The reason for the non-payment in the case Hansen tackled , is that the man had had his policy switched to Sovereign about six months before his death . <p> Ordinarily , there would be no fight over that , but in this case the insurer from which the man 's insurance policy was switched was also Sovereign . <p> This was what is known as an " internal " transfer and it can happen when someone with insurance agrees to let either their bank , or an insurance broker , switch their policy , though the most common types of transfer are from one insurer to another . <p> There can be many reasons for such changes , but switching , or " churn " , is often said to be driven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who can convince people to switch as by any client demand . <p> In the case Hansen is involved with , the man 's policy had originally been written by the ASB and was switched by an insurance broker , Hansen says . <p> The Sunday Star-Times has not been able to verify the details of the case , and Sovereign will not discuss them , but the giant insurer did issue a statement on its internal transfer policy , and it does seem to show that such situations are possible where there are changes in cover level . <p> " It is Sovereign 's default position to waive the suicide exclusion if the policy being replaced is an internal replacement , is over 13 months old , is like-for-like , and the sum insured is the same or less .

@@78233 <p> The clampdown against internet piracy is about to pick up pace with the Copyright Tribunal set to release its second " Skynet " ruling in the next few days . <p> Recording Industry Association of New Zealand ( Rianz ) boss Chris Caddick knows he 'll already be a hate figure for the nation 's computer geeks after the association secured a $616 award against the first woman caught under the new online piracy law last week . <p> The second ruling was reached on Tuesday and will be made public after all parties have been informed of the outcome , a Justice Ministry spokesman said . <p> " It is a carrot and stick situation and yes , we are clearly wielding the stick , " says Caddick . " But balanced by that , we 've been incredibly proactive in dangling the carrot . " <p> He claims Rianz had a hand in persuading Swedish music streaming service Spotify to launch here last May , hot on the heels of United States rival Rdio . <p> Spotify 's service , free if you tolerate advertisements and up to $13 a month if you do n't , offers unlimited access to several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 19 different legal streaming and download services available in New Zealand - from the familiar iTunes to internet radio stations such as Pandora . But the difference with Spotify is it appears capable of rejuvenating falling revenues in the music industry . <p> In Sweden and Norway , where the service first launched , sales have rocketed , bucking a global downturn . In the year to June 2012 , music sales rose 30 per cent in Sweden - almost entirely due to Spotify . <p> Admittedly , some artists have withdrawn from the service or complained about its revenues . Black Keys drummer Patrick Karney said last year , when his band removed its songs , that " I always pay for music " . <p> But Caddick says Rianz ' members have reported " really gutsy increases " in royalties every month since it launched in New Zealand . " It is still quite tiny in relation to the potential , but there is virtually no reason why every household could n't have one of these services . " <p> While CD sales still represent over half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decline has hit physical record stores . Closure is planned for Marbeck 's flagship Auckland store and last week the British giant HMV went into receivership . <p> Spotify and rivals like Rdio could conceivably see the death of the actual music collection you can touch . iTunes , launched in 2006 , was initially a slow-burner , says Caddick , and Spotify and its ilk , which offer unlimited plays of a song but not actual ownership of a copy is " another conceptual leap " . <p> The Swedish figures excite Caddick because in the last decade , music sales profits here have halved , following a worldwide pattern . Sure , the ability to buy single tracks , not albums , and the reduction in CD prices has contributed , but that can not explain it all , says Caddick , who spent 20 years as an executive with the EMI label . <p> Figures for 2012 will show a " fractional " upturn for the first time in 10 years , he says . " It 's a little green shoot of recovery . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for acquiring music and a resolute approach to piracy . <p> Last week 's " prosecution " of a woman for sharing three songs was the first of eight in front of the Copyright Tribunal and there are another 20 cases in the pipeline . Caddick says Rianz expects to take 150 pirates to the tribunal a year . It has cost it $250,000 already , including the salary of a fulltime staffer , but he says the fight is necessary for the industry to survive and Rianz is ready to pump in the same amount again this year . <p> That $250,000 includes a $25 fee paid to internet service providers each time they send a warning letter to offenders . Offenders are sent three such infringement notices , with time to respond , before any cases can be taken to the tribunal . <p> Of nearly 6000 notices sent , fewer than 100 have been challenged , Caddick says . " So our conclusion is most people know perfectly well they have been doing it . " <p> Although the file sharing law was designed to tackle the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movie-industry counterpart , the NZ Federation Against Copyright Theft , has so far decided against making use of the regime because of the $25 price it must pay internet providers to send out infringement notices on its behalf . <p> Its chief executive , Tony Eaton said the fee was " unworkable . . . to the point where the legislation may ultimately prove to be completely ineffective " . <p> Caddick says the convoluted nature of the process means it 's inevitable Rianz is catching recidivists . " And if people insist on doing it , we need to act to draw the attention to the fact it is illegal . I think we have every right to say ' hey , it is not acceptable to pirate and deliberately deny artists , songwriters and everyone else investing in music the right to earn money from their work ' . We wo n't back away from that . " <p> TAKING PENALTIES <p> An ambiguity in the Copyright Tribunal 's first " Skynet " judgment means it is not clear whether the penalties it will hand down for illegally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the thousands . <p> Recording Industry Association ( Rianz ) chief executive Chris Caddick said the tribunal had struck a good balance issuing a $616.57 award against a Telecom customer for illegal file sharing last month and the sum might set a " broad precedent for future cases " . <p> Rianz unnerved internet advocates last year when it asked the tribunal to make an award of $2669 against a Wellington student whose internet account was allegedly used to download and share five songs . It later asked for an even larger sum , $4675 , from another alleged pirate it accused of illegally sharing 11 songs , before dropping both cases on technicalities . <p> Controversially , Rianz asked the tribunal to order compensation for the possible " knock on " losses its members may have incurred as a result of people downloading songs from the computers of Skynet-accused . Rianz estimates that once someone has downloaded a song using file-sharing software , it will typically be uploaded from their computer by 90 others . <p> In last month 's landmark ruling , the Copyright Tribunal rejected that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it awarded Rianz only $6.57 in direct compensation for the illegal sharing of two tracks , one of which was downloaded twice . The majority of the award comprised a $120 " deterrent " for each of the three infringements and the reimbursement of $250 in fees that Rianz had had to pay to bring the case to the tribunal . <p> Auckland lawyer Rick Shera said it was not clear whether the tribunal intended setting a precedent of a $120 per track , or whether the deterrent was in respect of each of the infringement notices the woman received under the three-strikes regime . <p> That was a potentially important distinction for pirates accused of illegally sharing large numbers of songs . A Ministry of Justice spokesman said the tribunal would not help interpret the decision . <p> Either way , by dealing with the knock-on effects of file-sharing by way of a deterrent rather than compensation , the tribunal had given itself huge discretion over the level of awards , Shera said . <p> " Often , both courts and tribunals are a bit more lenient with people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

@@111239 <p> The persistently high exchange rate has caused much griping and belly-aching from a segment of exporters and manufacturers . <p> The kiwi is currently the strongest it has ever been against the British pound , and not far off all-time highs against the greenback . <p> But whether that 's ' good ' or ' bad ' is a largely matter of perspective . It 's a bit like the weather . A long , dry summer might be ruinous for farmers , but it 's lovely for holiday-makers . <p> For kiwi consumers , there 's plenty of sunshine forecast ahead as the high dollar boosts our purchasing power ever higher . <p> The most obvious advantage is being able to buy imported stuff cheaper in the stores . <p> But why not cut out the middleman ? <p> Online shopping on foreign websites is an increasingly popular pastime , made increasingly attractive by the generous exchange rate . <p> We 're still a bit slow on the uptake . A PwC/ Frost &amp; Sullivan report last year found that overseas shopping accounted for only 35 per cent of Kiwi 's online expenditure , less than half that of Australia . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . NZ Post reports the number of international parcels coming into the country jumped 13 per cent between 2009/10 and 2010/11 . <p> The latest figures are n't available yet , but the continued ascent of the kiwi will no doubt only increase the flow . <p> We came up with a sample shopping list of hot items to see how much we could save on Levi 's jeans , Nike sneakers , the 50 Shades of Gray boxed set of books , the iPhone 5 , and Elizabeth Arden perfume . <p> While we scored massive bargains on some items , on others buying locally was sometimes the better option . <p> TAPPING BIGGER MARKETS <p> The first item on the list is Levi 's 501 jeans . At an Auckland Jeans West store , a pair of the classic denim pants retail for the hefty sum of $130 . <p> On Amazon the same jeans are on sale for anywhere between US$36 and US$55 , many of which are heavily discounted . <p> At the current exchange rate , even the upper end is about NZ$65 , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wins this round . <p> But what about postage ? <p> Many websites frustratingly refuse to ship outside the country they 're based in , and others charge like wounded bulls for doing so . <p> To send a pair of Levi 's home would cost as little as $20-$30 depending on how they were packaged . <p> The mail-forwarding scene is expanding at the moment , and competition has already helped drive prices down substantially . <p> The real kicker with YouShop and Prezoom is that their warehouses are strategically situated in the few US states which do n't charge sales tax - which means you pay roughly 10 per cent less than many American consumers . <p> NASTY SURPRISES <p> Many an unwary shopper has shopped up a storm on an overseas website , only to be confronted by a whopping tax bill from Customs as their package comes over the border . <p> The Levi 's were cheap enough to pass through without attracting any attention , because Customs does n't bother charging duty or GST when the total charges would be less than $60 . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your order will slide under the threshold , but it 's not always straightforward . <p> The rule of thumb is generally that imports less than $400 will escape taxes . But that changes with certain categories - like shoes- which are subject to a 5 per cent duty charge . <p> Let 's look at buying a pair of Nike 2013 Air Max sneakers . On the New Zealand high street , the latest pair of kicks will set you back $259 , so that 's what we 're aiming to beat . <p> Amazon stocks the sneakers for US$175 ( NZ$209 ) , and postage for the bulky shoes works out to about another $40 . <p> Already , it 's a borderline saving . But then Customs will slap on duty of $21 , GST of $41 , and a flat import transaction fee of $38 . <p> The total bill comes to $349 - far more than it would cost to buy the shoes locally . <p> But wait - it gets worse . <p> If you used Prezoom to send the shoes rather than Amazon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charge on top of all the Customs fees for failing to slip under the threshold . <p> The funny thing about Customs charges is they 're an all-or-nothing proposition . <p> The same Nikes are on sale for 110 pounds in the UK ( NZ$198 ) . Because they 're a little cheaper , and the postage is cheaper , they just slip under the threshold , and therefore attract no extra fees . <p> Theoretically the UK pair will save you $40 , or 15 per cent . <p> But it 's a very close call - and it 's Customs who determine the final value . In this situation , it 's almost certainly better to play it safe and buy locally . <p> FREE SHIPPING , LOW PRICES <p> One of the items on the list was the raunchy 50 Shades of Grey trilogy of female ' literature ' - bought for a friend of course . <p> Books and DVDs not only are n't subject to duty fees , they 're often vastly cheaper to buy online than in physical bookshops . <p> Whitcoulls is charging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $78 . <p> Meanwhile , the UK-based Bookdepository has the same item on sale for $22.85 pounds , or NZ$41.21- with free delivery . <p> Amazon has it even cheaper at 10.99 pounds , which with shipping works out to roughly the same price . <p> That 's a saving of at least $22 , or 36 per cent off local prices . <p> SLIPPING ACROSS THE BORDER <p> We 're also hunting for a shiny new iPhone 5 . While the gadgets are $100-$150 cheaper in the US and UK , any savings would be wiped out by the aforementioned duty and GST . <p> However , Customs ' catch rate is somewhat hit-and-miss . You may even be offered a fake receipt with a lower purchase price by some retailers to get expensive goods through . <p> Do n't succumb to the temptation . Customs has beefed up its penalties recently , which include criminal prosecution , seizure of the imported goods and hefty fines . <p> Unless there are huge price disparities or you 're prepared to take a punt on getting it through , you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ITEMS <p> The last thing to tick off our shopping list was a bottle of Elizabeth Arden perfume . <p> We 'd just finished scouting out the best prices when we realised it was almost impossible to actually get the smelly stuff sent here . <p> Perfume contains alcohol , which makes it one of several goods that can be a pain to try and get delivered . <p> It comes down to the individual policies of the freight company involved- here are the exclusions for NZ Post , Prezoom , and DHL , for example .

@@116230 <p> Amid the bustling of holiday traffic , a layover , and no time for tea , I took a moment to speak with prominent talent , Yasemen Hussein . The London-based artist and creative all-star designs exceptional artworks that are both captivating to the fine art tenderfoot as well as any artistic mastermind . As I found a quiet space nestled in a corner of the airport , a few of Hussein 's designs came to mind : from the beautifully sculpted golden shield commissioned for Will.i.am ( right ) to the Marie Antoinette metal wig with antlers emitting from it called , Diana , exhibited at the Museum of London in 2010 , which she also categorizes as one of her proudest pieces . Hussein 's art has intrepid layers . Whether fine-tuned in an extravagant coiled headdress or in the sparkling of Swarovski Elements ( e.g. over 25,000 lavish crystals she used to create an outfit for Katy Perry 's American Idol performance of the single , ' E.T . ' below ) , Hussein 's pieces speak for themselves ! Outside the creative world , many people may not ponder in detail about the artist or designer behind such avant-garde @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even think it to be entirely the vision of a marketing team or performer themselves . Yet , however wonderful the end result is executed , it does start with an artist 's eye and most certainly one that can take on a mighty challenge transcending the intangible or conventional methods of design . Every designer has a process of development , perhaps a special moment when they are entirely in the zone of their body of work . For Hussein , an alumna from the Penland School of Crafts , getting in that zone means being fully open to experiment without limitations . ' I came from a strict working class Turkish -- Cypriot immigrant family where I was expected to live the norm of marriage and children . The UK gave me grounding and a true understanding of the importance of research and development . Living in the US gave me the time and experience to understand ... to do anything I wanted without creative boundaries , ' said Hussein . Clothing has the ability to create an image , displaying expressions of one 's mood or style @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outfit 's buoyancy ! Then , there are forms of wearable art that need no special introduction . It 's the one-of-a-kind bells and whistles : the statement pieces , timeless accessories , and other fashioning elements that fairly garner a worthy showcase all on their own . Hussein 's designs are just that ! With an eye for structure , an appetite for the bold and underlining ? sthetic of sculpture , her art merges the love of working with diverse materials such as metal , glass , and clay . She somehow transforms the initial vision into a forward-thinking wonderland . ' I secretly love the smell of metal when it 's been heated up to a cherry red and the sound it makes when I quench it in water , ' confessed Hussein . But , do n't place too much of a label on her artistic style , she 's a designer who is awe-inspired by a multitude of things . ' I do n't really think about it or guide myself towards something , I just do it . My style is what I gravitate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ designer . So , what advice would a celebrated and very down-to-earth designer give to aspiring artists ? ' You really do have to love what you do . There really is no winning formula , you have to create your own . Unfortunately it 's not always down to talent . I hate to say it , but a whole chunk is a business mind , patience , and timing , ' said Hussein . Needless to say , this was one layover with a chock-full of inspiration that I will not forget ! You may catch more of Hussein 's ( headwear ) pieces currently being showcased in the must-see Head On exhibition at Fashion Space Gallery in London .

@@116240 <p> It 's a familiar phrase said all too often in the tech era , where email gaffes happen every day . <p> Take for example the story of the British bride-to-be who was humiliated after the hotel where she planned to hold her wedding described her and her fiance in an email as not " the right type of people " to stay there . The wedding co-ordinator intended to send the email to a colleague . <p> Then there was the time Aviva , Britain 's second-biggest insurer by market value , mistakenly sent an email dismissing all its 1300 staff before retracting the message . It was intended for one . <p> The list goes on and on - and sometimes the gaffes end in tears , like when a Virgin Blue employee accidentally sent an email upgrading more than 1 million Velocity members to " gold " status , offering them free lounge memberships and upgrades . <p> The offer was withdrawn in a follow-up email , but not before many demanded a free upgrade . <p> You 've probably come close to sending an email to the wrong person yourself or including something in an email you thought you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there are ways to stop a silly mistake like this from happening ? Best of all , it does n't mean sneakily logging on to the person 's email you sent it to so that you can delete the email you sent ( which Gloria did ) . <p> Measure 1 - Use common sense <p> There are technical measures you can implement to prevent yourself from looking silly . But regardless of what technology is available , the first line of defence should always be you . <p> In all cases , you should read the " To " , " CC " and " BCC " fields before you send any email . You should also look at what you have attached and at the email 's body . Always proof-read it . <p> Measure 2 - Delay emails <p> Now that we 've got that out of the way , one of the technical ways to prevent email gaffes is by delaying emails from sending for a period . Though not foolproof , this helps prevent the occasional mistake made in an email and can help those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You can delay emails in Outlook , Gmail and other services too . In some cases emails can also be delayed for your entire organisation by your IT administrator . This might be something PR agencies and companies might consider , especially if they are often involved in sending emails to large distribution lists . <p> In Gmail , left click the cog wheel , " Settings " and then the " Labs " tab . Here , search for " Undo Send " and then enable it . Once enabled , Undo Send gives you a 10-second window in which you can undo a sent email . You can change that to five , 20 or 30 seconds by going into Settings and finding the Undo Send section . The same can be done in Outlook by setting up a rule that delays messages for the amount of time desired . <p> Measure 3 - Beg recipient 's IT department to delete email <p> If you know an email has been sent and you definitely do n't want the other person to read it , another way you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the IT department of the organisation you 've sent it to and plead for them to delete it . It 's very unlikely this will work if your email has been sent to an email address ending in gmail.com , yahoo.com , outlook.com or other major webmail providers , as they have policies against allowing this . But if you 've emailed an Australian company that manages its own email , for example , then it 's worth a shot . Depending on their IT policy - and how they feel about the situation - it might just work . But you 'll need to be quick , as the recipient may have already downloaded it from their workplace 's mail server . <p> Measure 4 - Recall the message <p> Some versions of Outlook allow you to recall messages sent to other email users who use Outlook . The success or failure of a message being recalled depends largely on a recipient 's settings in Outlook and also whether they actually want to let you recall it - a reason why this method is probably not the best to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ message will generally inform the recipient that the email exists and highlight the fact that you want to recall it . <p> Measure 5 - Admit defeat and apologise <p> If all of the aforementioned methods do not work - or you just do n't want to try them for whatever reason - then an apology might be in the works . The sooner you apologise the better .

@@130236 <h> An Idiot 's Guide to the Perfect Videogame <p> It 's like paint-by-numbers really . <p> There are some things in life that are perfect . A good mojito is pretty damn close ; the film Glengarry Glen Ross is about as close as it gets ( it 's one hour forty minutes long , has Jack Lemmon , Al Pacino , and Kevin Spacey , and in the second scene Alec Baldwin shows up and plays with his big brass balls . Do n't f*ck with me on this one . ) <p> But , and this is coming from someone who is perfectly happy to admit he never leaves his bedroom except to feed on the flesh of slaughtered cattle , I have yet to play the perfect videogame . Some have come close , straddling the line between excellence and perfection like filthy digital prostitutes ; probably named Candy or Peppermint or Ginger Crunch or some such thing . Sorry , I got sidetracked . Regroup in the next paragraph . <p> I decided to make it easier for writers and developers to make the perfect videogame , in these ten steps , not because ten is a nice round @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many it will take for me to reach my word limit . So shoot me . <h> Step number one : Moustaches <p> Give every male character a moustache . Moustaches make any lead character more heroic , and therefore more likeable and better tasting . In a recent replay of Final Fantasy VIII , the one thing that became apparent was that none of the playable characters was in fact the main character . The main character was the Jumbo Cactuar , an optional boss you can fight in order to obtain him as a summonable creature . <p> See ? Exactly . <p> Admittedly he appears for only a few minutes , and says nothing , but his luxurious moustache tells the real story . The whole game was simply a front in order for him to appear . Plus , the fight took place on Cactuar Island . The guy has a whole island named after him . Do you have an island named after you ? No . That 's because you are n't the protagonist . Jumbo Cactuar is . Moving on . <h> Step @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a winner . Not necessarily the same characters , or the same battle system . I 'm not even that fussed about whether or not you use balls to capture them , at a pinch . Just incorporate some sort of pet system where I can capture animals and train them to rip stuff apart and I 'm a happy man . <p> If you can somehow make them ultra-violent , with some sort of fatality-based kill system , I 'll buy the game immediately . Ideally , those monsters could perhaps be equipped with some sort of facial feature to distinguish themselves . A moustache is , perhaps , the ideal choice ; it 's either that or some sort of horrendous facial scarring . <p> Twice as cute , and at least 32% more effective <h> Step number three : Do n't make the enemies level with me <p> If I start out the game as a lowly barnacle on the testicles of society , I expect to end it as the Grand High Overlord of the Universe , capable of felling a T-Rex with a single @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their general direction . <p> I do n't want to spend hours levelling my character only to realise the T-Rex has scaled up with me making me just as useless as ever , if not slightly worse off because they were already a T-Rex to begin with and were therefore ahead of anything I could ever have to offer . Particularly when it comes to making the ladies jittery . Playing a game needs to yield rewards , which brings us to step four . <h> Step four : Let me build an empire/legacy/badass dungeon castle <p> Many Grand Theft Auto traditionalists struggled with GTA IV for a simple reason : you were hardly better off at the end of the game than you were at the start . You had a bit more cash and a few more guns , but when it all came down to it you were just some Eastern European guy . <p> OK , so , Agent 47 has little to do with GTA . He 's allowed in this section , however , thanks to that glorious face appendage . I mean , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Theft Auto : San Andreas , where you begin the game as some homie from the hood ( thankfully I have the street cred to pull these terms off ) , with no money , no weapons , no property and no social skills . By the end of the game you 're more veiny than Arnold Schwarzenegger 's penis ( poor taste ? Probably ) , own the vast majority of San Andreas , have your own airport , flamethrowers , and a jet pack . You also have like six girlfriends , not that I condone that sort of behaviour . In short , you are the absolute king . <p> Would we watch Breaking Bad if we thought Walter White was an average chemistry teacher ? Negative . Average is boring . Let me be the boss , and let me own stuff , because in real life I am a loser and I own nothing . <p> At this point you might think this list looks like something that would be compiled by a 13-year-old boy who has had too much orange fizzy drink and wants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like to apologise for that , but I ca n't because I have too much energy from all the fizzy drink . In any case , the fifth step to making a perfect videogame is violence . And lots of it . <p> Alright , enough with the pretense , and a spoiler alert : the rest of the pictures in this article are all videogame characters with moustaches . <p> I want blood , heaps of blood , a disgusting hybrid of Tarantino and Saw and that creepy dude who looks like what a shark would look like in human form from the Human Centipede . If I ca n't tear off somebody 's skin and stomp around in it like that dude from Silence of the Lambs , I 'm not interested . I could do it in Mortal Kombat , I should be able to do it in everything else too . If LittleBigPlanet had involved more skin-wearing , it would have been a much better game . The general rule is if there 's no intestines , it 's not finished yet . Trust me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doctor , I mean , I 'm not actually a doctor . I 'm a doctor in the sense that occasionally I doctor illegal documents to say that I 'm Portuguese when in fact I 'm Mexican . I mainly do this as a training exercise in case I ever get picked up by the Portuguese police for impersonating a Mexican . It 's complicated stuff , you probably would n't understand it . Only I can understand it , because I 'm a doctor. ** <p> **Please refer to * <h> Step six : Include a loot system <p> There 's a reason why people go mental for games like Diablo and Borderlands : good loot systems . Being able to blow someone 's face off and then take all their sh*t is like ghetto Christmas , and is both fun and educational . <p> Get the link here ? <p> In the horrible world in which we live , gifts are usually rare and often contain dead cats , faeces , and knives . In videogames , they often contain good things , like guns , money , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ games where every sucker you waste ( try to keep up with my street lingo ) provides you with better equipment . It makes every day Christmas . And Christmas is without a doubt the second best day of the year , losing out only to Pancake Tuesday . Pancake Tuesday is the greatest , because it contains pancakes . <h> Step seven : Do n't make zombies , vampires , orcs or goblins the main antagonists <p> Yeah , I 'm aware that all of these supernatural beings each have their own diverse and rich mythological and historical backgrounds . I understand there is a rich tapestry of tradition and fear to be drawn on , a pool of horror so deep it sucks at the very core of your soul like a really mean-spirited vacuum cleaner that 's having problems with its home life . I 'm aware of all of these things . I just really do n't care . <p> Make the enemy a nine-hundred foot penis , or a yak with the ability to see into the future , or a dwarf named Larry who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bad guy is just do n't make him a god-damn orc . We get it . Tolkien wrote about orcs and goblins , and they were cool in 2003 for about a week , but that 's over now . <p> Pac-Man is suddenly a bit-player , do n't ya think ? <p> The only redeeming feature about any of these creatures is the fact that Dracula , the ultimate vampire , had a gigantic moustache ( that is pretty much the only true sentence in this entire article ; Google that sh*t . He 's basically Lord Voldemort with a moustache , which is infinitely more badass . " Within , stood a tall old man , clean-shaven save for a long white moustache , and clad in black from head to foot , without a single speck of colour anywhere about him . " See that ? Education . You 're welcome . ) In fact , this rule can be ignored entirely if the zombie , vampire , orc or goblin in question has a moustache . <h> Step eight : We . Want . New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the best damn feature ever applied to a videogame in the history of ever . The first time I learned about new game plus was in Ratchet &amp; Clank , because I 'm still a fresh hatchling ( that 's why I 'm so membranous . ) I did n't know it was called new game plus ; I did n't care . What mattered was that I had finished the game and still had loads of stuff to unlock and money to collect and they gave me the whole story all over again to do it in . <p> It 's the ultimate gift a game developer can give : a game that dwindles away into nothing beneath the flames of time , only to be reborn , levelled up , and membranous like a freshly hatched phoenix . It essentially adds the ability to go back and find anything you 've missed , explore every opportunity , take every chance . It gives you complete control over how your characters live and what they do , and that 's about as far from real life as it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest in Sonic ? He does n't look like this . For real , I checked . I did n't actually check . <h> Step nine : Include a really , really good mini-game <p> The greatest mini-game of all time in a game is Blitzball from Final Fantasy X. I would re-purchase that game now just to play that mini-game . If you 've never played it , I pity you . I pity you the way Mr T used to pity fools : in a deep voice , and in the 80s . <p> Essentially , you played a Quidditch-esque game underwater , and you could recruit characters all the way through your travels and build up the perfect team . Finally , you would dominate the leagues , the Besaid Aurochs crushing opponents 13-0 , the best players swimming circles around opposing athletes like poised porpoises , like modish manatees , like the most stylish of sea-cows . Every player on your team would feature in the top goal scorer rankings , your keeper would never let a goal in ; you were invincible , unstoppable , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better . <p> I 'm tempted to change the title of this step to " include Blitzball " . <h> Step ten : Time travel is , and always will be , the only narrative feature worth including <p> Every story that includes time travel is , without fail , absolutely dynamite . Back to the Future has time travel in it , I 'm pretty sure , and I am almost entirely certain The Time Machine features that theme for at least part of the plot . <p> Point . Well . Made . <p> It 's nice to think that you 're playing a game , you get to the end and suddenly , BOOM , plot twist , YOU ARE YOUR OWN FATHER . NOBODY SAW IT COMING , OR UNDERSTANDS THE LOGISTICS OF IT , BUT THEN BAM , TWIST WITHIN A TWIST , your daughter is your own mother . Cue Japanese outro song a la Kingdom Hearts , and , as the saying I saw in a movie one time goes , that 's the trailer right there . To get your videogame into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ annals of history . <p> Ten steps , ladies and gents ( like there 's any women reading this . This is the website where sexuality comes to die ; if ever there is a cause for the extinction of the human race , it 'll be because of sites like this where procreation comes to die . Not bitter at all ) , is all it takes . <p> If you follow these to the letter , taking in all the addendums I could n't be bothered making , appendices I was too lazy to write , and extra bits I stapled on to the only copy I printed out and have n't attached to this document , you 'll have the perfect game . Without all those extra bits , you 'll probably just have a hideous , malformed abortion of a creation that is the digital equivalent of some vomit with a moustache on it .

I do enjoy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system and leveling system . D3 involves both these steps . It would have been better if the story was a lot longer though .

None of this , " We 'll take the idea of the old game , throw in some more features which make the game bad , then re-release it as the HD version .

It does not include collusion , investor fraud or financial statement fraud . <p> However , the survey , which canvassed about 140 New Zealand respondents , reveals more than 60 per cent of businesses estimated that only half , or less than half of fraud had been detected . <p> The average loss among organisations that had experienced at least one incident of fraud was $433,721 . <p> Christchurch was particularly at risk of fraud because there would be an influx of public and private money coming into the region for the rebuild , Bell said . <p> The amount of money flowing into the region was going to attract " a volume of potentially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anybody , " he said . <p> It was " inevitable " that fraud would occur . <p> In the United States , the FBI estimated fraud of about $6 billion during the recovery from Hurricane Katrina , about 10 per cent of total spending involved , Bell said . <p> If the same formula was applied to the Christchurch rebuild and its estimated $30b bill , there was potential for fraud of about $3b . <p> That was not to say it would reach those levels , but it was something regulatory authorities should be aware of . <p> However , Bell said he was encouraged by the fact the Serious Fraud Office and the Ministry of Justice were " front-footing " fraud prevention strategies in the region . <p> Whistleblower hotlines were not used in a significant way in New Zealand , Bell said , but international statistics proved that it reduced the amount of time it took to detect fraud , and reduced the value of the fraud itself . <p> New Zealand had a lower rate of tipoffs than other countries . <p> That was possibly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ internal fraud reporting processes or had no understanding of the reporting arrangements . <p> Bell said Canterbury might have potential for collusion around the rebuild and that would be difficult to detect if , for example , there was collusion among contractors , but he would like to think there would be enough competition between all the subcontractors that they would be out for themselves . <p> If there was collusion among a group of contractors detection might rely on a whistleblower . <p> " Someone outside that circle would be the first to blow the whistle . <p> " Introducing foreign competition . . . lots of players , in my opinion , will lessen the likelihood of New Zealand overpaying for the rebuild . " <p> Organisations should consider fraud awareness training . The detection method most used in New Zealand was a system of internal controls . <p> On average it took 201 days to detect internal fraud , and 206 to detect external fraud . <p> In cases of fraud perpetrated by management and senior executives it took on average 514 days and 545 days to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monitor for the agencies involved in the rebuild , to monitor the procurement processes , was another way to reduce the risk of fraud . <p> " Even the most senior employees should have controls around their job functions , " he said . <p> Bell said " red flags " for organisations to look out for included if someone appeared to be living beyond their means ; if someone never took holiday time and was very controlling at work , if they were very demanding and intolerant of staff , very jumpy and unable to relax around others or intolerant of questions or objective views . <p> In May last year then Serious Fraud Office boss Adam Feeley hailed former DataSouth chief executive Hayley Bryan as an " unsung hero " for her role as a whistleblower , revealing multimillion-dollar fraud by then DataSouth managing director Gavin Bennett . <p> Feeley said then that resolving cases without whistleblowers was " much more difficult " .

@@244240 <p> Some of Miranda Harcourt 's most stimulating acting has been inside prisons . Not as a jailbird herself but as a performer to inmates in London , Australia and across New Zealand . <p> A year-long stint at London 's Central School of Speech and Drama in 1990 led to an exploration of drama therapy in psychiatric institutions , with the deaf , and in prisons - the latter inspiring her collaboration with writer William Brandt for the solo play Verbatim , where Harcourt acted as inmates ' families and as the families of victims . Performed in front of people convicted of violent crimes , Harcourt says Verbatim " was a reflection back at the people on the inside ; what their mothers , their sisters and their children had said about them " . <p> The show received rave reviews , not just from Harcourt 's performances in New Zealand theatres and at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival , but from the inmates themselves .

" <p> The episodes were filmed on location near a Waimauku pine forest and Harcourt got to " flit about wearing high heels and glamorous clothes in a beautiful glamorous house with a white grand piano " . <p> Some viewers may remember Harcourt from a turn in Shortland Street 12 years ago as nurse Beanie 's mother . Harcourt says she got back into the groove quickly . " I do n't think Shortland Street changes . It 's been going for 25 years so it 's got a really great house style about it .

@@247230 <h> Persona 4 : Arena <p> On:PlayStation 3 <p> Persona 4 : Arena is an interesting beast . Technically a fighting game , it springs from the loins of an RPG franchise - a lineage it wears proudly , to interesting effect . At the core , you go head-to-head with another character and must use your abilities skillfully in order to beat them ; much like Street Fighter , perhaps , or BlazBlue for that matter . The reference to BlazBlue was a deliberate one ; Persona 4 Arena ( P4A ) , you see , is developed by the creators of that very game , giving it instant credence amongst fans of digital pugilism . <p> The characters on the roster are drawn largely from that of the PlayStation 2 game , Persona 4 ( and its recently reviewed PlayStation Vita re-release , Persona 4 Golden . ) While you do n't need to be familiar with that game to enjoy the plot of P4A , it certainly helps ; the story is a fantastical one and will likely take some time to get your head around if you 're not already well versed in the universe . <p> That narrative is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ( lengthy ! ) pre-match cutscenes . Each character you choose will then reveal their version of events ; as you go , you unlock more characters , whose stories overlap and expand on those you 've already discovered . <p> It 's a neat system , although this naturally means there 's some repetition ; a factor that irks somewhat largely because of the extreme length of time some of the story sequences can take to play out . Some of them , in fact , take around half an hour ( all the while , you 're repeatedly pressing buttons to advance it ) between each fight . A four-fight campaign , then , can take upwards of 90 minutes to play through . If you like Persona 4 's story and presentation , you 'll like this too ( it 's very much along the same sorts of lines ) , but there will definitely be some who could care less . <p> Fortunately , story mode 's hardly required , and if you do want to play through it without reading all that text , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resumption should your attention wander . There are loads of other modes to attract your attention , including the game 's typical - but welcome - online mode . <p> Persona 4 Arena made headlines last year when it was revealed to be the first ( and , given the late stage of the PS3 's lifecycle , likely only ) game to be region-locked on the system . This news was swiftly followed by a delay outside of the US , making fans of the franchise even more furious than they already were . When the game releases on May 9th , it will be some nine months since it hit consoles state-side , fragmenting an already niche online audience . <p> As it stands , it 's difficult to review the game 's online modes , as what few players are currently available ( before its local release ) are likely a long way away from us , so the rather laggy experience is difficult to blame on anything other than the speed of light ( something even Arc System Works , a great developer , can do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our coverage of the game post-release with our thoughts on the online mode ; until that time , this review refers exclusively to offline components of the game . <p> While the game is set in the Inaba region of Persona 4 , and uses that game 's " world inside a TV " setting as its backdrop too , P4A also includes characters from Persona 3 . We wo n't ruin the narrative ( as it 's either unimportant to fighting game fans , or critical to fans of the franchise ) , but we will say that fans are unlikely to be disappointed . About the only aspect of this side of the game that does frustrate is that the character 's inner monologues are typed out over the background images , rather than in deliberately created text boxes . The visual effect of this is invariably confusing ; making out text that 's presented over random background images is hard work and especially frustrating when compared with the title 's otherwise flawless ( and exciting ) presentation . <p> Spoken words appear in the black text box @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ text is printed directly over whatever image is currently being displayed ( the bit above the text box in this example ) <p> The fighting mechanics are fun to explore , fusing ( much like the RPGs ) a combination of character and persona-based attacks into a fluid and varied set of gameplay options . A classic 2D fighter , you ( depending on your character ) have a range of different attacks at your disposal , each with its own strengths and weaknesses . While a lot of this is familiar , P4A brings enough new tricks to the fighting game table to warrant its existence as a fighting game alone , over and above the fan service it delivers to enthusiast followers of the franchise itself . <p> One of those tricks is , of course , the Persona attacks . In Persona , if you 're not familiar with it , you can summon special creatures called , well , Personas . This is no less true of P4A ; here , once you 've earned enough power ( like a super bar in another bar , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forth your persona to execute special abilities . <p> Another new arrow in P4A 's quiver is the inclusion of status effects ; special attacks can leave your opponent inhibited or afflicted with a damage-over-time infirmity that will shift the balance and require that they adapt to the new conditions . It 's a fun , if ( generally ) minor , twist on the classic formula . <p> There 's also a crazy-powerful super move called an Instant Kill that does exactly what you think it does , however it 's not as overpowered as it might first sound . Experienced P4A players will have plenty of time to counter it , should someone attempt to use it against them , and you wo n't have enough meter ( called SP Gauge here ) to pull it off often . Rather than a race to execute the Instant Kill move , then , it 's probably best suited as a move by which a pro player can quickly dismiss a noob they might encounter , or as a way of embarrassing someone should you manage to pull it off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't full-screen by default ( at least , it 's not on PS3 - the version tested . ) Instead , it occupies the inner 85% or so , with black borders above , below , and to the sides of the action ( even in menus , cutscenes , etc ) , framing it in like some sort of overscan compensation . There are controls to adjust it , but they 're not your typical " stretch it out " type as you find in many other games . Here , it 's like the game does n't match the aspect ratio of the TV , and no matter how you fiddle it , it feels like the end result is a compromise of some sort . <p> All that aside , though , P4A does something unique ; it somehow manages to create a game that is both true to its ( non fighting game ) roots and yet also a very well executed fighting game in its own right . The characters all feel distinct from one another , and the simple control option ( where just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would n't normally wander into this sort of arena have a fighting chance , without stopping the hardcore from enjoying themselves too . <p> The story is both true to P4A and of value on its own , even if there 's a lot of reading required to get through it all , and the chance to spend time with the investigation team again is greatly appreciated - even though Persona 4 itself was a very long game ! <p> If you like fighting games , Persona , or - better yet - both , you 'll be well served by Persona 4 Arena . It 's familiar yet unique , and has enough stuff that 's all its own to warrant its existence . Based on the game 's reception and sales overseas , chances are good there will be more to come ; jump in now , even if it 's a year after the States , so you 're ready when the next game hits - hopefully at the same time here as it is over there . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @

' ' <p> Bambaataa met DJ Kool Herc , and together they started hosting legendary block parties which brought together artists , dancers , DJs and MCs with others in the community . <p> ' ' Bambaataa was known as Master of Records , ' ' says Sen. ' ' He had the reputation of having the deepest crates , the most music , and you would not expect what he played , and it would make you move in a way , and party in a way you had never partied before . <p> ' ' It was the beginning of hip hop culture , and Zulu Nation members were at the epicentre of it . <p> ' ' I 'd probably be dead if it was n't for getting straight into hip hop culture , and making a culture out of it , and bringing a lot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bambaataa told a journalist in 2008 . <p> ' ' Cos I never had a problem in pooling a large army or crowd .

' ' <p> Some of Bambaataa 's teachings can seem a little out there , but as Sen says , even if you do n't adhere to all his beliefs , he is at least a man who has never stopped thinking critically and for that he should be admired . <p> Zulu Nation chapters throughout the world have different means of trying to bring about peace and unity , with many focusing on charity work such as food and clothing drives . <p> But for Aotearoa Zulus , hip hop is how they connect to others . <p> ' ' I think hip hop culture is our best tool , because all of us are really good at it , ' ' says Sara , a youth worker by trade . <p> Young people are a big focus for the Chapter . <p> In her job at Wellington City Mission , Sara uses hip hop day to day to teach basic life skills such as respect , communication , commitment and a love of knowledge . <p> They are also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get graffiti art up on walls which , ironically , deters tagging . <p> There is an emphasis on learning from each other , and the group have organised respected hip hop names such as Mr Wiggles ( Rock Steady Crew ) to come out to New Zealand for performances and workshops as well as regularly organising local gigs . <p> Being a part of something , connecting with others , is a big driver for many in the hip hop community . <p> Rhyming , dancing , making art , geeking out about the newest piece hip hop knowledge you have dug out - all of it is better done with others . <p> ' ' To me , as part of a Samoan family , it is not any different .

' ' <p> MORE THAN ONE BATTLE <p> While both Sara and Sen are certain of hip hop 's value to their own lives and community , confronting the public 's perceptions of it is a constant struggle . <p> ' ' There 's two battles - one is to promote the culture , and the other is to refute what 's seen by the mainstream as hip hop culture , ' ' says Sen. <p> The blunt-smoking , bling-dripping gang bangers and booty-shaking women are stereotypes despised by many in the hip hop community - images perpetuated by a profit-driven music industry , says Sara . <p> ' ' It 's intentional , because it continues a certain type of industry - someone gets paid for these stereotypes to be out there . <p> ' ' It 's not us though .

@@247237 <h> New Zealand : Body corporates navigate earthquake insurance issues <p> You ca n't pick your neighbours . You may not even like them . But when you own a property in a unit title development ( as opposed to a fee simple or cross-lease title ) , you and your neighbours are covered by the same insurance policy . <p> Unit title developments are n't necessarily limited to large apartment complexes . Smaller blocks of flats and small to medium commercial developments are often unit title developments , especially where a number of individual properties share common facilities such as driveways . <p> With a unit title development , the Body Corporate takes out insurance for all of the units . Where any unit or common property has sustained earthquake damage , it is the Body Corporate that lodges the claim with EQC and their private insurer , and deals with the inspections , completion and costings of scopes of repair work . And ultimately the Body Corporate will make any decisions about repair or rebuild of the damaged property . <p> Body Corporates are funny things . They are created by statute and , as an owner of a unit title property @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well as any rules that the Body Corporate has passed which are particular to that development . Each unit in the unit title development is a member of the Body Corporate . At Body Corporate meetings , each unit is represented by an owner so that all owners collectively make decisions . When there are 10 or more units , the Body Corporate must establish a committee to look after the daily running of the development on the behalf of all owners . <p> Body Corporates facing significant earthquake issues and decisions on the fate of the development need to ensure all owners are actively involved in the process and understand the outcome . <p> One of the biggest issues facing Body Corporates is the lack of insurance cover . It has become quite apparent that unit title developments are heavily under insured and Body Corporates are scrambling to figure out how to apportion the insurance cover that is available among units and how to deal with contribution of any shortfall by the unit owners . If the Body Corporate resolves to rebuild ( even without the agreement of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to force owners to pay any shortfall . <p> Another issue is how damage is assessed from unit to unit . Earthquake damage inspections of units vary from development to development and it may be that not every unit is scrutinised . Inspectors may look at a few units , scope the damage and take the average cost of repairing the damage and apply it to all units . It is then for the Body Corporate to decide whether that is appropriate given the nature of the development and the damage sustained . <p> Serious decisions are required by the Body Corporate if the damage is deemed to be uneconomic to repair , and all owners need to agree on the way forward . <p> The first question is whether owners want to repair or rebuild . If there is a shortfall in the insurance payout , all owners must contribute to the shortfall . Such agreement is difficult . Owners tend to want their money out rather than put more in . <p> When a cash settlement is on offer from the private insurer there are still a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easy , but it 's not . The amount needs to be approved by the owners . Once approved , the funds come into the Body Corporate and then the biggest hurdle is agreeing on how those funds will be paid to the unit owners . There are no set rules here ? it is simply what the owners agree to do . <p> A related issue is that damage may vary quite widely from unit to unit and some owners may dispute how the insurance proceeds are allocated . This can also become an issue when the unit title development is uneconomic to repair , because the distribution of the insurance proceeds is likely to be in proportion to each unit owner 's ownership interest ( based on the relative value of the units before the earthquake ) than the extent of the earthquake damage to each unit . <p> But some unit owners may contest this , and the ownership interests of the unit title development can be reassessed after revaluing and may change . So , an owner could take their neighbour 's interest if their ownership @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go around . If your interest goes up , then one of your neighbour 's entitlements must go down . It follows then that those owners that lose entitlements have an interest in fighting back . <p> When it comes to allocating insurance money to unit owners there are no hard and fast rules . At the moment , various methods are being used by Body Corporates to allocate the funds out , and it can be based on ownership interest , market value , or it can be some other mechanism whereby all parties have agreed . <p> If you find yourself in this position , where the Body Corporate is proposing resolutions as to the allocation of such funds , make sure you are aware of your rights if you are disadvantaged in the decisions being made by the Body Corporate . If the Body Corporate choses to vote on resolutions to allocate funds that not all unit owners agree on then there are minority rights that unit owners may look to pursue . <p> To get a result , all owners must ultimately work together and agree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so that all owners on board . The last thing you want is for some owners effectively " holding out " - which results in everyone suffering . <p> Once an insurance settlement is distributed , the owners still have to work together on further decisions . Even once a unit title development is demolished , the title to the land is still based on the physical boundaries of the former units . So unless the units are being rebuilt exactly as they were , the owners must agree either to the cancellation of the unit plan or the completion of a new redevelopment plan ( as well as agreeing on any changes to the newly redevelopmed units ) . If the unit plan is to be cancelled , will the land be marketed and sold ? If so , by who ? What is an appropriate price to sell at ? Should the Body Corporate obtain a valuation ? All of these decisions require the input of unit owners . The Body Corporate needs to be confident that all owners will sign a sale agreement if and when presented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ owners signing could jeopardise the offer . <p> The issues are many and varied . If you own a unit title property , and the Body Corporate is currently completing insurance negotiations , seek legal advice so that you understand your position . <p> Similarly , if you are buying a unit title property , ask your lawyer to complete a thorough due diligence on the current situation with the EQC or insurance claim as well as the inner workings of the Body Corporate . Assess your risk , as well as your neighbours , before buying . <h> Panel <p> Issues with earthquake-damaged unit title properties : <p> Under-insured unit title developments <p> Contributions from owners for any shortfall in insurance <p> Agreement on the basis for inspection and scoping of damage to different units <p> Apportionment of insurance monies among units with differing degrees of damage <p> Securing owners ' agreement to a cash settlement or reinstatement when a unit title development is so badly damaged as to be uneconomic to repair <p> Apportionment of cash settlements amount units on the basis of ownership interest <p> Reaching agreement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the site where the original units have been demolished <p> Due diligence needs to be completed if you are buying a unit title property that has been damaged <p> The content of this article is intended to provide a general guide to the subject matter .

@@349236 <p> The model proposed by the Greens and Labour of a single electricity buyer with price discrimination has been likened to Pharmac . <p> OPINION : The only feature the two have in common is that both face some trouble in getting supplies and investment in New Zealand . In the case of Pharmac , there are benefits to be balanced against these effects . <p> Pharmac funds pharmacological drugs on a list it approves for New Zealand . Drugs not on the list that have health and safety approval can still be used , but they are not funded by the public health system . <p> Drugs not on the list may not be routinely provided . This limits the ready availability of some , often new , less-proven drugs . Put simply , Pharmac is not a single buyer in New Zealand or on a world stage . <p> New Zealand 's consumption of drugs is negligible on a world scale . That means price reductions achieved by Phamac do not affect drug-company profitability or investment in research and development of pharmaceutical drugs in general . <p> In contrast , a single buyer in electricity will be a monopoly buyer in an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buyer may also have to be given regulatory powers to make operational decisions for suppliers . <p> For example , there may be alternative uses for water that are more profitable than producing electricity at the single-buyer price , meaning regulation would be needed to require generating firms to use water for power generation . <p> While Pharmac can reasonably ignore industry investment , the proposed single-buyer could not do so . Investment requires that costs be covered with some allowance for risk . <p> The proposal threatens this in two ways . It would take away profit made by an established company at the going electricity price , and redistribute it among households . <p> If a company 's new plant was successful , it may soon have some profit scooped off by single-buyer actions . As investors know this will happen , potential generation plants would likely not be established . <p> There are at present renewable-energy generation plants that have the necessary resource consents for construction : Why would they be built in the shadow of this proposal ? <p> A second reason is that the wholesale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be restructured with no definable purpose . <p> The proposal entails reducing the price paid for electricity from particular sources of generation and lowering the price of electricity to households . <p> The reduced price reduces returns to private owners . The government , which owns power companies , will lose dividend revenue and receive less tax revenue from the privately held electricity firms because their dividends are lower . <p> Assuming the lost Crown revenue is to be replaced by increased taxation , the proposal has embedded in it a tax/ subsidy scheme where taxation sources household electricity consumption subsidies . Such a scheme for electricity could be implemented directly without restructuring the electricity market . <p> In targeting the " market " in " electricity market " the proposal would produce an unstable commercial environment . <p> These are not matters a single-buyer or regulation could fix . Assurances or rules about what prices are to be set for different sorts of generation and for new or potential generators could only be assessed by investors against the purpose and action of the single-buyer , price-discrimination policy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ established , particularly hydro with high capital and low running costs , should have an amount of its operating profit removed . <p> The tax/subsidy , and the investment effects of the proposal combine to suggest increased regulation and centralised control that would go well beyond the model that is Pharmac . <p> It is tempting to draw comparisons with health and education where the state does buy services . However , in these , labour rather than capital determines cost . <p> Capital and date of establishment are less of a factor in costs and profitability and so there would be less opportunity for the price manipulation of the proposal . <p> In the 1990s , there was a health provider-buyer policy for public health . The buyer contracted for services from providers . It was abandoned in 2000 by the Labour government of the day . <p> The investment and price effects of the single buyer for electricity suggest that a better comparison would be the New Zealand Electricity Department of the 1960s and 1970s . <p> In that era taxpayers paid , and politicians made pricing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ associated planning and control of electricity produced some poor investment decisions and meant that the price of electricity was not its cost .

This is a fact across , at least , the Western world , and has been established again and again . Many men , of course , buck that trend and many women will be careless or negligent with their wellbeing . <p> But the overall conclusion can not be disputed . One recent British study found nearly twice as many men as women had not visited their GP in the previous year . <p> Men are also much less likely to go to the dentist , ask a pharmacist for advice or attend contraceptive clinics .

From an early age , procrastination is more common in boys , as is risk taking . <p> They are more likely to avoid unpleasant issues and just hope problems will go away . <p> Men might be infamous for their predilection to pathetic responses - a la ' ' man flu ' ' - and might , in reality , not be able to be as well equipped to cope with emotional and physical strains . But , in their own minds , many think they should be able to take big hits , shrug off adversity and play the warrior . <p> A trusted celebrity like Sir John Kirwan can make it all right to admit to health issues , in his case depression , and to seek help . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Samuel Jackson last week urged men to be more open about their health problems in an attempt to tackle cancer . <p> He is fronting a new British charity called One For The Boys . <p> Angelina Jolie , meanwhile , has had a big impact on women 's health with her decision to go public about her double mastectomy . <p> The number of women ringing the breast cancer helpline in New Zealand has tripled and in New South Wales increased 900% . <p> The Men 's Health Trust New Zealand is a charity here which ' ' desperately wants to change the way men think about their health and encourage them to proactively visit their doctors and take responsibility for living healthy lives ' ' . It claims eight men die each day from preventable disease . <p> Perhaps men are more easily embarrassed or shy than women about personal matters , and more fearful of what the results might be .

@@478231 <h> Interesting passage for passangers <p> The process of circumventing the slip that occurred on the railway line near Puketeraki though fraught with considerable annoyance and inconvenience to passengers by yesterday 's trains had also a humorous aspect - though this would probably fail to appeal to many of those who were directly concerned in the operation . <p> Only one train left Dunedin in the morning - the 11.15a.m. express , which made a belated departure at 12 o'clock owing to the non-arrival of the first express from the south until shortly before that hour . <p> Passengers and mails were at once transferred to the Dunedin train from the latter , and it was a lengthy procession of carriages that left the station on a long and wearisome journey to Christchurch . <p> The rate of progress was very slow , as a stop was necessary at every station , and the constant traveller , who is accustomed to regularity in his train services , felt aggrieved at the slow advance , and was frequently heard to air his grievance . <p> Matters , however , progressed fairly satisfactorily until the train had got about a mile beyond the Puketeraki Railway Station @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which had come down on the line . <p> At this point there is a fairly high cutting , and one side of this , representing about half of a small hill , has slipped forward on to the line . <p> Close on 1000 tons of earth must have been deposited at the foot of the cutting at one period , but a large gang of men was quickly at work effecting a clearance , and these were kept strenuously employed throughout the day . <p> When the train arrived at this point the order was given : ' ' Transfer to the train on the other side of the slip and take all your baggage with you . ' ' <p> Acting upon this instruction , the passengers , of whom there was an unusually large number , got out on to the side of the track and commenced to collect their thoughts and their possessions . <p> Soon the short journey over the top of the cutting commenced , and it was evident that the Railway Department 's intimation that only ' ' light luggage ' ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well-known southern member of Parliament struggled along over the somewhat muddy track with a small portmanteau in each hand , an umbrella under his arm , and his hat pulled grimly down over his eyes . <p> A little further back a group of old Maori women , heavily laden with sugar-bags of Bluff oysters , presented a somewhat amusing sight . <p> The shellfish proved a heavy burden , but the Natives volubly encouraged each other in their own language , and struggled bravely on . <p> In the general body of the procession came many well-known business men carrying travelling bags , rugs , and umbrellas , a number of ladies encumbered with the usual varied assortment of parcels , while in front went the High School football team , which made short work of the journey . <p> The railway and postal officials had a busy time transferring the mails , and the task of carrying the large bags across the slip - a distance of some eight chains - proved one of considerable magnitude . <p> However , everything was accomplished as expeditiously as possible , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the northern side had commenced its journey , some three hours behind schedule time . <p> A similar experience also befell the passengers on the first express from the north , but those on the second were more fortunate , and got through from Christchurch without a break . <p> This train arrived in Dunedin some 20 minutes behind time , but the delay was merely caused by the general dislocation of traffic . - ODT , 27.8.1913.

@@599231 <p> Wellington-based actress Michelle Ang took another step towards Hollywood stardom recently , with a guest spot on an episode of Grey 's Anatomy airing in New Zealand on Monday night . <p> How did the opportunity to appear on Grey 's come about ? What sort of audition process did you have to go through ? <p> My agent got me an audition for the guest-star role of " Cherise " . I went to the pre-read session and read the scene for the casting director and assistant . They gave me a call back and a few days later I went back and did the same scene but this time the director for the episode was in the room ; which happened to be Kevin McKidd . A producer was also in the room , too . <p> It was a pretty emotional audition scene , but I nailed it and the director gave some adjustments which I took onboard . I found out I got the role about four days after that . I remember my agent calling me while I was buying macaroons with my best friend who was visiting from London . She tricked me , saying she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " , before laughing and telling me the news . <p> Tell me a little bit about your character . <p> Cherise has been a dutiful magician 's assistant and swallowed a lot of resentment about how her boss conducts his business . She does n't appreciate his ego and how he mistreats his wife , the other assistant , and that all comes to a head when a trick goes horribly awry . <p> How long did you spend on set ? <p> I spent two days shooting . And one additional day prior for fittings . <p> Did you get many opportunities to interact with the core cast ? <p> The scenes where I was involved with main cast were often hectic . They were high medical drama . I was lucky enough to be in scenes with Meredith Grey ( Ellen Pompeo ) , Callie Torres ( Sara Ramirez ) , Richard Webber ( James Pickens Jr ) and briefly McDreamy ( Patrick Shepherd ) . <p> The cast and crew are a very well-oiled machine and when we were blocking ( rehearsing ) or being directed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the technical setup work was being done by the crew , all the actors were relaxed on their chairs and then there was the opportunity to chat . Although , I think I got a bit starstruck ; I was a bit shy . <p> How did Grey 's differ from other shows you 've appeared on ? <p> I guess it was daunting because it was my first American guest role . And stepping in on such a big- name production was humbling , as was working alongside people I never thought I 'd have the chance to share the screen with . But , actually , it was just like a regular film set . <p> Eeryone is so settled in their own specific line of work . The actual biggest difference was the fact they still shoot on film - I believe only one of three shows in America that still do . That put on a lot of pressure because that is an expensive medium . You ca n't be asking for too many takes to nail your scene . <p> As an interesting aside , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the national system in London . She was amazed at how the set was stocked with all the authentic and best brands of gauzes and bandages . <p> How did you enjoy coming home for your appearance on Top of the Lake ? <p> I loved it . And was super-excited about the opportunity to work with Jane Campion , learn a new accent and play a challenging character . <p> Is working in New Zealand something you 'd like to do more of ? <p> Absolutely . <p> How tough is it for young " foreign " actresses to get regular jobs in America ? How do you make yourself stand out from the crowd ? Is television where you think the best opportunities are ? <p> I think the idea of getting a regular job when you are an actor has always been tough . The casting process is becoming more and more international , with technology aiding that . But it also means there are a lot of people being seen for that one role . I do n't consciously try and stand out from the crowd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the character you want to portray and trusting that that take will be your own , original interpretation .

I still feel very connected to the physical expression of music . It would be so cool to have reached a level where I may have been able to perform in New York when I was living there , although I suspect I would n't have kept to traditional ballet .

@@599232 <p> Close on the heels of HP CEO Meg Whitman 's financial update earlier this month , Steve Dietch , VP , worldwide cloud , enterprise group at HP , who was on a whirlwind trip of the ANZ region , and Keith Watson , MD of HP NZ , spoke to Computerworld NZ on the company 's role in the delivery of the ' new style of IT ' and the transformation of its go-to-market strategy . <p> Steve Dietch , VP , worldwide cloud , enterprise group at HP <p> Q : What are the reasons for your current visit to New Zealand ? <p> Steve Dietch ( SD ) : I am visiting both New Zealand and Australia . I have two roles at HP . One is as the VP of worldwide cloud and the second one is focusing on the transformation of our go-to-market for cloud . I have come down to meet customers here ; we had a successful CIO event yesterday . And to meet with the local teams . I do that very often . <p> This is my first trip to New Zealand in several years . I visit Australia couple of times a year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> New Zealand is a forward-thinking country . Customers are thinking about the new style of IT and the next-generation moves , so I want to be down here . We want to understand what our customers are saying and doing , and share with them my global insights . I would like to know what they are doing as well . We can learn from that . <p> Keith Watson ( KW ) : Steve has been our keynote speaker at our executive forums where we get a group of CIOs and COOs together , typically on a six-monthly basis . We have different keynote speakers and they fly down for these events . <p> Q : Can you speak a bit more about the transformation of HP 's go-to-market for the cloud ? <p> SD : I ca n't share any details right now . As you have heard from Meg Whitman , we are in a five-year transformation right now . We have just completed year two . We had our analyst meeting last week where we announced a whole bunch of progress that we are making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through a set of transformations as an organisation and broad corporation . And one part of that is how do we engage customers in a more efficient way to help them in their journey to the new style of IT . That 's not just cloud , that 's big data , that 's mobility , that 's security . <p> I happen to be focused on the cloud and what I am working on is a complete transformation of how we engage our customers in an efficient and unified way from a HP perspective . <p> Whatever they are doing on this journey to the new style of IT , the operative word is journey . Nothing happens overnight . <p> Q : This new style of IT -- how will it ' transform ' IT and will it be different for enterprises and SMBs ? <p> SD : In many cases , the objectives are the same , depending on the segments you are looking at -- whether it 's driving agility , flexibility or driving new business opportunities . You want to get to market faster to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public sector entity , to your constituencies . Or you want to lower cost . Generally everybody has the same broad sense of objectives . Hopefully people will remain focused in picking the right ones . <p> Whatever they are doing on this journey to the new style of IT , the operative word is journey . Nothing happens overnight , as much as we would like it otherwise . If you look at the cloud , this is going to be a journey over several years -- five to 10 years -- where people are all ultimately going to move to the same destination but they may do it in a different way , they may take a different path . <p> Q : What is the destination ? <p> SD : The destination is hybrid delivery . From HP 's point of view , every company mid-size and up will move to a hybrid delivery strategy . <p> Keith Watson MD of HP New Zealand <p> Q : How far along are companies on this journey ? <p> SD : We are very , very early . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tyres with hybrid . We are probably in chapter one of the book now ; we are just starting . There are a lot of CIOs and IT organisations that are still formulating strategies of how they move to a hybrid environment . That is the foundational element to better utilise big data , better utilise apps and more cloud services , better able to deliver to the mobile workforce . It is all intertwined , but I would say the next 10 years will be unbelievable -- unbelievable in terms of the transformation you will see in IT . <p> KW : I think Steve 's right . NZ is in chapter one . These are early days . What a lot of people have done is taken their traditional infrastructure and virtualized it . But not many have put what we would call the cloud OS and automation tools on top of the virtualization to get true cloud . We have made available NZ cloud services to our clients and to our channel partners as a service they can use via a portal . And we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they can use that . <p> We are rolling out phase one of NZ cloud services . We have got an anchor , a major client , as part of that . That 's gone reasonably well . We are still in the implementation phase . <p> The other area where we have had quite a bit of success in NZ is with Orion Health . They have essentially adopted the whole HP cloud stack . I mean the converged infrastructure , the virtualization layer , they are working with a hypervisor provider , and on top of that a HP cloud system . All of the automation stack on top of that , and they are running that from NZ . It is actually quite a good NZ story about centralised management of private clouds , since healthcare has such specific security and sovereignty needs associated with it . Most of the data needs to be in-country . <p> NZ cloud services will see an expansion of its set of services . But right now , predominantly it 's IaaS . You could buy bare metal , virtual machines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And you could add to that various sets of apps . The apps stack is dependent on the client at this point in time , but we will be running more generic apps stacks as we build the portfolio of solutions that we offer . <p> The relative percentage of traditional IT will go down but it will take years . It will take a long time . <p> Q : What is the role of the public cloud in hybrid delivery ? <p> SD : One thing that people are going to take into consideration is traditional IT -- it is not going away . Hybrid delivery is not just hybrid cloud it includes traditional IT . So you got private cloud , managed cloud , public cloud and traditional IT sides . A lot of people gloss over that , but as people move to the cloud a lot of workload and apps and services will never move off the traditional environment . All that -- the systems , tools , processes -- has to work together . A lot of people gloss over that when they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't have to worry about all that old stuff . " <p> The world will spend a couple of hundred billion dollars on cloud next year . They are still going to spend nearly $2 trillion on traditional IT . So that is important . That is where our value proposition comes into place where we span across all four of those pillars . <p> So if you actually think about why someone would want to move down a hybrid delivery strategy , it is pretty simple when you get down to basics . A traditional enterprise customer is dealing with 3000 apps to run their business . A typical NZ customer , mentioned yesterday -- about 1200 apps to run their business . IT budgets are probably flat . Pressure coming from business is enormous . How do I deliver more value ? How I do not only support the business but how do I shape it ? How do I do that in an optimal way ? Even if I did rationalisation I have got it down to just 1000 apps . <p> What a customer needs to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to look at that 1000 apps from a portfolio perspective and segment that into SLA blocks . There will be certain apps that will be very attuned to the characteristics of the public cloud -- not really core to the business , low cost , they want elasticity because the app is very unpredictable , they might be running a marketing campaign at the end of the quarter . <p> There will be a whole set of other apps that are very high performance , low latency , with privacy and data sovereignty issues that are never going to leave my data centre , but you know what , I want cloud features and functionality , shared access , self-service and so forth . That 's for the private cloud and there are others that will go into private , but I want it managed . <p> Taking that methodical approach and figuring out what apps can go onto the best suited or optimal deployment platform is what hybrid delivery is all about . Coming up with the optimal mix of using public , private , managed and traditional - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's the way to better utilise your scarce IT resources and come up with a strategy where you can better address the SLAs of your customers and business partners . <p> Q : How do you see the role of traditional IT changing in 10 years ' time ? <p> SD : Unless you are a teenage CIO now , traditional IT is going to be important for a long , long time . How traditional IT percentage will look in 10 years ? I would n't even fathom a guess . <p> The IDCs and Gartners state that overall IT spend is growing in the small single digits globally . But if you look at cloud , private cloud is going to grow 30 or 40 per cent next year . Public cloud will grow faster than that but you are growing from such a small base . <p> The relative percentage of traditional IT will go down but it will take years . It will take a long time . <p> Q : Knowing what they want to do with apps and segmenting delivery is a tall order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to overcome on the way ? <p> SD : If you asked CIOs or IT leaders , they would say that is what we need to do . But most companies , from my experience in meeting customers all around the world , they have a hard time figuring out where to start . It is a huge task . <p> First it involves assessing how many apps you have . A lot of people do n't know what they have . So it starts with assessing and getting a good idea of your baseline apps . Then doing an assessment of what needs to be re-architected , what needs to be re-hosted , what needs to be rewritten and what 's going to stay forever because it is just cost prohibitive or technologically just a ' triple flip with a half somersault ' for moving it off a traditional environment . <p> Then you move methodically down with your segmentation and figure out with our strategy near or long term what buckets of apps you are going to focus on first . <p> What I told you is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . From app assessments to the transformation aspect to the actual deployment on the different pillars of our strategy across public , private and managed . <p> Q : How do you ensure that your partners remain trained with all that is going on ? <p> SD : Partner training happens on a constant basis . HP will deal only with small percentage of customers directly and the larger ones at that . Our thousands of VARs , our relationships with SIs , our distribution partners are all critical to the cloud roll out . <p> We have two fundamental programmes in place that support the partner community . <p> One is called Cloud Builder , version 2 of which will go live in November . That programme is solely focused on VARs , SIs other partners that want to help build customers a cloud environment -- private , managed , public with services that go around it . We provide certification and incentives to make them want to do that on HP technology . <p> The other programme is for service providers . We call that Cloud Agile . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ providers that are providing IT as a service that build their foundation on HP technology , and we are working with them on joint sales and marketing , and around new solutions and education training . <p> KW : We have appointed one service provider so far in NZ to work with us on Cloud Agile . But we have hosted three service provider forums and we expect to have version 2 of the Cloud Agile programme out in the early part of the new year . <p> Assessment services can be included within NZ Cloud Services as well . There is a whole set of work that we do -- really from a discovery workshop , to apps assessment , to app transformation and migration onto the cloud services . <p> NZ Cloud Services , which was launched around six months back , is part of our ongoing discussions with service providers in the country . They have their own infrastructure , and , on many occasions , it 's HP infrastructure . But we also back them up with white label services as well . So they can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and also share apps , that type of thing . There is quite a bit of work going into how best we can support those service providers . <p> You will see streamlining of the pursuit processes , to reduce overlap and redundancies . That does not mean elimination of roles . I will tell you 100% that it has nothing to do with the elimination of roles . That has clarity of roles , of what people are doing . <p> Q : What apps would you advice companies to hold in their traditional environments and which ones should they shift to other delivery models ? <p> SD : It is an involved conversation . We have a framework that we use with customers , and it starts with what they are trying to accomplish , and how IT and the business are aligned . <p> Second is looking at what constraints or considerations they need to look at in their business . So are they in a highly regulated environment , like BFSI and healthcare ? Or are they in a low regulated environment , like high tech @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relates to what can and ca n't move . <p> You also look at the complexity of their data , and their tools and infrastructure . Can you break it apart ? Can you move things ? Are you breaking processes ? And if you move something out to the cloud can you take it back ? <p> Then there is the size of the business , legacy assets , the skills and maturity of the internal organisation to actually move existing stuff off or not . All these have to factor in . The thing you couple it with is : Are you looking at existing workloads or new ones ? <p> You factor that all into the conversation in a very structured way and you get your answer of what you want to move . <p> The conversation is very different if I am talking to the CIO of a bank on Wall Street than when I am talking to a Proctor &amp; Gamble . The conversation is very different . <p> Q : When is your transformation of go-to-market elements likely to happen ? <p> SD : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ourselves . We are a large , complex , Fortune 10 company , and anything you do takes time with methodical thinking . It is not a discrete set of actions . We are constantly looking at efficiencies and improvements in our go to market . We are not going to stop . This is just one of many endeavours that we have in play . <p> You will see streamlining of the pursuit processes , to reduce overlap and redundancies . That does not mean elimination of roles . I will tell you 100 per cent that it has nothing to do with the elimination of roles . That has clarity of roles , of what people are doing . Because if you look at any company , there are essentially different roles and responsibilities in the go-to-market pursuit processes ; everything from managing the account which is a more generic , generalised sales function , to more specialisation . How does that work in concert and harmony , so you do n't have a fragmentation in front of the customer ? I can tell you that we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ KW : In NZ , we do n't have the degree of fragmentation that Steve is talking about . But we have moved to put a single focal point or person that leads our discussions with our clients and can be a resource . It is pretty much running a virtual team so that they can talk to each of those converged cloud models around traditional IT , private cloud , managed cloud and public cloud . A lot of our clients want to know the economics behind that . How do I make the choices ? What are the trade-offs ? There is a focal point now here in the company that can have those kind of conversations . That will be effective from 1 November . <p> Q : What do you think will be the next big disruptive technology ? <p> SD : I do n't know . I am not the guy at HP thinking about the next big disruptive technology . My focus right now is driving the cloud business , the hybrid delivery business . HP is absolutely the market leader in this . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am not thinking about other disruptive technologies , because what you are looking at from a cloud perspective is going to be massively disruptive for established companies . We are levelling the playing field for mid-level companies by giving those folks access to data analytics tools that would be impossible in the past . I think you are going to see such innovation develop over the next five to ten years from people and come out of the blue that we have never seen in the past . That is where you are going to see the disruption - around business models , new ideas and processes that are enabled by this new style of IT . <p> Whether there is a new iPad or new i-something , I will leave that to super geniuses that are thinking about it right now . We have a job to do at HP and we are focused on it right now . We are one of the few companies that have a pure research lab left -- IBM and us .

The third crewmember , Andrew ' Dog ' Palfrey is a tad younger , and like the rest of us , had to watch it all unfold on TV . This year 's title takes Bertrand 's personal tally to seven ( and also one World Championship ) in the class he fell in love with nearly twenty years ago . Talking of World Championships , this very crew are known to have a wee penchant for the 2014 title , which is to be staged in none other than Newport R.I. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The man himself commented , ' Of the five Doggy and I have sailed together , we now have four titles and a second place .

Catching up with him in the first light of day he commented , ' At 0530hrs there is plenty to see . What a great location ! This may well be the most under-utilised location we 've ever seen for a World Championship . All you need to do is manage the time of year and the tides and away you go .

Mark had Nik Burfoot and Rafa Trujilo Villar on board . Rafa has not only represented Spain at the Olympics ( 2000 , 2004 and 2008 ) , he medalled , too , with a Silver in the Finn at Athens .

Winning this fantastic prize for 2013-14 is Jeanne-Claude Strong and the crew of Yandoo XX , which consists of Nev Whittey , Marcus Burke and Tiana Whittey . Strong said of the win , ' Bit of a surprise and rather nice . We 've been a Doyles boat to date .

@@652235 <p> For a generation of Australians , there remains only one true Doctor Who : actor Tom Baker , who played the fourth , and most popular , incarnation of the time-traveller between 1974 and 1981 . On the eve of the show 's 50th anniversary , Michael Idato met him in London <p> Doctor Who has , in five decades , seen off almost 800 episodes and no less than 11 actors in the lead role . It 's even in the Guinness Book of Records as the longest-running science fiction program . What do you make of all of that ? <p> I do n't watch Doctor Who . And I did n't watch it when I was in it . I did n't want to watch Doctor Who , I wanted to be Doctor Who , and I wanted to promote it , like any self-seeking , keen , inadequate ; I wanted to get out there . I was n't acting in Doctor Who ; I have always felt myself to be a kind of benevolent alien , who is quite willing to buy the drinks and hopes to get the laughs at the bar . <p> Before I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done some films , but I got very fed up being told what to do . That 's what actors have to do , a lot of people end up being told what to do . I did n't like being told what to do . And when I got to Doctor Who there were no standards , I did n't need to do it like Jon Pertwee , and I suddenly found everybody liked the sort of nonsense I was talking and I have n't stopped talking nonsense since . <p> You left school at the age of 15 to become a monk , and according to reports you were a monk for six years before you decided to become an actor . Was that a dramatic transition ? <p> My religious background - rampant , bigoted Catholicism in Liverpool - prepared me for Doctor Who because we were very strong Christians and you may have noticed there is something slightly shifty about them . I think it must be when you 're a Christian you have no privacy . He 's there all the time , watching you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watching you , so this makes life a bit tough in the bathroom , wondering why does n't he leave me alone ? It 's like trying to learn to play the violin under the bedclothes , you ca n't do it . <p> So believing all this utter nonsense , being brought up with all this bigotry , when I got to Doctor Who , and I realised he could disappear and reappear somewhere else , or that he had this sonic screwdriver to change things , that was all absolutely easy for me . It 's been easy ever since , because I have traded on it ever since , because no one would ever give me credit . And even years later when I played Macbeth , I played it like Doctor Who , and people said to me , I had no idea Macbeth was such a nice man , but I did it because it would have meant disappointing the audience . I am not interested in actors who are so wonderful that you do n't recognise them . I do n't see the point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a movie I want to know who the star is , or who the funny man is , or who the beautiful girl is , so I can respond . <p> You were in Doctor Who between 1974 and 1981 , perhaps the most successful years of the original Doctor Who series . The image of your Doctor , " all teeth and curls " , became iconic , particularly in Australia where the ABC screened the show five nights a week for many years . Was it difficult finding work after Doctor Who ? <p> It was n't difficult to find work because I was in big demand for voice-overs or to speak at colleges , and I was being invited everywhere , being flown first class to other countries . And also it means I had to get up early in the morning because so many people were wanting to applaud me , and go , hurrah , you 're marvellous . I 'd always wanted to be liked , and then I realised what I really wanted was to be adored . <p> When you become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the video recorder changed everything , that real-time watching and discussing the next day , required us to co-hear , as a population , otherwise you were out of the loop the next day . And so I had to get up early in the morning and go out basking in all this and shocked viewers would just shake their heads and say , it must be marvellous , and I would say , it is . <p> Although there was a brief interregnum in the 1990s , the show has essentially been in production since 1963 . And even while new episodes were not being made , the show 's fans never extinguished their torch . <p> Why do you think the show lasted so long ? <p> I do n't quite know but there 's nothing quite like it , is there ? And the early audiences seem to be so loyal , that they passed it on . I am still introduced to small children by their fathers and grandfathers now . <p> The BBC has confirmed that a new Doctor , the 12th Doctor , actor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christmas special . As a former Doctor , what is your feeling on that ? <p> I know him , I have acted with him when I was Sherlock Holmes many years ago , and I think people will think he 'll do it like The Thick of It character Malcolm Tucker and Malcolm Tucker is a one-note brute . He 's marvellous at it , and it was wonderful in the stage production of Arsenic and Old Lace , he has a big range and he will give it a lot of authority and mischief . <p> Do you think when an actor is being considered for the role of the Doctor , some actors are more right for the role than others ? Capaldi certainly " feels " right . <p> I do n't think anybody knows . It 's like Shakespeare , when they 're doing Richard II and they say we want someone noble with a fine voice and that does n't make sense to me because kings are just like the rest of humanity , some of them are wankers and some are not , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stands up straight , kings were n't like that , were they ? Capaldi will come with such a wave of fascination , they will want him to be good , and he will be good . And nobody has ever failed . A pause . I find that chastening , by the way . <p> There was for a time persistent speculation that there could be a female Doctor Who ? Do you think a woman could take on the role ? <p> Well , I do n't have any convictions about that , I do n't have many convictions anyway . I think it would have been quite nice to have a woman . I think it would have been quite nice to have a man dressed as a woman . I have always wanted to play Lady Bracknell from The Importance of Being Earnest myself . Or someone who was very , very obviously gay might break it up . And I do n't necessarily see why he has to stay long . If the audience do n't like it , kill him off . He does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too long . <p> The image of each Doctor has become somewhat iconic - Patrick Troughton 's fur coat , Jon Pertwee 's velvet smoking jacket , and in your case the hat and scarf . What do you think about the enduring power of that image ? <p> My costume evolved by accident , and wardrobe supervisor Jim Acheson , who won an Oscar . Acheson has actually won three , The Last Emperor ( 1987 ) , Dangerous Liaisons ( 1988 ) and Restoration ( 1995 ) . Now it all gets a bit precious , does n't it ? Following me , Peter Davison was dressed in some kind of Edwardian cricket gear and then Colin Baker was dressed in that funny way . The scarf was an accident . Jim Acheson bought a load of wool on the taxpayer and went to a woman called Begonia Pope and said , knit me a scarf in these colours . We went round to her little house and we could n't get in because she 'd knitted this scarf which was all over the place because of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Acheson said let 's keep it that way .

As someone who is uncertain and probably quite close to death , I think the silly things in life amuse me : children , grandchildren , animals , even wives , if they stay . I think about the silly things in real life . <p> You 've been on the set of the show twice for " regeneration " scenes , where an actor hands over to the new one : the episode where Jon Pertwee 's Doctor turned into you , and the episode where your Doctor turned into Peter Davison 's . Are those scenes difficult to shoot ? <p> Jon Pertwee did n't really speak to me - he did his scene , they locked off the camera and then he went away and I came in for that shot . The same with Peter , he just came in for that last shot , I really did n't meet him then for a year or two .

I love it . I love the fans . They 're not so young now , my fans , but I do enjoy it - recording for Big Finish the UK production company that produces a line of Doctor Who audio dramas or the BBC asking me to do signing sessions with the other actors .

@@652237 <h> If the shoe fits then thankfully it 's not gout <h> THE RILKOFF FILES <p> MATT RILKOFF <p> Last updated 07:55 16/11/2013 <h> Relevant offers <p> The gout is back . I blame Google . Two years ago when my big toes first began to ache I punched my symptoms into the online search engine . I typed " sore big toes " . Within seconds it was confirmed I had gout . It went away after a while . But now it is back . <p> In 2011 , I thought I knew quite a bit about gout and I believed I only sort-of fit its painful mould . It was my understanding you got gout from eating too many shellfish , devouring too many Bernaise sauce-slathered steaks , from quaffing bottle after bottle of red wine and setting off to bed with two litres of ice cream and bottle of chocolate sauce . <p> It was , I believed , the painful disease of the rich and grotesquely dieted man and suffering from it put me in the company of such notorious dickheads as Henry VIII and Dick Cheney . I was absolutely incensed . <p> But mostly embarrassed , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get such a debilitating affliction . That I did confirmed unwelcome suspicions that perhaps the lifestyle I was leading was a touch hedonistic , at least in a culinary sense . <p> This confirmation was no big deal in isolation but it was the final and most damning piece of evidence in the case against my life continuing as it was . I would have to do something drastic . I would have to change . Which I did . <p> It was only small pathetic things anyway . I started leaving the car in the driveway and walking more . I ate less red meat and more fish , opted for white wine instead of red , made a few more salads and once or twice even went jogging . Unfortunately this did nothing for my gout . It actually got worse so that I could hardly sleep at night . Even the weight of the sheets on my toes was too much to bear . <p> Then something happened that would only reveal itself as my saviour some six months after the fact . The thing that happened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bunch of horse races . <p> I do n't know much about horses or racing , owing to the fact I am completely disinterested in both equine matters and losing money by trying to pick which animal will run the fastest . Yet somehow , I 've managed to live a decent life anyway . However , eight months ago , that lack of knowledge also meant I was n't aware an invitation to attend the race day was also a compulsory order to wear at least a semi-formal pair of trousers , a decent shirt and a tie . When I turned up at the pre-race barbecue 360km from home and without any of these things , there was nothing else to do but to head to the Salvation Army store and gussy myself up . <p> It was while there looking through racks of dead men 's clothes and failing to avoid eye contact with the other shoppers that I spotted the yellow sneakers . They were n't just yellow , they were monstrously yellow , the sort of yellow that could blind a man . And they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inner sole and one pair of laces . But they were just $5 . I could n't resist . A few minutes later they were mine , along with some trousers that were a touch too short , a shirt a smidgen too tight and a pair of black leather shoes so ugly I could only assume they had been designed by a chimp . <p> A couple of months after that I was back home and had cause to bring out the yellow shoes from the bottom of the wardrobe where I had thrown them in March . I needed them because I had left my usual sneakers at work and the yellow distress beacons were my only option . After cannibalising an old pair of work boots for an inner sole and a lace they were good to go and I stepped into them to walk to work . <p> It may have looked like I was wearing a pair of flash lights on my feet but I had this to say for them ; they were outrageously comfortable . <p> They wore and walked so well they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was thrilled , and what 's more my gout disappeared within days . I was a completely new , though slightly ridiculous looking , man . <p> Then , on Monday , I was forced to resurrect my old sneakers , a pair of totally impractical American canvas plimsoles I had bought two years before because I thought they looked cool , even though I should have known better . By the end of the day the gout was back with a vengeance and in bed that night I finally put two and two together . It was the shoes ! <p> I will tell you this , it was an epiphany that brought immediate and lasting joy . It meant I could have my old life back . I went to Google again . I typed " Bernaise sauce " . 
@@652238 <h> The Sunday Morning Gamer : Puzzle Edition <p> This week , SMG takes on a bunch of mysteries all without the aid of a van , a dog , or thinly veiled drug references . <p> Back in the late 80s and early 90s , point and click games were the thing ; LucasArts especially were pumping out some classics . With the rise of game consoles and immersive PC gaming , the cartoonish point and clicks all but disappeared . Now , with tablets and phones , gamers are getting back to fundamental gameplay ( i.e. clicking on things and hoping like heck that it works . ) <p> This is an award winning game and for good reason . Like Device 6 , which I mentioned last week , The Room is a game built around a strange story that requires logical thought and practical movement in order to solve a puzzle box . <p> The Room does suffer slightly from the curse of having to do the same thing twice ( thanks to the tablet not registering the correct motion ) but - in general - I found this game to be perfect . Not only in the amount it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - compared to the amount of challenge it gave me . There is nothing better than finding hidden switches based simply on the fact that , logically , " there should be a switch there " . <p> The developers are also promising The Room 2 very soon , which I will also be buying . <p> Both of these games are made by G5 , who specialise in point and click puzzle games . I will admit to being a little skeptical of them at first , thanks to their uninspiring graphics and hackneyed storylines . Why would a newlywed bride , whose husband has just been kidnapped in front of her , stop to pick up a statue or miniature wine glass ? <p> But , once you get past that , the actual puzzles are quite cool . <p> You spend a lot of time randomly tapping various things on the screen , hoping they 're interactive ( " maybe if I click this bush there 'll be something in it " ) but once you you get the objects it becomes very clear what the next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a handy hint function that recharges slowly ( so you ca n't rely on using it continuously . ) <p> You start in the 1970s as a janitor ; not the usual beginning to a game Space Quest !

If there 's a giant pile of rubble in your way in the future , it wo n't be there in the past ; similarly , those annoying policemen of the 70s disappear in the future . This is how you solve puzzles . <p> Again , there 's a lot of tapping to discover items to help you solves puzzles , and the puzzles are pretty logical - although I will I admit that I did get stuck at one point and was very grumpy that my clearly logical solutions were n't working . <p> This game is pretty freakin ' cool . It 's been out a while now We first reviewed it in 2011 - Ed. , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beautiful low-res adventure . The puzzles are musical and very pretty . Some are easy to figure out , others take a lot of non-logical thought . <p> The narrative , led by a mysterious narrator in a suit , is well written and modern , despite the medieval setting . There is a basic fight mechanic but the real reason you 'll play this game is for the music and the setting . The simple landscapes and bad guys that stay just out of sight are amazing . <p> I did get stuck a lot in this game , and that was annoying , but it was easily overcome by the lovely music and adorable characters . You get a dog for goodness sake and you get to read his dreams !
