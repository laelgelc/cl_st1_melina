@@1874233 <h> Maidan and Armenian political perspectives <h> Maidan and Armenian political perspectives <p> Armenia has gone from negotiating an Association Agreement with the EU to expressing a desire to join the Customs Union of Belarus , Kazakhstan and Russia ; a decision that threatens to fundamentally undermine the country 's reform prospects , particularly following recent developments in Ukraine . <p> " Those who think there will be another Maidan in Armenia may have such a Maidan in their own backyard " , stated Galust Sahakyan , leader of the governing Republican Faction of the Armenian National Assembly , suggesting Armenian opposition parties should not be too excited about events taking place elsewhere . In order to understand how Ukrainian developments are viewed in Armenia , we first need to understand the political situation of a country that shared over seventy years of Soviet history , but which has currently chosen a different political path to Ukraine . <p> Not so long ago when negotiating an Association Agreement with the EU , Yerevan officials used to speak from high platforms about their commitment to signing the Agreement at any cost . The enthusiasm and convincing speeches of the Armenian authorities suddenly disappeared on September @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ president Serzh Sargsyan suddenly announced Armenia 's " overwhelming desire " to join the Customs Union of Belarus , Kazakhstan and Russia . Nobody in Armenia could understand precisely whose wish Sargsyan expressed during the meeting , since neither political nor public discussions had been held in Armenia on the subject . <p> Whilst people searched for an answer , the authorities immediately put their " independent and impartial " media into action to help people understand the situation better and orientate themselves " easily " . For days and nights the media kept reminding people about the advantages of having a powerful strategic partner in the region , about Russia 's role and importance in resisting military aggression from Azerbaijan and Turkey , and about Armenia 's happy and " fat " years in the Soviet Union . These beautiful images were occasionally followed by scenes of citizens on Maidan expressing their dissatisfaction with the Ukrainian authorities . <p> The footage , mainly made up from scenes broadcast by Russian channels , exclusively showed clashes between activists and ' Berkut ' troops , and the daunting number of police @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on TV were followed by interviews with analysts , political scientists and politicians who were diligently trying to prove that Armenia is not Ukraine , and that we Armenians can not allow bloodshed in our country , a country that has already seen so many tragedies . <p> As events in Ukraine unfolded , Russia increased its activities in Armenia , aimed to promote the interests of its " brother-country " in more and more visible ways . Russia reduced by 30% the price of natural gas for Armenia ( a prices difference that is not , however , passed on to the consumer ) . According to the authorities , the gas price has been constantly changing since 2011 ; however , consumer prices in Armenia have been $180 per 1000 m3 over this period . As a result , a debt of $300m accumulated over two years ; half of which Russia promised to pay , whereas the other half is supposed to be paid by Armenia . During negotiations on the issue , the Armenian government sold the remaining 20% of shares in gas company HayRusGazard to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gas deal concerned not only the gas price , but also stated that : <p> The Armenian party guarantees that until December 31 , 2043 , the rights and interests of Gazprom OJSC , HayRusgazard CJSC and their respective successors arising out of or in connection with the Agreement are not subject to change , amendment , withdrawal or reduction without Russia 's consent as of the date of signing the agreement . <p> The Armenian party guarantees that until December 31 , 2043 no laws , decisions , decrees or other legal acts will be changed , cancelled or in any way violate the legal rights and interests of Gazprom OJSC , HayRusgazard CJSC and their respective successors as of the date of signing the agreement . <p> In reality , the gas deal conceals a different kind of agreement between Armenia and Russia : up to December 2043 , Russia ensures unrestricted falsified elections and impunity towards such exercises . That is to say , Russia ensures that it will not allow changes of power in Armenia until December 2043 , as this would contradict Russian interests . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own interests , Putin 's regime protects the position and interests of Armenia 's ruling elite . <p> At the Forum of Russian Compatriots in Yerevan , Russian ambassador to Armenia Ivan Volinkin announced that Russia will halt any attempts at " aggressive intervention of other countries in the domestic affairs of its friendly states in an effort to instill ideas alien to our mind and soul " . In other words , Moscow simply declares its rights to intervene in Armenia 's internal affairs , or announces that any coup attempts in Armenia " initiated " or supported by a third country will be crushed by Russia . <h> Crimea <p> The reaction from the majority of Armenian citizens to developments in the Autonomous Region of Crimea is of particular interest . The announcement of a referendum on Crimea 's status aroused strong feelings of empathy among Armenians towards the ethnic Russian population of the autonomous region . It was clear that the phrase " right to self-determination " , formulated by the Russians and repeated by the Armenian propaganda machine , could not leave people in Armenia indifferent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or question the importance and predominance of the principle of self-determination . Since the Armenian viewpoint on the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict is that the Armenians in Nagorno-Karabakh also have the right to self-determination , immediately Crimea was referred to as a " Russian Karabakh " . The stream of articles produced about illegal and violent activities by extremists and Bandera-adepts against the Russian population in Crimea stirred more and more compassion among Armenians towards a people who , as most would see it , were now " sharing the bitter fate of the Armenians " . <p> During the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe ( PACE ) plenary session on Crimea , the Armenian delegation voted against the resolution that called for sanctions against Russia . " If the point is that territorial integrity should prevail while the right to self-determination will rely only on the consent of the central authorities , then , in this case , regardless of whether our relations with Russia are friendly or not , our position is clear and it is in our national and state interests " , commented David Harutyunyan , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ society groups in Armenia that considered Russia 's actions towards Crimea as annexation that should not go unpunished were once more labelled traitors and secret agents prepared by the West , trying to undermine the foundation of the Armenian state with their actions . <h> Russia 's role in Armenia <p> According to David Shahnazaryan , head of the " Concord " Center and former head of the National Security Ministry , the Armenian authorities , parliament ( with the exception of some MPs ) , analysts , certain civil groups , criminal elements and oligarchs all together make up a system that is fully-governed by the Kremlin , and this system is actually responsible for the current situation in Armenia , with little possibility for change . " The Armenian government is formed in Russia . Armenian foreign policy is shaped in Russia . The Republic 's security system is formed in Russia . This is accepted by everyone " , says Mr. Shahnazaryan . <p> Russia is always seen as a protector of Armenia . So , what do we gain from the Russian military presence that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of security , the gain may be more psychological than practical . Many think that the presence of Russian troops is a restrictive , preventive factor for Turkey or Azerbaijan . It may guarantee security from possible attack , since attacks on a Collective Security Treaty Organization 1 member would be viewed as an attack on Russia . For Russia , meanwhile , this is a warrant to restore its former dominant position in the South Caucasus . Thus , the kind of policy Russia is implementing towards Armenia ( for instance , when it continues to selling arms to Azerbaijan , or when it uses and will continue to use Armenia as a tool to destabilize the region when necessary ) , is almost not being discussed . <h> Economy <p> Today , many objects of great significance and strategic importance for Armenia are under Russian control : HayRusgazard , Electric Networks of Armenia , Hrazdan Thermal Power Plant , Metsamor Nuclear Power Plant , the Armenian Railways , telephone company Armente etc . It is important to understand that Russia has enormous leverage to influence both the internal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dependent on Russia . The relations between Russia and Armenia are similar to a " forced friendship " , with the potential to turn into a lord-vassal relationship at any moment ; and the characterization " strategic alliance " may lose its relevance at any time . After the Ukrainian events , it should be clear to everyone what the combined authorities of Putin and Sargsyan are capable of in case there is an attempt of a power change in Armenia . <p> Touching upon the current political discourse in Armenia , it must be noted that Maidan and the Ukrainian developments are presented as an anti-Russian processes initiated by Western countries . This is the sign of an old conflict between Russia ( the Soviet Union ) and the West , and this is the reason why the Armenian society is forced to view anyone with a different mentality as an enemy . Armenian society considers joining the Customs Union in order to join Russia 's efforts to resist Western pressure and aggression . Armenia is promised a number of benefits if it joins the Customs Union : solutions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Union countries ; upgraded roads and railways , and even economic stabilization of Nagorno Karabakh . <p> It seems that nobody in Armenia is able to critically analyze the situation and to ask very logical questions , such as how Russia will develop Armenia 's economy if all the Russian economy is based on its energy resources ? In fact Russia has few other industries except for the arms industry . There is hardly any other sphere that Russia can develop in Armenia , because all other spheres of great importance are already under Russian control . There has been no public discussion that would raise questions such as whether Armenia imports anything from Belarus or Kazakhstan , or what is the percentage of imports from Russia compared with imports from other countries ? It seems nobody really asks such questions . <h> Georgia <p> For some unknown reasons , many Armenians believe that Russia or integration in the Customs Union will take Armenia out of the blockade , and will open its roads and railways . It is unclear how Russia will do that if the closest neighbour of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affairs . Armenia and Russia do not have common borders , thus any communication will be interrelated with Armenia 's neighbouring countries . In addition , Georgia chose to join the Association Agreement with the EU , so very soon the custom policies and legislations will be incompatible . This fact creates even more obstacles and challenges for Armenia 's collaboration and cooperation with its closest neighbours . <p> How can Russia take Armenia out of the blockade if one of the reasons for such a blockade is Russia and its relations with Armenia 's neighbours ? Armenia 's railway to Russia is blocked because , besides going through Georgia , the railway passes through Abkhazia . With the issue over Abkhazia unsolved , the promise of railway development is unrealistic . It seems like a political mockery that a country involved in the Minsk group process as an independent mediator helping the Nagorno Karabakh conflict parties solve the issue in a peaceful way promises economic development for Nagorno Karabakh in case Armenia joins the Customs Union . <p> Armenians do not pay attention to the fact how the human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If one looks at any human rights-related report , it is clear that Russia and Belarus are in the lowest positions in terms of human rights protection , freedom of speech , freedom of religion , etc .

Unfortunately , the Armenian government and -- through propaganda -- now also Armenian society seems to be ready to pay with its sovereignty , freedom and democratic values for some promises of pseudo-economic development and security .

They reflect the express and implied boundaries and potential interpretations of chapters VI and VII of the UN Charter . <p> Chapter VI of the UN Charter talks about peacemaking as a non-restrictive list of peaceful , diplomatic , and judicial means of resolving disputes . Peacekeeping is situated before peace enforcement and before the sanctions regime as seen in chapter VII of the UN Charter .

Secondly , it includes improving respect for human rights through monitoring , education , and investigation of past and existing abuses , and providing technical assistance for democratic development like electoral assistance and support for free media , for example . Peacebuilding must include promoting conflict resolution and reconciliation techniques . <p> Peacebuilding is a quasi solidarity right that empowers popular action . The recent events in Ukraine is an example of popular action which comes as an applicability of this quasi-solidarity right .

These are the main causes of continuing violence in post-conflict societies , which have a very fragile democracy built into their governance system .

The deductive approaches to peacebuilding are driven by donor tools and capacities which tend to favour institutions over processes and ultimately will result in failed or mixed outcomes . The inductive approach is focused on conflict parameters and strategies that are being employed . Local capacity building means that local priorities are identified at all levels of society . It is centred on peacebuilding processes rather than building institutions .

@@1893236 <h> Breaking down barriers to peace between Israel and Palestine <p> Those living in an ongoing conflict such as that between Israel and Palestine build emotional and psychological forms of self-defence that underpin its continuation and the reasons why it can not be solved , thereby eliminating accountability for the conflict 's ongoing existence . Faced with this problem , it is necessary to resort to a psychological approach known as ' paradoxical thinking ' . <p> Our premise is that the Israeli and Palestinian people are both interested in peace , despite the real , fundamental issues of borders , refugees , Jerusalem , etc . There have been many attempts and large , even meaningful public endeavours aimed to offer a variety of " technical solutions " ( new ideas for division of areas , settlement exchange , etc. ) , but the public had rejected these attempts , while denying and repressing the harsh reality of the Palestinians . The public of both sides is now in great despair and the conclusion is that we must find new , innovative ways ; we must think outside of the box and come up with methods that have not yet been tried before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ research work and field trials , we have found a string of three links , which may help overcome the problem if understood correctly . <p> We have discovered that the main reason for the reluctance to achieve peace stems from psychological barriers , such as fear , hate , lack of trust in the other side , lack of accountability and more . <p> We have realized that the psychological problem must be addressed with psychological ways ; meaning if the problem is psychological , then the solution lies within the psychological realm . <p> We have developed ideas , messages and processes based on psychological theories , which may be used wisely to change the public 's approach to the issue of peace on both sides . <p> So how can it be done ? <p> Those living in an ongoing conflict build an emotional and psychological self-defence that underpins its continuation and the reasons why it can not be solved , thus eliminating accountability for the conflict 's ongoing existence .

The public of both sides had been approached many times to see the complications in their reality , but those attempts had always been met with walls and defences . <p> In order to overcome those walls , we have developed a psychological approach of ' paradoxical thinking . ' We have taken the arguments the public believes and instead of trying to convince by presenting opposing information , we have taken the arguments to the extreme , saying " the conflict must be continued , " because then we will feel moral , righteous , united , etc . Meaning , we have taken the public 's psychological arguments to the extreme , which made people recognize the problem , and then they started asking questions , like : do I really need the conflict ? Am I really like this ? Am I willing to cause pain and death only because I need the conflict ? That can not be true . After all , on a basic level I do want peace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In this way we 've made people take a deep look and explore if what they feel and think is correct . <p> The results were incredible .

The extensive academic research we have conducted with a group of subjects that represented the entire Israeli public ( 59% right-wing ) , had shown that 33% of the subjects who had initially defined themselves as right-wing , had changed their approach towards the Israeli-Palestinian conflict , meaning they understood that Israel is not doing enough to achieve peace . By the end of the experiment they were willing to make territorial compromises and some were even willing to make compromises on Jerusalem .

It is American journalist Helen Rowland , who said the hardest task in a girl 's life is to prove to a man that his intentions are serious . Every day , men seduce women , telling them all the sweet things women want to hear , some even promising marriage , just but to take them to bed and leave them . <p> There is no easy way out of the dilemma a woman finds herself in the early 20s . We can only weigh on the pros and cons of each age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in selecting a mate . <p> For starters , her male peers in college are probably very broke , sexually energetic , but often inexperienced . They are yet to learn how to handle their liquor or treat a lady decently . Charge it to the lack of experience . Equally , college boys also can be promiscuous and disrespectful . Yet , not many of them are bad . Mostly broke , but good chaps all the same . And can be loving and caring . And every girl needs to date a college lad , because , certainly , there is no love out there than the love life in campus . <p> Older guys are experienced , monied and can meet the basic demands of most college going girls without too much fuss . A fancy phone , a weekend getaway , nice food at the city 's better restaurants , you name it . The very things that tickle the fancy of a college girl . But the psychological gap between the two is so wide , rarely does a girl know . In my estimation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ youthful lass for his ego and will leave when he wants . And often they leave when the girl starts fantasising about everything including marriage . And he is probably married or looking for a woman aspiring for bigger things in life than expensive rum in an up-scale bar in the leafy suburbs . <p> Quite often , the college girl might be married to the older person . But she will always be a housewife or will always play second fiddle in the relationship . But if you elect to date a campus boy who declares that he loves you , you can turn him into a man and live to have a more balanced relationship or marriage whereby you are not a doormat necessarily . <p> To me , going for the older person is steeped in the short-term that informs the decision of many young women that they live to regret later in life . While more secure financially and in terms of stability , chances are that the man will keep going to the young women in college , just as he came for you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you by five years , if you want your freedom , independence to grow as an adult .
