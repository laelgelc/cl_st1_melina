@@1175237 <h> VAT Reform in Guangdong Province : A Transition to Value-Added Tax <p> Oct. 9 -- Since its invention in France in 1954 , value-added tax ( VAT ) has been implemented widely in more than 170 countries . China joined the wave in 1979 and set up the coexistence of business tax ( BT ) and VAT systems in its 1994 Tax Reform . However , this coexistence has caused confusion to business enterprises due to its duplicity , and China has begun to gradually replace BT on goods and services with VAT . <p> Shanghai successfully launched the VAT pilot program on January 1 , 2012 , followed by Beijing on September 1 , 2012 . Responding to the call from the government , Guangdong Province is set to launch its VAT pilot program on November 1 , 2012 . <p> Why VAT reform ? <p> Guangdong Province , as the economic engine of South China , is having a hard time under the tough current economic climate and the country 's industrial restructuring . Enterprises in the province are now faced with profit pressure due to weak external demand and rising production costs . Therefore , tax reforms have been put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficult situation . The VAT pilot program effectively reduces the tax burden on enterprises by resolving the issue of duplicate taxation brought by the current coexistence of BT and VAT systems . <p> Moreover , the service industry is of vital importance to the province 's economy ; the added value of the industry totaled RMB2.07 trillion at the end of the 11th Five-Year Plan , accounting for 45 percent of the gross production value of the province , with the modern service industry taking up 54.8 percent of the overall service industry . However , as the service industry is currently subject to BT , enterprises thereof can not enjoy any tax refund when exporting services , which largely weakens the international competitiveness of the industry and hinders its development . Guangdong is anticipated to break the bottleneck on developing the service industry and promote its development by launching the VAT pilot program . <p> Features of the VAT reform <p> Similar to Shanghai , the VAT pilot program in Guangdong adopts the " 1+6 " model , covering the transportation sector ( i.e. land transportation , water transportation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i.e. R&amp;D and technology service , information technology service , cultural and creative service , logistics auxiliary service , and authentication and consulting service ) . <p> Two new rates have been introduced into the VAT system -- 11 percent and 6 percent . Those two rates are chosen based on the actual BT burden of pilot industries . The converted VAT rate of the transportation sector ranges from 11 percent to 15 percent , while such rates vary from 6 percent to 10 percent for the modern service industry . <p> To ensure the overall tax burden on the pilot industries will not increase after the implementation of the VAT reform , tax rates of 11 percent and 6 percent are selected to apply on the transportation sector and part of the modern service industries , respectively . Besides , a 3 percent VAT rate is applied to small-scale taxpayers with annual sales less than RMB5 million . <p> Impact of the VAT reform <p> The government estimates that around 190,000 enterprises will be covered under the VAT pilot program , including 18,000 small-scale enterprises , which are the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ billion for local businesses and the revenue generated during the pilot period will be wholly disbursed by the local authorities . <p> Based on the pilot experience in Shanghai , small-scale taxpayers will see their tax burden drop while taxpayers in the transportation sector and tangle property leasing may experience an increase in their tax burden on a short-term basis . For enterprises concerned about their increased tax burden after the VAT reform , Guangdong has stated it will adhere to the general principle that " the overall tax burden on pilot industries shall not increase or shall be slightly lessened , and duplicate taxation shall be basically eliminated .

The 5,549-meter-long bridge , which was opened to traffic on Oct. 1 , 1986 , stopped charging tolls from Oct. 8 . <p> At the stroke of midnight Monday , drivers in China 's Henan province no longer had to pay a 10 yuan ( or around $1.50 ) toll to cross the 5.5 kilometer Zhengzhou Yellow River Bridge that links the cities of Zhengzhou and Xinxiang . <p> The toll was n't scrapped because of some end-of-Golden Week bout of generosity on the part of local government . <p> Instead , it was a grudging acknowledgement by bridge operators Henan Zhongyuan Expressway Co. that it could no longer charge for crossing the bridge , irreverently nicknamed the " Blood Sucker " by the cities ' hard-pressed residents . <p> Advertisement <p> Built in 1986 for 178 million yuan , the bridge recouped enough from tolls to repay debts just after one decade according to a 2008 investigation by China National Audit Office cited by a report by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four more years of toll paying since the audit report before drivers could take a toll-free spin across the span . <p> Internet users took to Sina Corp .

" wrote one . <p> " The National Audit Office has already ruled this kind of toll fee as ' illegal . ' How come this kind of illegal action could last as long as 16 years ? " asked another , adding : " Will anybody get punished because of that ? Where has all the illegal income gone to ? Anybody apologized to the public ? " <p> " The National Audit Office should do its job and provide people with their rights to use those roads and bridge for free , " commented another microblogger . <p> The abolition of the bridge toll follows the waiver of most highway tolls during the recent week-long national holiday that drew to a close Sunday . <p> Experts say such a top-down approach by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country 's highways . <p> Analyst Patrick Xu at Barclays estimates that the hit in the past week for listed Chinese highway operators could be as much as 4% of total annual revenue . <p> " The decision to waive may have benefited road users but it hurt investors , " he said , adding that the unilateral decision by the government was a breach of contract and " not justifiable . " <p> Still , institutional and retail investors have little chance of taking action given that local and central government combined tend to hold around 50% of the shares of the listed highway entities . " All investors can do is sell their shares , " said Mr. Xu . <p> He noted that new contract value for highway construction at listed companies has fallen sharply in the first half of 2012 compared with the same period a year earlier , something he attributed mainly to the government 's recent policy stance on tolls , which he said sent a " very negative signal . " <p> Meanwhile , the government continues to target infrastructure development . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's top economic planning agency , approved 13 projects to build new roads 2,018 kilometer in length . <p> While the value of those projects was not disclosed , analysts say the country 's road network is comparatively developed so most of China 's recent infrastructure development plans focus on rail and subway . In September , for example , NDRC approved $112.1 billion worth of subway projects . <p> China Railway Construction Co. , which in addition to railways is active in road construction , has seen its new contract value for highway construction fall to 38 billion yuan in the first six months of this year compared with 54 billion in the same period a year earlier , he said . <p> Stocks for China 's main highway operators were mostly lower down at the close of markets in Shanghai and Hong Kong Monday . <h> Comments ( 5 of 7 ) <p> Now that USA is planning to attack IRAN , it is either USA taxpayer pays more in taxes or borrow more MONEY from China . <p> American Taxpayers are therefore indirectly paying Chinese interest . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They are not use for playing WAR GAMES in the Middle East . <p> 2:39 am October 10 , 2012 <p> jhvance wrote : <p> Every cash cow ( and this bridge was certainly one ) eventually gets milked dry and the milk-drinkers ( the users ) reach a state of near-revolt -- something the government clearly can not tolerate .
