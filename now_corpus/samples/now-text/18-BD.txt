When it comes to receiving public services by the common people , it is a tale of unmitigated ordeal they are compelled to go through . The reasons for this are what the conference has rightly identified as lack of inclusive policy , monitoring , transparency and accountability . In the absence of inclusive policy , the average and common people are ignored by service points everywhere . Service providers consider themselves placed in a higher station compared with service seekers of modest means and of little or no influence .

First , the preparation of a centralised budget without involvement of the people at the grassroots level is faulty . Then , those people considered disadvantaged contribute more to development but they are left out from the development planning . The lower the social standing of people , the greater is the indifference to them in development planning . Actually , the underprivileged segments of the population deserved greater focus at the time of budget allocation but the opposite is happening . One stark example is the allocation in the health sector . The budget allocation for the sector was 4.71 per cent in the fiscal year ( FY ) , 2016-17 but it was 6.02 per cent in FY 2009-10 . <p> While services provided by the public sectors are vitiated by corruption and harassment , many of the essential services are privatised .

People of modest means can not even think of receiving treatment there . On the other hand , some of the private healthcare facilities run by unqualified or even fake physicians or nurses cause grievous harm or even death to patients . Had there been a rational and equalitarian health policy , such undesirable developments could be avoided . <p> Good governance and institutionalisation actually hold the key to bringing people of the bottom half under rational and just administration . The point at which administration turns into service to the people in its true sense of the term should be the ultimate aim . To that end , the system has to be geared to rolling like a well oiled machine with monitoring and supervision ensuring its smooth functioning . Thus transparency of public services will also be established . This done , no one can be deprived of his or her due .

The city was trying to force her out to make way for development , and Kelo did n't want to go . The high court ruled against her . <p> Now , however , Kelo 's story has been turned into a movie , " Little Pink House , " opening Friday in limited nationwide release . It 's a movie she and those involved in the film hope will get people to think about the government 's power to take private property for public use . Governments can use that power , called eminent domain , as long as they fairly compensate owners . <p> Kelo , who was in Washington @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city and state officials did " ripped our hearts out . " <p> Kelo was n't looking for a fight when she bought her house overlooking the Thames River in 1997 and had it painted Odessa Rose pink . Divorced and with five grown sons , she was looking for a place of her own . She found it in the 100-year-old cottage . Shortly after she moved in , pharmaceutical manufacturer Pfizer announced it would move in nearby , building a research facility that opened in 2001 . <p> New London hoped Pfizer 's move could help revitalize the city and , with the help of a private nonprofit development corporation , sought to redevelop land near the facility . A hotel , housing , office space , restaurants and shopping were planned . To get it done , the city authorized the use of eminent domain . <p> Kelo thought that was wrong , and she and a small group of other homeowners took on the city . They acknowledged eminent domain could be used to take their homes for public uses such as a road or military @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ count . <p> " She was just fearless , " said Oscar-nominated actress Catherine Keener , who plays Kelo in the movie .

The group was also instrumental in the new movie 's making , bringing a book about the case to the attention of filmmakers Courtney Moorehead Balaker and Ted Balaker . <p> Courtney Balaker , the movie 's writer and director , said she was " blown away " by Kelo 's case but also by Kelo herself . She compared her story to that of Erin Brockovich , a nonlawyer and divorced mother of three who took on utility company PG&amp;E over contaminated groundwater in Hinkley , California , inspiring a 2000 movie . One big difference : Brockovich won . <p> In 2005 , the Supreme Court ruled against Kelo 5-4 . Three justices who sided with the city -- Ruth Bader Ginsburg , Stephen Breyer and Anthony Kennedy -- are still on the court . The two others -- John Paul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ justices wrote that the city had carefully crafted a development plan it believed would benefit the community . They agreed the use of eminent domain was permitted . <p> " I want people to walk away thinking about if that 's right , " Balaker said . <p> Stevens , the Supreme Court justice who authored the opinion , has acknowledged it was the most unpopular one he wrote . Justice Antonin Scalia , who dissented from the decision , ranked it among the court 's biggest mistakes . <p> After the decision , more than 20 states significantly revised their laws to make it more difficult to take property through eminent domain , said Dana Berliner , litigation director for the Institute for Justice . <p> Those changes did n't help Kelo , who had to move . And despite the lengthy legal battle , her land still stands empty . Pfizer announced in 2009 that it would leave New London . But submarine builder General Dynamics Electric Boat now occupies its former facility with many more employees , said New London Mayor Michael Passero . <p> Passero said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Democrat who grew up in the city , said while the movie vilifies the development corporation , he believes the people behind it had good motives , though they also made mistakes . More than anything , he said , the story is a cautionary tale about two sides becoming so polarized they could n't find a middle ground . <p> Kelo 's little pink house was ultimately saved . Disassembled and moved but still painted pink , it stands on New London 's Franklin Street . Although Kelo does n't live there , she says she thinks about her former home and her legal fight often . <p> " A lot of people ask : ' How are you all doin ' ? ... How are your neighbors ? How did you survive this ? ' " she said of recent appearances in connection with the movie .

@@25509233 <h> Preparing for a global trade war <p> Published : July 06 , 2018 22:06:36 <p> Driven by populism , myopic self-interest and nationalism in the USA and Europe , the world is on the verge of a trade war . This is evident from the issuance of repeated threats as well as imposition of higher tariffs by the US President Donald Trump against his perceived adversaries in Europe , Asia and America . The EU , Canada and China in turn have also declared counter measures . It seems that the situation may go out of control any time in the foreseeable future . The world is therefore now facing the daunting prospect of an all-out trade war , which will not spare even minnows like Bangladesh . Against such a backdrop , the UN Conference on Trade and Development ( UNCTAD ) has recently released a document detailing the possible impact of a trade war , if it really happens , on different countries including Bangladesh . It estimated Bangladesh might be facing soaring tariffs to the extent of 43.40 per cent . In sharp contrast , the country is currently enjoying an average tariff of only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aside Trump 's recent onslaughts , a review of the global trade regime would reveal that the terms of trade have always favoured the powerful states . The G-20 nations have also consistently increased protectionism since the global financial crisis of 2007-8 , often with painful consequences for the developing countries . These measures included export taxes , tariffs and non-tariff barriers as well as counterproductive foreign aid . In fact , free trade has merely remained an attractive proposition , because mankind has never lived in a world sufficiently free of protectionism . And now the developing countries like Bangladesh are confronting an even worse scenario after being brutalised over the years by the protectionist might of the rich in the form of tariffs , subsidies and state-sponsored bailouts . The ruthlessness with which the powerful nations protect their self-interest has now become more flagrant and visible than ever before . <p> Now , what should Bangladesh do in the face of such an ominous prospect ?

For example , export-oriented industries like readymade garments ( RMG ) may divert their attention to the local market in case the export market becomes difficult or unsustainable due to enhanced tariffs .

You put out a song and people are like , " the beats could have been better " or " in this guitar solo you got ta ... " <p> Rushnaf : Yeah man , I get it . It 's a trend to seem more knowledgeable than we are . In the age of internet and social media , in order to win a fight I just have to Google the right words and find out two-minute Wiki information about it , and vomit it out wherever I need to win a random fight . And then there 's the fabled ' mix ' . Do n't get me started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Rushnaf : The discourse is not understandable for most people because they have to prepare themselves ... it 's a line from Eliot , " There will be time to prepare a face to meet the faces that you will meet . " Nowadays we are too busy preparing our faces all the time . <p> So now when we put out material , and when I say " we " I do n't mean Blunderware ; it could be any band , people will automatically prepare a face to tell you what you did wrong , instead of merely celebrating something new . I am not saying there are n't people celebrating . There are ! And I am very thankful that there are people who understand like , " this is a song . It touches me and that 's what I feel about it . <p> People who tell me songs connected with them are not musicians , these days . I used to think we were a band for the musicians , and not for an audience , per se . How wrong I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people who are open to anything that touch them . When you 're too busy preparing a face to show that you are knowledgeable , then you miss out on whatever originality is left in this world . You miss out on the basic fact that the mix must not be same for every act , and that even the mix of the song has a story it wants to tell . <p> Sinjan : I think it comes down to how used to you are with language . Even the language ( of the mix ) becomes like that . If we say a different word that no one understands , then they do n't want to pay attention . I feel like , the way you ( Rushnaf ) mentioned the barriers , they do it to guard off certain things , which might be discomfiting . They do n't want to get touched by what they think is " immature " stuff ; not ripe for the picking ; basically , not ' cool ' . That closes them off to a lot of options . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go on and on about this but Sinjan is right . There is a very guarded approach to what one might think good music is . Of course , when the album is done and given out to the world , I do n't really care about what people think about it after that . <p> Sinjan : I do . <p> Rushnaf : I have never been that person . And I just want to be happy with what I am making . I want to be completely happy with what I am making . No wonder the album took ... whoops ... I mean , is taking so long . <p> It 's not just a process of making . The entire time I am not working on it with my hands , that time and thought is also very necessary to figure things out with my mind . Sometimes one needs thirteen years to just absorb everything that one needs for a song . <p> Wadud : Most of it just stating all of that out in your head over and over again . <p> Rushnaf : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You are decaying and decaying and then you reach a point of decay , when you are like , this is the accurate moment . <p> Sinjan : Like a labyrinth . After a lot of dead ends you reach the end . Huh . <p> Rushnaf : I am not even proclaiming , " Hear , this is the right way ! The siratul mustakim ! The straight path ! " I am not a prophet . I am just saying this is my way . <p> There could be someone who releases like 5 albums in a really short time . That is the way they are going about it . I totally respect that . I do n't think there is anything wrong with that approach . <p> Sinjan : I mean , if some dude brings out a song every week , then he probably writes it in one day , by incorporating all the feelings he had over the six days . <p> Rushnaf : The nine years we have been vegetating has been really important for me . I need these songs to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I planted a seed , and now behold a tree ! <p> Rushnaf : Shakib Chowdhury , of Cryptic Fate once said to me in a party , " You have to just excrete the first album out . " <p> I love Shakib bhai , and he , among so many senior and lauded musicians have been supportive of Blunderware for so long , for such less gratification . Yet , we are of a certain age now as a band ; our first things are n't the first things anymore . <p> What is the story behind the Blunderware name ? <p> Rushnaf : I 've told this story so many times . Me and my friend Mushfiq , we grew up in Chittagong . We went to boarding school together . We learned how to play the guitar together . Mushfiq came to Chittagong before me and I was in India for all that time ( before my eventual permanent return seven years back ) . We never really got to make a band together . He had his own band , Act of Defiance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Summer of 2008 found me on vacation in Chittagong , hanging out in Mushu 's room , and he had this guitar riff that did n't really fit with his metal band . I brought out a small piece I had written a long time ago in my diary , the first thing I had written in Bangla in ages ! I took it out and we threw ideas and chords and put it together in half an hour . Our first ever single , " Afim Chaash " was born like that . We decided to call ourselves Blunderware soon after that . <p> Wadud : Himesh . <p> Rushnaf : Yeah , " Hi(s) Me(lodic) Sh(yness) " ( laughs ) It is a pretty cool name . I still like it . Blunderware basically came about because Mushfiq wanted to call our fans " chaddis " . So Blunder- wear , as in someone blundered ( winks here ) in their pants .

Twenty-four people were killed in that attack . If the attack was fully successful , most of the Awami League policymakers , including the party chief , would have died . <p> Who planned this militant attack , who were they , and what would they have gained by taking out the Awami League leadership ? Where did the grenades come from ? How , and who supplied them ? <p> The man who has provided the answers to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name is Abdul Majed Bhat , alias Abdul Majid , but his real name is Abu Yusuf Bhat . He had come to Bangladesh with the " assignment " to carry out long-term militant activities . He even married a local girl , after learning to speak and write fluent Bangla , reported Bangla Tribune . <p> Investigations revealed that Yusuf Bhat , son of Abdur Rahman Bhat , is from the Terigaon area of Kulgaon in India-controlled Kashmir 's Islamabad district . After finishing school , he completed his honours in biology from the Islamabad Government Degree College in 1989 . <p> In the beginning of the 90s , Yusuf was made a top level organizer ofHijb-ul Mujahideen , the military wing of the Pakistan Jamaat-e-Islami , after he left Kashmir in India and became a Pakistani citizen . Hijb-ul Mujahideen was formed in September 1989 , with the direct backing of Pakistan 's spy agency Inter-Services Intelligence ( ISI ) . <p> Yusuf Bhat is one of the principally accused in the August 21 grenade attack case . On December 6 , 2009 , Yusuf gave a 14-page @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bangladesh , India and Pakistan . <p> In his statement , Yusuf said he met Maulana Tajuddin , Maulana Abdus Salam , and Mufti Hannan , at Mohammadpur 's Saat Masjid in early August 2004 . " Maulana Tajuddin said if Awami League comes to power then it will be tough for our organization to be active in Bangladesh and India . So , if Sheikh Hasina is killed then Awami League will be destroyed and will not be able to come to power , and that will allow us to work easily in Bangladesh and India . That 's why we will have to kill Sheikh Hasina . <p> " When Maulana Abdus Salam asked how they would do it , Tajuddin said he had grenades that could be used to carry out the attack . Tajuddin also said his brother , Minister Abdul Salam Pintu , would provide all assistance on behalf of the government . He said they would have to carry out the attack with the BNP in power , because it would n't be possible if Awami League returned to power . " <p> Yusuf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think the matter over as government assistance was confirmed by his brother . <p> He said Tajuddin was given Tk6-7 lakh in several phases by Hijb-ul Mujahideen to bring the grenades and ammunition to Dhaka from Pakistan via India . But he could not bring them over as the person who was supposed to receive and supply the grenades and ammunition had gotten arrested at the border by India 's Border Security Force ( BSF ) . <p> " The grenades used in the attack on Awami League 's rally on August 21 , 2004 were the ones Tajuddin already had . Mujaffar Shah had given them to him . " <p> Yusuf Bhat in his confessional statement also gave information regarding the grenades that were used in the attacks on then British high commissioner in Dhaka , Anwar Choudhury , on May 21 , 2004 , on Awami League leader Suranjit Sengupta 's rally in Sunamganj on June 21 that year , on then Sylhet mayor Badar Uddin Ahmed Kamran on August 7 , and the fatal attack on former finance minister Shah AMS Kibria in Habiganj on January @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to permanently stay in Bangladesh , Yusuf married Nahid Laila Kakon of Sirajganj on October 3 , 2003 . <p> Kakon said she met Yusuf through Arif Hasan Sumon , another accused in the August 21 case . After their marriage , Yusuf applied for Bangladeshi citizenship and even had a fake Bangladeshi passport made with false information . <p> Sumon , whose real name is Abdur Razzak , is from Dhaka 's Mohammadpur . Another accused in the August 21 grenade attack case , Hafez Maulana Idris , is a brother-in-law . Tajuddin , who is a fugitive in this case and currently living in South Africa , used to be a tenant at Sumon 's house . Yusuf also rented a flat in that same building after he arrived in Dhaka . <p> Yusuf came to Dhaka for the first time in January 2000 . Before his arrest in Sirajganj in June 2007 , he lived in both Bangladesh and Pakistan . <p> Yusuf 's now former wife , Kakon , in her confessional statement given on September 15 , 2013 , also provided details regarding communications between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ travel of militant leaders to Bangladesh from Pakistan , arms and financing , and other matters of this nature . <p> Yusuf in his statement also confessed that Pakistan-based militant outfit Tehrik-e-Jihadi ( TJI ) leader Mujaffar Shah had sent him the grenades used in the August 21 attack . Tajuddin also had some explosives . The grenades and the explosives were even kept in Yusuf 's Mohammadpur flat for a while . <p> He also gave information regarding the activities of Pakistan and Afghanistan-based militant groups , such as TJI , Hijb-ul Mujahideen , Lashkar-e-Taiba , Jaish-e-Mohammed , Harkat-ul Mujahideen , Al-Badr , and **25;0;TOOLONG , and their members in Bangladesh . <p> For Hijb-ul Mujahideen , Yusuf was active in Kashmir until 1999 .

He also gave up information regarding Engineer Khan , Kamrul Islam , Golam Rasul , Mujaffar Shah , Sekandar , Shakil Shahed , Khurram Khaiyam , alias Selim , Safi Samiullah , alias Mostak , and others , who were involved in militant activities in India through Bangladesh.The reasons , according to Yusuf Bhat , why Sheikh Hasina was attacked <p> 1 . The religion-based militants needed a government in their favour to keep India destabilized , for which they did not like Sheikh Hasina2 . The militants consider her an enemy of Islamists as she is secular3 . Anti-Islam intellectuals apparently get more space whenever Hasina is in power4 . Hasina 's death would have destroyed Awami League and the party would never have come to power5 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agency , political parties , and militant outfits of that country do not like her6 . Bangladeshi political parties that favour militancy are also against Sheikh Hasina7 . Some political parties , which either came to power or shared power , also dislike Hasina .

@@30006230 <h> Mash 's focus only on the first step <p> Bangladesh coach Steve Rhodes ( L ) and captain Mashrafe Bin Mortaza were guardedly optimistic about the team 's chances in the Asia Cup during the pre-tournament press conference at the Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium in Mirpur yesterday . PHOTO : star <p> Sports Reporter <p> ODI captain Mashrafe Bin Mortaza knows the pitfalls into which Bangladeshi cricket teams often unwittingly stumble . He is also one who keeps expectations low before series , so it was no surprise that his feet were planted firmly on the ground when he talked about Bangladesh 's chances in the Asia Cup in the pre-tournament press conference in Mirpur yesterday . <p> The pitfall is that the confidence of the team seems to disproportionately draw from their most recent performance in a series . Afghanistan and Sri Lanka are in Bangladesh 's group , and there are bad memories of the former as Bangladesh succumbed to a 3-0 whitewash in a T20I series at the hands of the minnows when they last met , with leg-spinner Rashid Khan tormenting the Tigers ' batsmen in Dehradun in May . <p> " Of course he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formats . One positive is that in T20s you have to play more shots due to the pressure of scoring runs , but in one-dayers , maybe you will get two-three overs more , " said Mashrafe , but Rashid was not his focus because Bangladesh 's first match is not against Afghanistan . <p> " Before Rashid , I think that it is more important to handle Sri Lanka 's pace bowling and spin variety . If we can win the first match , I am pretty sure the confidence we will gain will make it easier to handle Rashid Khan , Mujeeb Ur Rahman or Mohammad Nabi . If the Sri Lanka match is a bad one then it will be doubly difficult . That match will set many things for us . " <p> There were also no forecasts of Bangladesh winning the tournament , despite the fact that they made the final in two of the last three editions , albeit all at home . <p> " Looking at the teams , I think that India are a far better team than the others . Pakistan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will have a few advantages , including the presence of many wrist-spinners , " Mashrafe said . " If you compare the teams , see the wicket , which players are in form -- I think there are better teams than us . But I do n't think the gap is a big one ; we can bridge it by playing good cricket and then anything is possible . " <p> New coach Steve Rhodes , sitting beside the inspirational captain , was however not that cautious and that perhaps has to do with him not being there when a single bad performance seemed to let loose an avalanche of losses in 2014 and also in late 2017 and early 2018 . <p> " I think it would be a wonderful achievement for us to win the Asia Cup . We are going there full of confidence , " said Rhodes with a smile . " Winning there in West Indies gave the team a lot of confidence . We have two games to qualify . We should n't assume that we will get into the next group . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have given him an inkling of the importance of starting well . <p> " If we play well against Sri Lanka and Afghanistan , then it will add to the confidence . Then if we are in the last stages of the tournament , why would n't you believe that you could win ? " <p> But the mood of the presser was set by the captain . " I think the 15th of September , in particular , will be important . " <p> All eyes , understandably , are therefore on the opener eight days from today and the team will do well to tap into their captain 's laser focus .

Once people clicked on the spoofed domain and provided their log-ins , they were rerouted to the original network . <p> On other occasions , according to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personal emails of employees at Westinghouse . Two account users clicked on the malicious links . <p> The indictment alleges that the seven defendants , all of whom are members of Russia 's military intelligence agency , sought to sow disinformation and create an influence campaign as retaliation for the exposure of a Russian state-sponsored athlete doping program . <p> The US Anti-Doping Agency and the World Anti-Doping Agency were among their hacking targets , as well sporting organizations including the Federation Internationle de Football Association ( FIFA ) and athletes whose medical records were stolen and later publicized . <p> Russia has denied meddling in the 2016 US presidential election , contradicting a unanimous conclusion by all US intelligence agencies . <p> All seven of the defendants are presumed to be in Russia , which does not have an extradition treaty with the United States . The indictment could make it hard for them to travel to other countries . <p> The hackers traveled to other countries to carry out hacking activities , sometimes with the use of diplomatic passports , prosecutors allege . <p> Such efforts , known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operations , were carried out in cases where remote hacking from Russia did not provide " sufficient access " to networks . <p> One such trip , for instance , was Rio de Janeiro before and during the 2016 summer Olympic games . <p> Some of the stolen data was later published under the false auspices of a hacktivist group known as " Fancy Bears Hack Team . " <p> " Close access operations , like the ones exposed today , are reminders of the considerable resources available to nation states , " said John Hultquist , director of intelligence analysis at the cyber firm FireEye . <p> While the motive behind the hacks involving anti-doping groups and organizations probing Russian poisonings were more clear-cut , the decision to target Westinghouse was less apparent . <p> Justice Department officials declined to provide additional details on Thursday about the attacks on the company . <p> Efforts to penetrate its networks started in late 2014 , some nine months after Ukraine 's pro-Russia President Viktor Yanucovych was removed from power during the Ukrainian Revolution .

And if the present trend continues , it could mount to $144 billion in the next five years . <p> The IMF has also estimated that the country 's foreign currency reserves would continue to decline to $7.075 billion by 2023 from $12.09 billion held by the State Bank of Pakistan now . <p> More alarmingly , the total external debt servicing would reach $19.7 billion by 2023 against $7.739 billion in the financial year 2018 . <p> DEBT TO CHINA <p> Writing in Express Tribune , Salman Siddiqui has quoted Topline Securities to say that Pakistan will end up paying $90 billion to China over a span of 30 years against the loan and investment portfolio worth $50 billion under CPEC . <p> " The estimated return on Chinese investments ( which is the sum of principal and interest on foreign currency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 40% return on investment , " the Topline Securities ' report on CPEC says . <p> " The amount increased to $54 billion after the inclusion of more projects in CPEC such as investments in Pakistan Railways and financing of the Karachi Circular Railways project . The volume of return would increase accordingly . " <p> " Infrastructure and power projects -- part of the CPEC portfolio and divided across time in terms of priority -- are expected to be completed by fiscal year 2030 . " <p> Leading economists have estimated an annual average repayment of $3 to 4 billion per year to China post fiscal year 2020 . <p> Also most CPEC-related projects are being funded abroad and Pakistan is not seeing any significant inflow of foreign exchange . <p> " It should be noted that project financing for CPEC is being done between Chinese companies and banks and around 25% of CPEC investment is expected to come in Pakistan , " the Topline Securities report said . <p> However , the report argued that repayment would be manageable given the projected surge in exports and drop in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pockets by generating 70,000 jobs so far . <p> CHINA MIGHT HELP OUT PAKISTAN <p> Pakistan 's heavy reliance on China to meet its developmental and strategic needs makes it hard for it to ask Beijing to reschedule or rework its debt repayments . <p> But eventually , as an " all weather friend " , China might oblige , though only if CPEC is not badly dented . Just as Pakistan can not do without China , China can not do without Pakistan . China has a huge financial commitment in CPEC and has a very significant strategic interest in it . <p> DIFFERENCES IN PERCEPTION <p> The first hurdle to be overcome in the Pakistan-IMF talks is the difference in perception about the nature of Chinese loans . <p> Pakistan 's Finance Minister Asad Umar told the media after his talks with IMF 's Christine Lagarde in Indonesia , that the State Department ' contentions about Chinese loans are " 100% wrong . " <p> " Pakistan 's financing gap for the current year is about $12 billion and total repayments to China averages $300 million over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The terms of Chinese loans would be placed before parliament and shared with the IMF . We should show how China , a real friend , extended attractive financing to Pakistan for the long term . The Chinese embassy has endorsed this position in a recent tweet , " Umar added . <p> Former Finance Minister Miftah Ismail told Reuters that the " weighted average interest rate " of Chinese loans is only 2% . " These are not loans that will break our back , " he said . <p> As per Finance Ministry calculations for the next five years , Pakistan 's total annual debt repayments and profit expatriation by Chinese companies would be below $1 billion , Ismail added . <p> But in this context , Dawn writer Kurram Hussain asked : " How come the Planning Commission put out a figure closer to $3 billion year or so ago ? <p> Finance Minister Umar denied a statement by his Information Minister Fawad Chaudhry that unacceptable conditions from friends , Saudi Arabia , China and the UAE , had compelled Pakistan to go for the IMF bailout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their consultation and there was no condition demanded either by Saudi Arabia , the UAE or China at all , " Umar said . <p> Pakistan has to go for an IMF bailout because of certain domestic and external factors , the minister explained . <p> Foreign exchange reserves dwindled because of the yawning gap between imports ( $60 billion ) and exports ( $25 billion ) . And the debilitating external factors were the US sanctions on Iran and the trade war with China . This led to an oil price increase and economic uncertainty in the international market . An increase in US interest rates also created unfavourable conditions in the external sector . <p> WAY OUT <p> However , according to Prof. Rashid Amjad of the Lahore School of Economics , a question that should be asked is why 18 IMF programs in the last 30 years , have ended up with an unsustainable fiscal and current account deficit and a run on the country 's foreign exchange reserves . <p> The blame can be put at the door of the IMF as well as successive Pakistani @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And there has been continuous economic mismanagement also . <p> Writing in Dawn , Prof Amjad suggested that the government draw up a " credible and consistent homegrown economic roadmap , a strategic three-year plan covering the coming years from 2018 to 2021 . " <p> " On the stabilization front , this plan should target a staggered decline in the fiscal deficit from the current expected 7.2 % in 2018-19 ( excluding measures in the revised budget ) to near 5% over the next three years , supported by steps to gradually reduce subsidies and the adoption of new initiatives to increase tax revenues . " <p> " But we must never forget the terrible impact of a sudden steep decline in the fiscal deficit agreed on with the IMF in the 2008 program , which led to a collapse in the growth rate from 5.5% to around 0.7% . A cut in subsidies resulted in food inflation of over 25% . The economy never quite recovered from this , " Prof Amjad pointed out . <p> " Most importantly , the strategic plan should be supplemented with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a framework for cuts in development expenditure , shelving or reduction of projects and reallocation of funds for projects including those under CPEC . " <p> Other countries like Malaysia have cut expensive and non-priority Chinese- funded projects drastically . <p> " In the negotiations with the IMF , it would be sensible to agree to a 24-36 months , $8-9 billion fund program , frontloaded with the release of a sufficiently large initial tranche to calm the markets and restore business confidence , " Amjad said . <p> Finance Minister Umar has said that government will see that the IMF 's conditions do not impact on the poor harshly . He pointed out that fuel prices have been differentiated so as not to hit the poor hard . Electricity prices would also be similarly differentiated .

" <p> At present , the two sides say Britain will remain inside the EU single market , and subject to the bloc 's regulations , from the day it leaves on March 29 until December 2020 , to give time for new trade relations to be set up . <p> But with Brexit talks at an impasse , the bloc has suggested extending that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deal that ensures the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland remains friction-free -- the main sticking point to a Brexit deal . <p> May said the U.K. was considering an extension of several months .

Chief EU negotiator Michel Barnier said " we need much time , much more time , and we continue to work in the next weeks .

He makes a 20,000-pound bet with four sceptical fellow members of the exclusive private " Reform Club " , in central London ( each of whom contributed 5,000 pounds towards the wager ) , that he can arrive back at the Reform Club , eighty days from exactly 8:45 pm that evening . <p> Together with his able valet , Passepartout ( Cantinflas ) , Fogg goes around the globe liberally spending money to encourage others to help him get to his destinations faster so he can maintain his tight steamship schedules .

Therefore , a Police Inspector named Fix ( Robert Newton ) is sent out by Scotland Yard to trail him ( starting in Suez ) and keeps waiting for a warrant to arrive so he can arrest Fogg in any of the British ports of call he visits en-route . While in India , Fogg and Passepartout rescue a young Hindu widow the Indian Princess Aouda ( Shirley MacLaine ) from being forced into a funeral pyre with her late husband . The three ( Fogg , Aouda and Passepartout ) next visit Hong Kong , Yokohama , San Francisco , and the Wild West ( USA ) .

And , although Fogg is exonerated , he has insufficient time to reach London before his deadline and thus has lost everything , except for the love of beautiful Aouda . However , by an act of providence upon returning to London , Passepartout buys a newspaper to find that it is still Saturday . Fogg then realises that by travelling east towards the rising sun and by crossing the international date-line , he has actually gained a day . Thus there was still time to reach the Reform Club and win the bet . Fogg arrives at the club just before the 8:45 pm chime . Soon , Aouda and Passepartout also arrive together , surprising everyone , as no woman has ever been allowed to enter the strictly all-male Reform Club , in London before . <p> The movie has a star-studded cast , with David Niven and the famous Mexican-comedian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A plethora of more than forty performers made cameo appearances in the movie , an all-time record for any Hollywood movie . It made a US screen actors guild representative cry out in amazement : " Good heavens Todd , you 've made extras out of all stars in Hollywood " . <p> Actor David Niven portrays Fogg as the epitome of a Victorian gentleman -- fastidious to a fault , immaculately attired , always proper , well-spoken , and very punctual , whereas , his side-kick or aide Passepartout ( with a roving eye for the ladies ) provides much of the comic relief as the resourceful " jack of all trades " in the film in contrast to his master 's strict formality . Actress Shirley MacLaine plays the role of the exotic Aouda , an Indo-European Indian princess , the daughter of a Bombay Parsi merchant who was married against her will to the Hindu ruler of Bundelkhand , an Indian princely state .

Some 10,000 extras were used for the bullfight scene alone in Spain , with Cantinflas as the bumbling matador . <p> The filming of the movie took place in late 1955 , from August 9 to December 20 . The picture cost just under USD 6 million to make , employing 112 locations in 13 countries and 140 sets . The film premiered on October 17 , 1956 at the Rivoli Theater in New York City . By the time of Todd 's accidental death eighteen months later in a private plane crash , it had grossed an astronomical sum of USD 33 million , unprecedented for those days .

@@30235230 <h> Stages of Becoming Bespectacled <h> Glasses are something a large number of us have grown used to over the course of our lives . However , for most of us , we had n't always been visually impaired . There exists a process to a person getting used to their new set of eyes , and turns out , it 's a pretty common one . <p> That one statement is where it begins for a lot of people . It 's the moment you realise someone around you can actually see something you ca n't . Our sight does n't just decide to stop functioning perfectly overnight . It 's a gradual process and it usually takes a while before this realisation even takes place . Once it does though , you ca n't ignore it . You face a couple days of reading signs from a distance . Each one you read feels like a little reassuring pat that you might have been mistaken about your diagnosis . Each one that you ca n't read , however , you just look away from those as quickly as possible . <p> STAGE II : DENIAL <p> There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after they 've made the discovery . You now have a secret . You ca n't let your family know that you are having trouble seeing , because then you 'll be forced into your worst nightmare : wearing glasses . You try to convince yourself that you do n't really need the glasses . You sit at the front in class , and try to forget about the problem . You squint a lot and , unlike before , you now begin to notice whenever you do it . <p> STAGE III : CONFRONTATION <p> Someone notices something 's up . It may be your parents , or a sibling , or some other adult you did n't manage to slip past . They find you with your face practically inches from the TV screen , and just like that , your little secret is out . Your parents come to the conclusion that you need glasses , and so , to the doctor 's office you go . <p> The optician 's office can be a daunting place the first time . You did n't know you had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actual doctor sees you . You do n't have any idea how looking at the floating hot air balloon helps , but the contraption looks official enough for you to go along with it . The next one however , is a lot more intimidating , although you do n't know that till you 've already placed your chin on the device . " You 'll feel a puff of air in your eye " says the operator , and immediately you begin hyperventilating . In the end , you manage to make it through that as well . <p> What you do n't know is that the real trial is yet to come . You meet the doctor , and you think that this process is finally moving along . You 're placed in a chair and asked to read a couple rows of letters . Easy enough , you think . That is when the worst part of going to the optician reveals itself- deciding which amongst two essentially identical lenses lets you see better , all the while feeling like your entire life depends on this ridiculous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> STAGE IV : RELUCTANCE <p> You 've finally gotten those pair of glasses . You took your time and picked out a nice frame that you could live with . However , once you get home you keep looking at the mirror , and the more you look , the more you realise how different your face is with the glasses . All kinds of thoughts of how people will judge you go through your head , and that 's when the reluctance to use the glasses takes root . <p> You now begin a game of wearing the glasses as infrequently as possible . Perhaps you 'll put them on only in class when you really need to see that board , or when you are sitting in front of your PC . At all other times they are placed in their box and out of sight .

That is because the reluctance phase just gets awfully exhausting . Keeping the glasses in their box , or at least somewhere safe ; always remembering to carry them around ; making sure to clean them each time because they are worn and taken off so frequently ; all of these actions take a lot of patience and effort . Alas , there 's that one day when you 've forgotten your glasses at home one too many times , and it 's just the last straw .

Not all the moments are endearing though . Some are just flat out ironic ; like needing your glasses to look for your glasses . <p> BONUS STAGE VI : APPRECIATION <p> After a considerable amount of time , you might just have found a style for glasses that you actually like on your face .

@@30235232 <h> Know your sleep cycle <p> Among all the activities that we are supposed to perform every day , sleeping is probably the favourite among most people . The way we interact with the idea of sleep is quite interesting . It evolves as we complete different stages of our lives . <p> When you were an infant , all you did was sleep around all day . Then you grew up to be old enough to understand what makes your mom angry -- you not going to bed on time , but still not old enough to understand why you need to sleep . During your teen years , you love sleeping all of a sudden . You sleep through your morning lectures , you sleep through lunch , you basically sleep through anything and everything . Yet you probably still have no idea why sleeping is important or how much you should actually sleep . <p> A typical sleep cycle lasts about 90 minutes . During these 90 minutes , you will move through five stages of sleep . The first four stages make up your " Non-rapid Eye Movement " ( NREM ) sleep , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( REM ) sleep . The NREM part of the sleep starts with Stage 1 when you are just going to sleep , down to the very deep sleep in Stage 4 . It is very difficult to wake someone who is in Stage 4 sleep . During NREM sleep even though your eyes do n't move , your muscles still have the ability to function , whereas REM is when you will experience the most amount of eye function but other muscles that help us move will remain inactive . Most people start dreaming at this stage of their sleep . <p> Your sleep cycle can be affected by factors like age , the amount of recent sleep , and other behaviours prior to sleep such as exercise , stress , environmental conditions such as temperature and light , and various chemicals . <p> While asked about different sleep cycles , Prof. Dr. Abu Nasir Rizvi , MBBS , MD , Professor at The Department of Neurology at Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University , said , " The sleep cycle of a newborn baby will be different from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should sleep for 18 hours a day and remain awake for only 6 hours , whereas the minimum amount of sleep that an adult needs can be achieved by 6 hours of sleep and maximum 10 hours , given they are leading a healthy lifestyle and are not overworked . " <p> The minimum hours a person needs to sleep also depends on the kind of profession they are in . The amount of sleep a day labourer needs will be significantly higher than that of an office worker . Since the body repairs and recharges itself during sleep , the more damage or fatigue , the more the body requires sleep . <p> So what actually happens if you do n't maintain the sleep cycle according to your age and work ? If you sleep too little it can cause consistent nightmares leading to epilepsy , diabetes etc . Since our body recovers from all the hard work it did all day during sleep , being disrupted in the middle of a sleep cycle can also cause headaches and lead to more stress being built up within the body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lack of sleep or disrupted sleep cycles can also leave you feeling tired all day . It disrupts your concentration and reduces your efficiency . <p> Even though it might seem like a first world problem , excessive sleeping is also a thing . Hypersomnia is the clinical term for excessive sleeping and sleepiness during the day . Sleeping too much is linked with many of the same health risks as sleeping too little , including heart disease , metabolic problems such as diabetes and obesity , and cognitive issues including difficulty with memory . <p> Sleep problems are particularly common in patients with anxiety , depression , bipolar disorder , and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ) . But it does n't end there . The effects of sleep cycle dive deep into a person 's mental health . <p> When asked about how a person 's sleep cycle affects their mental health , Dr. Samsad Begum , MBBS , DCM , MPSC ( Psychiatry ) , said , " Sleep cycle is deeply related with a person 's state of mind .

This is a direct result of stress and continuous neglect towards having a proper sleep schedule . Sleepwalking and sleeptalking are also similarly correlated with an unstable sleep cycle . <p> So before you take a sip of your 12th cup of coffee of the day and pull off another all-nighter or worse , sleep for 3 days straight because you can , do n't do it .

@@30235237 <h> Why is n't private investment growing faster ? <p> The long-term trend of GDP growth rate of Bangladesh shows that the country has continued to improve its rate of growth steadily over the past 46 years after independence in 1971 . Starting from a highly volatile rate in the 1970s , the GDP growth rate became higher and much more stable in the 2000s and 2010s . The growth rate increased significantly since the early 1990s , shooting up to over 5 percent per annum , but importantly exceeding the 6 percent mark for a number of years during the 2000s , and then crossing the 7 percent mark in recent years . The average GDP growth rate increased from 3.7 percent in the 1970s to 6.7 percent in the 2010s . Bangladesh has been able to increase the average GDP growth rate by one percentage point for each decade since the 1990s . In 2018 the country achieved the highest growth rate of 7.9 percent in the past four decades . <p> Despite the gradual rise in the investment-GDP ratio over the past three decades , in recent years , the share of private investment in GDP @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GDP has risen . It is also found that the share of private investment in total investment has fallen whereas the share of public investment in total investment has increased . One very important aspect of the pattern of Bangladesh 's investment regimes in the 1990s and 2000s is that the major contribution to the rise in investment-GDP ratio came from the rise in private investment and its share in total investment . Especially , during 1995 and 2008 , there was a persistent rise in the private investment-GDP ratio . Between 2009 and 2017 , this ratio fluctuated and increased by only 1.2 percentage points . <p> Bangladesh aspires to achieve 9 percent real GDP growth rate by 2030 . In this case , the required investment-GDP ratio would be around 40 percent under the assumption of a 4.44 ICOR ( Incremental Capital-Output Ratio ) -- the average ICOR between 2013 and 2017 . In this scenario , between 2018 and 2030 , the investment-GDP ratio has to be increased annually by 0.73 percentage points which is 171 percent higher than the annual average percentage point rise of 0.42 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ growth acceleration and high investment requirement , there will be the need for a much larger contribution from the private sector in raising the investment-GDP ratio . <p> So the question is , how do we boost private sector investment in Bangladesh to achieve the much larger GDP growth target ? There is a need to address several policy-induced challenges . Further reform of trade policies is needed with strategic and dynamic industrial policies aiming at rapid expansion and diversification of the economy through large-scale domestic and foreign investments . Also , the crisis of the banking sector in Bangladesh is not conducive for private sector investment . There is a need for undertaking meaningful and effective remedial measures against the irregularities in the banking sector to enhance the confidence of the private sector . Furthermore , the tax system in Bangladesh is still a revenue-oriented tax policy , not a development-oriented tax policy , and thus it requires a major overhaul . <p> A number of supply-side constraints in the form of weak infrastructure and the high cost of doing business need to be addressed within a short time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foreign direct investment ( FDI ) even by LDC standards . In 2016 , the FDI share in GDP in Bangladesh was only 0.9 percent against the LDC average of 3.3 percent . Weak infrastructure and a poor business environment are critical problems for Bangladesh to overcome for attracting both domestic private investment and FDI . According to the 2019 Doing Business index of the World Bank , Bangladesh ranks 176th among 190 countries . In terms of sub-components of the Doing Business index , Bangladesh 's worst performances are observed in the areas of " enforcing contracts " , " getting electricity " and " registering property " . There is a need for rapid improvement in these areas . The initiatives taken by the Bangladesh government in setting up 100 special economic zones ( SEZ ) as well as the development of big infrastructural projects seem to address these issues . However , there is a need for faster and quality implementation of these projects , as delay in implementation , cost overrun , and sub-standard quality of projects are long-standing problems in Bangladesh which discourage private investment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the country discourage enhanced private investment in high valued and diversified sectors . Public spending on education and health as percentages of GDP in Bangladesh is among the lowest in the world . The country , therefore , needs to attach vital emphasis on improving the existing low level of human capital by enhancing investment on education , skill development , and health facilities . <p> Dr Selim Raihan is Professor , Department of Economics , University of Dhaka , Bangladesh , and Executive Director , South Asian Network on Economic Modeling ( SANEM ) .

@@30235239 <h> Why the RMG industry needs to invest in its workers <p> The Bangladesh economy is growing at an extremely healthy rate . According to the latest figures form the Asian Development Bank ( ADB ) , Bangladesh is expected to post a growth rate of 7.5 percent in 2018-19 , and the ready-made garment industry will be a key engine driver behind that growth . <p> The industry has ambitious plans to expand in the coming years , with a target of USD 50 billion in exports on the horizon . We expect this target to be met , but there will be many challenges along the way . One of the biggest challenges we face is development of the people . <p> Like any growing economy , there comes a point where we have to begin truly developing our most valuable asset -- and that is our human resources . Bangladesh will soon graduate to a middle-income country as it begins the next stage of its economic journey . Our people , their skills and the way employees are nurtured and developed will be integral to the success of our economy . <p> Looking at the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you will find excellent people development programmes in place . That is no coincidence . Employees who are treated well by their employers , who are given good training , and who are provided with proper employee benefits are happier and more productive . <p> Various research studies on this issue have found that happy employees are up to 20 percent more productive than unhappy employees . Imagine adding that to the bottom line in our industry ! All our factory owners should be asking themselves , are my employees happy ? Am I fostering a happy -- and productive -- working environment ? <p> What makes a happy employee ? Again , summarising from the research here , it is about feeling like you matter , feeling that what you do as an employee has an impact on the workplace , and feeling that you are making progress in terms of your personal development in terms of a career path . <p> Now , readers might think that our RMG factories can not be like the large blue-chip organisations of this world with their extensive people development programmes in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not ? When it comes to looking after people , leading international blue-chip companies are the benchmark . These are what us , as RMG factory owners , need to be aspiring to . <p> We know that in the RMG industry , workers , many of them women , still work in challenging conditions . This is not just the case in Bangladesh -- this is an issue in every garment manufacturing country in the world . Factory work of all kinds can be monotonous and gruelling , and when a large order comes in , workers may come under pressure to get the order out on time . Western brands can be demanding . <p> There is a concern that , against such a backdrop , we are in danger of losing valuable workers to the industry . Last year a major study was jointly carried out by Bangladesh Institute of Development Studies ( BIDS ) and the Ministry of Finance which suggested the country is facing serious skill shortages in its RMG sector due it its ongoing growth . This problem will become even worse if , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ production from the downsizing of China 's textile industry . <p> In our industry many expatriates work in managerial positions . Why can not we be training and developing these people ourselves ? Ours is now a mature industry , the second largest manufacturing exporter in the world . We should be able to produce the managerial talent from within , and the only way to do that is to cherish and promote people from the factory floor . <p> Governments such as those in Bangladesh also have a key part to play here . We need a nationally coordinated skills and training policy which adapts to the future needs of our industry and provides the managerial skills and technical knowledge to take our industry forwards . <p> However , I believe we as factory owners have the most important role in the skills and training challenge .

@@30235240 <h> US Midterm Elections 2018 <h> Between a House and a Senate : Can a truce be in the offing ? <p> People react to live results while attending a midterm election night party hosted by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee on November 6 , 2018 in Washington , DC . Photo : BRENDAN SMIALOWSKI/AFP <p> As one of the most talked about and , perhaps , controversial US Midterm Elections comes to an end , the US , as a nation , remains where it was before the election started . That is , at a crossroads , where the only good outcome would be for the two parties -- Democrats and Republicans -- to come together , talk to each other , and figure out how best to move forward as a nation through compromises from both sides . And by that I am not just referring to the politicians ; supporters of the two major political parties , too , must be willing to build a bridge between them at a time when the country seems divided on a number of issues and quite passionately at that . <p> Of course , when it comes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ universally the worst candidates for the job . Already we 've heard politicians at the highest levels of both parties claiming victory for their sides while vehemently attacking the other -- forgetting the concept of being humble in victory altogether . Although , in all fairness , what they are actually doing is failing to be gracious in defeat as , looking at the election results , neither side can truly claim to have been victorious . <p> However , the fact that record numbers of people turned out to vote could be seen as a sign which reflects Americans ' belief that their votes do matter and that their democracy is working -- after the entire Russian collusion and election interference saga during and after the 2016 Presidential Elections . <p> Which is another reason why , perhaps unsurprisingly , at the centre of nearly every narrative surrounding the midterm elections was US President Donald Trump . That is why , perhaps , it is surprising to learn that the Republicans under him actually did better than nearly all past incumbents in the US , with their biggest achievement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with an incumbent president , which has only been done five times in the last 105 years . <p> If we look at the performance of past presidents going as far back as Reagan , Trump by far seems to have the best record : Reagan lost 26 House seats and neither gained nor lost any Senate seat ; HW Bush lost 8 House seats and one Senate seat ; Bill Clinton lost 54 House seats and 9 Senate seats in his first term and won 5 House seats and neither gained nor lost any Senate seats in his second term ; W Bush won 8 House seats and one Senate seat in his first term and lost 30 House seats and 6 Senate seats in his second term ; Obama lost 63 House seats and 6 Senate seats in his first term and lost a further 13 House seats and 9 Senate seats in his second term . Compared to those numbers , Trump ( at the time of writing this article ) gained at least two Senate seats and lost at least 26 House seats . Taking the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 51 and House seats to at least 199 , while the Democrats won at least 45 Senate seats and at least 222 House seats . <p> Despite these impressive figures , the Democrats regaining House majority will surely put a dent to the Republicans winning the Senate majority and to the " Trump Agenda " . These include increased difficulties to finance the building of " the wall " that Trump often talks about , getting changes in immigration and government spending cuts proposed by the Republicans through the House . And , most likely , will make it impossible for the Republicans to implement its Obamacare replacement plan . <p> If we look at the Democratic side of the aisle , the top two agendas on the Democrats ' wish list -- impeaching President Trump and Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh -- are now all but impossible as that would require a two-thirds Senate majority which they do n't have . <p> So where does that leave the two parties ? Seemingly at a deadlock -- back to square one , as I mentioned at the start . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep his promises " to his voters as Trump keeps repeating , he must get his party to work with the Democrats . Even though that may be a difficult pill to swallow given the current animosity between the two parties , the good news is that , there are no other alternatives . <p> And the same applies for the Democrats . Even though they are stuck with Trump as president , much to their revulsion , the fact of the matter is that they , too , have made a number of promises to their voters which they would be wise to at least slowly work on prior to the next Presidential Elections . And that means they also have no other option but to work with the Republicans . <p> What does that mean for the US going forward ? It means that the two parties can either continue to hold onto their uncompromising positions , as is the case in most dysfunctional democracies around the world or , it could take a lesson from its own people , who turned out in record numbers to vote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ democracy , and make certain compromises that are necessary to get policies that are good for the nation and its people through . <p> That is the reality -- which has a kind of an ironic twist to it . <p> At a time when democracies around the world are faltering , this deadlock provides the US with another chance to demonstrate to the world how a true democracy should function . Thus , this is the perfect time for both parties to recall what a past giant of the Democratic Party , John F Kennedy , had said , " Let us not seek the Republican answer or the Democratic answer , but the right answer . Let us not seek to fix the blame for the past . Let us accept our own responsibility for the future . " <p> With the whole world watching , the US should realise it now has the opportunity to again work towards becoming a shining example of democracy for the world , as it once was , keeping in mind what one great leader of the Republican Party , Ronald Reagan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power , to begin the world over again .

@@30272234 <h> A true superhero <p> In the early 1940s , Timely Comics , the earliest comic book arm of publisher Martin Goodman , had encountered an individual that would change the way the world looked at fictional characters and comic books . Initially , this particular individual was hired as an office assistant , but within a year 's time , became the interim editor to the company . In the early 1960s , he had the opportunity to create a series that could compete toe to toe with DC Comic 's Justice League of America series and in a year 's time , the Fantastic Four was introduced to the world . But the journey did n't stop there . Soon enough came a series of characters that took readers by storm ; Doctor Strange , Daredevil , X-Men , Iron Man , Thor -- the list goes on . All the superheroes that get our blood pumping came from one creator , Stanley Martin Lieber , more famously known as Stan Lee . <p> It might seem as though Lee had only paved the way for Timely Comics ( now known as Marvel Comics ) , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lee would recall his experience with the Comic Code 's inflexibility , and how it stood in the way of using comic books to attack contemporary issues of that time . For one example , an issue of Spider-Man ( which has to be one of Lee 's most adored characters of all time ) in the 1970s portrayed the then current drug abuse situation . Despite the portrayal of drug abuse being negative and sending a substantial message , it was not approved by the authorities . Since then , Lee realised that this authority had to be opposed in order to loosen their codes , if these strict codes were still in play to this day , we would never have seen iconic characters such as the Joker and Harley . Moreover , we would not have comics reflecting the present day status quos . Safe to say , his stances were an impactful success . <p> I 've never really been a fan of the Marvel comics or movies . Nor have I really indulged in the stories as much as I did when it came to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lee 's contribution . Speaking for myself , I love the X-men . The animated series and comics reminded me of one thing constantly , that there is a place for everyone , even if you are weird , small , huge or strong ; there will be people to accept and help you . As an added bonus , when things do go south , there will always be a way to combat the situation , and if you allow it , you do not have to face it alone . I owe it to him for shaping such a wonderful fictional world in which , many , just like me , found not only their own voice , but also something to look forward to and believe in . That is why Stan Lee will always be legendary , not only in the comic realm , but in the real world too , immortally etched into many of our hearts . I wholeheartedly must apologise for not appreciating him more when he was still amongst us . <p> As Lee had once said , Spider-Man is " a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fears , and frustrations that haunt us all . " This single quote tells you that superheroes are n't just about fighting bad guys in capes and masks , but also about us . Our hopes and dreams and nightmares . If we look closely , we find our journeys amongst these heroes , among the creations of Stan Lee . These contributions he made to us , to the world of comics , is something we can never pay back for . All we wish now is that his superpower were immortality , or that Thanos could use the Time Stone to take us all back in the presence of his creator . Moving forward , catching a cameo of Stan Lee himself in Marvel movies will be a reminder of not just the legacy he left behind , but a bittersweet feeling of knowing that he no longer is among us.

Amplifying youth voices and empowering youth leaders : Youth : Recent progress in expanding access to ART for adults and significantly reducing the number of children born with HIV has obscured stagnation in the response for children and adolescents adolescents are the only age group for whom AIDS-related deaths are increasing . Falling through the cracks between paediatric and adult services , young people must contend with a lack of services tailored to their specific needs . The impact of the epidemic is felt particularly acutely by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HIV infections among adolescents in Asia , an estimated 95% occur among men who have sex with men , sex workers , and people who inject drug . In sub-Saharan Africa , adolescent girls account for 75% of new HIV infections among adolescents . The voices of youth are frequently stifled , and young people are not as meaningfully involved as they should be in the policy discussions that directly affect them . To improve the AIDS response for youth , their voices must be heard and listened to every step of the way from research , to policy , to programme implementation . The right to health is the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health , as enshrined in the 1966 International Covenant on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights . This includes the right of everyone including people living with and affected by HIV , to the prevention and treatment of ill health , to make decisions about ones own health and to be treated with respect and dignity and without discrimination . Everyone , regardless of who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to health , which is also dependent on adequate sanitation and housing , nutritious food , healthy working conditions and access to justice . The right to health is supported by , and linked to , a wider set of rights . Without the conditions to ensure access to justice , the right to a clean environment , the right to be free from violence or the right to education , for example , we can not fulfill our right to health . Ending AIDS as a public health threat can only happen if these rights are placed at the centre of global health , so that quality health care is available and accessible for everyone and leaves no one behind . The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development reflects the interdependence and complexity of a changing world and the imperative for global collective action . In shifting from so-called development for the poorest countries to sustainable development for all , the global agenda has expanded in scope and complexity . As a set of indivisible goals , the SDGs give all stakeholders a mandate for integration of efforts . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be ended without addressing the determinants of health and vulnerability , and the holistic needs of people at risk of and living with HIV . People living with HIV often live in fragile communities , and are most affected by discrimination , inequality and instability . Their concerns must be at the forefront of sustainable development efforts . By extension , lessons learned from the multisectoral , multi-stakeholder AIDS response are key to progress across the SDGs . The AIDS response has advanced such issues as the right to health , gender equality , health information systems , service delivery platforms , commodity access and security and social protection . The response has garnered substantial experience in addressing entrenched social norms , social exclusion and legal barriers that undermine health and development outcomes , and its investment approach is increasingly being adopted to accelerate gains across global health and development . The AIDS response can be a leader in leveraging strategic intersections with the Sustainable Development Goals ( SDGs ) , while disseminating lessons learned from three decades of unprecedented progress . -Civil society activists , working closely with researchers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ research and accelerated access to new medicines . This enabled new medicines and combinations to get to patients faster than ever before . Pressure from the global AIDS movement also ensured that the prices of new medicines were rapidly brought down to make them affordable to almost every country in the world . States should adhere to the following basic human rights obligations : ( 1 ) Respect : refrain from interfering with a persons ability to fulfill their right to health ( 2 ) Protect : act to prevent third parties from interfering with a persons ability to fulfill their right to health ( 3 ) Fulfill : adopt appropriate legislative , administrative , budgetary , judicial , promotional and other measures to enable everyone to fully realize their right to health and put measures in place to actively inform and promote the fulfillment of the right to health ( 4 ) Almost all of the Sustainable Development Goals are linked some way to health(5) Achieving the Sustainable Development Goals , including ending AIDS as a public health threat , will depend heavily on ensuring the right to health @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rights at the centre of global health can quality health care be available and accessible for everyone , leaving no one behind .

@@30371233 <h> International Migrants Day <h> The voices of women migrants <h> The GCM is a significant milestone in global efforts to comprehensively address the needs of migrant workers , especially women . But to make the most of it we must listen more closely to the real experts -- those women themselves . <p> A migrant disembarks from a coast guard vessel in the Sicilian harbour of Augusta in February 2017 . The sea route between Libya and Italy had become the main crossing point for many asylum seekers and economic migrants seeking a better life in Europe , after a clampdown on crossings from Turkey . PHOTO : ANTONIO PARRINELLO/REUTERS <p> UN Member States gathered in Morocco on December 10-11 to adopt the Global Compact for Migration ( GCM ) . The GCM is the first intergovernmental agreement to cover all dimensions of international migration . It promises to improve the lives of the world 's 258 million migrants , their families and communities . <p> Almost half of the world 's migrants are women and although both men and women migrate , it is not a gender-neutral phenomenon . Some countries place bans and restrictions on migration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ require the permission of a male relative . Women may also lack access to the information on migration and recruitment that they need to make empowered decisions and manage the risks . <p> Women are too often pushed into low-paid , undervalued work , whether on assembly lines in manufacturing or as domestic workers in private homes , often based on their gender . This not only restricts their employment opportunities , but also increases their exposure to gender-specific risks . Domestic workers , isolated in employers ' homes , may face physical and sexual abuse , food and sleep deprivation , low wages and excessive working hours . <p> The text of the GCM addresses these and other gender-specific challenges . But its provisions only open the door for change.To make those changes a reality on the ground , we must ensure the implementation of the GCM is gender-responsive at every step of the way . <p> A review driven by those concerned <p> Gender-responsiveness is one of the explicit guiding principles of the GCM . This includes promoting gender equality and the empowerment of all women and girls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lens of victimhood . <p> This also means recognising migrant women 's independence , agency and leadership . This must not be limited to migration itself ; as governments across the region prepare to implement the GCM , the voices of the women affected must also be front-and-centre of the upcoming processes to develop and review the next generation of labour migration policies . <p> Transforming migration so it works for all requires full participation across society , including women migrant workers , their employers and recruitment agencies . Only when migrant women are embedded in and empowered by these processes can we be sure migration policies are gender-responsive . Civil society organisations , trade unions and local officials can offer critical insights into issues like removing gendered barriers to accessing decent work at home and abroad , health care , skills training and justice . <p> When policy reviews do n't include women , they too often get it wrong . For example , in some countries , restrictions and bans on women 's migration are in place . These were introduced to protect women from exploitation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we found this did n't stop migration at all -- it just meant that more were using unlicensed brokers and irregular channels to migrate instead . This places women at even greater risk of high debts , trafficking , forced labour and exploitation . Worse still , it meant that when things went wrong , women could n't seek justice . <p> Policies that include women work better for women . Consulting social partners , civil society organisations , women migrants and their representatives does more than just ensure women migrants ' on-the-ground reality is reflected in policies . It also brings the community of stakeholders on board from the start . This makes for effective implementation and subsequent monitoring . <p> Early movers <p> There are initiatives already underway in our region to protect the rights of women migrant workers . These early movers hold valuable lessons for others as the GCM is endorsed . <p> In Bangladesh , the 2016 Expatriates ' Welfare and Overseas Employment Policy includes a standalone directive on women 's migration .

In the Philippines , we brought together five government agencies , 23 civil society organisations and experts from international organisations and academia in early November to draw up national-level priorities to realise a gender-responsive GCM . The actions identified are a real opportunity to invest meaningfully in the participation of women migrant workers in decisions that affect their lives . <p> The GCM is an essential starting point for the next chapter in international cooperation on migration , and an historic opportunity .

We strongly urge the Malaysian government to not go through with this proposal which would make all foreign workers , including Bangladeshis , more vulnerable and more at risk of being exploited by employers .

@@30393237 <p> It is election season in India and it is raining sops for farmers , the most key segment of the electorate , in the form of farm loan waivers running into thousands of crores of Rupees . India remains a predominantly agrarian country despite the hoopla about the rising status of its manufacturing and services sectors and its technology prowess . With fresh parliamentary polls due in April next year , governments of all ideological hues in different states are racing against time to roll out loan waivers to farmers before the ban on this goes into force once the Election Commission announces the poll schedule expected in February or March . Politics of competitive populism has taken over and economic prudence has taken the back seat . <p> Undoubtedly , the farm sector in India has been in a crisis for several years now with prices of farm produce declining , bumper harvests , poor marketing mechanism and drought and deficient rains in many parts of the country , leading to suicide by small and marginal farmers over the years . The most immediate trigger to the loan waiver fee was provided by the Congress Party 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the three key heartland states of Madhya Pradesh , Chhattisgarh and Rajasthan and announcement of the decision to waive farm loans within hours of installation of its government there . It was not merely the Congress Party 's fulfilment of a poll promise that was largely seen as the main reason for its victory in those states but also a clear signal to the farming community in the run up to the national elections . After all , the Congress was not oblivious of the fact that it was a similar farm loan waiver promise which had brought the party back to power in general elections in 2009 thwarting the BJP and ensured a second consecutive term for Manmohan Singh as prime minister . A day after the Congress government 's loan waivers in the three heartland states , the BJP dispensations in Assam and Gujarat also waived farmers ' loans and pending electricity bills . <p> Assam and Gujarat are the latest addition to an already long list of states including Tamil Nadu , Maharahstra , Uttar Pradesh , Andhra Pradesh , Karnataka , Punjab , Telangana , Jammu @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loan waivers . There is intense speculation that such waivers are on the cards in some more states like Odisha and Haryana where assembly polls are due in 2019 . And if that happens , it is estimated that the cumulative loan waiver would be to the tune of thousands of crore . This will finally strain the public exchequer of the state and the federal governments which reimburse the banks the waived loans of farmers . What is of greater concern that governments will have to mobilise funds for loan waivers by cutting down on spending in welfare schemes in other sectors of the economy . <p> The questions thrown up by the rush for farm loan waivers is how economically sustainable it is for the finances of the states and federal governments and if the time has not come to look for permanent solution to the crisis in the agricultural sector . Leading economists have questioned the waiver schemes contending that it is not a lasting cure to the farm crisis and provides just a temporary relief to the stressed farmers . This is recognised by Congress Party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the day Rahul announced the farm loan waivers by his party governments in Madhya Pradesh , Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh , he also affirmed that such a step can not be a permanent solution to the farm sector crisis . What Rahul 's actions and words reflected is the gap between the short-term imperatives of winning elections and a long-term view of the problem . <p> What is more worrying is that even seven decades after independence , Indian farmers remain trapped in the cycle of debt . This underlines the urgency for a long-term solution that addresses the issues of falling prices of agricultural produce , marketing bottlenecks and bank credit for all farmers irrespective of the size of their land-holdings . According to most economists , only rich farmers -- a very limited section of the overall farming community -- benefit by loan waivers primarily due to their access to institutional ( commercial and rural cooperative banks ) credit and political connections and poorer farmers are left high and dry . <p> An important factor for the agrarian distress has been the terms of trade for farmers to sell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the government 's bid to fight food inflation . Almost every time domestic prices of food-grains go up , the government clamps down on their export to ensure their abundant availability at home .

Economists feel this knee-jerk switch-on and switch-off policy constitutes a temporary measure rather than a long-term cure by ensuring the farmers get more from what consumers pay for their produce . <p> Secondly , economists say loan waiver tends to undermine honest credit culture of banks which tend to be reluctant to give loans to farmers . The hardest hit by such reluctance are small and marginal farmers without the requisite political pulls . Thirdly , loan waiver does not necessarily ensure that farmers are freed from debt-burden . Loan waiver is like a pain-killer medicine without taking care of the fundamental structural reforms the agricultural sector needs .

The Teesta Shishu Dal ( TSD ) is part of a larger platform funded by Plan International Bangladesh . These girls are conducting the campaign and attitudes are slowly beginning to change in the community . Although three girls of the TSD were secretly married off by their parents , incidences of child marriage have begun to decrease in Char Sinduma . <p> Though child marriage is illegal , the practice is widely prevalent in rural areas , particularly areas that are remote like the char lands . What TSD has shown us is that change must be initiated from within the community and age-old attitudes can be changed gradually . This is certainly a practice that can and should be replicated on a bigger scale to help fight child marriage nationwide . 
@@30393240 <h> Editorial <h> How the economy performed in 2018 <h> Stability in the financial sector main worry <p> This paper recently carried out an opinion poll to get a sense of what went right and what did n't in 2018 . Respondents included some 37 prominent businessmen , the presidents of four leading trade bodies , CEOs of banks , non-financial banking institutions , insurance companies ; economists and researchers . The positives included some major growth drivers : exports , public spending on infrastructure , remittance and agriculture . Sixty-two percent of respondents pointed out that robust export ( 62.8 percent ) propelled the economy forward in 2018 . Inward remittance grew a healthy 32.43 percent and increase in public spending on infrastructure was significant at 54.05 percent . The overall political stability in the country helped move the economy forward , but it could have done much better if nagging bottlenecks could be addressed . <p> Principal among these are a lack of good governance , the high cost of doing business , low domestic investment , and container congestion at Chittagong port . Bangladesh has , unfortunately , been consistently scoring low scores in the cost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if we want more businesses ( both local and foreign ) to register companies . The bottleneck at Chittagong port has proved to be very stubborn because of a lack of policy initiative and the situation will pose a major challenge for the incoming government in 2019 , especially in light of the fact that neighbouring India has been granted transit rights at Chittagong port and the volume of container movement is set to rise significantly in the coming year . <p> Business community leaders hope that stability will remain in the post-election period and there is much concern about whether the next government will take concrete steps to bring back stability in the financial sector . Nearly 46 percent respondents are looking forward to a better business environment . Fewer respondents hoped for a stable energy supply , timely completion of mega projects that would help alleviate traffic congestion -- both of which could help put the economy on a much firmer footing in 2019.
