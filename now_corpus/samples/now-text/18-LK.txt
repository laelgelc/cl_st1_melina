Global linkages between countries through military conquest , colonization , multilateral free trade agreements and cultural exchange existed in an uninterrupted continuum in the evolving history of humankind . <p> Historically , however , the process of globalization has taken different forms and its meaning has changed and mutated since it was first used in English in the 1930s . <p> For lack of a better word , the term received an extension to its lifeline until the end of the 20th century despite the profound structural changes and technological advances that began to take place in the 1980s . <p> Therefore , globalization has come to be used to represent ' modern ' 20th century economics and social processes , including the instant exchange of money enabled by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use , it does not truly reflect the electronic and digital empowerment that has been unleashed by the information technology revolution . <p> Therefore , globalization is not an accurate descriptor of the 21st century and the Internet-driven transformational change sweeping the international economic landscape . <p> And so I have coined the term Internetization , which I believe should replace the concept of globalization . <p> Internetization : Time , geography are irrelevant Internetization is the contemporary face of globalization . It includes the modern tools of electronic globalization and embraces the digital connectivity and empowerment of the Internet and World Wide Web . <p> Although we could widen the term globalization to include Internetization , I believe it is better to replace the word globalization altogether because the long duration of its usage has given birth to evolving definitions and the creation of a plethora of different nuances . <p> If we embrace this new term , Internetization , within our modern economic vocabulary , it will permit a more accurate description of the engine which drives our new 21st-century global economy .

Time and geography are irrelevant . Communications have sped up and reduced the time required for connectivity to nanoseconds . Geographical boundaries have melted and become increasingly more porous and insignificant in terms of social , economic and political outreach . <p> The new economy is built on a culture of innovation and an emphasis on creativity .

@@22531232 <h> President Maithripala Sirisena 's opportunity ahead in 2018 <p> 2018-01-02 12:18:40 <p> 0 <p> 301 <p> January 8 , 2018 will mark three years since Maithripala Sirisena was elected as the Sri Lankan President , after defecting from the cabinet of his predecessor , Mahinda Rajapaksa . <p> He is the first president to hail from the North Central Province . He is an agriculturist by vocation . He joined mainstream politics in 1989 as an MP and has held several ministries since 1994 . He was General-Secretary of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party ( SLFP ) and Health Minister until November 2014 when he announced his candidacy for the 2015 presidential election . <p> After being sworn in , Sirisena stated that he would only serve one term . On April 28 , 2015 , Sirisena voluntarily transferred significant presidential powers to parliament unlike any other president before . Sirisena 's simplicity has certainly won the support of many people and put all the politicians in the country under pressure to follow his example . <p> Unlike most of his ministers , he himself takes his phone calls and returns his calls . Leo Tolstoy , once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no simplicity . " Sirisena is certainly a humble man with a very strong resolve , a very refreshing change for the country . <p> Three years into his term while democracy has got strengthened , there has hardly been any meaningful reform . His fourth year in office will start on January 8 , 2018 with strong evidence of the president getting ready to play a bigger role in the government and will no longer allow political scoundrels past and present to cut deals with the government to abscond their place at Welikada . <p> His dreams of a new bipartisan era have given way to a new political order . To the vast majority in the country , his government often sounds very offhandish and removed from reality . Therefore , the president needs to act fast to push through the reform agenda he promised in January 2015 . If he fails to provide leadership to push through the reform agenda , the opposition politicians like Mahinda Rajapaksa will invariably succeed in brainwashing the gullible . <p> Move into 2018 Therefore , as we move into 2018 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ election for the SLFP . Some politicians are making an attempt to portray the current election as one that would be consequential in shifting the fundamental thinking of the masses towards a sea change in public perception . This wishful thinking is bordering on being overly optimistic at best and delusional at worst . <p> This government , made up of the United National Party ( UNP ) and Sirisena 's SLFP , too would not alter that political truism . When in power , the psyche of political parties is totally different from that when they are out of power . Given the current political situation , it wo n't be a surprise according to political analysts , if the UNP comes out as the winning party , despite a poor voter turnout . <p> Most Pradesheeya Sabhas and Municipal Councils are not yet decided on who should be second and third . There seems to be great uncertainty about that . However , conventional wisdom dictates that it would be quite hard to beat a well-established party like the SLFP whose leader is the president , who was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the SLFP and an overwhelming majority of the Tamil and Muslim minorities . <p> The SLFP most likely should still be having its rural party structures intact . In which case , it will be an extraordinary task for any political entity , whether led by Rajapaksa or his three siblings , to relegate the SLFP to a subordinate position from a totally new party like the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna ( SLPP ) -- very similar to the Democratic United National Front ( DUNF ) story in 1993 . But certainly they know their game . <p> Political reconciliation However , for the government of Sri Lanka , there is the challenge of resettlement and reconciliation . But neither of these can be seen in just the political context or in the limited framing of ethnic harmony . They are both related to a process of democratization , a political settlement and also good governance . <p> On the other hand , good governance is not an abstract principle but a practice . Also , it will not be too long before Sri Lanka learns if its ' yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' on the ' status of Jerusalem ' resolution would have repercussions . <p> The next session of US-Sri Lanka Trade and Investment Framework Agreement ( TIFA ) Council scheduled in Washington is but a few months away . The US could also take an even more aggressive stance against Sri Lanka at the UNHRC in Geneva . But for sure after the conclusion of the local government elections , a new window of opportunity will open for reconciliation , therefore , it is a priority , as it is wanted , needed and has the acceptance of the people . <p> Constitutional reforms The proposed constitutional reforms will not be endorsed by an electorate that is deeply sceptical of its leaders . During the decades of war , the problem in Sri Lanka was construed as an ethnic problem . Indeed , the political problems of Lanka can not be limited to one of ethnicity . The most serious challenge in Sri Lanka has been a problem of democratization . <p> Social exclusion also follows a lack of a balanced democracy . Democratization needs to distance itself from excesses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ democracy in Sri Lanka . A process of political reconciliation centred on democratization would have to involve reforming the state through a new constitution that allows for the devolution of power to the regions with power-sharing at the centre . <p> It would have to advance the devolution debate in ways to address class , caste , gender and rural-urban divide . There needs to be substantive demilitarization involving not only demobilization and reduction of the size of the military . This is not easy to accomplish and strategies have to be planned for absorbing the demobbed forces into civil society through adult education programmes as well as skill training . <p> Thus , political reconciliation can not just be about humanitarian issues and ethnic harmony . Nor can it be limited to a narrow vision of reconstruction and economic development . Rather it has to take seriously the challenges of democratization and a political settlement . <p> Such political reconciliation will not be possible without constructive debate and the free expression of opinion that challenges the Sri Lankan state and the ruling regime and the implementation of our national @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more popular in the electorate . <p> In this backdrop , the president must engage and understand the problems of the underprivileged and promote political reconciliation and help all communities to work together as one nation to ensure that as a country we can realize our full potential . On the other hand , the future of Sri Lanka 's economic health will largely depend on political stability , technocratic efficiency , return to genuine peace , good governance and continued policy reforms -- particularly in the area of fiscal discipline and management .

Criticism against President and her government it said was swelling in frequency and tempo and Richard Howitt and Robert Evans , two MEPs who visited Sri Lanka recently , without mincing words accused the Sri Lankan government " of not doing enough to protect civilians caught up in the war against Tamil Tiger rebels and is covering up their suffering . " They compared the plight of the displaced Tamil people in and around the conflict zone with those of Sierra Leone and Chechnya the website said . It said earlier the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they met Tamil civilians displaced by fighting in the northern Jaffna peninsula and Vanni . The two MEPs directed their harshest criticism against the government for implementing an oppressive press-censorship policy and of not allowing essential supplies , including baby food and medicine , to be distributed in areas controlled by the Tamil Tigers . <p> Writing further the website said that Mr.Evans , a member of the Parliament 's South Asia delegation , said that President Kumaratunga 's proposals to end the civil war would not work unless she sat down and negotiated with the Tamil Tigers . The website also stated that before the diplomatic and political ripples raised by the MEPs could die down came hot on the heels a report by Amnesty International ( AI ) . It said that in a hard hitting report dated July 20 , 2000 , the human rights watchdog AI slammed the Sri Lankan government for continued violation of the rights of the Tamil detainees arrested under the emergency regulations . The Amnesty International said that it has received reports of at least 540 cases of " disappearance " since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the new emergency regulations was presented by the government as part of a package of measures to put the country on a " war footing " . Other measures included the suspension of all non-essential development activities for three months and the acquisition of sophisticated arms from abroad . <p> The government also depreciated the rupee as much as 6% , the first in 22 years , and the Central Bank linked the one-stroke depreciation to the ballooning defence expenditure . <p> The sharp depreciation followed a 14 percent drop in Sri Lanka 's foreign reserves to 1.40 billion dollars at the end of May compared to 1.64 billion dollars at the end of the previous year . There was a further drain on the foreign reserves as the government announced in May that it hoped to spend an additional 175 million dollars to buy urgently needed military hardware .

On 19th July the Mulaitivu camp fell killing 1,200 soldiers . They were not given instructions to attack . The air force and the navy were not sent in offensive missions to eliminate the Tamil Tigers . <p> They pointed out that to cover up the debacle , Chandrika administration launched Operation Sathjaya and later Operation Jayasikuru and both operations failed to weaken the LTTE to the point of surrender .

The militry analysts emphasized that it is absurd for Chandrika to claim any credit for war victory . <p> Having got defeated militarily Chandrika sought to pass her political package as a solution to the problem and allowed the Ceasefire Agreement ( CFA ) to be signed under her watch which is termed the greatest betrayal of modern times . <p> The Indian website Radiff.com rported on 23rd May , 2000 that upon a request made by Sri Lankan President Mrs. Chandrika Kumaratunga the Atal Bihari Vajpayee government is seriouslay considering evacuation of a large number of trapped Lankan troops amounting to more than 40,000 from Jaffna peninsula to the Indian shores .

But Speaker Karu Jayasuriya told Parliament that the Presidential Media Unit had informed him that copies of the report could be made available to parliamentarians only by January 17 . Therefore , the Speaker said he had given approval for the Prime Minister to make a statement on the issue .

Fortunately , in the galleries there were no schoolchildren to take the wrong lessons on how their elected representatives behaved . Parliament 's CCTV cameras had also been switched off when sitting were adjourned but some MPs , apparently with various personal agendas filmed the tumultuous scenes with their smart phone cameras and gave them to private TV channels which gave wide publicity on their night news telecast .

He did so comprehensively outlining case by case .

" <p> President Mahinda Rajapaksa after coming to power with a promise to abolish the Executive Presidency , going back on his words , strengthened the same Presidency through the 18th Amendment to the Constitution which also removed the limit of terms of presidency an individual can hold . However , when he was preparing for the election of his third term @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is no stranger to controversies opened a Pandora 's Box claiming that President Mahinda Rajapaksa was not eligible to run for a third term as President of the country . <p> Mr. Silva argues that when the 18thAmendment to the Constitution was introduced , President Rajapaksa had already been subjected to the previous law and was disqualified from contesting again , once he was elected for the second time . However , Rajapaksa did not take that contention seriously and ran unsuccessfully for the third time in January 2015 . It is doubtful whether Mr. Silva would apply his argument with regard to President Maithripala Sirisena 's case as well and claim that the President has received a mandate to rule the country for six years under the law in January , 2015 when he was elected to power . <p> The person declared elected as President at an election shall , if such person is not the President in office , hold office for a term of six years commencing on the date on which the result of such election is declared <p> All these controversies involving the previous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the question remains as to why President Sirisena has sought a determination on the expiry of his term of office at this juncture , two years before the issue inevitably comes up , despite the validity of the question he had raised . The decision of the date for the next Presidential election is not a responsibility of the President but an exclusively right of the Elections Commission , unless the President decides to hold it prematurely . Therefore he does not need to bother about it . <p> It is noteworthy that he has raised this issue at a time when an election is to be held countrywide and one might ask whether he was attempting to convey a message to the general voter with this request to the Supreme Court . <p> He had done so during the last Parliamentary election as well through his statements that badly affected the Mahinda Rajapaksa faction of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party ( SLFP ) . The message that he conveys now , as many surmise is that he was prepared to run for a second term . <p> He had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would not contest another Presidential election , but for the politicians keeping promises is not a must . He pledged that he would abolish the Executive Presidency and at the media conference where he announced his candidacy for the Presidential poll he went to the extent of vowing to hold a referendum , if need for that purpose . However , he did not take action to scrap the presidential system of governance during the " 100 day government " on the grounds that a referendum was needed for it . <p> Apart from the people 's hunger for power , the current political environment in Sri Lanka does not permit a President to retire from politics , even if he desires to do so , as it would imperil his personal as well as political life . Therefore it would not be surprising if President Sirisena announces his willingness to run for a second term . 
@@22699238 <h> Between " Laundromats " and a " Clean house " <p> Some appreciated the work of the PCoI and the stand taken by President Sirisena against corruption <p> Forty years with a free market economy , the urban middle class think corruption can be wiped clean . They do n't understand the role of the State has completely changed <p> Corrupt State officials even use political pressure to avoid themselves being investigated into . They did say it with a veiled threat to President Sirisena at the very outset . <p> The Bond Scam Report is n't out in the public domain yet . It is supposed to be only in English too.The call for a parliamentary debate on it turned out a big farce . For now what is interpreted and played around is what media picked from President Sirisena 's pre-recorded Sinhala statement aired on TV channels . A carefully written Sinhala statement that tried to position him as a decent , non partisan national leader , yet tactfully noting PM Wickremesinghe 's responsibility and former Finance Minister Karunanayake 's complicity . <p> Interpretations in urban society on what was thus revealed are of two minds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the stand taken by President Sirisena against corruption . Some agreed with sarcasm throwing a jibe or two at President Sirisena . Those were few " pundits " who landed on the post January " anti Rajapaksa " dinning table and are comfortable with Wickremesinghe 's hectic liberalising of the economy . <p> None were real indicators of the dilemma the President was in , after his nuanced statement . In less than 24 hours , the website " Economy Next " said on 04 January afternoon , " President Maithripala Sirisena 's office has put out several versions of his bond commission statement in an apparent attempt to soften the blow to Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and his party . " <p> It then added , " The President 's website carried the first translation and later swapped it with the new version which was once again amended bringing back references to Ravi Karunanayake but without including Wickremesinghe 's name " . The next day , Minister Faizer Musthapha in a media intervention took pains in clearing PM Wickremesinghe of any wrong doing . <p> Appointment of Arjuna @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political deal . <p> The Bond scam is not just about the UNP and its elite leadership . The lame excuse that President Sirisena opposed the appointment of Arjuna Mahendran as Governor CB has no validity after he appointed Mahendran as Governor . Appointing Mahendran was more or less a political deal with PM Wickremesinghe to have a government the accepted and accommodated him . It is for that single reason he had Leader of the UNP and then leader of the Opposition Ranil Wickremesinghe , sworn in as PM an hour after he was sworn in as President on January 09 , 2015 . <p> After the presidential election , D.M. Jayaratne should have constitutionally continued as PM with no change of government . Wickremesinghe was not qualified to be sworn in as PM with only 47 MPs . The Constitution requires the President ensure he appoints as PM one who commands a majority in parliament which means a minimum of 113 MPs . The SLFP/UPFA government that was , would not have accommodated President Sirisena for betraying them . He therefore fished out the most rustic in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ led government . Appointment of Arjuna Mahendran as Governor CB was thus the cementing of that political deal . President Sirisena can not pretend he is innocent thereafter . <p> It means , it is not only politicians who are in tow with the politically powerful new rich <p> With this unprincipled coalition in government during the past 03 years , this single Bond scam is not just the " one and only " . There is yet another in April 2016 . There is also the unoccupied multi storey building leased for the Agriculture Ministry at 21 million rupees per month on a Cabinet paper by the PM . There are more by many high profile UNP Ministers that should be investigated . They are all about political deals no less corrupt than the Rajapaksas.The Russian warship deal and the Spectrum deal are two stinking deals that hold President Sirisena responsible . A warship was no priority when the Navy had 02 brand new warships provided by China and India.Yet President Sirisena 's Cabinet paper as Defence Minister to purchase this Russian warship on a re-negotiated Russian credit line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PM . The Spectrum deal , the sale of a frequency bundle was no different . Frequencies are " public property " . They can only be rented or leased for short terms , through public bidding . Why the UNP is mum on this deal said to be worth over Rs.03 billion and comes directly under the President , is also due to their political compromises to be in power . <p> These sordid deals do n't get washed clean if Bond scams under Rajapaksa from 2008 are investigated as demanded by PM . That would only say , " Rajapaksas were also corrupt like us " . End of the day " free market economies " do n't allow Commission Reports to topple their apple cart however accurate and complete the investigations could be . In free market economies , State Departments are not left " independent " . Run through this short , selected list for proof . AG who was summoned to parliament by the Speaker ruled that all hurried Amendments to the LG Elections Act at the third reading need only a 2/3 majority . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scam Report , the AG had been provided with the COPE Report one year ago . He is now given the Bond Scam Report by the President . Will he proceed on it as required ? Let 's keep counting days this 2018 too . Corrupt State officials even use political pressure to avoid themselves being investigated into . They did say it with a veiled threat to President Sirisena at the very outset . Bureaucrats have and they create big enough gaps to wriggle through in this very corrupt system . The prosecuting agency filed charges against top administrators Weeratunge , former Secretary to the President and TRC Chairman Pelpola , under Section 386 of the Penal Code avoiding the Public Property Act for misappropriation or misusing of public funds . Under the Public Property Act , misuse of public money is a non-bailable offence , but not under the Penal Code . The two were out on bail all through their case . State prosecuting agencies can opt to prosecute partners of the " filthy rich " with minimum or no damage , if they so wish . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only be rented or leased for short terms , through public bidding <p> There was speculation that Gotabhaya Rajapaksa , former Secretary to Ministry of Defence , would be arrested on misappropriation of public funds . The corrupt have many social allies in free market economies . Buddhist monks met with President Sirisena to request he should not be arrested . The Appeal Court allowed his anticipatory bail application and prevents the FCID from taking any legal action against him . The temporary stay order was extended for the third time on 15 December . That perhaps is an independent judiciary in a free market economy . <p> Yet , forty years with a free market economy , the urban middle class think corruption can be wiped clean . They do n't understand the role of the State has completely changed . The State is no more the regulator and monitor of economic activities . In a free market economy , the State is turned into a facilitator , promoter and also into a custodian of private investment . In Sri Lanka , investment as in all " developing " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ top bureaucracy thus sits with governments ( politicians ) to formulate policy and draft legislation that can encourage , promote , facilitate and safeguard shady investments with as much incentives as possible . <p> With the State re-positioned as facilitator , promoter and custodian of the new " filthy rich " , the theoretical definitions of the " State " and the " Government " are no more valid . They are now seen as one and the same . It means , it is not only politicians who are in tow with the politically powerful new rich . The State at policy and decision making level including of course , investigators , prosecutors and judicial officials are also tied to the powerful new rich . <p> It is therefore amending few laws and punishing a culprit or two that is now demanded as serious remedies by anti corruption groups in Colombo , including the JVP . <p> In short , in a free market economy that allows free growth of a new " filthy rich " , corruption becomes inherent at every level of governance and across State and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lifestyle on heavy consumption . The urban middle class that plays the " big consumer " is allowed unquestioned economic space to chase after a luxury life . Such " freedom " does not allow the urban middle class a need to think in terms of a cleaner , more cultured and amall inclusive national " development model " . That discussion instead is substituted with talks on " Reforms " to clean up the " mess " . Reforms that would not upset the ' status quo ' of their " expensive living " . <p> There thus is a serious absence of a discourse for alternatives in national terms on ever deepening crises that we live with . Instead we are left with very narrow , short term options for quick ' washing and drying ' of dirty politics . It is therefore amending few laws and punishing a culprit or two that is now demanded as serious remedies by anti corruption groups in Colombo , including the JVP . But , no one is questioning the competency and credibility of the present politicians . This politically illegitimate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in legislating better laws . There is also the unavoidable question , " will the investigating , prosecuting authorities including the AG 's Department and the judiciary be efficiently independent than what they are , if they are provided with new laws ? " Parliamentary debates on the Bond scam report will only be verbal duels and the call for indictment of the culprits , will be nothing more than what the old Sinhala idiom " asking the rogue 's mother to read the fate " ( fydrdf. w ? uf.ka fmak wykjd ) plainly say . Bond Scam Commissions , PRECIFACs , FCIDs and the rest are all about moving with " Laundromats " with different brand names . What we need is a paradigm shift that can provide a new and an alternate system " to keep the house permanently clean " without continuous visits to different " Laundromats " expecting better washing and drying . The discourse for a new development model with better systems needs to be kick started , before this society falls apart .

@@22826234 <h> Bitcoin : The past , present &amp; future of cryptocurrency <p> The term cryptocurrency still remains somewhat of an obscure term , with many being confused over its meaning . However , bitcoin , the cryptocurrency market giant , is a widely heard and popular term . Essentially cryptocurrency can be referred to as virtual money , a digital cash system that uses cryptography to protect the anonymity of transactions . While the basics of cryptocurrencies have already been covered by one of our previous articles , we can now take a more in-depth look at the world of digital money . <p> " Virtual currencies , perhaps most notably Bitcoin , have captured the imagination of some , struck fear among others , and confused the heck out of the rest of us . " <p> -- Thomas Carper , US Senator from Delaware -- <p> The main difference between Bitcoin and our conventional monetary system , however , is that it 's decentralized , with no central entity monitoring transactions . This , of course , raises one key issue . If there is no central authority , who will validate a transaction ? This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is blockchain and what does it do ? <p> Blockchain is the backbone of decentralized cryptocurrencies . It 's a process that allows the system to function without central authorities . In layman 's terms , it 's a public ledger where all confirmed transactions are recorded in a permanent and unalterable way . <p> To make things simple , blockchain is all about confirmation . Since there is no central authority to verify a transaction and state that it 's legal , the system simply asks all entities instead . This is why a typical bitcoin transaction can take up to one hour to be completed . Once a transaction is approved by all relevant parties , then the data is added to the public ledger aka the " blockchain " never to be changed again . <p> How blockchain works ( Image credits : blockgeeks ) <p> Who are these parties who approve transactions ? They are called miners , and they are the most important individuals in the cryptocurrency process . They spend their time going through transactions , checking their validity , labeling them as legit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for this process with a token of their cryptocurrency ( like bitcoin ) . This is how cryptocurrency is created , or " mined " . <p> The flipside of this mining is the enormous amount of energy being used . Bitcoin , in particular , uses up 4 Gigawatts of electricity , which is equal to 3 nuclear reactors . The carbon footprint this leaves is extremely heavy . This is more complicated by the fact that bitcoin mining gets harder and harder as more coins are mined , putting a strain on the environment . <h> How did this all start ? <p> In 1983 the American cryptographer David Chaum conceived an anonymous cryptographic electronic money called ecash . He implemented it in 1995 through digicash , which was a form of electronic payments that used user software and encryption keys in such a way that it was untraceable by the issuing bank and the government as well as any third party . <p> David Chaum of Digicash ( Image credits : Heywyre ) <p> In 2009 , the first decentralized cryptocurrency , bitcoin , was created by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know who he really is ) . Starting off transactions with pizza orders , bitcoin slowly gained popularity . In 2011 it was followed by Namecoin and then Litecoin , as well as several successors afterward . IOTA became the first cryptocurrency which disregarded the blockchain and instead used tangle . Nevertheless , none were able to usurp bitcoin from its dominant role in the digital currency market . <h> Popularity of crime : How bitcoin became the big boss <p> Ironically , the first major use bitcoin had was on the Silk Road ( for everyone recently coming out from under rocks , imagine the black market of the internet ) . A massive organization of underhand operations , Silk Road was finally taken down in 2013 with extreme difficulty with the collaboration of many agencies and departments . <p> One of the major reasons the Silk Road was so difficult to take down was the use of an anonymous payment system ; bitcoin . The Silk Road was formed in such a way that it could only be accessed by the Tor network , which hides user identities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , successfully preventing any digital identification . This combined with the encrypted decentralized network of bitcoin operations resulted in a seemingly invulnerable black market . <p> The Silk Road was named after the famed travel route ( Image credits : Central &amp; South Asia Business ) <p> In 2013 , with the cornering of Ross Ulbricht ( also known as Dread Pirate Roberts ) the founder and operator of the Silk Road , the black market came to an end . By then , however , the world had learned how easy it was to have anonymous operations digitally . Digital crime rose , with ransomware beginning to demand payments in bitcoins . The general market expanded as well , with many users finding bitcoin a safe and easy method for transactions . With that , the public rise of bitcoin began . <h> So where is it now ? <p> Bitcoin changes its value according to the user 's demand . With the popularity of bitcoins rising , it has risen dramatically ( and fallen dramatically several times as well ) since its introduction in 2009 . The problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Mark T Williams by 2014 bitcoin had a volatility seven times greater than gold . <p> Demand for bitcoin has risen , to the point that by last weekend , the 16.8th million bitcoin was mined by the bitcoin miners . Bitcoin has a capping limit of 21 million . This means 80% of all bitcoins have now been mined . Experts estimate that bitcoins will be capped somewhere around 2040 , but with the ever-fluctuating rates , we can never tell . <p> The changing value of bitcoin ( Image credits : Fortune ) <p> That being said , we can not deny ( looking at the above diagram ) that there have been more ups than downs for bitcoins . However , that is not to say that it 'll remain the same . Just last Tuesday ( Jan 16th 2018 ) bitcoin created mass chaos when the market price of a single bitcoin dropped down below $12k within 24 hours . <p> Considering that this is a six week low ( since December 5th 2017 ) this is even more reason to panic . It only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ further to $8000 which is 50% off the all-time high . This meant that the collective cryptocurrency market suddenly lost approximately $200 billion of its value . <p> The fluctuation is so much that during the course of writing this , it had to be edited more than 3 times to keep up with the volatile cyclone that is cryptocurrency . The reasons for the market 's sudden drop in value is still speculation . However , there are 2 or 3 main reasons we can theorize might be the biggest factors . <h> China and South Korea 's attitude <p> China , which houses the majority of the bitcoin mines in the world , recently announced its plans to shut down bitcoin miners . The primary reason being ( so they say ) , the excessive amount of energy needed for mining , which is reasonable . <p> However , China also has concerns about the risks of cryptocurrency , particularly involving security , and as a result , officials shut down cryptocurrency exchanges and banned fundraising through initial coin offerings ( ICOs ) . Recently it was reported @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ permit centralized trading . China 's strategy seems to be to stop all practices as opposed to stopping illicit practices . <p> South Korea , has expressed interest in following in China 's footsteps on the above matter and banning cryptocurrency exchange . Considering South Korea is one of the largest cryptocurrency markets in the world , this promises to send major ripples across the system if the Korean government does decide to implement such a law . <p> It speaks a lot about the volatility of the bitcoin that reports of possible bans by two governments sent the user base into a frenzy enough for bitcoin ( and other cryptocurrencies ) to drop at alarming rates within 24 hours . The estimated loss by all cryptocurrencies was roughly $40 million by Tuesday and has been dropping steadily since then . With rumors of possible updates from France and the US , we can likely expect this to get worse . <h> So is bitcoin the only viable cryptocurrency ? <p> Like every sector , bitcoin has its own competitors in the cryptocurrency world . They 're commonly referred to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be ; <h> Ripple <p> Ripple is a fast growing name in the cryptocurrency field , mainly due to its signature feature ; speed .

Ripple has had one of the fastest rises in the cryptocurrency community , with an ascension from basically nothing to one of the biggest contenders in the market in a very short time . <h> Ethereum <p> Bitcoin 's biggest competitor before Ripple 's unprecedented and unexpected rise , Ether currency was founded in 2014 by a Swiss nonprofit foundation called the Ethereum Foundation . While bitcoin uses blockchain to record transactions , Ethereum in addition to that allows users to build their own applications or use existing applications that use blockchain technology .

Zcash offers the option to make a transaction truly anonymous with a " hidden " option . What that means in even the blockchain ledger will have no record of the buyer , seller , or the amount transferred . Only the time the transaction took place will be in the records . While that sounds like a good deal , in reality only an estimated 10% of total transactions are hidden due to the extra time and computational power required to make that happen . <h> Stellar <p> Once again boasting a transaction speed of mere seconds , Stellar prides itself on starting at rock bottom ( initial market value being cents ) to rising at a rapid rate to become a viable competitor in the cryptocurrency market . What sets Stellar apart from the other altcurrencies in this list is that its fast timing applies to conventional money systems as well . Using Stellar you can convert Dollars to Euros in a second without relying on the cumbersome bank system . <h> Steem <p> One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the cryptocurrency market is using real-world money to acquire digital money . Steem is a solution to that problem . Steem is the underlying currency for steemit , a blockchain based social media platform . Users can earn money by posting original content , and the best part is that it can be converted into bitcoins later . Once converted into bitcoins , a user has access to any number of altcurrencies they want . <h> So what can we expect this year ? <p> There are several breakthroughs in blockchain technology the past year , the most notable of which is Oracle 's cloud-based blockchain service launching in October 2017 . The rise of blockchain technology has sparked interest in a few other sectors we can expect developments from , a few being ; <p> Cybersecurity <p> Finance <p> Insurance <p> Automation <p> However , it should be noted that while blockchain technology has a lot of potential applications , it remains largely untapped , and will remain untapped if the most we do is introduce Luna dating service , which finds you connections via block chaining or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own country , we can see a fast-growing cryptocurrency market . Currently , it 's mostly involved in trading , but there are a lot of enthusiasts and hardcore investors who are very active in the field . The best example for this is their facebook group . <p> In addition , if China and South Korea go through with banning cryptocurrency exchange , we will be seeing a drastic exchange in the markets , as well as a few companies migrating to new countries or closing down since China is cutting down on the mining process . All in all , it 's safe to say that we can expect a very interesting year ahead . <h> Event Details <p> What kicked off in 2011 as a friendly gaming event has now developed into a fully-fledged gaming tournament .

Finally came the British rule in 1796 that lasted until 1948 . <p> It was the British who unified the Island under a single administration in 1833 .

Completing 70 years of freedom is indeed a significant milepost . Independent Sri Lanka , or Ceylon , has faced many challenges and problems in the past 70 years . We have had military coup attempts , communal riots , pogroms , armed revolts , external military intervention , assassinations of Heads of State , terrorist violence and above all a long secessionist war that threatened to tear apart the country . <p> What Sri Lanka can be proud of as Asia 's oldest democracy is the fact that despite many formidable challenges and crises the country continues to be democratic . Flawed but Democratic ! More importantly , perhaps Independent Ceylon/Sri Lanka has succeeded tremendously in improving the quality of life for her people in areas such as education , higher education , healthcare , nutrition , infant mortality , life expectancy , family planning , rural electrification , roads , transport facilities , housing and worker rights . <p> An illustrative example of the progress made would be life expectancy .

Had our post-independence governments ruled wisely , Sri Lanka could have been an economic power in Asia . Our political class -selfish and short-sighted - has through various acts of omission and commission reduced the country to a sorry state . Looking at the prevailing political situation of today , it appears that no effective lessons have been learnt even after seven decades of independence . <p> An example of the progress would be life expectancy . When Independence dawned life expectancy for a male was 46 years and 44 for a female . After 70 years , it has risen to 72 and 78 years for a female . <p> As stated earlier Sri Lanka has certainly progressed in many directions . However , it has failed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Sinhala and Tamil people deteriorated due to a series of blunders by politicians on either side of the ethnic divide resulting in what was termed as South Asia 's longest war . <p> The separatist war waged by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam ( LTTE ) is now over and the country has been unified militarily but whether the country has been united politically remains an unanswered question . <p> Notwithstanding optimistic assertions by those in power the stark reality today is that of the Sri Lankan Tamil people being alienated from the State and estranged from mainstream consciousness . <p> Archipelago of Communities Paradoxical as it may seem , I have in the past often referred to Sri Lanka as both an Island nation and archipelago of communities . Given the raucous cacophony of strident cries of race and religion , it does seem unlikely that this polyphony of voices can ever be blended into a harmonious symphony . It is against this backdrop that this column intends to focus reflectively on the recent past of post-independence Sri Lanka and ponder over its future while drawing extensively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyone being free of colonial bondage , Independence Day would be a day of joy and happiness . But that has not been so for the Tamils of Sri Lanka for many , many years . They remain estranged and alienated from the Sri Lankan state still . Many Tamils are not part of the freedom day festivity emotionally and spiritually . <p> To many Tamil people whether in Sri Lanka or abroad the future for Tamils in Sri Lanka seems bleak and dreary . This despondency is not one which envelopes sympathisers and supporters of the LTTE alone . It is prevalent more widely , regardless of political affiliation . <p> There was a time when Independence Day on February 4th was observed as a day of mourning by many Tamils . The advent of the Ilankai Thamil Arasuk Katchi ( ITAK/Federal Party ) and the rise of Tamil nationalism in the fifties and sixties of the last century , saw the Tamil polity being asked to treat Freedom Day as a day of mourning . The rationale was that independence from British had only resulted in bondage under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So , Independence Day was nothing to celebrate , but only to be observed as a black day , it was argued . <p> These symbolic protests underwent a change after the Republican Constitution of 1972 . Thereafter , May 22nd too was observed as a black day . February 4th lost a little of its significance . The symbolism of black flags on Independence Day however continued . The escalation of the conflict and resultant suffering made the very concept of independence meaningless to Tamils . Years of perceived oppression and suppression had inculcated among Sri Lankan Tamils a feeling of alienation in the land of their forefathers . <p> The dominant Sinhala political class preferred to cooperate rather than confront the British . They worked for self -rule through negotiation rather than agitation . As a result of this nation never had an anti-colonial struggle as what was conducted in India by Mahatma Gandhi or Netaji Subash Chandra Bose . <p> Tamil Political Psyche The Tamil political psyche too had changed over the decades . Tamils saw themselves as being on par with the Sinhalese as a founding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ G. G. Ponnambalam period saw Tamils thinking of themselves as the premier all island minority ; S. J. V. Chelvanayagam years saw the Tamils regarding themselves as a territorial minority of the north-east ; the Amirthalingam years and the emergence of the TULF saw Tamils perceiving themselves as a distinct nationality with a separate homeland and the right of self-determination . Veluppillai Prabhakaran and other Tamil militant organisation leaders led an armed struggle to liberate this ' homeland ' on the basis of the mandate for Tamil Eelam obtained by the Tamil United Liberation Front ( TULF ) at the July 1977 elections . <p> Tamil perception of sovereignty too differed . The Jaffna Kingdom had lost its sovereignty on the battlefield to the Portuguese in 1619 . It was then ceded to the Dutch in 1658 ; the British took over from the Dutch in 1796 . It was only in 1833 after the Colebrooke Reforms of 1832 that pre-dominantly Tamil territories were integrated into a unified Ceylon . Until then they were administered separately . In 1948 , the British transferred power to the Sinhala majority . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paved the way for Independence in 1948 , the 1972 and 1978 Constitutions were imposed on Tamils without the consent of the majority of their elected representatives . Tamil sovereignty , therefore , lies within the Tamil nation still and the Sinhala majority has no right to dominate . This position often stated on political platforms was argued brilliantly by Murugeysen Tiruchelvam in courts at the Amirthalingam trial-at-bar case of 1976 . <p> However , Post-independence political problems should not blind us to the fact that a significant section of the Tamils was in the vanguard of a freedom struggle against the British . <p> Sadly the pioneering role played by Tamils in the quest for Independence is now forgotten . From Sir Ponnambalam Arunachalam 's famous lecture on Our Political Needs which laid the foundation for the National Congress to the activities of the Jaffna Youth Congress , Tamil efforts have been commendable in this regard . <p> The south after the heroic and historic 1818 and 1848 rebellions was generally quiet during British rule . The dominant Sinhala political class preferred to cooperate with rather than confront the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than agitation . As a result of this nation never had an anti-colonial struggle as what was conducted in India by Mahatma Gandhi or Netaji Subash Chandra Bose . <p> Jaffna Youth Congress The nearest to an anti-British , pro-freedom struggle , in the country came from the north . It emanated from the now forgotten Jaffna Youth Congress led by the likes of Handy Perinbanayagam , Orator Subramaniam , C. Ponnambalam . Fired by the ideals espoused by Mahatma Gandhi the Youth Congress demanded Poorana Swaraj ( Complete Independence ) and urged a boycott of the first State Council elections in support . It was the Jaffna Youth Congress which called first for Poorana Swaraj or complete self-rule from the British and rejected the limited reforms proposed by the Donoughmore Commission . <p> It is recorded that hundreds of Jaffna youths ran about the town streets shouting Swaraj after listening to a lecture by Kamaladevi Chattopadhyaya . The 1931 boycott was observed only in Jaffna . <p> The rest of the country did not follow suit and the boycott ultimately ended in failure . British scholar Jane Russell compared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ struggle and observed that it was like the turkey-cock trying to imitate the dance of the peacock . Later , southern historians tried to distort the boycott call and depicted it as a communal cry . That , however , was untrue . The Youth Congress boycott was inspired by nobler motives . So praiseworthy was the impact of the Youth Congress , that Philip Gunewardena , the ' Father of Marxism in Sri Lanka ' , wrote glowingly in the Searchlight journal that Jaffna had given the lead and asked the Sinhalese to follow suit . Prof. Wiswa Warnapala reviewing the book written by Santhaseelan Kadirgamar on the Jaffna Youth Congress expressed his admirataion of the Jaffna Youth Congress openly and chastised Sinhala political leaders of the colonial period as ' Bootlickers of Imperialism ' . <p> The Youth Congress also conducted several meetings and satyagraha , in support of freedom . Two noteworthy feats were the boycott of a visit to Jaffna by then Prince of Wales and the hoisting of the Nandhi ( Crouched Bull ) flag in place of the Union Jack . <p> It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was hoisted defiantly instead of the Union Jack on the Empire Day . It was Jaffna that boycotted the visit of the then Prince of Wales during colonial rule . <p> Tragically , political vicissitudes in the post-independence years compelled Tamils to demonstrate with black flags on Independence Day . <p> The roots of this development and the emotive background to it are understandable . It is to be hoped that a satisfactory resolution of the Tamil national question would bring about a remarkable change in Tamil attitudes towards Independence from the British in the future . <p> National Anthem In Tamil The singing of the national anthem in Tamil at the official Independence Day Celebration was made possible by the Sirisena-Wickremesinghe Government . After several decades Namo , Namo Thaayae was sung at an official Independence Day Celebration . <p> It was a highly commendable move and welcomed by most Tamils . Yet it was only a silver lining in a dark cloud . What is important to note is that unequal relations between the numerical majority community and other numerical minority communities still exist . <p> The nearest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came from the north . It emanated from the now forgotten Jaffna Youth Congress led by the likes of Handy Perinbanayagam , Orator Subramaniam ... <p> This is particularly so in the case of the Sri Lankan Tamils who have been struggling to achieve equality on the Island for decades . The Tamil Eelam demand was a desperate manifestation of the Tamil state of mind . This state of mind is likely to continue until genuine unity is achieved through the creation of a plural and egalitarian society . <p> The tragedy of independent Sri Lanka has been majoritarian hegemony . Majority rule is a democratic principle . Here it has been interpreted as the majority of the numerically largest ethnicity . <p> Sri Lanka is a modern State with an ancient civilisation , but the attempt to define Sri Lanka as a modern Nation State has led to conflict and strife . Power is concentrated with the majority ethnicity leaving the others out in the cold . It is a case of Maha Jathiyata Kiri , Sulu Jathiwalata Kekiri .

From the Indian sub-continent to Fiji Islands and from Nigeria to Malaysia , there are many instances of this . Sri Lanka too can be classified as an example of post-independence conflict within pre-independence boundaries . Some ex-colonies have reduced and managed ethnic tensions by evolving new forms of power sharing . They have reinvented themselves as ' new ' nations on the basis of equality and forged a strong sense of common identity . In the final analysis , the unity and integrity of a nation do not depend on its military strength or structures of governance but on the will of its people .

In reality , we are a divided nation today and military conquest and domination by itself is no answer . If we are to resolve these divisions and create a strong nation on the basis of equitable power-sharing , the structure of the state needs to be radically transformed . There is no consensus on that so far . <p> Sensible and Pragmatic The need of the hour is for Tamils to evolve a sensible and pragmatic approach to the situation they are in . What is necessary now is not confrontation but cooperation . Cooperation is not submission . Conciliation is not surrendered . <p> Those continuing the old politics of sabre-rattling must realise there is no sword or blade in the scabbard or sheath to " scare " the enemy . Instead , these vocal warriors make laughing stocks of themselves without perhaps realising it . <p> This inability or unwillingness to recognise the tragic plight of the Tamil people and adopt a practical approach rather than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evolved in a vacuum . There is a history behind this emotive content in Tamil politics . It has been prevalent ever since the Tamil polity began experiencing political anxiety over the perceived threat of Sinhala majoritarian hegemony . <p> What is required now is the creation of a just , egalitarian and plural society . There must be equitable power-sharing based on principles of devolution . If one were to simplify the ethnic crisis in Sri Lanka and its potential solution one may say that it is a contest between three " ideas " . Broadly , three schools of thought have been clashing , namely hegemonism , secessionism and pluralism . <p> The Sinhala hardliners want Sinhala-Buddhist domination and look upon this country as theirs alone , excluding or reducing others to subservient status in this ' Chinthana . ' <p> They interpret numerical superiority as a divine right to dominate other ethnicities who are treated as children of lesser Gods . Their numerical strength has afforded them the ability to exercise this control through " democratic " procedures . <p> They want a Unitary State where the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want a separate State for the North-East known as Tamil Eelam . Just as Sinhala hawks say Sri Lanka is for the Sinhalese , these Tamil hawks say Tamil Eelam is for the Tamils . The Tigers may have been destroyed militarily but the ideology of " tigers " still exists . It is fuelled by funds from tigerish elements in the global Tamil Diaspora . <p> A state for the dominant ethnicity within excludes by definition , other ethnicities living within these real or imaginary borders . Both these Sinhala and Tamil " hawkish " ideas have brought about disunity , violence and destruction . The nation bled profusely and the country diminished drastically . <p> Amity and Fraternity The third idea is that of establishing an egalitarian and plural society where all children of this country can live together in amity and fraternity . It incorporates a vision where no one will claim superior rights on the basis of belonging to the majority race/religion or claim exclusive rights to their historic habitat . Power will not be confined to Colombo but shared with the periphery . All people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have their say and have a role to play . <p> Sri Lanka will belong to its people from Paruthithurai to Devinuwara and Mannar to Mullaitheevu . At present , this ' vision ' seems unrealistically impossible and Utopian ! <p> In spite of the adverse politico-military environment , this is the vision that should ultimately triumph .. ' Visionaries ' of this nature are an endangered species . They are under attack by hawks on either side of the ethnic divide . <p> They are dubbed derisively as ' jokers ' and ' traitors . ' It is , however , this vision that will ultimately salvage Sri Lanka . Hegemonic and secessionist dreams have turned into cruel nightmares . The call for the third option between the hegemonistic one-State and secessionist two-State schools of thought is a voice of sanity and sensibility .

However , when a claim arises it is an entirely different story . Many policy holders have difficulties in properly presenting their claims to their insurance companies and obtaining a fair settlement . <p> Most insurance claims involve technical issues and the claimants encounter serious difficulties in submitting their claims to their insurance companies .

This is in no way a criticism of the facts and opinion expressed by the writer but a clarification of some points raised , to prevent any misunderstanding of the facts by the public . <p> The Transplantation of Human Tissues Act of Sri Lanka of 1987 deals with many legal aspects of tissue donation . The Criminal Procedure Code also deals with the legal procedures involved in death investigations and autopsy procedures . However , ethical aspects of organ donations have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to serious consequences for all ; doctors , donors and recipients . <p> I wish to state that I did not contact any person involved in the medical treatment and organ retrieval or transplantation in this case . My view is based on facts stated in various newspapers and my knowledge and expertise on the subject . <p> Better understanding of the circumstances could have been achieved if hospital documents were perused and all individuals involved were interviewed . I am not aware whether the previous writer had the chance to obtain all these details but from the contents of the article it appears that he is unaware about some important information and the law governing tissue transplantation . <p> Question 1 : Why was Jeewanthi transferred back ? <p> The NHSL has a special neurotrauma unit with the most modern facilities to treat patients with head injury . This brings out two important questions . Is it ethical to transfer the patient back ? Is it the correct management in this particular instance ? <p> A few newspapers have mentioned that a CT or an MRI scan of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the doctors at the NHSL . It is very likely that such patients with severe brain injuries need ventilation until they recover or succumb to injuries . Though the NHSL has many Intensive Care Units ( ICUs ) all ventilators are almost always occupied by patients needing the life support system . The turnover of patients with serious brain injury is very high at NHSL as it functions as a tertiary care hospital and it receives patients from every corner of the island . In some instances , it is very difficult or even impossible to find a vacant ventilator in any of the ICUs at NHSL . So it is logical and ethical to transfer the patient to a unit where a ventilator is available . According to one Sinhala newspaper , the patient had been on ventilator support at the Homagama Base Hospital which means that a ventilator was available there . So is n't it prudent to transfer the patient there for ventilator support ? <p> The writer says that " if there was hope to revive her ; the hope lay nowhere else but in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ethical to keep a patient who needs ventilator support in a general ward ? If this was done the patient would have died hours earlier . It would also amount to medical negligence due to the fact that necessary action was not being taken to treat her properly . In my opinion , the doctors have done what is logical and ethical by transferring the patient back to Homagama where ventilator support was available . <p> Question 2 : Did lack of medical attention during the re-transfer result in irreversible brain damage ? <p> This is a difficult question to answer with a certainty . The condition of a patient with severe brain injury can deteriorate at anytime , irrespective of whether medical attention is given or not . However , accepted procedure in transferring a patient is that a nursing officer or a trained para-medical person accompanies the patient . Occasionally , doctors also accompany patients but this is subject to their availability at that moment . On the other hand , the same potential threat would have been there during the initial transfer of the patient to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for her transfer to NHSL . <p> CT and MRI scanning facilities are not available at Homagama and there is no option but to transfer the patient to NHSL for further investigations . The actions taken have to be considered together with options available in the best interests of the patient . Is n't it logical and ethical to transfer back the patient to Homagama for ventilator support rather than keeping her in a general ward without a ventilator and allowing her to die sooner ? <p> Question 3 : The writer raises the question why the patient was kept on a ventilator without being disconnected . The reason is simple . Once the decision to harvest organs is taken , ventilator support should be continued until such harvesting to prevent putrefaction of organs . This is a genuine technical issue . <p> Question 4 : The writer correctly says that there is a thin line dividing the sublime from the ridiculous and the genius from the lunatic . The thin line here means that it is difficult to differentiate between the two conditions . However , it is incorrect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death and a coma . In medical practice , the difference of the two is very obvious . Probably what the writer refers to is the usual way of confirming death in a normal ward . This is not the procedure adopted in diagnosing brain death in a patient on ventilator support . <p> The accepted procedure in diagnosing brain death is that it is done by two consultants separately on two occasions -- excluding the doctors involved in the tissue transplantation team . Many brain functions are assessed and the tests are repeated after some time . A basic vital function is the presence of spontaneous breathing as in the absence of spontaneous respiration an individual will not be able to survive as the oxygenation process of blood wo n't occur and cells would die soon due to lack of oxygen . <p> Question 5 : The writer asks whether the doctors at Homagama can declare a patient brain dead when the heart goes on ? In medical terminology there is ' beating heart cadaver ' . It means that the patient is dead but the heart is beating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The heart has an innate capability of beating on its own . This innate capability of beating on its own lets the heart beat for a very short time after brain death is confirmed . Could it go on for a considerable period ? No . Once the brain is dead the capability of having spontaneous respiration is lost and the oxygenation of blood does n't happen . This automatically stops the provision of oxygenated blood to body tissues including the heart making them incapable of remaining alive . <p> What actually happens in a ventilated patient is that the machines act as an artificial lung and keep the oxygenation process going on maintaining circulation . This means that it is the machine that keeps the heart going on . Therefore , technically and medically a brain dead patient can not be considered as being alive . The patient is dead and a dead patient does n't have sensations as far as medicine is concerned . <p> Question 6 : Already discussed under Question 3 . <p> Question 7 : The writer has questioned the validity of the consent obtained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law pertaining to tissue transplantation which deals with different types of consent . <p> In this case , the husband is dead and her child is a minor . Therefore , the father of the deceased has the legal right to consent . <p> The writer says that no one can give consent to ' medical ghouls to thieve the assets of their beloved .... ' . I can not understand why the writer considers this a theft when it is legally permitted and done to save the lives of many others awaiting organ donations . <p> Question 8 : I have already answered the issues raised on this question . <p> Question 9 : The writer theorizes about what happened after the diagnosis of brain death . I am unaware about what exactly happened or how the message was communicated to the relatives but I also do n't find anything wrong in what the writer has suggested here . Is there a better way of telling them the outcome and getting consent for organ retrieval ? <p> What doctors have done in this case is not to play the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ humanity being within the law , ethics and accepted medical practice . <p> The public media should carry the true picture about important events and issues . It is true that legislation and code of ethics do not always ensure rightful acts by all individuals . If someone does something wrong it is an individual issue not a fault of the accepted procedure and system . Laws can take necessary action if someone does anything illegal . 
@@23135232 <p> Missing , or rather , not enough attention has been given to the rights of female migrant workers and their status in society in the just-concluded election campaign for local authorities . Our attention was drawn to this one morning when Kussi Amma Sera , preparing the morning cup of tea , said : " Mahattaya , apey pitarata rassawata yana lamei gena ... <p> " Eh , " I asked but before waiting for a long , drawn response during a busy week , moved to my computer since this thought , in fact , had occurred to me , too . <p> The election which concluded yesterday has many changes and is seen as a test for future polls . For instance , representatives will be elected on the basis of 60 per cent first-past-the-post and 40 per cent through PR . Also 25 per cent of the representatives must be women . <p> The struggle for women 's rights across the island particularly in marginalised communities at the election may have , unfortunately , been eclipsed by an ongoing battle for the rights of women to buy , be served or drink liquor in public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right owing to archaic , societal and cultural norms must be removed for good from the country 's laws and regulations ; the attention it drew during the election campaign ( maybe mostly in the English-speaking media and media platforms ) , relegated for another day , the discussion of the perennial problem of the right to vote for migrant workers , particularly thousands of women working in modern-day , slavery-like conditions overseas . And at local government level , these are very important issues <p> While government authorities assert that the number of female domestic workers working in difficult conditions abroad -- sexual and physical harassment , long working hours , sometimes forced to skip a meal and taking care of large families -- is not as bad as reported in the media , extensive studies have shown that the number of complaints does n't reflect the actual situation . <p> Large voting bases , like the plantation workers for instance , draw politicians like magnets , eagerly offering the sun and the moon in return for their votes . The plantation bloc vote is a good example of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while showing or rather pretending to workers they care . However workers , it must be said , have benefited given the collective agreements between unions and plantation companies on a decent wage . <p> Similar protection and rights for migrant workers , many of those working in support of these rights believe , could be secured if the workers are able to vote abroad through electronic or some other mechanism . <p> Voting by expatriate workers is not new . More than 90 countries allow their nationals working abroad to vote . The Philippines is the best example , since it has a large army of female domestic workers abroad , of allowing these nationals to vote from overseas locations . <p> The Overseas Absentee Voting Act , officially known as Republic Act No. 9189 , is a law in the Philippines approved in 2003 which provides for citizens of that country residing or working abroad to vote at a local election . Supporters have often urged workers abroad to make use of the vote to gain national attention on human trafficking , illegal recruitment and good governance . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number as a sector . Your sheer number will force policies in your favour , " said one migrant worker-support group , there , in one of its right-to-vote campaigns . <p> The right-to-vote campaign for thousands of Sri Lankan migrant workers was initiated in the 1990s by David Soysa , a retired Labour Department officer , whose work led to the creation of several NGOs working in this field . He died a few years ago , unable to see his pet project -- voting rights for MWs -- to its successful conclusion . His persistence on this issue resulted in the Human Rights Commission endorsing the right to vote for migrant workers , 16 years ago in October 2001 . However , it did n't move beyond a recommendation sent to the Foreign Ministry . <p> That was it . Soysa 's campaign for voting rights for domestic workers lost its momentum after he died . <p> In fact , while many Colombo-centric women 's rights activists lent their name to the petitions before the Supreme Court challenging new gender-bias regulations ( or those that were re-introduced after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the unfairness of the government ruling that women do n't have the same right as men in liquor consumption and sale , there is not even a murmur of protest in the hallowed walls of the Hulftsdorp courts complex against the rights of female migrant workers . <p> Where were these activists when one courageous woman from a village filed a fundamental rights plea in 2013 , challenging the Government 's right to stop her working overseas without the permission of her husband ? That petition was dismissed during a preliminary " seeking leave to proceed " hearing by the Supreme Court on the grounds that the rule was neither gender discriminatory nor violated an individual 's human rights . <p> In this case , even more ironical was the fact that the appellant-worker was separated from her husband and looking after the children on her own but still had to seek his permission . <p> This ' permission-seeking ' rule is a provision in the under-fire Family Background Report ( FBR ) . While the FBR is meant to ensure people going abroad leave their children in ' safe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grandparents or a proper guardian , it has led to abuse and corruption by village-level officers . <p> Many women have got FBRs approved after being forced to pay a bribe . <p> While the FBR is under review to minimise corruption , a recent issue raised by employment agents is the FBR being imposed on female professionals seeking to work overseas . " We are losing a lot of job orders in West Asia in professional categories for women because of the FBR , " one agent said , advocating a different FBR approach to professional women workers as against unskilled female workers . <p> This , however , is a discriminatory approach that should be strongly discouraged and vigorously challenged . <p> In neighbouring India , discrimination on almost similar grounds is being challenged by activists . Indian parliamentarian Shashi Tharoor , also an author and former international civil servant , has lent his voice to protests against a government move to introduce orange passports for Indian migrants . <p> Activists say a decision to change the colour of the passport for Indian migrants depending on their educational @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Dr. Tharoor was quoted in local media as saying that " the very premise of this decision -- discriminating against the citizens of a country based on their economic status and educational qualifications -- makes it inherently unfair " . <p> In Sri Lanka , thousands of women work in the plantations , garment industry and as domestic workers ensuring the wheels of the country 's economy run smoothly . It is this largely , female-driven workforce that accounted for a total of over US$13 billion in foreign exchange in 2016 . <p> Worker remittances have slowed down considerably in recent months owing to lower oil prices and unrest in West Asia and are unlikely to reach the $7.2 billion achieved in 2016 . Lower earnings from this source and less attention from the authorities could further alienate female domestic workers from state protection and national attention . For these reasons , it is imperative that movements fighting against gender-bias must campaign vigorously for the rights of female domestic workers as much as they do in the current " right to drink " discourse .

Irrespective of who wins or who loses on the 10th of February from among the competing actors jostling on the political stage , the voter ( it seems ) has already lost a significant portion of the promised gains of 2015 , bar the shouting . Yet were those promises a mirage at the very time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question that surfaces in terms of fundamental governing imperatives . To be clear , this is also a question that is quite distinct from defensive positions taken by some when they say that Sri Lankans are better off in terms of their civil liberties than they were three years ago . The truth of that assertion is without a doubt . <p> But it is also the truth that systemic Rule of Law failures did not start with the Rajapaksas . Rather , much of that predated Rajapaksa rule with the best example being the fact that the precipitation of Sri Lanka 's Supreme Court into one unpleasant political controversy over another became a matter of international scrutiny during the Kumaratunga Presidency . <p> From that point , it was a small step to the summary impeachment of a Chief Justice by the Rajapaksa Presidency and an even smaller step to the executive dismissal of the successor to that Chief Justice who was deemed ' never to have been ' under the Sirisena Presidency while the Bar clapped . Now we have the ultimate irony of that Chief Justice ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Appeal judge being slapped with corruption charges in the Magistrates Court . And the Bar , ( in a vastly different avatar of course ) , splutters in protest over the same . <p> Prejudging actions of CIABOC Indeed its recent statement that the institution of criminal proceedings ' on the basis of professional advice given by them in their former capacities as the Attorney General and Deputy Solicitor General affects the independence of Judiciary , Rule of Law and the interests of the public at large " invites the appearance of prejudging the matter . As at this date , the Bribery and Corruption Commission ( CIABOC ) which filed these charges in the Magistrate 's Court has yet not entered upon an elucidation of the same . No doubt , this would be forthcoming in the months ahead in the judicial forum . Until then , it would be opportune to hesitate before rushing into conclusions as to the basis on which the charges rest . <p> From the standpoint of a critical observer , these responses by the legal profession in 2015 and 2018 attract equally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ illustrate profound dilemmas of justice that Sri Lanka faces as a result of crude politicization of the profession even though lofty language is resorted to in order to hide less than lofty motives . That was the same in 2015 , ( let us admit that undoubtedly inconvenient truth ) , as it is now . <p> A few weeks ago , it was observed in these column spaces that the utilization of Section 70 of the Bribery Act ( as amended ) by the Bribery and Corruption Commission in this regard was salutary after this provision had been allowed to be dormant for decades following the amendments in 1994 . However it was also pointed out that penal charges call for evidentiary material that go beyond claims of the improper use of discretion in wielding statutory powers . <p> The occurrence of strange things in the past That said , it must also not be forgotten that this country has seen strange things happening including at one point when the Attorney General lodged an appeal with the Colombo High Court in 2009 to withdraw an indictment on purportedly ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leading Colombo school who had been charged with allegedly preparing forged documents and misleading the Criminal Investigation Department ( CID ) over a school admission . The Court was informed that the accused had regretted his conduct and had accepted a transfer to another school . Further , judicial clemency was pleaded on the basis that several citizens had written to the Attorney General requesting that mercy be shown to the accused based on the good services that he had rendered to the country . In that specific case , the judge rightly refused to accede to the application of the Attorney General . <p> In these circumstances , the propriety of the Attorney General came in for severe critique . Indeed , troubling patterns were demonstrated in regard to substantial decisions to file indictment or , ( in the alternative ) , refuse to file indictment in cases where the law and the investigative material called for a contrary course of action . These matters remain therefore of clear public interest , quite apart from the use of the Bribery Act in the instant context which has been objected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been good if a reference had been made in that sanctimonious statement issued by the Bar to the crucial importance of the independence of the foremost state law officer rather than indulge in sweeping generalisations . <p> In other jurisdictions , it is interesting to note that English judges have opined that the court would dismiss the charge in criminal matters if the applicant is able to show that the Attorney General or any of the police officers is found to have abused the process of court or had acted in an oppressive manner towards the applicant . Again , in Israel , the judges have gone further in this regard . The Court has set aside prosecutorial decisions tainted by improper motives , arbitrariness , discrimination and where there was a material or grave distortion of reason . <p> Structural reforms needed Taking these issues out of the heat of political aggravations , structural reforms pertaining to the exercise of powers of the Attorney General may be urged as appropriate . In Canada , for example , expert committees have been set up to lay down guidelines for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ African jurisdictions are increasingly emphasizing the political neutrality of the office as well as the need to ensure judicial oversight of the powers of the Attorney General in appropriate circumstances . In the meantime , it may befit the Bar to abstain from ' appearing to prejudge ' the actions of CIABOC in warning of stern consequences that would follow if their cautions are not adhered to . Adding a rider that this intervention is not meant as an obstruction or interference with the course of justice or the right of law enforcement institutions to carry out their functions ' is merely a sop . That much must be said .

A natural public speaker ( he has spoken at around 500 colleges and universities ) , his conversation is no different speaking with sentences that are carefully and eloquently strung together .

It is perhaps what has made his poems including @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You Really From " go viral online . He performs with such ferocity that it is impossible to forget it .

" <p> Do you feel people connecting with your poetry whilst onstage ? " Human beings are so beautiful . Sometimes they think they can keep this shield up , they have so much you do n't see and as I watch them open themselves up over the course of an hour long show -- they show themselves . It 's like we 're all bare to each other . My hope is that when people leave a show they feel like anything is possible and they leave knowing that at least I want them to stay on this Earth as long as humanely possibly and they are important . I feel like I 'm a magician of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a room full of people my only goal is to create a space of radical empathy and connection . " <p> And connection is what he ultimately achieves , particularly when capturing the thoughts and emotions of minority groups that perhaps do not always have a voice . His wife is African-American and together they have one daughter and another on the way . I tell him I enjoyed his poem ' Black Hair ' which was ostensibly written for his daughter . " So much of my writing is at the intersection of race , gender , sexuality and nationality and that 's one of the things I consider , being a parent to a black child in the United States at a moment in time where the murder and control of black bodies feels ubiquitous and overwhelming for me and I 'm not of the African diaspora .

Poetry , masculinity , white supremacy , the human connection .

However , science tells us that animals can have cognitive faculties that are superior to human beings .

Here are some of these widely published findings : <p> Animals are capable of developing language and communication skills and tool usage , with elephants , dolphins , whales , apes and crows considered the most intelligent .

Elephants have incredible memories as do chickens -- who if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protect not only their own precious pups , but also nurse those who have lost their mothers .

Universal Compassion being the tenet of Buddhism , Buddha taught us to treat humans and animals with equal respect . Hinduism advocates non-violence -- the " Bhagawata Purana " , a principal text of Hinduism lays down that " deer , camel , donkey , monkey , rats , creeping animals , birds and flies -- one should consider them as one 's own children .

Some artists paint their subjects without having seen the bird and rely on other artists ' work or images . <p> However , a photograph captures the entire bird with one click of the camera . The only downside to a photograph is the lighting conditions in which it is taken .

Sampanthan <p> ( February 22 , 2018 , Colombo , Sri Lanka Guardian ) I thought I would say a few words on this debate . The people have delivered a verdict and , in a democracy , the people 's verdict must be respected . The Hon. Member who moved the Motion and the Hon. Member who seconded the Motion have referred to various matters . I think , Sir , I will primarily do a brief analysis of the result of the Local Authorities Election held on 10th of February . <p> The Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna polled 44.69 per cent of the votes cast at that election . The United National Party polled 32.61 per cent . The United People 's Freedom Alliance polled 8.90 per cent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If one was to add the percentage of the votes polled by the United National Party , the United People 's Freedom Alliance and the Sri Lanka Freedom Party , those three parties put together polled 45.99 per cent , almost 46 per cent . The Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna polled 44.69 per cent , that is almost 2 per cent less than the other three parties put together . <p> The People 's Liberation Front -- JVP -- polled 6.26 per cent and the Illankai Tamil Arasu Kachchi polled 3.06 per cent . If one was to add the percentage of votes polled by those two parties together with the percentage of votes polled by the United National Party , the United People 's Freedom Alliance and the Sri Lanka Freedom Party , the total would be 55.31 per cent . So , in other words , parties opposed to the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna have polled 55.31 per cent and the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna has polled only 44.69 per cent . This is indisputable . <p> Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa at the Presidential Election held in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the Presidential Election in January , 2015 were more than the votes he polled now . There have been three elections in recent times ; the Presidential Election in 2015 , the Parliamentary Election in 2015 and the Local Authorities Election held this month . In none of these elections has former President Mahinda Rajapaksa been able to obtain more than 50 per cent . <p> His vote has always been below 50 per cent at the Presidential Election , at the Parliamentary Election and at the Local Authority Election . So , there is nothing to get excited about : elections are held ; parties win ; parties lose . The Local Authority Elections have been held and you have won . One does not dispute that fact , but the fact of the matter is that you have polled only 44.69 per cent as opposed to 55.31 per cent cast against you . So , what is there to get excited about ? Nothing at all . Parliament is not constituted on the basis of votes cast at the Local Authority Elections . Parliament is constituted , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cast at the Presidential Election -- at a Parliamentary Election held for that purpose in keeping with the Constitution and the laws of this country . The Constitution and the laws of this country can not be subverted by your claiming benefits under the Local Authority Elections to your advantage in the way you please . <p> I want to make a few comments , Mr. Speaker , if you permit me in regard to the nature of the propaganda that was carried on at this election . I do not want to do something controversial . But , I must refer to the fact that I was quite alarmed when , quite early in the campaign , former President Mahinda Rajapaksa , in the course of an election rally , said that sometimes this election would result in Tamil Eelam blooming after the election is over . The reason he gave was that there was a new Constitution being framed which might result in that happening . Sir , ever since the Thirteenth Amendment was enacted in 1987 -- 1988 , there had been continued efforts on the part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Amendment in such a manner as to bring about a political resolution acceptable to all the citizens in this country . During President Premadasa 's time , there was the Mangala Moonesinghe Parliamentary Select Committee Proposals which made recommendations which went far beyond the Thirteenth Amendment . During President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga 's time , there were the 2,000 Constitutional Proposals brought to Parliament by no less a person than Prof. G. L. Peiris which went far beyond the 13th Amendment and contained various new features . That proposed Constitution had been brought as a Bill to Parliament . <p> Thereafter President Mahinda Rajapaksa assumed office . If he will recall his speech that he made at the initial meeting , the inaugural meeting of the All Party Representatives Committee ( APRC ) and the Experts Committee , he talked of maximum possible devolution . He appointed an Experts Committee that came up with the reports . There was the Prof. Tissa Vitharana Committee which came up with their own report which took the Constitutional proposals much beyond the Thirteenth Amendment and that was the position . After the assumption @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a Constitutional Assembly to frame a new Constitution . As per a Resolution adopted unanimously in this Parliament with all the Joint Opposition Members being supportive of that Resolution , -- none of you opposed it -- there was a Steering Committee appointed . You participated in the proceedings of the Steering Committee . None of you opposed it . None of you talked of Eelam in this Parliament . None of you talked of Eelam at the Steering Committee . You accepted it ; you went along with the process . Suddenly , Mr. Mahinda Rajapaksa says , " There Eelam is likely to bloom after the Local Authority Elections if the people are not careful . " <p> I have information , Sir , that this message was propagated amongst the innocent Sinhala people in this country . They were told , " This is a referendum for an Eelam . If you vote for the Government or if you vote for the UNP , it will result in an Eelam being created . So , do not vote for them .

We only talked of a solution that is acceptable to our people , that is reasonable , with substantial power-sharing within the framework of a united , undivided , indivisible single country . That was the propaganda we carried out in all our areas and when we did that , how dare President Rajapaksa say that Eelam could bloom after the election . This is not merely deception of the people in the South , innocent Sinhala people in the South , but it is the deception of everyone including himself . <p> I would like to put this on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it was a malicious , vicious , fallacious , false propaganda on the part of President Mahinda Rajapaksa and the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna and if you proceed with this agenda , I want to tell you , Eelam will bloom , not on account of us , but on account of your " Lotus Bud " . Your " Lotus Bud " will bloom into an Eelam . That is what will happen .

According to him , Sri Lanka 's economic outlook and investment opportunities are positive . Sri Lanka 's per capita income is around US $ 3,850 and the FDIs , excluding the loans to the Board of Investment ( BOI ) companies , are even below Rs.1 billion per year . <p> For a small economy ( US $ 83 billion ) like Sri Lanka , with a domestic consumer market of a mere 21 million , even with 2.0-2.5 million foreign travellers , the external demand from the international markets for Sri Lankan products and services is critical , in order to sustain medium-term economic growth . However , the Sri Lankan external sector performance -- balance of trade -- remains a critical issue mainly due to a steady deterioration in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lack of consistent policies , implementation snags , red tape , etc . It is regretted to mention that an export-led growth strategy , which has been practiced for many years , has become a mere slogan . <p> " Capital inflows reflecting the favourable developments in the external sector , the BOP recorded a surplus of US $ 2,068 million in 2017 , while gross official reserves of the country stood at US $ 8 billion as at end-2017 , " a Central Bank release said . <p> These foreign reserves are not ' earned ' but with additional foreign borrowings , which include the issue of international sovereign bonds and sale proceeds from the Hambantota port transfer , etc . Although the earnings from exports increased in 2017 ( US $ 11.4 billion from US $ 10.3 billion ) , the increase in import expenditure resulted in widening the trade deficit . The year-end run on imports pushes the trade deficit highest since 2012 ( US $ 9,620 million ) <p> The Sri Lankan per capita income is stagnated during the last three to four years and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't really show the income inequality and huge disparity among the rural ' bottom of the pyramid ' people , where more than 25 percent of the people are living below the poverty indicators set by the World Bank . <p> Based on the World Bank statistics , the gross domestic product ( GDP ) per capita for Sri Lanka in 2016 was US $ 22,195 and for Singapore it was US $ 87,832 ( ppp adjusted ) . As far back as 1950s , both countries ' GDP per capita were more or less the same , around US $ 160 . <p> A Sri Lankan high-calibre professional working in Singapore , on a short holiday to Sri Lanka recently told the writer : " It is sad to see that the Sri Lankan economy is deteriorating from bad to worse . Singapore was once a county that benchmarked itself with Sri Lanka for development . However , today they are light years ahead of us and our development is basically the opposite . Further , due to this plight , our country is also losing some of its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this will only add to our negative growth . " <p> Continued inflows by way of tourist earnings and workers ' remittances , however , have contributed in curtailing the expanded trade deficit to a certain extent . <p> On a cumulative basis , import expenditure recorded its historically highest value of US $ 21 billion in 2017 . This was largely led by higher imports of fuel and rice , wheat imports and refined petroleum products during the year . Import expenditure on rice and wheat increased to fulfil the shortage in the domestic market due to serious loss of rice production by as much as 50 percent to a mere 2,300 million metric tonnes during last year compared to the average of 4,600 million metric tonnes during the previous years . <p> Furthermore , the import expenditure on machinery and equipment declined due to the lower imports of engineering equipment and electrical machinery and equipment . Also , the import of cement and fertilizer declined during the year . India ( 21.4 percent ) , China ( 18.8 percent ) , the UAE ( 7.5 percent ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) were the main import origins , accounting for about 59 percent of the total imports during 2017 . <p> Persistent savings : Investment gap in Sri Lankan economy The real issue lies with the shortfall in the investment required for the desired economic growth . Low levels of FDI inflows have been a chronic issue in the Sri Lankan economy . Therefore , it has to be some kind of an ' investment-led growth strategy ' that could drive the export sector and economic growth . <p> As development economists have identified , the obstacles to development are self-reinforcing where , low levels of household income preventing domestic savings , which in turn retard capital formation , thus low investments hinder productivity growth and keep the household income back at low levels . This is the poverty-growth vicious cycle . <p> As a result , the successive governments are compelled to borrow funds to finance the deficits . In addition to this , the public sector inefficiency , lack of coordination among ministries and departments and human resource skill gaps , coupled with political instability , have contributed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life The Central Bank has been repeatedly emphasizing the need to address these ' deep-rooted structural issues ' in the economy , which have prevented the country from maintaining a high and sustainable GDP growth rate over time ( Page 27 of CB 2016 ) . <p> According to the world economic outlook of the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) /World Bank , the global economy gained momentum . Therefore , one can argue that the low export performance has been due to the supply-side issues than demand-side and therefore , signing free trade agreements alone will not reverse the trends . The writer has further developed a new economic vicious cycle stemming from lack of policy cohesiveness on the part of the government . <p> Conclusion As can be seen , low levels of FDI inflows have been a chronic issue in the Sri Lankan economy .

Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe decided to reshuffle the cabinet of ministers to manage the fallout after the recent election . <p> Many new faces were expected to be appointed to the cabinet , with a few changes to the existing portfolios . The public wanted a thorough shake-up . Their message after the local government elections was loud and clear -- work and deliver your promises . Changing a few ministers would not serve that purpose . <p> After three years in office , some ministers had delivered and some lack ideas and had become stale , detached and complacent . Some were simply out of their depth .

So far , the changes are insignificant and short-sighted . Many expected General Fonseka to take over Law and Order at least at non-cabinet level , to give a fresh lease of life to law enforcement in the country . That too did not take place . <p> Disappointing The questions raised after cabinet reshuffles are not unexpected . After all , cabinet reshuffles are an intriguing affair . At least for one thing , they demonstrate the power of the head of state .

Often the people , who are promoted to the ministerial rank , are told only on the day itself . <p> The other reason for wide interest is that more often than not , the cabinet reshuffles are heavily laden with hidden motives and agendas . The public expectation of Sirisena 's proposed reshuffle was to get the government to change direction and to inject fresh hope . It was not done with realism and pragmatism expected . Therefore , it has led to further uncertainty within the government . <p> Need for strong leadership It is often said that the cabinet in most countries wields tremendous power and authority . However , in Sri Lanka , despite the recent amendments , the president still wields substantial power and authority and a few nations in the world have power so highly concentrated in one office , as in Sri Lanka .

Ideal democracy never produced results . <p> However , what is equally very important is to have very strong and pragmatic men and women , preferably educated with a commitment to national service , in the cabinet , to advise the prime minister or president and in some instances , to act as a foil . <p> Needless to say , in the end , the only valid reason as far as the public goes to change a cabinet line-up is to strengthen it or inject new life , for the benefit of the country . In this case , the overall ' reshuffle ' was far from a complete overhaul talked of in political circles -- especially after the president and prime minister vowed to take very bold and far-reaching steps in view of the embarrassing defeat of the UNP as well as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What a shame both leaders did not make use of the opportunity to define the issues in their own terms to the opposition ? <p> Conclusion Though the coalition to many looks in shambles . It is not all gloom and doom . Sri Lanka had its first primary budget surplus in 2017 . The improvements in the economic climate have been reflected in the sovereign ratings by Fitch and Standard &amp; Poor as they upgraded from a negative to a stable outlook . Sri Lanka 's external sector had performed well with exports reaching US $ 11.4 billion , 10 percent more than that of 2016 and higher still than the previous best of US $ 11.1 billion in 2014 . Therefore , whatever that has been achieved so far should not be squandered over political misgivings . <p> The way out of this political stalemate is for Wickremesinghe to take careful steps in dealing with Sirisena , leaving sufficient space for the latter to understand the ground reality . Wickremesinghe needs to adopt a model that is based on discipline ( someone telling what to do ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best ) who are incompetent . <p> If any of our leaders can sell that to the masses ( not the intelligentsia only ) , then we get some discipline in our society ( which needs to be shaped like Lee Kuan did with the mass of the Singaporeans ) . The current leadership at the helm has to reinvent itself to be trusted once again with a fresh mandate . So far , its record of broken promises , weak governance , judicial ineffectiveness and above all , tolerance of financial scandals , has largely betrayed the confidence that people placed on the regime . <p> The alternative leadership that is challenging the current one also has a past with even more baggage . As a result of all this , young people are now looking for new alternatives to carry the nation forward with a clean slate . Therefore , if serious steps are not taken to rectify the errors that in part led to the disappointing election result , the result at the next provincial elections will be the final nail in the coffin because it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solid results .

@@23515235 <h> Mix of anti-incumbency , chutzpah help BJP gatecrash into India 's North East <p> 2018-03-06 00:00:54 <p> 0 <p> 217 <p> A mixture of anti-incumbent sentiment and sheer chutzpah has helped the Bharatiya Janata Party ( BJP ) led by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi , gatecrash into power in the North Eastern States of Nagaland , Tripura and Meghalaya in the recently held State Assembly elections . <p> These states were long thought to be the preserve of the Congress , the Left , and local parties . They were thought to be inhospitable to the BJP which was seen as a North Indian-centred party of Hindu nationalists . Except for Tripura , Nagaland and Meghalaya have non-Hindu majorities mostly Christian . <p> But the scenario has completely changed now . Due to a variety of factors , these States now see the BJP in a new light even as the BJP has shown that it can change its image to suit local conditions . <p> With wins in the latest State Assembly elections held in late February , the BJP is in power in 22 of the 29 Indian States . It is expected to form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the single largest party . <p> The BJP won the Tripura elections convincingly by defeating the entrenched Communist Party of India ( Marxist ) . But it captured the Nagaland and Meghalaya governments by forming both pre and post polls alliances with local parties . <p> The BJP 's main aim was to dethrone the Congress and the CPI(M) in the North East . And towards that end , it encouraged local tribal parties to unite and make a bid for power with its support . It has succeeded in this endeavour . <p> In Meghalaya , the BJP has ousted the Congress brazenly by forming a post poll tie up with a formidable local party , though the Congress had emerged as the single largest party at the polls . The BJP has repeated what it did in Goa , where too , the Congress had emerged as the single largest party but could not form the government because the BJP had cleverly forged a post-poll alliance to pip the Congress to the post . <p> With wins in the latest State Assembly elections held in late February , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indian States <p> Though the BJP has only two Members of the Legislative Assembly ( MLAs ) , it encouraged Conrad Sangma 's National People 's Party ( NPP ) to tie up with other tribal parties like the UDP , HSPDP and the PDF and make a bid for power with 34 MLAs in the 60-member House to prevent Congress from forming the government as the single largest party . The BJP would be a part of the new government . <p> In contrast , the Congress failed to rope in allies just as the CPI(M) failed to do so in Tripura . <p> Why BJP succeeded ? <p> One of the reasons for the success of the BJP and the failure of the Congress and CPI(M) lies in history . In the North Eastern States , the BJP has no big baggage to carry as it is a new entrant . But the Congress and the CPI(M) have a big baggage , which is a long period of " incumbency " . <p> They are forced to safeguard their long established " primacy " in every election and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long and feel the need to continue to be that . Therefore , they are not amenable to compromise with other parties to the latter 's satisfaction . <p> It is therefore time both the Congress and the CPI(M) tried to respect other parties if they want to come back to power . <p> Architects of BJP 's victory <p> The BJP would not have registered such stunning success if it did not have good poll managers . The architects of the BJP 's successful electoral and post electoral management are its President Amit Shah and its National General Secretary Ram Madhav , whose innovative thinking and bold moves helped the party reach out to local tribal groups even though they are mostly Christians . <p> The duo was able to rid the local Christian majorities of fears that the BJP , being a Hindu nationalist party , would obliterate the uniqueness of the local tribes which are not only non-Hindu but culturally very different from the rest of the Indian population . <p> They were able to overcome the high decibel anti-BJP and anti-Hindutwa propaganda by successfully propagating the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the BJP-led Central government in New Delhi . The development cooperation line struck a chord with the educated youth looking for employment and modern facilities . <p> Anti-incumbency <p> However , clever and skilful political policies and management were not the only reasons for the BJP 's victory . It had a lot to do with anti-incumbency arising from the inability of the ruling parties to solve pressing local issues despite being in power for long . <p> In Tripura , time had run out for the CPI ( M ) and its long serving Chief Minister Manik Sarkar . Though the CPI(M) had rid the State of insurgencies , it had not solved the problems of the modern generation . <p> Roughly 30% of Tripura 's population is between 15 and 29 , but the State has one of the highest unemployment rates in India . Tripura youth fell for Modi 's promise of " HIRA " or " diamond " comprising " Highways , I-ways ( internet ) , Railways and Airways . " He promised one job per family . He also promised a huge hike in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used the rift between the immigrant Hindu Bengali majority and the local Tripura tribal . While appealing to the Hindu Bengalis on the basis of jobs and Hindutwa nationalism , the BJP overnight became the champion of the political ambitions of the tribes in the face of decades old migrant Bengali domination . <p> Nagaland <p> As an observer put it , in Nagaland , elections are not about development but about money to spend in elections and earning money through corruption after the elections . <p> Believe it or not , according to a study done by YouthNet , a youth organization in Nagaland , in the 2013 elections , candidates spent INR. 9,370 million ( US$ 144 million ) to woo voters ! To put that into perspective , the State 's total tax and non-tax revenue projected for 2017-2018 would be less at INR. 7,960 million ( US$ 122 million ) ! Naga politicians openly admit that they need money to fight elections and make money after winning elections . <p> In Nagaland , having the support of local tribal personalities is very important for winning elections.The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ local parties , the Nagaland People 's Front ( NPF ) and Nationalist Democratic Progressive Party ( NDPP ) were co-opted as allies . <p> The BJP , which had won only one seat in the 2013 Nagaland State Assembly polls , bagged 12 seats this year , while its ally , the newly-formed NDPP , won 17 seats in the 60-member House . The NPF became the single largest party in the House with 27 seats . But with the support of the Janata Dal ( United ) ' s one member , the NDPP with BJP is expected to form a government . <p> Meghalaya <p> In Meghalaya , the ruling Congress faced a challenge from regional forces like the home-grown National People 's Party ( NPP ) , a rare pre-poll alliance of the United Democratic Party ( UDP ) , Hill State People 's Democratic Party ( HSPDP ) and the Garo National Council ( GNC ) , and the new entrant BJP . <p> Though the Congress emerged as the single largest party , it could not form a government because it could not rope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had won only two seats . This was because it encouraged the NPP and other local parties to unite and make a bid for power . For such an encouragement it will be given a place in the government , albeit as a junior partner . <p> The Congress-led Meghalaya United Alliance ( MUA ) government headed by Mukul Sangmahad posed an incumbency issue . The Chief Minister was accused of running a Presidential form of government keeping with him 18 portfolios and taking arbitrary decisions . Many rebelled against this and these included Rowell Lyngdoh ( Deputy Chief Minister and legislator since 1983 ) , Prestone Tynsong ( a three-term legislator ) , Sniawbhalang Dhar , Ngaitlang Dhar and Comingone Ymbon who helped bankroll the Congress in the last elections .

Dr. de @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ military defeat of the LTTE through his regular articles to the Sinhala and English newspapers through the 1990s till the ultimate ending of the war in 2009 . In recent times and particularly after the defeat of President Mahinda Rajapaksa in 2015 , <p> Dr. de Silva in his almost daily writings on social media and the website kalaya.org has been one of the first to advocate the return of Mahinda Rajapaksa to national politics and the formation of a new party as early as April 2015 . Most recently he was vocal that President Maitripala Sirisena and the Political camp led by former President Mahinda Rajapaksa should come together to remove Ranil Wickremesinghe from the Premiership . Excerpts of the interview follow : <p> Q : Why have you been advocating for a long time that former President Mahinda Rajapaksa should be brought back to politics ? <p> Soon after the defeat of Mahinda , I knew that he should be brought back . He is the most suitable person to lead the country during this period . We organized a conference to advocate that position . Unfortunately , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , the 19th Amendment was n't there . We said that if Ranil Wickremesinghe was made the Prime Minister with 40 odd members , we should be able to bring back Mahinda . Even at that time , Mahinda had the majority in Parliament . He had the required majority . If they had moved a vote of no confidence , they could have won . <p> Even at that time , the Rajapaksas had different ideas . I am fed up with this type of politics . Even at that time , the Rajapaksas did not want to remove Ranil . They were interested in removing President Maithripala Sirisena . The Rajapaksa rule , in the opinion of westerners and Indians , was against their views . They wanted a new constitution giving more powers to Tamil racist elements . They really wanted a confederation here . They wanted to remove Rajapaksa and bring Ranil . Maithripala was a puppet . People , including me , say that Maithripala should not have defected from the then Government . What made him to defect ? <p> It was Basil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in favour of Mahinda Rajapaksa because of Basil Rajapaksa . If anybody is responsible for the defection , it is Basil . Ask Maithripala . People do not understand this . I wanted to bring back Mahinda . I knew that it was possible . Also in my opinion Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe is not just a representative of the English , Anglican Christian culture . He is one of them . Even D'Oyly spoke Sinhala . <p> Q : In the run up to the last General Elections too , you asked for the formation of a new party under the leadership of Mahinda Rajapaksa . Why did you do it at that time ? <p> I knew at that time that Sri Lanka Freedom Party ( SLFP ) was a dead party . So , I wanted them to form a new party . They did not listen to me at that time . In fact , I , along with a few others , went to meet Prof. G.L. Peiris at his residence . I met him , Dulles Alhapperuma , Wimal Weerawansa and a few others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contesting under the UPFA ticket . They did not listen to us . They contested under the UPFA ( betel leaf ) ticket . What happened ? If they had contested under a different party , Mahinda Rajapaksa could have even become the Prime Minister . If not , he could have become the Leader of the Opposition at least . Today , they can not do anything . They are MPs as members of the UPFA . The Joint Opposition is not a recognized political party . They have 51 or more members . The Tamil National Alliance ( TNA ) has only 16 members . Even then the Joint Opposition ca n't stake a claim for the post of Opposition Leader because they are UPFA MPs . Then , they are virtually members of the Government though they do not realize it . The speaker knows this . <p> When the Prime Minister got the Secretary General of Parliament to read a resolution passed in September 2015 , it said that the UNP , having obtained the majority of votes , had formed a National Government . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ numbers of non-Cabinet Ministers . The resolution said the UNP had formed the National Government as the party with the biggest majority . The problem is that the UNP is not represented in this Parliament . It is the United National Front ( UNF ) that is represented in Parliament . As far as Parliament and the Speaker are concerned , the UNP is not represented in Parliament . However , they continue to ignore that . <p> Q : Yet , they all contested under the elephant symbol of the UNP . Then , how can you say that it is not recognized ? <p> The elephant is the symbol of the UNF . The symbol does not matter . It does not matter as long as the Elections Commission recognizes it . They contested as the UNF . Then , the UNP , even as a party , though not represented in the parliament , does not have a majority . It has only 82 members . If that is the case , the Prime Minister can not say his party has the largest number of seats . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was formed . The opposition claims that there was an agreement between the UNP and the UPFA or SLFP . That is not clear . We do not still know whether the UNF ( UNP ) formed a so called National Government with the UPFA or the SLFP . The so called agreement is immaterial . The Constitution does not say there should be an agreement between the two or more parties concerned . Then , the argument of the Joint Opposition is also invalid . The Constitution only defines a National Government and states that such a National Government could have a cabinet consisting of more than 30 MPs with the approval of Parliament . The above mentioned resolution read by the Secretary of the Parliament received the approval of the Parliament to appoint a cabinet of 48 members . <p> If it is a ' National Government ' comprising the UNP as the resolution says claiming that UNP has the most number of MPs then such a claim is wrong on many counts . The so called joint opposition does not speak about it as they also want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SLFP may be recognized parties by the Elections Commission , but they are not represented in the Parliament . Whether they like it or not , the Joint Opposition is also part of this Government if the so called National Government is formed with the UPFA . If it is formed with the SLFP then there are other problems as the SLFP is not represented in the Parliament . <p> If the so called National Government has been formed by the UNF with the UPFA then there is some sense in asking the UPFA to withdraw from the Government , but in that case the joint opposition should realise that they are also withdrawing from the Government . More than that by asking the UPFA MPs to withdraw from the Government they are strengthening the hand of Wickremesinghe . Maithripala , if not impeached , will be a prisoner of Ranil . <p> There was a talk by the joint opposition about a vote of no confidence against the Prime Minister over the Central Bank bond fraud . What has happened about it ? Nobody is talking about it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bandara if and when he moves a vote of no confidence . It is the Joint Opposition as a group of MPs that should take the leadership in bringing a motion of no confidence . They now want an election . <p> How can you hold an election ? The President can not dissolve Parliament until February , 2020 . By that time , he would not be in presidency , most probably . There would be a different President at that time . I do not want to speculate on it . <p> The only way to dissolve Parliament today is by bringing a resolution in Parliament to the effect that the House declares that it should be dissolved . For that , they need a two-thirds majority . The Joint Opposition talks about it without talking about the no-confidence motion against the Prime Minister that can be passed with a simple majority . This is nothing , but humbug . The Joint Opposition can not muster two-thirds for dissolution . <p> Q : What do you think of the formation of Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna ( SLPP ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ party ? <p> The Party should have been formed before the 2015 General Elections . In February , it was able to get only 44.6 percent of votes with all these problems the country was facing . They claim it as a huge victory , though it is not . The Government is so unpopular . The cost of living is so high . There is the bond scam . With all that , the SLPP could not get more than 45 percent of votes . In the 2015 Presidential Elections Mahinda secured 48% of the vote . It has to be emphasized that I never advocated that the SLPP should form an alliance with Maithripala at the Local Government Elections . I am more concerned with the removal of Ranil as Prime Minister rather than capturing power of the local bodies . <p> Having said that , one has to remember that President Sirisena got 13 percent . Of that , I would say three percent were from the UNP vote base . Some people who are disappointed with the UNP would have voted for him . The remaining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supporters of Mahinda/Basil want to believe that these votes are from Thondaman without realizing the latter contested separately . From Mahinda 's 45 percent , at least 40 are from the nationalist camp . The nationalists have at least 50 percent together . That is more than enough to form a Government on their own . Even if the joint opposition does not want to accept ministerial posts they can still be in the Government . As UPFA members they have no alternative . Why are they ( Maithripala , Basil and Mahinda ) ignoring the Sinhala nationalist camp ? Are they under foreign influence ? <p> The Tamil parties are now in shambles . They did not get the necessary votes . There are problems . If the Sinhala people are united , the Tamil racist elements can not do anything . They understand it more than the Sinhala people . In this game , Tamil racist elements have no say if 50 percent of the Sinhala nationalist votes remain intact . They realize it more than the Rajapaksas and Sirisena . <p> How can you hold an election @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2020 . By that time , he would not be in presidency , most probably . There would be a different President at that time . I do not want to speculate on it <p> Q : In your view what should be done in the future under these circumstances ? <p> Get President Sirisena to talk with Basil Rajapaksa or Gotabhaya Rajapaksa and reach some agreement . They need to sign a document . That has to be done within the next few days . If they do not do it , that will be the end of the nationalist movement for some time . The Prime Minister will be powerful . Already , he is the Law and Order Minister , either for a temporary period or on a long term basis . Giving it to Minister Sarath Fonseka is equally harmful . They would destroy the Sinhala nationalist movement . Mr. Fonseka was the Army Commander . But , he is against the Rajapaksas . As a result , he is also against the nationalist movement . In a way he had betrayed the country on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the case who should take over as Prime Minister ? <p> I would go for former President Mahinda Rajapaksa . Different Rajapaksas have different mindsets . I am for Mahinda because he is the best person . If it is not Mahinda , somebody from the Joint Opposition should be appointed . If they are not ready for it , somebody from the Maithripala faction in the Government should be chosen . It could be anybody like Ministers Dayasiri Jayasekara , Susil Premajayantha or S.B. Dissanayake . Definitely , it should not be Minister Duminda Dissanayake . <p> Q : On the other hand there is an opinion that the stance taken by you is being racist and excludes the minorities . Your view ? <p> I am not a racist . I recognize that the Sinhala Buddhist culture should be given its due place . If that is racism all the western countries are racist . They have dominant Christian cultures in their countries . Please remember that I am not asking for a dominant place for the Sinhala Buddhiist culture . The Christian culture especially in its Anglican @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world as well . Our education is Christian . The Judiciary system , the Parliament and almost all the others are Christian . What is the place given for traditional ( paramparika ) medicine in Sri Lanka . There is not even a Vaidya Sabha even in the western format for traditional medicine . The list is long , and I have written on these during the past thirty five years or so . The English wanted to destroy the Sinhala Buddhist culture , but they failed . However , they have succeeded in weakening the Sinhala Buddhist culture . The English created Tamil racism and baptized it in 1833 , which I have explained in An Analysis of Tamil Racism , in order to weaken if not destroy the Sinhala Buddhist culture . With Nandikadal , Tamil racism was defeated . A military solution is also a political solution . The Tamil racist ' problem ' created by the English has been solved . There is no need for further talks on this matter . Would Churchill have spoken to the Nazis after the so called second world war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the support of the politicians , to win back their lost rights . If you call it racism , then what do you call Christian hegemony throughout the world ? Please remember that it was the Sinhala people who protected the Muslims from the Portuguese Catholics , and settled them in the present Eastern Province , and protected the Catholics from the Dutch Reformists . <p> Q : How do you see the present Constitution making process and where it is heading ? <p> If the present Prime Minister is allowed to get himself established by the Rajapaksas , he will get the new Constitution that would pave the way for a confederation hook or by crook . The Constitutional Assembly is a dangerous instrument that Ranil could make use of to establish the new constitution without presenting it to the Parliament citing the 1972 constitution as an example . He could even claim to be a follower of Bandaranaike policies by extending the Parliament for another five years .

Dr. Indrajit Coomaraswamy who assumed office as CBSL Governor from July 3 , 2016 must bear some responsibility . The chequered response of the CBSL particularly in recent times to its regulatory obligations has no doubt aided this outcome . <p> Discerning visitors to Sri Lanka have commented on the mismatch on the one hand of a country with a weak economy and infrastructure bending over backwards for FDIs and financial assistance from multi-lateral agencies and on the other the swanky high-rise apartments and fancy restaurants dotting the city of Colombo with high-end vehicles which would do even a first world country in Europe proud . <p> Crucial issues of governance incidental to the egregious bond scam thrown up by witnesses at the Presidential Commission @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bonds by the CBSL which include possible tax evasion , money laundering and bank malpractice are not even on the radar of the CBSL . The only exception is the ' suspension ' of Pan Asia Bank ( PABC ) in relation to its ' primary dealer ' activities . <p> Money Laundering / Tax Evasion ? <p> What action has CBSL taken in relation to : <p> 1 ) Kaushitha Rathnaveera , a Senior Dealer of PTL ( Perpetual Treasuries Limited ) disclosing to the PCoI that " millions " encashed by him were " several times " left on " PTL 's CEO Kasun Palisena 's chair " . <p> Nuwan Salgado , Chief Dealer of PTL disclosing to the PCoI that on the " instructions of PTL 's CEO Kasun Palisena " he maintained a record of payments to " informants " code named as ' Charlie ' , ' Tango ' and others . <p> 2 ) B. R. Sinniah , Chief Financial Officer of GTLPL ( Global Transportation and Logistics Pvt Ltd ) said to be controlled by former Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake 's family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chairman ' Lakshmi Kanthan ' who resides in Britain had arrived at the Company on two occasions in February 2016 and 2017 and dumped cash amounting to Rs.145 million in the Chairman 's safe " . " It had not been supported by any documentation or receipt issued to Lakshmi Kanthan neither were there any entries in the GTLPL accounts books regarding these two cash inflows " <p> 3 ) B. R. Sinniah also telling the PCoI : " The Rs.145 million used in making the initial payment of Rs.16.5 million and thereafter to pay the monthly loan installment of Rs.11 million " for the purchase of the ' Monarch ' Penthouse in Colombo by a company owned by the then Minister Ravi Karunanayake 's family " has no origin nor has it been accounted for " . Should these not concern the CBSL and the Inland Revenue Department ? <p> PEPs as Bank Directors <p> Politically Exposed Persons ( PEPs ) are at the centre of the worldwide efforts for the prevention of money laundering . <p> The CBSL consistent with international best practice defines PEPs as : <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or abroad who are , or have been , entrusted with prominent public functions " e.g. Heads of State or of government , senior politicians , senior government , judicial or military officials , senior executives of State-owned corporations , important political party officials . Business relationships with family members or close associates of PEPs involve reputation risks similar to those with PEPs themselves . " <p> 1 ) Based on this definition it is not difficult to discern there are prominent PEPs in Sri Lanka who are currently ' directors ' of banks . One such person is a ' man for all seasons ' under successive administrations who is a frequent writer on governance . Others include a banking sector regulator and a senior member of the judiciary who became bank directors soon after retirement . <p> 2 ) When even the mere " Opening of accounts " in banks by PEPs is under scrutiny in Sri Lanka , how could the Director of Bank Supervision advise me there is " no restriction for appointments of PEPs as Board members of licensed banks " . <p> The Central @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ untenable response subsequent to my e-mail of July 5 , 2017 to Dr. Coomaraswamy . <p> It must be flagged that although all PEPs are not involved in money laundering or unlawful activities , the high risk they pose can not be ignored . Laws and guidelines are there for a purpose and must be adhered to . <p> 3 ) It was revealed at the Bond Commission that B.R. Sinniah was " appointed to the Board of Directors of the BoC in 2015 by the then Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake for a period of one year " . <p> This demonstrates the hopeless situation in Sri Lanka when the Finance Minister himself appoints the Chief Financial Officer of his family-controlled company to the Board of Directors of the Bank of Ceylon . <p> Ravi Karunanayake being a PEP is a no-brainer . B.R. Sinniah too is clearly a PEP as per the CBSL definition which is consistent with international best practice . Under no circumstances is it suggested that Ravi Karunanayake , B.R. Sinniah or all PEPs are engaged in unlawful activities . Nevertheless , the high risk PEPs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had presumably ceased being a bank director when Dr. Coomaraswamy assumed the position of CBSL governor , the fact of the matter is that under his watch too there are PEPs who are bank directors . <p> 4 ) During the tenure of former CBSL Governor - Ajith Nivard Cabraal , his sister Shiromi Wickramasinghe - clearly a PEP - was a bank ' Director ' which included being Chairman of ' State owned ' entity HDFC Bank ( Housing Development Finance Corporation ) . The CBSL is continuing to turn a blind eye to its own guidelines and laws . <p> SL has earned the dubious distinction to be listed by the EU as a ' high risk country for money laundering ' <p> Bank Malpractice ? <p> 1 ) A gaping hole in the PCoI report is the ' pussyfooting ' on the Bank of Ceylon giving PTL access to billions of rupees almost instantly which enabled PTL with the aid of " inside information " to make a ' killing ' in the secondary Bond market at the further expense of state institutions which include the hard-earned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The PCoI report states that at a meeting " convened " on March 28 , 2016 by Ravi Karunanayake the then Minister of Finance " three State Banks had been instructed to place Bids within a specified range of Yield Rates at the Treasury Bond Auction to be held on March 29 , 2016 and that , the three State Banks had been given an assurance that , Bids at higher Yield Rates would not be accepted at this Auction . " <p> The State banks concerned : - Bank of Ceylon , People 's Bank and National Savings Bank - adhering to these ' instructions ' had significantly benefited PTL financially and resulted in an ' opportunity loss ' to the state banks . <p> 3 ) It was also revealed at the PCoI that Saman Kumara , the then dealer for the EPF at the CBSL , had allegedly received a personal loan of Rs. 25 million from PABC when Nimal Perera was Chairman . It is relevant to ascertain whether this loan and its settlement ( if any ) took place in the ordinary course of banking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 4 ) Although it was the EPF that by far suffered the major loss due to purchases of Treasury Bonds in the secondary market from PTL , another non-bank financial institution that reportedly took a substantial hit was the Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation ( SLIC ) . <p> Should these not be of interest to CBSL 's ' Bank Supervision ' and ' Non-Bank Supervision ' Departments ? <p> Tax Evasion in ' Leading Bank ' ? <p> After the damning allegations in a website of an alleged tax evasion in a leading bank was brought to the attention of CBSL Governor , Dr. Indrajit Coomaraswamy on September 25 , 2017 , it took the CBSL 42 days to advise me ( i ) " CBSL has not carried out any investigations " ( ii ) " the statements " in the article " are factually incorrect " ( iii ) " The matter is being brought to the attention of the Inland Revenue Department . " <p> The allegations include : - <p> i ) Some portion of the " evaded tax " was " divided between the tax @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ involved " <p> It begs the questions:1 ) How " the statements " contained in the article " are factually incorrect " if " CBSL has not carried out any investigations " ? <p> ii ) " The current Chairperson of the Bank Rani Jayamaha has also been able to identify the wrongdoing through an internal probe " ( since then there is another chairperson ) <p> 2 ) Why it has taken CBSL 42 days ( from my initial e-mail of September 25 ) to belatedly state " The matter is being brought to the attention of the Inland Revenue Department . " ? <p> 3 ) Has CBSL brought it " to the attention of the Inland Revenue Department " even now ? If not why ? <p> Much was expected from incumbent CBSL Governor Dr. Coomaraswamy who has been in the saddle for 20 months . <p> Whether CBSL has investigated the legitimacy of the Sri Lankan accounts in the ' Panama Papers ' ? <p> Conclusion <p> In the context of the foregoing -- particularly the absence of the political will to enforce existing laws and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dangerous to have in the statute book the recently enacted ' Foreign Exchange Act , No. 12 of 2017 ' which further liberalizes foreign exchange transactions which in effect is conducive for money laundering if people are so inclined . The Act inter alia states " The Central Bank shall as the agent of the Government , be responsible for implementing the provisions of this Act " . <p> One would have expected Dr. Coomaraswamy at the very least to have publicly cautioned the government against the enactment of such an Act . <p> Do these not have implications for the integrity of the proposed ' Colombo International Financial City ' ? Dr. Coomaraswamy has also failed to respond to the questions posed to him in my e-mail of August 30 , 2017 in regard to Sri Lankan citizens allegedly linked to offshore companies in tax havens revealed in the ' Panama Papers ' which include : <p> " Whether the CBSL has investigated the legitimacy of the Sri Lankan accounts in the ' Panama Papers ' ? " One of the persons named -- a prominent corporate personality who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a Bank . <p> The writer is not suggesting or implying that the mere listing of names and entities in tax havens is indicative of wrongdoing . Nevertheless it is incumbent on the CBSL to ascertain legitimacy . Tardiness on the part of CBSL does injustice to those who have legitimate accounts . <p> The CBSL which was at the centre of the egregious Bond Scam ( prior to Dr. Coomaraswamy assuming office ) definitely requires a thorough clean-up . Will this convincingly happen ? <p> The tragedy is that the alternative to the Yahapalana government is also disconcerting unless there is a radical course correction .

Perhaps , it was the way Somawathi Chaitya was ' rediscovered ' . It was rediscovered in the 1940s and archaeological excavations began in 1964 . Archaeologists have unearthed several artifacts including , stone inscriptions , moonstones , flower pedestals and Siripathul gala ( footprint ) . It is believed , one Prince Giri Aba who was married to Princess Somawathi , sister of King Kavantissa , built the Chaitya in 2nd Century AD . They lived in and ruled over an area known as Somapura , which was located at the bed of the Mahaweli Ganga , and the Somawathi Chaitya has been built on the request of the princess who wanted a Vihara to perform religious activities . <p> The most significant event of the place is that the right Sacred Tooth Relic of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and is believed to be one of the two remaining tooth relics in the world , the other being the one at Sri Dalada Maligawa , in Kandy . The Somawathi Chaitya was maintained by several kings who succeeded Prince Aba . However , it was later abandoned during foreign invasions . <p> Again , in 1987 , the Somawathi Chaitya came under a terrorist attack . The Bhikkus and civilians who resided in the Vihara and the nearby village of Sungawila fled for safety . The entire area of the temple and Somawathi wildlife sanctuary was largely abandoned for over 20 years until the temple was renovated in 2002 , during a ceasefire with the Government and LTTE and reopened to the public . Now , it is regularly visited by pilgrims and has become a fairly popular tourist attraction as well . <p> Another unique phenomenon at the Somawathi Chaitya is the radiation of beams of light ( Budu Res or Buddha rays ) from the pinnacle of the Chaitya . This phenomenon was first reported in 1977 and then in 1981 , 2002 and 2006 . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ temple , however , it remains an unexplained mystery . <p> Two week ago , I had an opportunity to visit this sacred site with a group of devotees who offer Puja to the sacred Chaitya annually , and took part in the Puja with them , both day and night . <p> Day 1 - 4 pm <p> We knew from our travels to Somawathi Chaitya , that if you want to have the best experience at tourist sites , you must reach the site as early as possible and reserve rooms which suit you , from the temple authorities . We booked three rooms for a day , which cost us Rs. 2,500 each . We started our journey from Ratnapura in the morning and reached Somawathi around 4 pm . Having parked our vehicles under a shady tree and kept our belongings in our rooms , we walked to the Chaitya premises with brooms to sweep the compound of the Chaitya , it being the duty of each devotee who comes to offer the Puja of the day . At dusk , the setting sun gives vibrant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the landscape and you would spend some time gaping in awe at the Chaitya premises . You have to be ready for the first event of the Puja . <p> 7 pm <p> Gilanpasa Puja ( tea and herbal offering ) is offered to the Chaitya by devotees who flocked to the temple taking Puja under embellished umbrellas in a procession . A Bhikku from the temple observes the Puja chanting stanzas for around an hour . Each devotee has his or her turn in the Puja of the day until it ends with the mid-day Buddha Puja , the following day . To offer the Puja , each devotee reaches the temple from various parts of the country on his/her day with relatives and friends . There are spacious rooms available for devotees who come to the temple . Food is not allowed inside rooms , which is good , because it 's kept really clean . There are eating areas built close to the rooms . You will need to get plenty of rest , because the next day you have to be up early . <p> Day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cold morning is tough . But , not when you are near the Somawathi Chaitya . <p> The sheer anticipation of getting a glimpse of nature 's wonders can fill the air with a spiritual atmosphere . Devotees engage in sweeping the compound of the Chaitya at dawn . They sweep the sandy earth neatly . Indeed , it seems to be part of the meditation practice . Meantime , the rising sun on the Eastern horizon like a fire ball is a sight to behold . <p> 7 am <p> Now , it is time for morning ' Kiripidu Puja ' ( milk rice offering ) as devotees clad in white costumes flock in front of the temple 's alms hall to take the Puja under colourful umbrellas in procession , to the Chaitya . The devotees walk in single file carrying bowls filled with milk rice and other offerings to offer to the Chaitya .

It is carried by many devotees in procession with Hevisi sounds around the Chaitya to be wrapped around it . After the Puja is finished , you 'll arrive at your rest room utterly exhausted . You would need to get a little rest after a cup of tea and be ready for the next event . <p> 11 am <p> This is the last and final event of the Puja , the ' Buddha Puja ' ( mid-day alms offering ) . With this , all the events of the Puja terminate , invoking blessings on the devotees who take part in the Puja , by a senior Bhikku of the temple . This last event is rather unique because devotees need to prepare 32 curries for a single Puja which comes from age-old tradition . Every day , this tradition has to be performed in the offering as a ritual . The same method is performed at the Sri Dalada Maligawa in Kandy where the left sacred Tooth Relic is housed .

It is 37,645.5 hectares and was established first as a wildlife sanctuary in1966 , and then as a national park . It is home to a wide variety of animals , the most commonly sighted being elephants . This is mainly because the area consists of villu which the elephants love to eat . <p> A sad scene we witnessed at the site was the elephants consuming food left over by pilgrims .

@@24490237 <h> Mounting debt threatens Sustainable Development Goals <p> 2018-05-04 09:56:22 <p> 0 <p> 199 <p> In 2015 , 193 countries adopted the 17 Sustainable Development Goals ( SDGs ) as an overarching policy roadmap through 2030 . These goals are predicated on the idea that for a sustainable future , economic growth must go hand-in-hand with social inclusion and protection of the environment . <p> Our respective institutions , the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs ( UNDESA ) and International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) , fully support these goals . From the UN perspective , they represent a down payment on a more peaceful , prosperous and cooperative world , especially in increasingly perilous times . For the IMF , they help underpin economic stability and sustainable and inclusive economic growth . <p> In 2017 , most types of development financing flows increased , helped by an upturn in the world economy , increased investment and supportive financial market conditions . Yet , less than three years after adoption , the implementation of the SDGs is running into a major hurdle -- rising public debt in some developing countries . This is the sobering message @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the UN , in collaboration with the IMF and almost 60 other agencies . Here 's the problem : as noted recently by IMF Deputy Managing Director Tao Zhang , 40 percent of low-income countries face high risk of debt distress or are unable to service their debt fully -- this is up from 21 percent just five years ago . On top of this , several developing countries are also falling behind in terms of per capita income , induced by such factors as fragility and conflict -- these include vulnerable countries like Haiti , D.R. Congo , and Chad . <p> Low tax revenue , weak international support <p> A key problem is that many of these countries are not able to raise enough public revenue . There are many reasons for this -- narrow tax bases , continued over-reliance on extractive industries and weak tax administration . But tax evasion is also part of the problem . The low tax take in low income developing countries -- where the median tax revenue is just 13.3 percent of gross domestic product -- can be traced in part to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the first step of any reform strategy must surely be to raise more revenue at home . But in a world where business activity has become increasingly global , domestic efforts alone will not be enough . We will also need enhanced international collaboration on tax . It is encouraging that governments are developing new international standards on exchange of tax information -- we need to make sure that developing countries also benefit from this . <p> Official development assistance ( ODA ) also has a vital role to play . According to recently released data , ODA amounted to US $ 146.6 billion in 2017 . But this amounts to less than half the internationally-agreed target of 0.7 percent of gross national income . And a growing share of ODA is being deployed for emergencies such as in-country refugee costs and humanitarian aid . While such aid is critical , it leaves less available for long-term public investments in sustainable development . ODA inflows toward the poorest and most vulnerable countries have stagnated and remain concentrated in a few of them . Donor countries need to step up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ support of SDGs <p> Given the large investment needs , attracting more private investment will be critical . But the least developed countries still struggle to do so at scale , particularly in sectors outside extractive industries . The report calls on developing countries to continue building competitive business environments , including by improving institutional and regulatory frameworks and developing project pipelines and investible projects -- especially in infrastructure . <p> More recently , policymakers have also focused on sharing risks with private investors , through instruments such as guarantees and public-private partnerships . If done correctly , such blending activities can potentially unlock additional SDG investments . For now , they are mostly bypassing countries where the need is greatest . Only 7 percent of private finance so far mobilized was directed toward projects in the least developed countries . <p> There is also a risk that such activities will also add to debt burdens , including through contingent off-balance sheet liabilities . These risks need to be managed carefully . <p> Growing debt risks <p> The recent growth in debt is not all bad news , however . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creditors such as China , has unlocked the much-needed financing for infrastructure investments in recent years . And investment in productive capacity , if done right , can lead to higher income that offsets debt service . The report recommends that assessments of debt sustainability take this important channel into consideration . <p> But problems arise when debt is already high , when resources are not spent well ( including in the presence of corruption and governance weaknesses ) or when a country is hit by natural disasters or economic shocks such as sudden reversals of capital flows . Another issue is that the new wave of private credit often comes with higher interest rates and shorter maturities . And coordination among creditors has become harder , which creates problems when debt restructuring is needed . <p> When the risk of debt crisis is high , a quick response to lessen the immediate financial stress can make all the difference between rapid recovery and long-lasting harm . We need to think hard about innovative solutions here . For example , a greater use of state-contingent debt instruments -- which reduce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can provide some relief in some cases . By reducing default risks and risk premiums , they also expand available fiscal space for investment . <p> The bottom line is that we only have 12 years left in which to implement the SDGs . The current upswing in the global economy opens up a vital window of opportunity but we must make sure that the financing agenda is not derailed by mounting public debt . <p> The UN and IMF are united in this common cause . This is demonstrated by our collaborative report , which puts forth recommendations on public finance and debt , private investments , trade and other critical priorities for SDG financing . Our institutions are committed to deepening our support for the SDGs , in the service of our member countries , to secure a more prosperous and peaceful world . <p> ( Christopher Lane is Special Representative of the International Monetary Fund to the United Nations .

@@25475230 <h> A.H.M. Fahim responds to United Hajj Union 's allegations <p> The Muslim Religious Affairs Minister 's Private Secretary A.H.M. Fahim last week responded to allegations of money laundering through hajj pilgrims and vends quota by accepting bribes that were made by United Hajj Union agencies to the Hajj Committee and Ministry of Muslim Religious Affairs on 24 June . <p> He said the Hajj Committee was formed under the patronage of the ministry and managed by Board Chairman Dr. Ziyad Thaha , as well as three top Sri Lankan lawyers namely Ilyas Admani , Shiraz Noordeen and S.M.M. Yaseen , Former Department of Muslim Religious and Cultural Affairs Director Y.L.M. Navavi , All Ceylon Jamiyyathul Ulama Additional Secretary Moulavi Thaseem and former Ministry of City Planning and Water Supply Additional Secretary Muinudeen Hanifa to maintain the system according to the law . <p> He said this Board of Directors was a list of high-profile members of society who are considered genuine individuals who are in charge of the Hajj Committee with the aim of rendering its services to the Muslim community without expecting any profits or advantages from the operators or hajis . He asked that if the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from pilgrims then why did the ministry appoint a panel of inquiry under the supervision of previously retired Judge Abdul Majeed . <p> ' ' If we want to make deals out of this holy tour why would we drive down the price and raise up the services when we can easily trade quotas for higher rates , " he added . <p> Fahim said that the United Hajj Union which made the allegations was actually fake and was first of all neither an association nor a union since it had not been registered under the ministry . We challenge them to show us the registration of the association . We have only approved two associations -- the All Ceylon Hajj Operators and Hajj Group Association . <p> ' ' All Ceylon Hajj Organisation Vice President M.S.H. Mohamed acted as a puppet for the United Hajj Union . I appreciate the effort he took to set up a PET scanner for the cancer hospital but because he did one good thing for society , there is n't an impact on the Muslim community if he is not being reliable . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ National Shoora Council , All Ceylon Jamiyyathul Ulama and Young Men Muslim Association approved carrying out the latest structure , " he asserted . Highlighting the reasons behind changing the policy system in 2015 , he explained the guideline that was initiated by the Supreme Court in 2013 . The ministry has closely examine the guidelines which specifically articulates a section . <p> " The subject minister in power has control to change the rules and regulations according to the required needs of the system to function " so the ministry has looked into the guideline and brought key changes to the system such as selecting the operators , giving an opportunity to pilgrims to choose their own tour operators , providing EPF and ETF for the operators ' staff and Credit Information Bureau ( CRIB ) reports of the operators . " The ministry 's previous administrators considered only one part of the guideline specifically on distributing the given quotas for the operators . <p> " We only implement the policy which says that the hajjis that had been registered with the department should be given an opportunity to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The ministry has added a few changes in registering operators to the system . Operators must provide a CRIB report to verify their financial reliability , a general test to analyse the knowledge of the operators on Hajj and Umrah , according to the marking scheme the quotas ' distributors to the operators and investigating whether employees of the operators have given EPF and ETF . <p> " We did n't practise any injustice with the operators in marking all the quota distribution , whoever got marking to their level was equally given quota . " <p> In Sri Lanka about 4,500-5,500 people are willing to go to hajj every year but visas are available only for 2,240 applicants . <p> He explained the faults of operators and how they treat the pilgrims and provide their services . The earlier system had caused much discomfort to pilgrims . <p> ' ' When a particular operator has a fixed quota of 50 and hajjis were treated in a bad manner they would be denied from travelling with the tour operator since other quotas were full and they were left without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in groups but operators who have a quota of 10 would say they have only two slots available . The rest of the members would have to go separately . Such practical issues can be seen in the earlier Hajj tour system , ' ' he added . <p> " According to Saudi rules , we have to provide licences for up to a minimum of 50 people for a bus therefore an operator should bring 50 individuals as a team . To maintain that we have to manage only 30 operators . " ' ' This year we got a quota of 3,000 from Saudi . Out of the 3,000 we are sending almost 2,850 hajis . The trade quota was completely a false statement , we ca n't sell quotas . Also they claim 500 slots were received by staff . None of them is from the department or ministry . It was received by the operator 's staff . " <p> Fahim went on to state : " The statement of sending quotas of around 5,400 to agencies is somewhat right . From December we have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 6,250 letters . We were running out of time . The association is pushing to do it fast so we advertised in the media . Whoever registered with us up to December can come and pay an advance as a refundable deposit and confirm their willingness to attend Hajj . Whoever has been depositing the money and has registered here gets the receipt . And we tell them you are on the waiting list . This money does n't go to the minister 's account or hajj committee 's account or the director 's account . It goes to the Hajj Fund account . " <p> He added that if they had provided the money without registration they could claim the money back . <p> " These two operators associations met with us and they requested us to charge a Rs. 50,000 refundable deposit . They have taken this refundable deposit last year . Also specifically this is not a charge . Registration is free and we take a refundable deposit to confirm their willingness to go . <p> " So we take this Rs. 25,000 as a refundable deposit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave Sri Lanka . Before they proceed to the hajj it is refunded to them . Anyway , we keep 200 people on the waiting list . At the last minute a lot will get dropped due to financial problems in previous years . This system has helped people who are saving money for the Hajj , " he said . <p> " The guideline lists a minimum of 2,000 not a maximum of 2,000 . When the administration is 2,000 we do n't have enough funds to run the Hajj and the currency variation , most of this is spent in Saudi for the hajj committee , so the administration fee , whether it is 4,000 or 10,000 , goes to the hajj fund not to the ministry .

@@25475232 <h> A real Swiss lesson -- Merci ! <p> This is all about an experience but more so placing on record an experiential learning . Those who read this may take their own interpretations or reflect with more questions . I am giving a perception I do value . <p> Landing in Switzerland coming from Sri Lanka for a change I felt like a big brother . Usually this is not an experience Sri Lankans can have unless you are a frequent flyer to Maldives ! My country is bigger than yours and there was no feeling of a citizen from a small country which meant that I should not be cowed about ! We also have numbers to boast of ( or worry about ? ! ) comparing 22 million to 8.4 million Swiss . <p> Well , the rest of data really puts you in place ! The relationship between the Sri Lankan Rupee and Swiss Franc ( CHF ) is like David and Goliath and that limits seriously your purchasing aspirations . Consistently the world 's No. 1 country in the Global Innovation Index , I still have the visuals of proudly Swiss Made analogue watches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after disembarking . <p> Even though the mobile can give you the accurate time , the Swiss have been able to keep their watch industry thriving and with even dedicated Museums ( Philippe Patek museum in Geneva ) to showcase Swiss design talent . Quality in design and aesthetic appeal can preserve institutions even perhaps well after their technical age of relevance -- they are not simple watches but monuments for displaying time . <p> Star-class sustainability mindset <p> My time was spent within the confines of a technical university EPFL ( Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Lausanne ) presently ranked 22nd in the global scale ( QS rating ) . I do not dare open my rating for discussion . The metro stopped next to my place of stay at the University and I could directly step into it from the platform . <p> Bikes go in and come out of the train with passengers . Bikes to hire over the web are evident and 80% of the commuters to the campus are soft mobility converts . There is a repair shop dedicated to bicycles and all facilities are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bikes repaired by themselves for free . Of course you can outsource your problem to a technical support available but then it will be at a significant cost . So all students are competent in repair work and a skill aspect goes up a notch in the community . <p> When I met the Head of the Energy Group ( Prof. Scartezzini ) he told me that the campus is planning to ban cars in the near future . Now there would not be any agitation over car permits at EPFL for sure . The campus has 15,000 m2 of PV panels on its roofs , triple glazing in buildings ( dating back 30 years or so ) , no hot water in washbasins , ecological green spaces ( no electric lawn mowers and when the need arrives sheep do the honours ) . EPFL is really a campus operated with a sustainable mindset and all its practices are star-class well worthy of emulation . <p> An aspect I learnt was their interest and commitment towards low carbon transformation . The entire EPFL is cooled and heated from a heat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also noticed their reluctance to use air conditioning even though the temperatures were in the 30s ( centigrade ) . <p> At EPFL , research was quite visual as they appear to put into practice what they are doing transforming the university to an experimental lab . Prof. Scartezzini has the idea that university is a mini-city and that definition allows you to reach for scale from your own confines . You walk through spaces and scientific comments greet you , not absurd graffiti ! <p> One research of developing paint to coat train wagons gave me a lesson . The development of the paint had been with a view to reducing the air conditioning load . Upon inventing the paint they have identified that passengers within can not use their cellular phones and after another back to the drawing board -- voila ! Another major development . <p> What is interesting is a simple requirement had been converted to a highly-advanced development and then the final result -- saving of operational expenditure , gaining of advanced scientific knowledge , etc . All the more sweeter is the researchers have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Morpho -- true biomimetic research well in tune with an eco design . <p> EPFL 's Convention Centre -- A world 's first <p> Famous scientist Michael Gratzel heralds from EPFL and his award-winning invention of dye sensitised solar cells adorn the fa ? ade of EPFL 's Convention Centre -- A world 's first . And Gratzel was trying mimic the leaf ! Go to the university bookshop and you will find a G-cell based haversack for sale . 100% electricity used by EPFL is from renewables . <p> You find that the EPFL Convention Centre has a design of its own with the integration more emerging energetic technologies . The entire centre rests on 30-metre-deep geothermal pillars -- a design of EPFL 's Soil Mechanics lab . Passage of heat transmitting fluids in these pillars exchange heat of the ground with the building . The sanitary hot water used is generated by heat produced by the fridges , one option among a few , and heat is 100% renewable . I was quite happy to see food waste being turned into biogas and there were vehicle powered by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plenary room natural light is made use of . The researchers at EPFL including one Sri Lankan were analysing and modelling cities of multiple countries . While Dasun who specialises in distributed urban energy systems was showing me around the campus , his model analysis for Lund in Sweden was running in the cloud ! <p> The lesson in this short sojourn courtesy of EPFL of course is to understand you tackle local issues but produce world-class solutions and develop cutting edge abilities . Your system is your laboratory and the mind is about finding the best solution there is -- not a one of approximation . <p> I can see why even the Germans rate Swiss efficiency to be better than theirs and I do have some experience of the former . While we have been able to snatch defeat from victory as well as defeat subsequent to victory , the Swiss demonstrate the way forward . <p> I listened to why Swiss came up with the CERN -- the largest laboratory in the world ! And they pumped in money when they had much less and more issues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their talent in the country and today CERN draws in plenty of talent with many Nobel prizes and as the birthplace of the touch screen and the World Wide Web . A lesson in investing wisely and not asking for subsidies and handouts but taking charge of one 's own destiny . <p> Swiss pride <p> A short journey outside the campus , the social event of the conference was taking all of us to a UNESCO heritage site and you may be initially excused for thinking of seeing ruins and medieval fortresses -- no , the visit was to Lavaux vineyards which is the UNESCO heritage site -- a location with stunning scenery . <p> Families who were growing and producing vines were able to show 1,300 years of lineage and located alongside the Lake Geneva they speak of moving their village after a tsunami . Tsunami without a sea and by the side of a lake -- that has happened due to a part of mountain crashing down to the lake around 560 and that had created a 10m high wave ! While they served wine I contended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the estate where Taylor started it all for Ceylon is not even in a popular tourist trail back home . <p> It was evident that the Swiss are proud of their cows too in addition to their watches . Well you receive your visa in Colombo and the courtyard stands a big sculpture of a cow ! I can not imagine what our Sri Lankan embassies are showcasing ! ? Your take-home memorabilia are of course various types of happy cows ! And cowbells ( kuhglocke ) quite elaborately decorated . <p> Of course one is reminded that world 's No. 1 food industry is based in Switzerland when among displays of watches you see Nespresso designs . It was also evident that they love their cheese when fondue is a national dish , reminding anyone of their past too . Fast food is mainly for visitors and they want to know from where what they eat comes from and they prefer the produce to be from within , having trust on how they produce . Of course the Swiss revolutionised chocolates by adding milk and we all have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important lesson was EPFL 's sustainability mindset and the emerging social innovativeness ; Switzerland did portray a country with four languages -- a polyglot paradise perhaps ; a style of architecture which now they speak out to the outside with -- modern architecture ; research culture that solves local situations but results in globally best solutions ; an attitude as demonstrated with CERN investing for the future ; a country of a few million people in a small land mass that has managed to scale the development ladder effectively .

Soon after he took office on January 20 , 2017 , Mr. Trump pulled the US out of the Trans-Pacific agreement and in recent days has criticised the World Trade Orgnisation ( WTO ) which the US itself helped to create . <p> After the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one-to-one meeting in Helsinki with Russian leader Vladimir Putin whom he has praised though the US intelligence agencies and the Senate 's intelligence committee said on Monday there was substantial evidence that Mr. Putin 's Russia meddled with the November 2016 US election and helped Mr. Trump to win . Mr. Trump has also expressed a liking for China 's possibly lifetime leader Xi Jinping though the persistently inconsistent US President is also having a trade war with China . Mr. Trump , a billionaire businessman known to have a desire to win every deal has also expressed admiration for Turkey 's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and also the North Korean leader Kim Jong-un whom he met in Singapore last month and later described the dictator as a strong and responsible leader who is loved by his people . Most analysts believe Mr. Trump 's tweets and declarations may be based on his dislike of the checks and balances in parliamentary democracy and how these prevent him from doing whatever he wants to do . <p> The analysts say that though he may like to be a lifetime President there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Constitution -- known to be one of the most enlightened documents produced by the human beings -- prevents him from going beyond the two four-year terms . <p> Abraham Lincoln , known and admired as one of the greatest US Presidents , has declared that democracy is the government of the people , for the people and by the people . So there is no way Mr. Trump can change this democracy where there are checks and balances among the executive , the legislature , the judiciary and the free media -- the four pillars of democracy . <p> According to a UN statement , this is the first time the world body is celebrating the International Day of Parliamentarism . It is the 1889 date on which the Inter-Parliamentary Union -- the global organization of parliaments -- was established . This Day celebrates parliaments and the ways in which parliamentary systems of government improve the day-to-day lives of people the world over . It is also an opportunity for parliaments to take stock , identify challenges and ways to address them effectively . <p> In Sri Lanka we saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2015 with the 19th Amendment substantially reducing the powers of the Executive President . But almost three years after the August 2015 Parliamentary election what we see today is an unstable situation if not a muddle with MPs going here , there and sometimes nowhere . <p> If we could have MPs who have the inner gift of honesty and integrity and the spirit of serving the people sincerely , sacrificially and selflessly then only would we have real parliamentary democracy with a just , fair and all inclusive society . There is a long long way to go , but for the sake of the country and the people especially the next generation , we hope we could do so though unfortunately a religious leader recently suggested even a Hitler-type dictator to run the country .

Again , as per their rhetoric , they abhor injustice , corruption , nepotism , graft , misuse of state resources and abuse of authority , among other things . <p> Yahapalanaya , in the way the term has been used by its advocates , is not just about good governance . Yahapalanist rhetoric has waved many other flags , with noble objectives beautifully embroidered on them . They have called for a separation of religion and state , regularly rant and rave against assertion of identity ( usually limited to those by Sinhalese and Buddhists ) and insist that Sri Lanka is a multi-ethnic and multi-religious country ( carefully omitting relevant numbers and percentages ) . As such we have to take ' yahapalanaya ' as a political concept that embraces all these things and it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the sense the term is used here , refers to all those in the United National Party ( UNP ) , the Sri Lanka Freedom Party ( SLFP ) and other parties who directly or indirectly backed Maithripala Sirisena 's presidential campaign and all individuals and organizations opposed to the previous regime . <p> All right . Various key yahapalana spokespersons have often dismissed and vilified their political rivals , in particular key personalities in the joint opposition and the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna ( SLPP ) as well as those in organizations claiming to represent Sinhalese and Buddhists . They have been called racists and chauvinists . They are said to be out of touch with the times , accused of living in the past and being obstacles to progress . <p> Now both the parties led by the President and Prime Minister , the SLFP and UNP respectively , have a long history of positions taken than yahapalanists would not hesitate to call chauvinistic , racist , extremist and intolerant <p> This is not a defence of those accused thus . The ululation notwithstanding , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respect to some of those charged . The issue here , however , is about the integrity of the accusers , or put another way , the yahapalanist worthy of the yahapalanists . In short , the question is , ' do/can they put their money where their mouths are ? ' <p> Now both the parties led by the President and Prime Minister , the SLFP and UNP respectively , have a long history of positions taken than yahapalanists would not hesitate to call chauvinistic , racist , extremist , intolerant , etc . These parties have spawned many leaders who have in their operations turned the basic premises of yahapalanaya on their proverbial heads and kicked them in their proverbial behinds to boot . Furthermore , it is not as though the current lot are squeaky clean when it comes to upholding the yahapalana articles of faith . Let us be generous , however . <p> Let us assume , for arguments sake , that the yahapalanists are actually abiding by yahapalana principles . Assuming thus , among all litmus tests one can theoretically conduct to ascertain integrity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the run up to the January 2015 election there is one that I believe would demonstrate beyond a shadow of doubt their commitment to the yahapalana cause : the ideal profile of a yahapalana presidential candidate ? <p> If , as they claim , the JO , SLPP and other non-yahapalanist political groups are ' majoritarian ' can not they , the yahapalanists , being the righteous , noble and exemplary political actors on the Sri Lankan stage , be the members of political parties or not , argue for a presidential candidate who is the antithesis of whoever a JO/SLPP-led coalition puts forward ( i.e. , a racist in the eyes of yahapalanists ) ? <p> No , it would not be enough for such a candidate to be a Sinhalese or a Buddhist uttering yahapalana terminology at every turn . They should go the whole hog . Get a non-Buddhist who is also a non-Sinhalese as the candidate . If they do n't , it could mean that they are playing ethnic-politics that is a far cry from yahapalana ideals . Let 's take Ranil Wickremesinghe . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubt that he is a Sinhalese . Sajith Premadasa is a Sinhala Buddhist . Ravi Karunanayake is a Christian , but he 's a Sinhalese . Sinhalese are out , so let 's not labour the point with other potential UNP candidates . Among those who are neither Sinhalese nor Buddhists , the most senior is Kabir Hashim . How about Kabir as the UNP 's next presidential candidate ? Has any yahapalanists stopped to even consider him ? <p> It does n't have to be someone from the UNP , after all that party has not fielded a candidate at a presidential election since 2005 . The UNP can find someone from outside the party system ( e.g. Sarath Fonseka in 2010 ) or back a candidate from another party ( e.g. Maithripala Sirisena in 2015 ) . And the UNP need not worry if the political history of the particular candidate being embarrassing either due to wrongdoing ( e.g. Fonseka , who was called all kinds of names by UNP stalwarts ) or association ( e.g. Sirisena ) . What counts is agreement on a program , never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ e.g. Sirisena ) . <p> I am sure there are exemplary Tamils and Muslims untainted by political affiliation and endowed with the kind of integrity and aloofness from the dust and grind of ideological/political engagement . Can the yahapalanists come up with some names ? Better yet , will they sweat and toil for such a person to be nominated as a candidate who runs against ' the racists ' ? <p> Let 's assume that they want someone who is already ' political ' ( considering the utter failure of the Fonseka experiment ) ; let 's lower the bar . Let 's just say ' ok ' to any Tamil or Muslim politician , regardless of his/her track-record ideological or political . <p> R. Sampanthan is the most senior politician in today 's Parliament , along with John Amaratunga , the latter not relevant since he 's a Sinhalese . Sampanthan had his black marks thanks to circumstances forcing his party to be an LTTE mouthpiece and before that for subscribing to Appapillai Amirthalingam 's chauvinism , such blemishes can be ignored . He 's not disgraced himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occasions Sampanthan has spoken for all citizens and not just the Tamils . <p> Age is not on his side , obviously , for he 's 85 . How about M.A. Sumanthiran , then ? The occasional Tamil nationalistic rhetoric aside , Sumanthiran has also , like Sampanthan , spoken for all citizens , articulating their concerns and critiquing policies that could have a detrimental impact on them . How about a Sirisena-like deal , where Sumanthiran is nominated as the ' Yahapalana Candidate ' with all yahapalanists backing him ? Would the main ' yahapalana party ' go along ? That 's the UNP , by the way , which added a ' yahapalana ' tag to the party name when contesting as a coalition in August 2015 . How about Rauff Hakeem ? He 's been embraced by the UNP and the SLFP at different times . Arumugam Thondaman ? <p> Would all this shock the yahapalanists ? Would they say I 'm being mischievous and just trying to tease yapalanists to find someone who is unlikely to win ? Well , the fact of the matter is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idealism . You ca n't be a yahapalanists who is willing to bend the yahapalana yardstick , surely ? Let 's hear it from them . Dear yahapalanists , would you go with a candidate whose choice will do justice to your multi-ethnic , multi-religious rhetoric or would you not ?

This year , multiple themes -- from the need to focus on Indians in distress abroad to deploying soft power and celebrating Gandhi 's 150th birth anniversary ; from India 's global development assistance and cooperation to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fifth government official . Swaraj gave the inaugural address and PM Narendra Modi delivered the final keynote speech at the meeting . <p> It was on the sidelines of this conference that Swaraj held both individual and region-specific meetings with ambassadors posted in Europe , Gulf , African and Latin American countries , besides the neighbourhood . " The idea behind the region-specific meetings is to ensure a broad commonality of approach since there are many overlapping themes ; it is to understand , in a free and frank internal setting , the views of different ambassadors and if there is anything the ministry can do to help , " said the fifth official . <p> Kicking off the neighbourhood meeting , according to the first official , Swaraj asked the ambassadors to give her a broad sense of what China was doing in each of their countries . Each envoy then spoke briefly about Beijing 's footprint in the country they serve . <p> According to the first four officials , the broad sense in the meeting was that in Pakistan , China 's economic and political dominance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a strategic partner but its economic and development footprint was minimal and there was room for engagement ; in Nepal , while Beijing 's involvement had grown , PM K P Oli 's recent visit to China had not broken new ground and was a reiteration of past agreements ; in Bangladesh , while the Chinese have made huge economic commitments , many in Dhaka were wary of the ' debt trap ' Sri Lanka found itself in ; in Sri Lanka , while the government remained politically friendly to India , its economic ties with China had continued apace . In the Maldives , according to the first and second officials , the presentation focused on how there was a conscious attempt by the regime in Male to erase the Indian footprint altogether and China had gained tremendous leverage with investments , already made or in progress , in an airport , bridge , islands and port . <p> One ambassador , according to the third official , laid out the border context and emphasised that Beijing had given up its defensive posture and was aiming for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " India has to recognise this and make a choice accordingly , " the official said . <p> After listening to all the presentations , Swaraj said -- according to both the first and second official -- that Delhi 's focus must not be on competing with China on resources . <p> Instead , she reiterated , India must continue to closely watch all Chinese activities ; it must push ahead , with full vigour , its own work , and advise and educate friends in the neighbourhood about how a certain kind of economic engagement with Beijing can have negative consequences for them . This refers broadly to the phenomena of big investments in economically unviable projects with Chinese loans , which then gives Beijing both an economic and strategic foothold and " traps " the country . <p> The fifth government , official , however said that it would be wrong to read any such deliberations as policy . " You must see this in the nature of an internal brainstorming meeting as a part of a broader conversation on a range of themes . The idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free-wheeling conversation . Everyone is encouraged to speak their minds . This is not in the nature of a policy directive . It is a constructive in-house engagement to understand evolving geopolitics .

We do n't have to be paranoid about them in the neighbourhood either . They have their own advantages and disadvantages . We need to work on our strengths and leverage those . There is extensive synergy and our inter-connectedness straddles across domains -- from physical proximity to economic ties to cultural links , " Kantha said .

A positive relationship between the State and the media goes beyond pure laissez-faire to nourishing an independent and pluralistic mediascape . <p> A current issue in many countries is the monopolisation of the media by powerful interests , whether private or public , which lessens the plurality of voices in the public sphere . Perhaps , the most important expression of an open relationship between the media and the government is the airing of unpopular viewpoints that may reflect tensions in the society . If the mediascape is not open and pluralistic , these viewpoints may leave the democratic sphere and foment violence . <p> Governance of the media @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and interests present in the media themselves . The implementation of a legal and regulatory environment that encourages freedom and pluralism in public information is often facilitated when governments and professional associations have access to comparative examples of media legislation , codes and cooperation strategies for media development . <p> Associations dedicated to media accountability such as ombudsmen and press councils also have a key role to play in media governance . One pivotal role they play is in encouraging discussions within the media sector about ethical practices and their professional responsibilities . They can thereby strengthen the media 's internal professional standards and increase public confidence in the reliability of information provided . <p> Only when journalists are free to monitor , investigate and criticize the public administration 's policies and actions can good governance take hold <p> In countries with emerging independent mediascapes , professional media industry associations can take the lead in assisting various media outlets to understand their role as independent media and encourage them to find ways to be economically self-sustaining . This should include both the media as well as information services such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ production networks . Considering the limited number of women in the media in most societies and the special situations they may face , professional associations should actively encourage training for women and greater gender equity within the profession . <p> These associations should also promote training among media professionals and broad education for those who wish to enter the profession . Such training should emphasise the values of independence , professional ethics , gender equity and the role of the media in democratic societies . Such associations can sponsor debates that touch the heart of the particular circumstances and challenges confronting the media in particular societies , while opening up wider discussions about the relationship between governance and the media in the region and in the global context . <p> The role of the media in promoting good governance is clear . All aspects of good governance are facilitated by a strong and independent mediascape within a society . Only when journalists are free to monitor , investigate and criticize the public administration 's policies and actions can good governance take hold . Independent media are like a beacon that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much to improve . Indeed , this is the concrete link between the functioning of the media and good governance -- the media allow for ongoing checks and assessments by the population of the activities of government and assist in bringing public concerns and voices into the open by providing a platform for discussion . Instead , all too often , governments devise laws and informal means of keeping their activities hidden from public view or only available to the media favourable to their viewpoint . <h> Necessity to regulate the media <p> Private media freedom is running amok . The news that millions of people in this country including foreign correspondents who convey news overseas receive each night are determined by a handful of men responsible only for their corporate employers . The State should have control not to permit abuse of the freedom of the press . These corporate sectors have their vested interests , their own way of exploiting the resources of their rabid news . <p> Some corporate employers create a monopoly to cow and terrorize their victims and it is trite learning that some politicians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe are absolutely analytical and factually correct . The media has to be regulated . Journalists should act with responsibility for good governance not behave like harlots . <p> Journalists should test the accuracy of information from all sources and exercise care to avoid inadvertent error <h> Quality of language <p> Words are known as the vehicle of thought . Unfortunately , daily newspapers , the electronic media and some weekend newspapers have been reported to be of poor standard where errors in English are seen . Mischievous reporting too is a vital ingredient to satisfy the corporate masters to create dissention and conflict . <h> Origin of media <p> The word media comes from the Latin plural of medium . The traditional view is that it should therefore be treated as a plural noun in all its senses in English and be used with a plural rather than a singular verb : the media have not followed the reports ( rather than ' has ' ) . In practice , in the sense ' television , radio , and the press collectively , ' it behaves as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instance ) , which means that it is now acceptable in standard English for it to take either a singular or a plural verb . The word medium is defined as " one of the means or channels of general communication , information or entertainment in society as newspapers , radio or television . " <p> The Hutchins Commission , whose official name was the Commission on Freedom of the Press , was formed during World War II , when Henry Luce ( publisher of Time and Life magazines ) asked Robert Hutchins ( President of the University of Chicago ) to recruit a commission to inquire into the proper function of the media in a modern democracy . The commission was established as a response to criticism from the public and government over media ownership . <p> As the commission chair , Hutchins had the duty of selecting members for the commission , though he ran his picks by Henry Luce first . The final commission was made up of twelve prominent intellectuals , all white upper-class men . Although all members were respected intellectuals with sterling reputations , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opinion that the commission would be more open-minded if it contained no journalists , but enemies of the commission , particularly in the press , used this fact to attack the credentials of the commission . <p> After deliberating for four years , the commission came to this conclusion in 1947 : the press plays an important role in the development and stability of modern society and as such it is imperative that a commitment of social responsibility be imposed on mass media . According to this social responsibility theory , the press has a moral obligation to consider the overall needs of society when making journalistic decisions in order to produce the greatest good . Though there had been journalism " codes of ethics " for decades , the commission 's report was considered landmark by some scholars ; they believed it was a pivotal reassertion of the modern media 's role in a democratic society . <h> Social-responsibility theory <p> Social-responsibility theory was born at a time ( just after Franklin Roosevelt 's death ) when large and powerful publishers were unpopular with the public , and when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motivations and objectives of the press . The press had mushroomed into an unwieldy and powerful entity , and criticism of the Fourth Estate was widespread . Critics contended that the media had monopolistic tendencies , that corporate owners were not concerned with the rights or interests of those unlike themselves and that commercialisation produced a debased culture as well as dangerously-selfish politics . <p> Social-responsibility theory thus proposes that the media take it upon themselves to elevate societal standards , providing citizens with the information they need to govern themselves . It is in the best interest of the media to do this ; if they do not , social theorists warn , the public will demand that the government regulate the media . <p> Some scholars ( among them John C. Nerone ) have speculated whether journalistic fairness and balance already existed prior to the commission 's report . Were the commission 's conclusions merely an " adjustment " in liberalism , brought on by perceived business demands ? Libertarians who prioritize individual liberty and seek to minimise the power of the State are wary of the social-responsibility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government intervention and government intervention comes at the expense of liberty . Indeed , the commission noted that continued misuse of press power would necessitate regulation . The code of ethics in the media was created by a suggestion from the 1947 Hutchins Commission . They suggested that newspapers , broadcasters and journalists had started to become more responsible for journalism and thought they should be held accountable . The guidelines were set up around two important ideas . The first is that whoever enjoys a special measure of freedom , like a professional journalist , has an obligation to the society to use their freedoms and powers responsibly . This guideline is useful so that people in power are able to be held liable in case their actions are not professional . People who have high media attention should not abuse the power . The second guideline that was established is society 's welfare is paramount , more important than individual careers or even individual rights . Again , holding people responsible for their actions and stating society is more important due to the vast number of people that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ added another five guidelines specifically for the press . <p> Journalists should clarify and explain news coverage and invite dialogue with the public over journalistic conduct <h> Neutral viewpoint <p> All of these guidelines are important because the press is required to maintain a neutral viewpoint , providing the basic facts and allowing for readers to come up with their own opinions from the news they report . These guidelines inspired the Society of Professional Journalists which is the current version of media ethics that were adopted in 1996 . The Society of Professional Journalists created a code of ethics that are in effect today . The main mantra of the code is : Seek truth and report it ! Journalists should be honest , fair and courageous in gathering , reporting and interpreting information . Journalists should test the accuracy of information from all sources and exercise care to avoid inadvertent error . Deliberate distortion is never permissible ; diligently seek out subjects of news stories to give them the opportunity to respond to allegations of wrongdoing ; identify sources whenever feasible . The public is entitled to as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question sources ' motives before promising anonymity . Clarify conditions attached to any promise made in exchange for information . <p> Keep promises ; make certain that headlines , news teases , promotional material , photos , videos , audios , graphics , sound bites and quotations do not misrepresent . They should not oversimplify or highlight incidents out of context ; never distort the content of news photos or videos . Image enhancement for technical clarity is always permissible . Label montages and photo illustrations ; avoid misleading re-enactments or staged news events . If re-enactment is necessary to tell a story , label it ; avoid undercover or other surreptitious methods of gathering information except when traditional open methods will not yield information vital to the public . Use of such methods should be explained as part of the story ; never plagiarise ; tell the story of the diversity and magnitude of the human experience boldly , even when it is unpopular to do so ; their own cultural values and avoid imposing on those values on others ; avoid stereotyping by race , examine gender , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , disability , physical appearance or social status ; support the open exchange of views , even views they find repugnant ; give voice to the voiceless ; official and unofficial sources of information can be equally valid ; distinguish between advocacy and news reporting . <p> Analysis and commentary should be labelled and not misrepresent fact or content ; distinguish news from advertising and shun hybrids that blur the lines between the two ; recognise and special obligation to ensure the public 's business is conducted in the open and that government records are open to inspection ; minimise harm ; ethical journalists treat sources , subjects and colleagues as human beings deserving respect . Journalists should show compassion to those who may be affected adversely by news coverage . <p> Use special sensitivity when dealing with children and inexperienced sources or subjects ; be sensitive when seeking or using interviews or photographs of those affected by tragedy or guilt ; recognise that gathering and reporting information may cause harm or discomfort . Pursuit of the news is not a license for arrogance ; recognise that private people have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public officials and others who seek power , influence or attention . Only an overriding public need can justify intrusion into anyone 's privacy ; show good taste . <p> Avoid pandering to lurid curiosity ; be cautions of identifying juvenile suspects or victims of sex crimes ; be judicious about naming criminal suspects before the formal filing of charges ; balance a criminal suspect 's fair trial rights with the public 's right to be informed ; act independently -- journalists should be free of obligation to any interest other than the public 's right to know .

Imran Khan 's wish -- a set of wishes including one where he asked for a government without difficult allies -- has come true . Amid protestations in a shocked Lahore by the Pakistan Muslim League-N , the signs are that we are going to have the same Pakistan running through from Chitral to Sadiqabad . This is quite a remarkable capture given how fractured the Punjab-Khyber Pakhtunkhwa stretch has appeared politically over the last few years . <p> The Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf is sweeping through Khyber Pakhtunkhwa . The Awami National Party resurgence has failed to materialise . The Muttahida Majlis-i-Amal challenge spearheaded by the Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-F with help of the Jamaat-i-Islami has been rudely dismissed . The experts ' pet phrase that " the PTI is everywhere in the northwestern province " takes on new meanings after the results of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ANP followers . The election outcome is like rubbing salt in the wounds that the party has suffered at the hands of terrorists . But this is how it is in the cruel world of politics . <p> You win some and then you fall on bad days , sometimes for long periods of time . Just as there are election results that you accept gleefully and vote counts you are appalled by . <p> As the whispers , sometimes followed by hideous , vindictive chuckles , go in the all-important Lahore , it is now the PML-N 's turn to go into the protest mode . Marriyum Aurangzeb has just spoken by the side of a Musaddiq Malik who was for once not smiling a naughty smile . These PML-N spokespeople are aghast and want the media to report ' large-scale ' rigging in an election that has reduced the Sharif domain drastically to parts of Lahore and areas in some adjoining districts , with occasional long-distance occupation . <p> According to early results , the PML-N was badly curtailed in Islamabad and Rawalpindi , was losing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lagging behind in Faisalabad and Multan as well as some other southern Punjab districts -- setbacks that were too severe to allow the party to celebrate sporadic good showings by some of its senior leaders in areas such as Sialkot and likely success in Gujranwala . The overall impression was that of a party which was faced with its toughest hour and which was on the verge of collapse . <p> Some magical opening where the PML-N could lay a claim to forming a government in Punjab could still salvage it for the Sharif camp ? If some innocent souls were nursing this desire among the ' N ' cadres , the dream was soon tempered by the voices of protests that emerged from within the ranks . This betrayed a kind of despondency that could well have been the result of a dire threat to the PML-N 's hold on Punjab . <p> Just as it was tough for PML-N president Shahbaz Sharif to strike a balance between Mian Nawaz Sharif 's combative narrative and his own desire to work with the establishment , it is perhaps time for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ results of the election with as much intensity as he can pack in it . <p> Shahbaz Sahib will most definitely need to come out of his conservative shell to deal with this latest mountain that he has been confronted with . His first formula , that was to lead him to some kind of rapprochement with you know who has failed totally . He is tasked with taking the party out of jail . <p> In a role-swap with the PML-N , prime minister Imran Khan appears to be all set to emerge as the leader with enough resources at his disposal to form a government without ' unwanted ' allies . He must start with a self- assurance that those who are disputing the results now do not have the stamina or the critical backing that had enabled him to sustain a protest campaign -- which had its origins in PTI 's grievances against poll rigging -- for five long years . But as the chief executive of the country he will have to do better than blaming it all on an international conspiracy . He will have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Some estimates say that Imran will win more than 100 national seats . Even if the PTI secures 90-odd seats his wish will be fulfilled and he would not require the crutches that some others might have been quite keen to offer him in his attempt to lead this country as its chief executive . He can well do with the support of the ' azad ' MNAs even though for longevity 's sake he may be advised to cultivate good relations with smaller groups among the nationalists and Islamists that may yet sneak into the parliament . <p> This PTI success marks a new era . Imran 's struggle was avowedly to end the domination of not just one party but he sought to correct a whole system that had been exploited . The main culprits in his book were the Pakistan Peoples Party and the PML-N . In some of his recent remarks he made it quite clear that he was allergic to the idea of having to enter into an alliance with the PPP of Asif Zardari , who to the PTI cadres is epitome of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PPP does appear to have retained its presence in Sindh , and it could improve its overall national numbers by the time last results come in . As theories go , a result for the PTI where it will not have to rope in the PPP to make a coalition would be a godsend for Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari . The young PPP leader has just won his first positive reviews -- most definitely these are the first positive thoughts his presence has generated in Punjab . <p> He would do well to stay away from any offers of joining a coalition . He must concentrate on finding a new identity for his party beyond its present position as a regional party which makes occasional guest appearances in the rest of the country . He can try making a fresh start in southern Punjab and move upwards . <p> The PPP will next have to decide what kind of role it wants to play in the emerging alliance against alleged rigging in this general election . The PML-N is not the only party that cries foul of the results . There are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get louder in coming days .

@@26163230 <h> GSP Plus impact <p> Fisheries volume of exports has literally doubled since the removal of the fish ban and regaining GSP Plus -- Pic by Shehan Gunasekara <p> By Export Development Board , Ministry of Development Strategies and International Trade <p> Competitive disadvantage erased <p> Sri Lanka was blackballed and lost its GSP+ concession in August 2010 due to allegations of human rights , resulting in a loss of export revenues till the reinstatement of GSP+ in May 2017 of Rs. 150-250 billion . <p> While it is difficult to provide a full analysis of what was lost , looking at how Sri Lanka 's competitors fared in the EU market , give some sense of how Sri Lanka lost out to Asian apparel exporters . <p> According to the International Trade Centre , Vietnam , Pakistan and Cambodia all trailed Sri Lanka in 2009 , with EU exports at $ 2.1 billion , $ 1.5 billion and $ 1.09 billion , respectively , against Sri Lanka 's $ 2.3 billion . By 2015 , however , Vietnam 's apparel exports to the EU had risen to $ 3.9 billion , Pakistan 's to $ 2.9 billion and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trailing at $ 2.4 billion . <p> The European Union ( EU ) reinstated the EU GSP Plus facility to Sri Lanka with effect from 19 May 2017 . Importantly , this will provide Sri Lankan exports a level playing field with other countries such as our neighbours from Bangladesh and Pakistan , and several countries from Africa and South America who enjoy preferential market access . <p> The additional tariff concession gained by sectors varies -- in many apparels categories duties are cut from 9.6% to zero , in the seafood sector from 18.5% to zero , in the fresh and processed fruits and vegetable sector from 12.5% to zero , in the porcelain and ceramic ware sector from 8.4% to zero and in the toy products sector from 1.2% to zero . <p> Overview of GSP Plus <p> GSP Plus offers incentives in the form of duty reductions on exports as a reward to developing countries for their commitment to upholding the 27 core international conventions on human and labour rights , sustainable development and good governance . <p> Then the country must also be considered ' vulnerable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the EU market ( the import-share ratio is less than 6.5% of the EU 's total GSP imports ) and the country does not have a diversified export base ( seven products account for over 75% of that country 's total GSP imports to the EU ) . <p> Apparel is by far our biggest export to the EU . Given that the Rules of Origin under GSP Plus requires fabric to be sourced from Sri Lanka or from an area that qualifies for regional cumulation in order to qualify for GSP Plus , there will be an increase in demand for fabric sourced from Sri Lankan fabric mills , rather than from countries such as China . Sri Lanka will continue to be eligible for GSP Plus as long as the periodic reviews ( the first one coming in less than a year ) by the EU do not raise any red flags with regard to the implementation of agreed human rights and governance reforms . Yet , once the country graduates to an ' upper-middle-income economy ' status ( as classified by the World Bank ) and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lanka becomes no longer eligible for GSP Plus ( with a grace period of around two years ) .

It is not just the big three ( Brandix , MAS , Hirdaramani ) manufacturers that have had an immediate uplift in EU volumes from the GSP concession but many SME manufacturers , local fabric producers such as Teejay and Hayleys Fabric , other participants in the value chain ( e.g. trim suppliers , packaging , logistics ) , and thousands of operators , who we are obliged by the EU to pass on benefits to .

Further , Sri Lankan companies are progressively moving towards and practicing sustainable production concepts such as the organic produce , green production , as well as Fair Trade practices which are highly valued by the consumers world over and in particular in the EU . <p> The ability to penetrate the EU market as a strong country respecting basic human rights , rule of law and good governance would send a strong signal to the international investor community which will facilitate the attraction of inward FDI . <p> The GSP+ scheme encourages increased value addition within Sri Lanka , and thereby promotes backward integration , resulting in the setting up of new industries , and creating new employment opportunities in the country . <p> Benefits of GSP-Plus status will need to trickle down to Sri Lanka 's rural workforce . The concessions under GSP+ are likely to have assisted the financially less privileged farmers who are engaged in agriculture and fisheries industry in Sri Lanka . New export opportunities will eventually develop the livelihoods and raise income levels of the farmers . <p> Sri Lankan exporters can also exploit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ European companies through joint ventures and transfer of technology .

Meanwhile , the seafood exporters cautioned that the noticeable decrease in live fish in the Sri Lankan deep waters is posing a threat to the medium to long-term ability of the sector to meet new demand . <p> The UK market accounts for a third of our EU exports . With the impending Brexit , one needs to be cognisant of establishing a mechanism to maintain our preferential market access to this key region . <p> EDB Chairperson Indira Malwatte commented , " While we have experienced impressive export growth to the EU in the 12 months following the re-gaining of GSP Plus , we need to focus on creating new products and services , and facilitating export diversification and entering direct to the Central European markets .

" <p> Benefits of Trade Agreements <p> In 2017 , Sri Lanka had the highest ever export earnings of 15.1 billion dollars and this year it may rise further to 17.4 billion dollars . 2017 was also a record year for foreign investment . FDI inflow was a record 1.9 billion dollars last year and in 2018 it may rise to around 2.5 billion dollars . <p> However , these are extremely low figures in comparison to some of the other Asian countries . For example , annual exports in Singapore is 480 billion dollars , in Taiwan it is 340 billion dollars , in Thailand is 254 billion dollars , in Vietnam it is 250 billion dollars , and in Malaysia it is 230 billion dollars .

All of these countries have been able to grow their economies and bring more good jobs and raise people 's living standards , within a short period of time . <p> What is very clear is that Sri Lanka has a long way to go , and if we concentrate only on our market of 21 million people , we will never be able to achieve the rapid economic development that we need . Our only choice is to integrate with the world markets , and this is one of the primary reasons for the FTAs -- to enter into new markets and bring in the investments we need along with new technology and know-how so that we can compete with the best in the world . <p> We would encourage and invite FDI from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ executed the Singapore FTA earlier this year , we are in the advance stages of negotiating a FTA with China , and expanding our current FTA with India through Economic and Technology Cooperation Agreement ( ETCA ) .

Together the Chinese FTA and Indian ETCA will give Sri Lanka preferential access to a market of two billion people and an emerging middle class larger than the whole of the EU . <p> The Government of Sri Lanka is aware of the possible trade disruptions that can occur during the transition period and therefore we are looking at providing a trade adjustment package for local industrialists to upgrade machinery and introduce new technology so that these industries can be more competitive and serve the local market as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The Government is committed to improving the Ease of Doing Business in Sri Lanka under the theme Sri Lanka means business .

@@26163235 <p> Confident of resilience built by strong postwar growth , the Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority yesterday stuck to removing a nine-year-old minimum room rate scheme for Colombo hotels , despite a proposal by Tourism Minister John Amaratunga to discuss the issue in November and protests by hoteliers , setting the stage for a potential standoff between stakeholders . SLTDA Director General Upali Rathnayake insisted the SLTDA Board arrived at a decision to remove the minimum room rate for five-star hotels in Colombo at a meeting held in July and the authority would gazette the decision soon . <p> " We found that after nine years there is sufficient capacity in the capital and the market is not driven by the price but the quality and services they offer . Considering these factors , the Board decided it was not the right mechanism to control the prices with a minimum rate , " he told Daily FT . <p> He pointed out that the minimum rate was introduced to the market at a time when city hotels were finding it difficult to continue business . <p> " Out of the 15 players at that time in Colombo , 13 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The mechanism was introduced to safeguard the players and allow hotels to upgrade their standards with the high income they earned , " Rathnayake said . <p> The Director General denied industry allegations that the decision was not communicated . <p> " The decision to remove the minimum room rate was first informed to the Tourism Advisory Board and it was also informed to industry stakeholders at different forums where the Minister was also present , " he added . <p> Rathnayake believes that the discipline in the market will continue , while helping industry players to uphold the quality driven by market forces . <p> Nonetheless , the decision does not appear to have impressed itself upon Minister Amaratunga who outlined plans to hold talks with the industry in November and take a decision by the end of the year . <p> " The gazette imposed on minimum room rates for five-star hotels within the Colombo city limits has now expired and it 's inactive at the moment . We will discuss the matter with industry stakeholders and the Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority ( SLTDA ) in November @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the Minister said . <p> According to the Minister , the gazette for minimum room rates scheme for five-star hotels in Colombo had expired on 31 March 2018 . <p> " September and October are usually the lean period , where we do n't get many tourists . Upon considering the views from the trade and authorities we will arrive at an appropriate decision towards the end of the year , " Amaratunga added . <p> However , Colombo City Tourist Hotel Association ( CCTHA ) President M. Shanthikumar contended that if the Government decided to remove the minimum rate it would adversely impact the two- to four-star city hotels . He also expressed concern that a removal would result in the staff service charge being reduced by 50% . <p> " The removal or the continuation on the minimum rate was not discussed with CCTHA . In an industry that has high staff turnover , this is crucial . On the other hand , this may allow competition with the informal sector which is growing fast by reducing rates , " he opined . <p> Shanthikumar noted that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the request of the CCTHA to avoid undercutting . <p> " The two- to five-star category hotels had their rates ranging from $ 45 to $ 125 . The implementation of the minimum rate undoubtedly helped the smaller hoteliers to be in business and benefited the economy by way of taxes and the staff to get much higher service charge . If not for the implementation of the minimum rate , most of the city hotels would not have been able to be refurbished or renovated . This was a benefit seen across the higher star class hotels as well in spite of not having a proper monitoring mechanism by the authorities , " he added . <p> He pointed out that the city mostly depended on corporate , MICE and airline crews . The leisure component constitutes only about 20% of total occupancy . Therefore Shanthikumar said it could be misleading to describe Colombo as expensive for leisure . <p> " Moreover , the airline crews have a special rate from $ 45-$ 65 ( depending on star category 3 to 5 ) .

Firstly , to reduce indirect taxes on hotels as we find it difficult to compete with regional players . Secondly , to expedite the promotion campaign which they have failed to do so during the past three and a half years . Thirdly , to regulate the informal sector where the majority of the tourists now prefer staying at . We hope that the authorities will consider these before removing the minimum room rate , " said THASL President Sanath Ukwatte . <p> He pointed out that the minimum room rate mechanism was introduced to discipline the market and take action against players that were undercutting the prices . <p> " Since the gazette expired , we have seen a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

With the opening of the Southern Expressway the majority of travellers go to tourist hotspots in the Southern Province . Around 20% of total tourist arrivals chose to stay in Colombo for leisure purposes . Colombo is now visited mostly by businessmen , conference delegates and people who come to casinos .

@@26163236 <p> The International Trade and Development Strategies Ministry has released an outline for implementing the long-awaited Trade Adjustment Programme ( TAP ) for stakeholder feedback that details how domestic enterprises would be supported through regulatory and policy reforms as well as specific schemes of grant support . <p> The document , which has been posted on the ministry website , is open to private sector and other responses till Thursday . TAP aims to provide comprehensive assistance for firms and workers and institutional mechanisms to ensure transparent , credible and timely delivery of trade adjustment assistance . <p> It is focused on data-driven decisions , making use of analytical tools to assess vulnerable industry sectors , a skills retraining and labour market flexibility program alongside tariff liberalisation , mechanisms for industry sectors to reveal their productivity constraints and have them resolved , and clear communication to stakeholders of the why , what and how of TAP , the document said . <p> The draft said a Trade and Productivity Commission ( TPC ) would be established to be the independent body that analyses TAP , that examines quantitative and qualitative evidence , investigates and responds to industry requests on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Competitiveness Councils ( ICCs ) that are established to solve productivity constraints of affected sectors and make recommendations to the Ministry of Finance for action . <p> The TPC will consist of independent Commissioners ( possibly appointed by the Constitutional Council ) and accountable to Parliament , supported by a Secretariat of qualified professionals who are competent in trade and industry economics ( initially can be seconded from the Department of Commerce and Central Bank ) . <p> " A new unit at the Ministry of Finance will be the ultimate arbiter of TAP and would be headed by the Secretary to the Treasury who will take final decisions regarding TAP matters , following the recommendation of the TPC . For example , taking the final decision to slow the tariff phase out for a particular sector , following the investigation and recommendation by TPC , " it said . <p> In both of the above submissions received by industry sectors , the recommendations by the TPC and the decisions by the Ministry of Finance and their justification will be published online and available for anyone to see to ensure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ submissions and representations can be open to the public to ensure further transparency and mark a departure from the typical industry lobbying process . <p> TAP proposes to establish Industry Competitiveness Councils ( ICCs ) as and when required to reveal and resolve productivity constraints faced by firms in an industry or sector . This will help build confidence among the industry that although the trade liberalisation will impact them and take them out of their comfort zone , the Government is able to help them navigate this process and find solutions to their problems , it said . <p> Recommendations given below were also included : <p> Implement a minimum level of labour market flexibility reforms in order to allow workers in affected sectors to move into new sectors and adjust better to new market conditions . <p> Establish a network of TAP-approved skills retraining centers and job placement hubs across the country ( from within the established government TVET institutions and agencies ) which will be primarily tasked with helping impacted workers obtain the new skills they need to move to another sector or find new job openings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will cover part of the costs of skills retraining for TL-affected workers . <p> Launch an accelerated program of investment promotion in emerging sectors ( for example , the National Export Strategy sectors ) in order to boost new opportunities for job creation and absorb displaced workers from sectors previously enjoying high protection and now facing a decline due to trade liberalisation . <p> Identify some key indicators to keep track on an ongoing basis ( e.g. every quarter or biannually ) to identify early signs of socioeconomic stress due to trade liberalisation , either in specific demographic groups or in geographic locations .

@@26163237 <h> Placate or stand firm ? <p> This week opens with the Government staring down the barrel of a second possible train strike with powerful railway trade unions unless their salary demands are met by Thursday . The hefty increases , which the Finance Ministry has battled against on the basis that it would result in a salary hike for 24 grades of the public service and was therefore untenable as it would push up public expenditure and trigger inflation , are likely to test the mettle of the Government and put pressure on its public image . <p> President Maithripala Sirisena has been the lone point of engagement with trade unions after he intervened to call off the first strike earlier this month . Contents of his discussions with union representatives have not been fully divulged to the public but shortly afterwards the Finance Ministry presented a Cabinet paper to appoint a Salaries Commission for the public sector , which was approved . The Commission has been tasked with analysing and evaluating the salary structures of the entire public service and present a report on the way forward in two months . <p> The task , already significantly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their demands are centered on salary increases that have already received Cabinet approval after being presented by the Transport Ministry and therefore a commission was not needed to peruse them before implementation . The unions also contend that legal provisions were included in the Cabinet paper to exclude railway services from the rest of the public sector and that any salary increase given to them does not need to extend to the other segments . <p> In any case a possible strike does not give sufficient time for the Salaries Commission to even be constituted much less have its proposals considered by the government . Whatever the contents of the Transport Ministry Cabinet paper the contention that railways should be given preferential treatment is an absurd one . The Ceylon Railways Department has provided significant services but it has also been marred by mismanagement , corruption and wastage in its long history . The quality of its services to the public are basic at best and while this is not only the fault of the department the idea that a chronically loss making entity deserves to be given higher pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is both unfair and unrealistic . <p> However , the Government is also caught between a rock and a hard place . A railway strike is daunting at the best of times but a segment of buses have already pulled off the roads protesting spot fines . A railway strike on top of reduced busses would be a double whammy for the public and the Government would become the instant scapegoat facing heightened public censure for its role . <p> The political backlash of such a situation could be grave as the Government heads to elections next year . But it also can not afford to do nothing , literally , as any fiscal slippage could unleash macroeconomic instability that it can ill afford as it looks to finance growing external debt repayments over the next few years . All in all the Government may have little choice but to batten down the hatches and ready for the coming storm . <h> Share This Article <h> DISCLAIMER : <p> 1 .

The choice of the five experts , it appears , has been done carefully drawing on the multitude of expertise which they possess not only on trade but also on all other aspects of economic policy .

Jayatissa ) . <p> Need for resolving conflicting views <p> The President had been prompted to appoint this committee due to conflicting views expressed by many sections of society on the Sri Lanka-Singapore Free Trade Agreement that was signed in early January this year . Hence , the members of public have been advised to make their representations to the committee . <p> Since none of the experts had taken a position on the Free Trade Agreement in public previously , it can be reasonably assumed that they would approach the problem with an open mind . It is up to the warring professional associations and Government officials to have their views known to the committee . <p> In the meantime , the sustainable national policy ( available at : http : **40;127;TOOLONG @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emphasised the need for diversifying and promoting exports by adopting a strategic approach to trade agreements via supply-side reforms that aim at improving export competitiveness and productivity . Hence , as a second mandate , the committee will have to examine the proposed trade policy by the officials of the Ministry of International Trade in line with the sustainable national policy . <p> The trade agreement is incomprehensible to many <p> The full text of the Sri Lanka-Singapore Free Trade Agreement , running into thousands of pages , can be accessed from the Singapore Government 's website for enterprise development ( available at : https : **38;169;TOOLONG ... ) . <p> It contains 17 chapters and about an equal number of annexed documents . They are in such technical terms that only an expert with practical experience in trade and trade agreements would be able to comprehend them . Hence , many critics who have taken liberty to attack the Free Trade Agreement may not have examined the document in toto and referred only to some selected sections . In this background , the appointment of the committee of experts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a welcome development . It is in line with the true spirit of economic policy governance as well . <p> This article does not seek to review the agreement . That is left to the committee of experts . Instead , it will analyse causes of the miraculous development of Singapore from around mid 1970s and identify what lessons which Sri Lanka could learn from its experiences . <p> Singapore model versus national economic model <p> There has been a debate about what type of policy which Sri Lanka should pursue in order to deliver prosperity to its people . Some have argued that the country should follow the Singaporean model to replicate the miracle . This is understandable since Singapore , by following its unique growth model , was successful in elevating that Third World country four decades ago to a First World country within the lifetime of a single generation . <p> But many others , including those on the top of Sri Lanka 's political structure and those among the mainstream economists , have disagreed . They have argued that Sri Lanka should follow its own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ following a foreign growth model and converting the country to another Singapore is not the dream of the nation . They want Sri Lanka to be ' Sri Lanka ' and not another foreign country although that foreign country has been the envy of many by being a top achiever of the world . <p> Both sides are wrong <p> Both these arguments are wrong . Sri Lanka and Singapore are culturally , geographically and politically different from each other . Singapore is a city state composed of immigrants brought from three main countries in the region and settled in a narrow strip of land at the tip of Malaysian Peninsula just 200 years ago . <p> In contrast , Sri Lanka is a country with a long history , dating back to 6th century BCE if one goes by its recorded history , with a fairly large commercial and subsistence agricultural sector and a diversified economy . Hence , Sri Lanka can not be another Singapore and by being a Singapore it can not fulfil the aspirations and wishes of its citizens . <p> However , in the opposite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ short-sighted . The country need not endeavour to become another Singapore . But , the development lessons which Singapore has left behind are all worthy of serious examination by others who also wish to enter a high development path . <p> Though the world environment which Singapore faced at the time it undertook its rapid development strategies is different from what we face today , the fundamentals underlying the issues , strategies and outcomes still remain valid . Hence , attempts should be made to dig up the strategies followed by Singapore with a view to subjecting them to a critical evaluation and generating a public debate on the same . <p> Sources to gain knowledge on the Singapore model <p> Several sources can be tapped to learn of the Singapore Model . The best way to do so is to learn it from the horse 's mouth itself . Singapore 's miracle maker , its Prime Minister from 1959 , Lee Kuan Yew , has documented these strategies with a critical evaluation in two volumes of his autobiography under the titles of ' The Singapore Story ' and ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Swee , leading politician who provided economic wisdom to Lee , has also documented his experience in a contribution to the Silver Jubilee Commemoration Volume of the Singapore Board of Currency , ' Prudence at the Helm , ' published in 1992 . <p> Two British academics , Daniel Yergin and Joseph Stanislaw , have reviewed the economic reforms undertaken by both the developed and emerging countries in a publication titled ' The Commanding Heights , ' and it provides a useful description of the models adopted by all the countries including Singapore . The careful perusal of these documents and other publications will help one to keep himself informed of the different strategies adopted by many countries to push themselves up in the last few decades . <p> Lee 's dilemma <p> According to Lee , when Singapore separated from Malaysia in 1965 , everybody had expected it to fail without the supporting strength of its big brother to the North , Malaysia . All advisors had advised Singapore to remain within a close trading block with Malaysia and Indonesia , the other big economy to its South . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ centre to these two big powers , Singapore could continue to harness its comparative advantage of functioning as an entrepot trading centre . According to them , there was no any other future for Singapore . <p> Poor neighbours versus rich strangers <p> This advice was essentially to concentrate on having strong economic relationships with its neighbours and not to look beyond . Today , Sri Lanka too gets similar advice that it should have strong economic relationships with its neighbours and other South Asian nations . The logic behind this advice is that trading with developed countries is a risk and when trading is done with countries of similar circumstances , there is a certain element of safety because those countries do not have hidden agendas to follow . <p> Wealth was with rich countries <p> This advice has puzzled Lee and his team . Wealth in the world is not with developing countries but with the developed world . If someone has to reap the benefits from such wealth accumulation , he has to necessarily link himself with developed countries . While the richness of developed countries could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which stands as an effective barrier for developing countries to reach them . In the circumstances , the advice given to them is perfectly in order . <p> Breaking the glass ceiling <p> Singaporean leaders had thought that there should be a way to break the glass ceiling without harming themselves and causing damage to their relationship with the developed world . To do so , they have to make a long jump to the developed world bypassing the neighbouring developing countries . Even if they are successful in doing so , it would not be sustainable , since the developed countries might be disappointed with their performance and delivery capability . <p> Hence , it was necessary to look for a solution which will allow them to undertake the long jump and keep their relationship with developed countries unhindered . Compared to Malaysia and Indonesia , the two big neighbours , North America , Europe including the UK , Japan , Australia and New Zealand which are located thousands of miles farther from Singapore , had offered the best prospects for Singapore to tap markets and create wealth on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ countries is strenuous , it was worth making efforts to do it successfully . <p> ' Leapfrogging ' strategy <p> Singapore , therefore , decided to ' leapfrog ' the two neighbours and reach the developed countries directly . This was contrary to the advice given to them constantly and the popular wisdom prevailing at that time . Yet , they found that all the prerequisites for rapid economic development were with those developed countries and not with their neighbours . <p> In the late 1960s , technology especially , information and communication technology , was advancing at an unprecedented rate and such technological innovations were alien to its neighbours just like to Singapore . Hence , to get the benefit from the advancing technology , one should align itself with those who have the technology and not with those who looked at those innovations with goggled eyes . <p> Developed countries were also making rapid strides in productivity and quality improvements thereby capturing markets and cutting down costs , two main ingredients for success in trading . Singapore as well as its two neighbours were light years behind both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an important part of their cultural traits . Hence , the most important requirement of the day was to jump onto the bandwagon of the developed world and be part of the new quality and productivity improvements . <p> In addition , the management and business decision making of the firms in the developed world were mainly based on sound prudential criteria and they helped them to become resilient and stand up to challenges coming from outside . Given all these requirements , ' leapfrogging ' the two neighbours was a must . <p> A developed country oasis <p> Then , the question was , ' even after the successful leapfrogging , how to maintain the relationships with prospective investors continuously ? ' At that time , Singapore was another typical developing country with no considerations for quality , environmental beauty , learning , self-discipline , maintaining law and order and rule of law which constituted the foundation of the ever rising prosperity of the developed countries . <p> Hence , among the pool of the developing countries surrounding Singapore , it was necessary to create a ' developed country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as completely different from all other developing countries in Asia , Africa and Latin America . <p> Conscious efforts were then taken to beautify Singapore , make Singaporeans quality conscious at all levels , improve skills and competencies through learning and training , maintain law and order and rule of law and create a clean society by eliminating bribery and corruption . Infrastructure for mobility was developed by modernising the port , airport , transport system and the road network . <p> Within a decade , Singapore emerged as a ' developed country oasis ' with distinguishing characteristics and attributes . According to Lee , it made a world of difference because its neighbours were still embroiled in internal disputes and substandard legal , managerial and business practices . <p> Lessons Sri Lanka could learn from Singapore <p> Singapore became a rich country by being seamlessly integrated to the global economy . In the first few decades , it was a free trade centre and functioned as an entrepot trading centre in which goods were imported from the rest of the world and exported to other countries . Subsequently , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Sri Lanka too through millennia brought prosperity to its people by functioning as an entrepot trading centre . Goods that were brought from all over the world were stockpiled here and made available to traders who visited the country freely . Today 's trade is digital and does not require goods to be shifted physically from one country to another to be sold in the international markets . This is what Singapore does today . Hence , by jumping on the bandwagon of Singapore , Sri Lanka has no reason to lose . <p> ( W.A.

On Saturday the former cricket-star turned politician took his oaths as Prime Minister of his country after leading his Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf ( PTI ) party to electoral victory . <p> In his capacity as captain of the Pakistan national team Imran Khan was able to mould Pakistan 's individually brilliant , but often divided national cricketers into a world cup winning unit . Today as Khan takes up the reigns of leadership , his country faces a plethora of problems which he has vowed to tackle . Among them are : A mounting economic crisis , major corruption scandals , a serious breakdown in relationship with its neighbours India and Afghanistan , rampant poverty , a serious diplomatic breakdown with the US , and his future relationship with the country 's military . <p> Pakistan 's external debt and liabilities has increased 76% to 10.6 trillion rupees ( $92 billion ) since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GDP . According to the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) Pakistan 's gross external financing alone needs at a record $27 billion for the next fiscal year and forecast that due to additional borrowings , Pakistan 's external debt would jump to $103.4 billion by June 2019 , up from this June 's projected level of $93.3 billion . <p> Throughout his political career Imran Khan has raised his voice against and vowed to bring to book those involved in rampant corruption at the pinnacles of power which he claimed , led his country into the parlous economic situation it faces today . During the 2013 election campaign he vowed to wipe out corruption within a 90-day period if elected to power . A major challenge ... But Khan has examples in Asia itself to choose as his model for fighting corruption . History will judge him on the road he takes . <p> There is the Malaysian model -- where the immediate past Prime Minister who stood accused of mega corruption was charged , arrested and remains behind bars ... all within a week of the new regime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power . Or there is the the Sri Lankan model where even after three long years , the new regime , which was voted into power on a promise to end corruption , has been unable to bring to book any of the major players accused of corruption . History will judge Mr. Khan on the model he chooses . <p> In the international field the PM-elect faces a minefield of problems . While relations with Afghanistan have improved , Pakistan 's relationship with India is at an all-time low with Kashmir being the bone of contention . India 's PM Modi initially invited Pakistan 's then premier to his swearing-in- ceremony . But since then , dialogue with Pakistan has ceased and India has ratcheted up anti-Pakistan rhetoric . Indian troops have also made incursions into Pakistan on the pretext of chasing Kashmiri terrorists . An action which reminds Pakistanis of India 's role in the bifurcation of their country , the bloody birth of Bangladesh and India 's role in it . <p> Both countries possess nuclear weapons , India 's conventional arms build-up , which Pakistan can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conflagration . Urgent measures need to be implemented to defuse the situation in Kashmir and especially rebuild a sense of trust with India . Can Khan do it ? Relations between Pakistan and its ally -- the US -- are bad , with the US accusing Pakistan of being an untrustworthy ally and villain in the Afghan war . Pakistan 's relations with Washington are summarized in one of the US President 's tweets in January this year : " Washington had ' foolishly ' provided Pakistan $33 billion in 15 years to fight terror , but " they have given us nothing but lies and deceit , thinking of our leaders as fools " . <p> While wishing Imran Khan the best in his role of captaining the Pakistani nation , it must be kept in mind that Pakistan 's military -- has ruled the country for more than half of its 71-year history -- and still continues to be the power behind the throne . Will the military permit Captain Khan to pursue his aim of improved relations with India ? Will he ( Khan ) be able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dirty politics which grips his country ?

What does the idea of rural development -- abandoned globally in the decades of liberalization , including under an ' open economy ' since 1977 in Sri Lanka -- mean today ? Will rural development merely serve as a fig leaf for expansion of political patronage , or is there rural capacity to shift such investment towards progressive social and economic change ? <h> Electoral outcome <p> There are a few interesting historical trends with electoral politics in Sri Lanka . First , given the long democratic tradition of universal suffrage , the first country in Asia reaching back to 1931 , there has never been a successful military coup and the citizenry have overthrown authoritarian governments at crucial elections ; the 1994 and 2015 elections are two such instances . Second , electoral swings against incumbent governments have been a consistent pattern . Third , the rural constituencies when their interests are neglected have dramatically shifted their electoral allegiances leading to change of governments . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is shaping the current rural development drive . <p> One major reason for the overthrow of the Rajapaksa regime in 2015 was its abandoning of the rural constituencies during its second term . While rural infrastructure works such as electrification and rural road development were given priority during its first term from 2005 to 2010 , after the war they became focused on urban-centred development such as the beautification of Colombo backed by tremendous international financing . The current Government continues to neglect the rural economy despite the long drought ravaging many districts ; the consequence was the major defeat in the local government elections this year . <h> State versus social mobilization <p> Rural development as with any other form of development requires capital , and if it is a development drive by the state , it requires state funds . Furthermore , even when such funds are made available , there is a need for rural capacity to absorb such funds . This capacity for absorption also requires local state structures to disperse funds and carry out rural infrastructure work . The line ministries and district secretariats have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and provide " livelihood schemes " mainly in the form of handouts . Indeed , with the neglect of the rural vision including the related rural development institutions over the decades , it is political urgency resulting in dispersal of funds and projects by the administrative bureaucracy that is characteristic of contemporary initiatives of rural development . <h> " One major reason for MR regime overthrow in 2015 was its abandoning the rural constituencies during its second term " <p> On the other hand , sustainable and meaningful rural development has to go beyond infrastructure and handouts , challenge top-down development by officials and increase avenues of production with the participation of people . This requires strong social institutions that can mobilize rural society . However , most of the social institutions such as co-operatives , rural development societies , women 's rural development societies , farmers ' organizations etc. , all require considerable strengthening . Furthermore , even those state and non-state institutions that are to build the capacity of rural social institutions , including for agricultural research , training and extension , require revitalization . With social mobilization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a central challenge for the Government 's current programme centred on state institutions . <h> Building rural economies <p> There are major public misconceptions about rural development that are also the consequences of decades of intellectual neglect of the rural question . First , the flawed idea that rural economic problems are simple matters and can be dealt with state priority and funding . Here , urban elitist arrogance reduces rural development to allocation of some funds , ideas about starting companies in villages , or throwing some computers at rural educational and other institutions . Second , that the rural world has not changed and that it is archaic and is about subsistence . In reality , there are considerable changes and many new dynamics in the rural social life ; their incomes and livelihoods come from multiple sources , including linkages with small towns and migrant work abroad . Furthermore , there are new possibilities for production and increased value from rural agricultural production for both the national markets and even exports . <p> Third , the aspirations of rural youth and society more broadly have also been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forms of consumption , which are also related to advances in media and communication technologies . <p> In other words , the rural societies are as modern , dynamic and complex as urban societies , and it is our urban ignorance that relegates the rural to the backward and simple . For the urban working class , employment and income are important for their daily lives , which when affected lead to rising protests and strikes . Similarly , for rural folk , landed agricultural production and other sources of waged income are critical for sustaining their communities , which when disrupted invite a political response . In this context , when governments forget the rural population , they come back with a vengeance at elections . But remembering rural constituencies is one thing , and working with them to build a progressive economic future is of another order . Rural development is not just about building small infrastructure and handouts , it is much more about rural production with the participation of producers who form communities , whether they be farmers , fishermen , craftsmen etc. and to build @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , landed agricultural production and other sources of waged income are critical for sustaining their communities " <p> Returning to the current rural economic drive by the Government , its success depends on whether rural social institutions are strengthened and a rural economic vision is consolidated .

This the Governor said had resulted in large capital outflows from emerging markets back to the US , reversing the inflows out of the US experienced earlier due to low interest rates there and attractive options elsewhere . <p> However , he noted Sri Lanka had n't seen a major outflow though foreign investments had relinquished some of their positions from Government Securities and listed equity raising the demand for US dollars from the market as against the weak supply . <p> The second exogenous factor listed by Dr. Coomaraswamy was more geopolitical . One is the trade war between the major economies , US and China , with the former slapping higher tariff on $ 200 billion worth of more Chinese imports and the latter countering with a similar move on $ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the tensions between US-Iran and within the Middle East . <p> " Due to the elevated uncertainty at global level , money and investors shift to safer havens i.e. US Dollar , the currency of the reserve of the international financial system , thereby strengthening the currency , " the Governor explained at the FT Cyber Security Summit , co-hosted by CICRA Holdings Ltd . <p> The third external factor is the rise in oil prices and since Sri Lanka is a net importer , there is pressure on reserves and exchange rate . " These are the three major reasons for the pressure on the rupee , " he added . <p> " Though Sri Lanka has made progress in terms of stabilising the economy , the external factors are too powerful and we do n't have the capacity to withstand without experiencing some pressure on reserves and exchange rate leading to depreciation , " Governor added . <p> It was also pointed out that countries with current account deficit in the balance of payments such as Sri Lanka are most vulnerable to these external shocks . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrong economic policies of the past which saw exports as a percentage of GDP shrinking to 12.4% by 2015 from 33% in 2000 and heavy foreign borrowings some in commercial terms and funding projects with low or no return , " Dr. Coomaraswamy recalled . <p> The Governor also strongly responded to queries as to why the Central Bank is not defending the falling rupee more aggressively . He revealed that past exercises of defending the rupee had disastrous effect and must remember the lessons . <p> According to him , in 2011/12 the then Central Bank administration spent a staggering $ 4.2 billion ( current reserves are at $ 8 billion ) to defend the rupee yet eventually the currency depreciated by 13.5% . Then in 2015 around $ 1.2 billion was spent but that failed to prevent the rupee from depreciating by 9% . <p> " So trying to spend large amount of our reserves to defend a particular ( exchange ) rate , in the end you up with a doublewhammy -- depleting the reserves and eventually ending up with a depreciating rupee , " he added @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Central Bank had of late been pursuing a flexible exchange policy with the rate more determined by the market and intervened selectively to smoothen out any sharp volatility and if necessary will get aggressively but not overly . <p> " We also have n't been just sitting back but have taken a few more remedial measures , " he added . <p> Additionally , the Central Bank addressed the loss of foreign exchange due to the excessive import of duty free gold only to be smuggled to India where a 15% duty applies . He said gold imports which were around $ 250 million had ballooned to $ 600 million in 2017 and in early this year it was growing at a rate by which we would have ended with nearly $ 1 billion spent by end 2018 .

@@40074232 <p> The poem is about Genghis Khan , the mighty Mongolian warrior who by the year 1227 created the world 's biggest empire before the British Empire . <p> The Mahinda Rajapaksa forces , like the malevolent armies of Genghis Khan , are hell-bent on invading Colombo , dislodging the democratically-elected Government and retaking power once again . For what ? One is compelled to ask . Genghis Khan had a purpose . But Mahinda ? <p> The Government has another one-and-a-half years to go to complete its duly won mandate . It is n't seeking to extend its hold as Rajapaksa did by his autocratic 18th Amendment . The UNP Government has no siblings to pass on power to as Rajapaksa has . Democratically , the electorate can ask the Government to account before it for promises made only at the end of its period . Yet , Mahinda Rajapaksa must invade and surround and capture . For what ? <p> This question keeps coming up like a rubber ball pressed into water . What on earth does Mahinda want to do now that he could n't do during his decade-long regime with all the power of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mask as liberators . Mahinda and his men are suspect before the law for countless alleged offences . Personally , Mahinda can escape court because of the legal immunity the Constitution gave him . Those who took orders are in trouble , like Lalith Weeratunga . <p> The men he put in charge of his Government 's key institutions were mostly his kith and kin and close stooges and they all have played riot with their jobs . His brother-in-law who worked as US Ambassador is at large over serious allegations of fraud . His other brother-in-law who ran Sri Lanka 's airline is faring too badly at the Presidential Commission . The amount of money involved in both instances runs into millions . An embassy can not go broke but the SriLankan Airlines , instead of flying in the air , ran down to the ground-dead broke ! <p> Then , we have Mahinda 's other relative , Udayanga Weeratunga , who was Ambassador in Russia , who has to answer prima facie evidence of serious fraud presented by his accusers . Udayanga is also said to have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the brother of Mahinda -- the powerful Gotabaya of Viyathmaga and Eliya and whatnot . If these accused feel innocent , why do they abscond and dodge court ? <p> Gota himself is seriously suspect over high profile murders and brutal assaults said to have been carried by a hit squad he is supposed to have operated . We had disfigured pictures of Keith Noyahr recently over social media . <p> The list is too long , but we can not miss Basil , the other powerful brother , who is also before court . Basil is said to have built a luxurious house with unaccountable money . His only defence is denial although the building is materially there . His wife is supposed to have been overseeing the construction but now both claim they have had nothing to do with that bungalow . That is one of the mysteries left behind by the regime . <p> The other hilarious mystery is over a house bought by Mahinda 's son , Yoshitha . We have to believe that the house was paid for by the grandma who , in turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bag of gems that she sold to get the money for her adorable grandson . This kind of story beats Aesop 's fables by heaps and bounds ! <p> The money said to have been played out by the Rajapaksa cohorts run into millions . Mahinda 's Private Secretary Gamini Senerath is now before the Special Court Trial-at-Bar and the money involved is simply over millions . Apparently , the Rajapaksa hordes never took small amounts . The fact that President Mahinda Rajapaksa watched over all these misdemeanours for 10 years without even making a pretence , like his successor , to be fighting corruption or swaying his sword against that as a threat , speaks volumes in support of the sub-text that he did benefit by all these . <p> The same also applies to the range of murderous activity that took place under that regime . The brutal killings and disappearances of numerous journalists and others are well on record and are under investigation . If anything comes of these enquiries , those who carried out orders will get caught and those who gave orders will stand immune @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have ? Mahinda Rajapaksa lied when he promised to rid the country of that Constitution and now he opposes the current move to change it . Mahinda wants power back together with that Constitution . <p> Financial crisis <p> Mahinda 's regime left a severe financial crisis behind them . National indebtedness rose to 82% of GDP ! None of the projects , even the useful ones like the highways , could be paid back out of earnings from the projects . The airport without flights and the harbour without ships were only flattering to Mahinda 's ego at the expense of the people . They are illustrations of foolery and stupidity . <p> No purpose <p> Mahinda 's army , unlike the army of Genghis Khan , is fighting without national purpose . The danger is that Mahinda shows no remorse for what transpired under his watch . He can not honestly do so as he is an amoral individual to whom moral values are empties . Nor does he present to the population a new style of government . <p> There is a purpose but that is personal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his guilty men released of their worries . The other purpose is to continue to amass fortune . Even Hitler had a purpose and that was to rid the land of Jews . To be fair , Mahinda aims at no such genocide . On the other hand , he would n't budge at setting off one ethnic group against another as a measure of being in power . In this sense , his slogans of Sinhala nationalism resonate with the Fascist times . <p> Politrix <p> It is clear the Rajapaksa forces focus on the politrix of the situation . They bring out all the tricks under their hat to swerve the political game in Sri Lanka in their favour . Ever since they were dislodged twice they adopted a two-fold strategy . <p> First was to create a fear among persons at decision-making level that they will make a comeback soon . This was to discourage officials and politicians from carrying out action against the Rajapaksas . Even a few UNP Ministers got trapped into that -- not to speak of officials . <p> The second strategy was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side . Rogues try to escape calling their accusers rogues . Unfortunately , they could not call them murderers as the Government has not killed any opponent and protestors are allowed to obstruct normal traffic all the time without getting anything more than a water bullet . This is wisdom on the part of the Government . <p> Politrix has n't space for <p> the economy <p> In the game of politrix there is n't any space for economics . On the other hand , the Sri Lanka economy can not wait anymore for rectification . Bad economics is the root cause for most ills in Sri Lanka . Unless the economy is rectified Sri Lankan society will collapse . But Mahinda 's hordes have no solutions presented for that . There was , of course , Gota 's economic plan , said to have been borrowed entirely from that of Ranil Wickremasinghe . <p> ( The writer can be reached via sjturaus@optusnet.com.au . ) <p> The weakness of the Sri Lanka economy is derived from two sources . First , we have a persistent fiscal deficit arising out our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increase in revenue . Politrix has been playing a role here . Our politicians cry halt at taxation but keep wanting to spend . <p> The population has also come to believe that the Government of the day must give them all the services they want but are unwilling to let the Government find revenue through taxation . The economic truism that expenditure can come only where revenues are available has never been realised by the politicians and the public . Political populism feeds into a syndrome . <p> The second source of weakness comes from a basic structural disorder in the economy in that we have become a debt economy . Almost every year since independence , Sri Lanka has had adverse trade balances . Our imports keep growing but the growth of exports is insufficient to meet the import demand . Over the last three years , we have achieved a definite growth in exports but the import bill has climbed even further . A resulting balance of payments crisis has been averted only by foreign remittances and tourism . <p> This condition can not go on without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quality of public services like education , health , etc . The need for intense investment in economic growth ventures is paramount . <p> In this connection , the Government 's encouragement of enterprises at local level is commendable . <p> ' Enterprise Lanka ' program <p> The Yahapalayana Government , avoiding politrix , is focusing seriously in economy remodelling . The Prime Minister and the Finance Minister must be commended over the recently opened ' Enterprise Lanka ' program where loans are given at low interest to young entrepreneurs to start ventures at local level . The program started off in Moneragala District and will spread to Anuradhapura , Jaffna , etc. soon . <p> It is clear the Government is on the right path here . Having restored the lost democratic liberties the Yahapalanaya Government has at last got into the right path as far as the economy is concerned . <p> Rajapaksa 's politrix runs counter to the serious economic realities that the Government is currently giving attention to . If he loves his country , Mahinda Rajapaksa must be serious about economics and not politrix . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> DISCLAIMER : <p> 1 .

@@40074233 <h> The knowhow path to Sri Lankan development <p> When Adam Smith wrote ' The Wealth of Nations ' in 1776 , the richest country in the world was four times richer than the poorest one . Today , Singapore is over 110 times richer than Burundi . What could possibly explain such an extreme divergence of the wealth of nations ? <p> Economists have shown that these differences are too large to be explained by differences in the availability of land or capital -- including human capital . So , they ascribe it to differences in the productivity with which land and capital are used , something that economists attribute to technology . But what is technology and why does it differ across countries ? <p> Technology really is composed of three elements : tools , codes and knowhow . Tools embody the knowledge of how they were made . They exist in three-dimensional space . Codes include recipes , protocols , routines and how-to-do manuals . They codify the knowledge about making things in the form of instructions to potential implementers , just as cookbooks do . Codes exist in a symbolic space in the sense that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ink over paper or as letters on a screen . Tools can be shipped anywhere in the world and codes can be put on the web , making them available pretty much everywhere . So why do such large differences in productivity and technology persist ? <p> Implementing technology requires not just tools and codes but also knowhow . To play a violin sonata you need a violin , which is a tool and you need the music score , which is a code , but you also need to know how to read the notes and how to play the instrument . That is what we call knowhow . It exists only in brains and gets there through a long process of imitation and repetition . It takes many years to become a master violin player . Knowhow is tacit , meaning that it is hard to transmit . You do not learn it by just hearing somebody speak about it . <p> Tools , codes and knowhow are complements : you need all three . If you do not know how to play the violin , you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scores . Because of its reliance on knowhow , technology moves across geography only with difficulty , and it is much easier to move brains than it is to move knowhow into brains . <p> Moreover , it is not just individual knowhow that matters . Many technologies can not be implemented by individuals : they require coherent teams . A violinist may play a violin sonata , but he can not , on his own , play a symphony . He requires many other musicians that are competent in different instruments . <p> Having more technology means having more tools , codes and knowhow , but the hardest to accumulate is the knowhow . And knowhow does not grow because musicians individually learn how to play more instruments . It is because different musicians learn how to play different instruments . In other words , societies know more because individuals know different . Hence , accumulation of knowhow at the level of the society requires the division or diversification of knowhow across individuals . <p> This diversification of knowhow has two consequences . First , more knowhow means that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make more things , meaning that production can become more diversified . Second , having more knowhow also means that societies can also make more knowhow-intensive products : things whose production requires larger and more diverse teams . <p> How does diversifi <p> cation happen ? <p> If a society accumulates knowhow it will be able to do things it was not doing before , i.e. it would diversify its production . But this faces a chicken and egg problem . You can not do the things you do not know how to do but you do not know how to do the things you do not do . <p> For example , if a country would like to start producing watches , it will need watchmakers . But if it does n't produce watches , it will not have any watchmakers -- it will have to train watchmakers . But who will train the watchmakers if there are no watchmakers to begin with ? This type of problem is ubiquitous when it comes to economic diversification and limits the speed and scope at which it can take place . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As knowhow resides in brains , the movement of knowhow happens through the mobility of the brains that hold it . This happens at all scales . It happens between firms in a city . In the heydays of automotive industry in Detroit , Michigan , almost half of the over one hundred new auto firms were spin-offs from existing companies , as employees that learned how to do things in one firm moved to found other firms . Similar is the case of the Silicon Valley , where many semiconductor companies are spinoffs of a single parent company -- Fairchild Semiconductors , itself a spin-off from Bell Labs . <p> It also happens between regions of a country . In research with Frank Neffke we documented that the firms that diversified East Germany after reunification hired experienced workers from West Germany and firms that diversify regions of Sweden are founded by entrepreneurs that come from outside the region or by multi-plant forms that are headquartered outside of their region . And it happens also between countries through migration , diaspora networks and foreign direct investment . <p> Starting in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to multinationals . Today , 46% of Singapore 's population is foreign-born . Over the last 20 years , Singapore 's annual FDI inflows have averaged 18% of its GDP . Today the purchasing power of Singapore 's GDP per capita is seven times that of Sri Lanka , although at its founding in 1965 Singapore looked up to Sri Lanka . By contrast , only 0.1% of the Sri Lankan population is foreign born and FDI has averaged about 1% of GDP . <p> In addition to migration and FDI there are diaspora networks and return migration . Members of a country 's diaspora often acquire knowhow in their host country that they can transfer to their home country under the right circumstances . Return migration of US-educated engineers to Taiwan and Korea played a key role in the development of the ICT industries in this region and overseas Chinese played a key role in the development of China once it opened up to FDI in 1978 . They brought along knowledge , capital and connections from the world 's most advanced places . Several cities in India , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IT centers by leveraging the Indian diaspora in the US and the returning diaspora . Today , India 's ICT service exports are 5% of its GDP , while those of Sri Lanka are only 1% of GDP , even after the end of the civil war . <p> These channels have all played a role in Sri Lanka 's past growth as well . The rubber tyre sector was pioneered by an immigrant from Belgium , for example . In the garment sector , today 's two largest exporters were started by descendents of immigrants from Gujarat , and in general most of the largest post-liberalisation companies started as joint ventures or FDI . Finally , the rapidly-growing IT sector is bolstered by the connections that Sri Lankan entrepreneurs made while living in Silicon Valley and elsewhere . Yet in spite of their transformational impact in the past , there remain significant barriers and disincentives to immigration , return migration and FDI in Sri Lanka today . <p> Attracting knowhow <p> into Sri Lanka <p> Going forward , it is critical that Sri Lanka harnesses these three knowhow channels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weak growth of exports , particularly from new sectors . In the last 25 years , Sri Lanka has seen virtually no new export products , especially in manufactured goods . This is in contrast with other countries in the region such as Thailand , China , and Vietnam , where new product lines contribute significantly to the increase in overall exports . While Sri Lanka is still mainly exporting garments and traditional agricultural products , the other countries moved on to electronics and machinery . As a result , Sri Lankan exports have not been keeping up with the pace of economic growth , leading to widening of the current account deficits that ultimately cause growth to stall . <p> But Sri Lanka can change this by enhancing the inflow of knowhow from abroad and it has several policies it can adopt . One of these is immigration policy . The current immigration system makes it difficult for Sri Lankan firms to hire foreign professionals . It also makes it nearly impossible for potential new entrepreneurs to migrate into the country to establish new firms . <p> In a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ study showed how restrictive the current policy regime is in Sri Lanka . The study found that while other countries are transitioning from systems that just authorise immigration to those that promote it selectively , Sri Lanka has restrictions galore including no path to permanent residency or citizenship , a feature that is quite unique . <p> Singapore , for example , offers a variety of visa categories for key economic actors such as investors , entrepreneurs and start-up talent . It also offers a variety of visa categories for people with different levels of skills and economic roles , from the highly skilled to domestic servants . It offers the possibility for workers ' dependents to seek employment as well as paths to permanent residency and citizenship . As a result , foreigners there have high incentives to consider migrating to the country and once there , to integrate and to invest in the future of Singapore . <p> Sri Lanka is very far from these practices . True , the Board of Investment ( BOI ) makes it easier for BOI firms to hire foreign employees , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ destination : spouses of foreigners need ministerial-level permission to work in Sri Lanka ; foreign experts are not allowed to move across firms , as visas are specific to an employment relationship ; and they can not aspire to permanent residence , let alone citizenship . For non-BOI firms , which are the overwhelming majority of Sri Lankan companies , hiring foreign experts is much harder . <p> One hurdle facing many worker visa applications is obtaining approval from the corresponding national association for the profession . These associations have often worked on the assumption that businesses might use foreigners to substitute for local professionals , and hence lower their wages or employment prospects . But this assumes that foreign professionals are substitutes rather than complements of local talent . Substitutes are things like tea and coffee . The more tea you have , the less coffee you want . Complements are things like tea and sugar : the more tea you have , the more sugar you want . <p> In research studies that Harvard CID has carried out not only in Sri Lanka but also in several countries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jordan , we have found that foreigners , especially skilled ones , are strong complements , not substitutes of locals , meaning that a greater employment of foreigners increases the employment and wages of locals . Moreover , the effects are not just limited to the expansion of the industry that hires the immigrant : there are important multiplier effects on the whole local economy with employment multipliers -- i.e. local jobs created per immigrant -- estimated between 2 and 4 . <p> One study for the US estimated that every foreign-born worker with a Science Technology Engineering or Math ( STEM ) degree creates 2.6 jobs for US-born workers . And since these are good jobs that pay high wages , their growth also increases the demand for non-tradable domestic services . By contrast , immigration restrictions tend to create artificial skills shortages that prevent industries from expanding and hiring more locals . <p> Some argue that Sri Lanka can not open up to more high-skilled immigration because it does not have the right institutions that would evaluate the qualifications of foreign nationals . This argument is bogus , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as medicine or law is a process that is independent of the immigration status of the person under consideration . If Sri Lanka were to admit graduates from any university that is better ranked than the best ranked Sri Lankan university , this should allay any fears of inadequate foreign training . <p> While the current migration policies are bad in general for Sri Lanka , they are particularly catastrophic for diversification , as immigration is key to solving chicken and egg problems . To put it bluntly , If the United States had Sri Lankan immigration policies , Silicon Valley would not exist , given that 57% of its STEM workers are foreign born . Another 25% come from states other than California . Only 18% were born in California , which is a state with twice the population of Sri Lanka ( and the US population is 15 times that of Sri Lanka ) . <p> It 's clear that Sri Lanka 's current economic structure -- and the underlying knowhow -- is inadequate to propel the society forward . Some Sri Lankans wish that their country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ocean , or a high-tech manufacturer connected to many global value chains , or an incubator of some of the world 's next high-tech unicorns . Each of these visions is possible , but not if the country tries to do it alone . <p> No economy can achieve such a transformation using only the knowhow of the citizens who have never ventured past its borders . The successful economies enhance their capabilities by attracting the missing sugar that can enhance the tea : that is , they work to integrate foreign migrants and their own diaspora into their societies . Rather than fearing foreigners , they develop an attitude of pride in the fact that people born elsewhere want to become part of them . This is a path that is open to Sri Lanka . But as all paths , it does not get you anywhere unless you take it . <p> Ricardo Hausmann is the Director of the Center for International Development ( CID ) at Harvard University and a professor of economics at the Harvard Kennedy School .

When ousted from power they discover new virtues in democracy and leverage mobs and oligarchs to reacquire their positions of domination on a larger and more destructive scale . <p> In the past three years of scandal plagued deeply dysfunctional democracy we have forgotten what it was like to live constantly under government coercion . Today three years after , we take our liberties for granted . The decade of unfreedom is erased from our collective memory . <p> The threat looms large and loud . One oligarch at a recent parley that was labelled a ' fireside chat ' at the Colombo Hilton openly called for a ' little bit of a dictator ' to make things smooth for the rich to get richer . His logic was spookily soft ! There is no such thing as a little bit of evil . <p> This essay is an exploration of our current political discourse wherein everyone is doing what they think is somehow justified . That includes those now in power , those who hope to regain their lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power . <p> Patriotism as our experience has shown is a virtue of the vicious . <p> ' Evil ' is an accusatory adjective that calls for some explanatory reasoning . Most people do things which somehow later turnout to be evil and remembered as evil . <p> ' Who is Lasantha ? ' Gotabaya Rajapaksa famously asked BBC 's Stephen Sackur . It was not arrogance of power . It was the evil of power . Trivialising human life is wrong . Trivialising murder is evil . <p> Lasantha Wickrematunge met with evil in 2009 just before the carnage of the civil war ended . Richard de Zoysa 's tryst with evil was in 1990 just seven years after the pogrom of July 1983 that more or less unleashed the hell and hellfire that lasted another two decades . <p> Journalist Poddala Jayantha is the most recent victim of evil that lived to narrate his encounter with evil . <p> " They cut my hair and put it into my mouth , then gagged me . They struck both my legs , breaking one at the ankle . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my right hand until they bled . They said , ' This will stop you from writing ' . They eventually let me go , saying ' We wo n't kill you now , but if you organise any more demonstrations against the Government , if you speak to the media , we will kill you ' . " <p> Finger pointing is not the purpose of this essay although it may appear to be so , given the illustrative episode cited . <p> What is attempted is another quest for our collective moral compass amidst the drift to nowhere after a decade of unfreedom and three years of inchoate and chaotic freedom with the kleptocracy entrenched more than ever . It is a fairy tale that has no fairy tale ending . <p> The King saw the ' Evil ' in all its monstrous complexity and terror . Together with his brothers he formed a great army to destroy the evil and rescue the land from imminent peril . The war was savage , but its intent was pure . Many died but the King remained true to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set . <p> It was a humanitarian war against an opponent whose evil the likes of which , the world had not seen before . The people saw the armies the king put in to the battle . They cheered their benign bravery . They sang hymns of praise for their deep-rooted humanism . The king was truly a Great King . The enemy was dead . But evil lived on , for evil does not die in battle . Evil dies with the dead and lives with those who survive , for it can survive only in a human heart that beats and evil has the genius of adhering to the rhythm of the human breast . It is a clever usurper of the space reserved for the human conscience . <p> The fairy-tale where the goblin of evil defeats the good fairy is relevant to our post war politics . The post 2009 trajectory of our flawed democracy is clear evidence that evil results can flow from good motives . <p> Post war peace time evil <p> The war ended unleashing a torrent of rampant nationalism . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time evil that has gripped us since the end of the armed conflict . The raw political divisions that has emerged since the end of the military conflict contains adequate quantities of evil that makes this survey a national imperative . <p> Make no mistake . We created the edifice of tyranny and evil . Impeaching the chief justice was a politically motivated vindictive act but did not amount to evil . <p> When the chairman of the parliamentary select committee that found her guilty Anura Priyadharshana Yapa went to the gates of the residence of the ousted CJ to partake in a ' Kavun &amp; Kiribath ' feast , that was pure unadulterated ' evil ' . It was even greater evil when he decided to accept cabinet office in the subsequent ' Yahapalanaya ' dispensation . <p> When the Defence Secretary -- a nominal public servant ordered the navy to stage a firework display in the Diyawanna Lake to mark the ouster of the Chief Justice , it was unmitigated , unimaginable evil . The two instances are minor examples that demonstrate that evil is a composite of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in advance and created an evil monster . Most of the powers of the tyrant were freely given by us . In those troubled times , the people willingly allowed themselves to be co-opted in the fight to prevent greater evil . What we failed to realise was that we were teaching power what it can do to whom we despised and to us when peace was restored . <p> We allowed our institutions to be dismantled . We never imagined that the 17th Amendment could be tinkered with . The then opposition walked out on the debate on the 18th Amendment . That they did not march in to the well of the house in protest was not evil but qualifies to fighting terrorism must necessarily resort to some degree of violence , observe some protocols of secrecy and be willing to abrogate some citizens ' rights . <p> While , this was sound strategy at the time of fighting the war , it carried with it the seductive allure of absolute power that made the ruling family run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end of the war brought a peace that did not reduce the power or the scope of the surveillance state . It hardly impacted the security regime .

We know what they are talking about , but we miss the most significant fact about ' evil ' . It distorts the rational choice of those who wield political power . Politics is not evil , only politicians turn evil . Because politics is about masses and mobs the collective evil is reflected through the masses and the mobs manipulated by those engaged in politics . <p> The war is over . The lessons of the war are remembered . The war compelled the state to use fear to manipulate and control . The war made fear an instrument of power . <p> When we are afraid , we obey .

He taught his political stooges the importance of upholding their natural self-interest and that of his political machine -- the party . <p> Fighting terrorism is fighting evil . There is no harm in that proposition . One may even go further and claim the necessity for fighting evil with greater evil . But often that is not the way the dice fall . Some of the worst things done to human beings are done with the best will in the world . In a democracy blindness to evil can also be equally evil . Subverting institutions that guard against evil is the greatest evil of all . <p> The Rajapaksa family rule may yet come back . Our memories are short .

Let us also take the fact into account , that the two weeds that have conquered the human civilisation from grass family are the rice and wheat crops . These two weeds have evolved for generations with scientific hybrids and feed and energise the majority of the global population .

Cabinet approves the purchase of 2567 AK47s for the DWC <p> Based on a Memorandum dated 18 July submitted by the Minister of Sustainable Development , Wildlife and Regional Development on a ' Proposed new plan for resolving the Elephant-Human Conflict , ' the Cabinet of Ministers approved Cabinet Paper No. 18/1604/844/002 . <p> Among other things , including the construction of an additional 2651 Km of electric fencing ( Proposal 1 ) to make the total length of fences in Sri Lanka a staggering 7000 Km , is the purchase of 2567 AK47s ( Annexure 3 ) . Why would the Department of Wildlife Conservation ( DWC ) require such an arsenal of weaponry ; to shoot elephants or people ? <p> The right thing to do <p> Of the many Government Departments , almost 100 , there is only one that has the mandate to look after the interest of Sri Lanka 's wild animals -- the Department of Wildlife Conservation . Yet , the favourite phrase of most incumbent Ministers who have responsibility for it , when turning a blind eye to the illegal encroachments into protected areas , as sponsored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fencing ' , is that " the people must be looked after " . <p> True ... and that is what the other 99 plus departments should do ! The Ministry for Wildlife should do just that -- look after wildlife ! Instead , the winds blow towards the political needs of whichever politician is foisted on them . <p> The answer is not to increase the number of kilometres of fencing but to reposition the existing fencing to places where they will have the greatest effect in reducing Human-Elephant Conflict ( HEC ) , thereby preserving the life of both elephants and humans . For this , strategic fencing is necessary . <p> Over 70% of wild elephants live outside of protected areas which is where most of the HEC takes place . Surely , if the priority is to protect people , then the fencing should be around their villages and cultivations ? This way , the elephants can wander on their traditional paths within Forest Department ( FD ) and DWC protected areas and not intrude into the lives of the people who live in villages . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way <p> Electric fencing is the best option available , at present , to prevent elephants moving from one place to another but they have to be in the right places ! <p> Electric fences are most effective when erected on ecological boundaries , as elephant range is based on ecological needs . A map of the existing electric fences shows many that are haphazardly placed , with no seeming rhyme or reason and others , most dangerously , placed between DWC land and FD land , traditional homes of the elephant , movement between the two being vital for their long-term survival . <p> Invariably , further investigation reveals that these fences were erected at the behest of the local politician of the area , as endorsed by whoever was in charge of Wildlife at the time .

Yet , it has spent most of its time on a shelf in the relevant Ministry . One of the reasons may be that once adopted into statute , it will be that much harder to breach , and relevant Ministers will find it more difficult to placate their colleagues or take arbitrary decision to woo popular appeal .

Elephants will then either starve to death or be shot trying to break out to find food and water . <p> Their blood , and those of the additional humans who may also die due to the inevitable escalation of HEC , will be on the heads of the Cabinet of Ministers who have approved this measure ... while , no doubt , the official and other may have well-publicised religious ceremonies for every elephant and human so murdered . <p> The only way forward <p> There is huge cost in erecting electric fencing , not to mention the other issues which often plague large public sector spending in Sri Lanka .

@@40074237 <h> Vision 2025 : Shaping Sri Lanka ? ? ? s Socioeconomic future <p> Sri Lanka geopolitically positioned at an important inter section in the Indian Ocean is on a developmental approach to reinvigorate its socio-economic growth . The interconnectivity between India and Sri Lanka and the broad-based economic expansion policy plans of ' New India 2022 ' and ' Vision 2025 ' of Sri Lanka indicates the extent to which the two countries vie to continue with reforms to increase growth , jobs and wages . <p> Sri Lanka 's Vision 2025 is founded on a set of core principles including a strategy for national exports , social market economy and a skill pool to match the demands of the job market . Vision 2025 has fixed targets of achieving an annual export income of $ 20 billion , increase Foreign Direct Investment ( FDI ) up to $ 5 billion and to create employment opportunities for at least a million Sri Lankans by 2025 . <p> This ambitious goal is however not without apprehension . The statistical figures in the recent past since the new government came into power in 2015 indicate a steady decline in annual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 5% growth rate in 2015 has fallen to a low of 3.1% in 2017 . <p> The looming elections which could cause market volatility closer to the polls and the sense of the existence of a shadow government appears to have lowered investor confidence . Hence a strong political leadership is cited as the defining factor for the success of this vision plan in the next few years . Furthermore , another important factor to boost investor confidence and enhance the economy is to have concrete measures for transparency and accountability in all processes in both the public and the private sector administrations . <p> It is commonly acknowledged that the key element to enterprise reforms in Sri Lanka is the development of the micro enterprise sector with the promotion of Small and Medium Enterprises ( SMEs ) which generate over 50% of GDP . Hence , subsidies for small agricultural holdings can be perhaps cited as one of most important factors that can drive the economic growth levels of SMEs while also facilitating the country to achieve required levels in food security . <p> Though the country has seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remains one of the highest among Asian countries . The Poverty Head Count Index had dropped from 8.9 in 2009/10 to 4.1 in 2016 . However , despite the rising income levels as reflected through per capita GDP estimates , income inequality remains high with the poorest 20% of the population accounting for only 4.8% of the income while the richest 20% have earned 50.8% of the total income . Hence , while initiating measures to boost economic growth , it is imperative to have processes in place to increase the share of national income available to the poor . <p> Foreign Direct Investments ( FDIs ) are important to boost the economy for small countries such as Sri Lanka . FDIs in the country have seen a steady increase from $ 680 million in 2015 to $ 1.4 billion in 2017 . It is expected that the new Inland Revenue Act and the Foreign Exchange Act aimed at promoting the investment climate will help Sri Lanka achieve its target of $ 5 billion by 2025 . <p> Over the past 10 years the nation 's development agenda has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at high interest rates . These loans put pressure on the country 's economy . Heavy borrowings from China and India come with their own strategic interests impinging on Sri Lanka 's development agenda . <p> The National Unity Government elected in 2015 began to advocate radical economic reforms by obtaining loans through the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) to boost economic growth . One of the most widely adopted economic reform measures entail tax reforms to increase government revenue , as agreed with the IMF in exchange for a $1.5 billion , three-year loan . <p> The country 's export performance had recovered after the slump in the years 2015 and 2016 to $ 11.4 billion in 2017 slightly higher than the 2014 figure of $ 11.1 billion . Improvement in export income occurred through the restoration of the GSP + with effect from 19 May 2017 providing exports from Sri Lanka preferential market access on par with countries such as Bangladesh , Pakistan and several countries from Africa and South America . <p> The recent investment of $ 1.5 billion by China in the Colombo Port City @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foreign exchange earner to the country is worker remittances amounting to $ 7.2 billion in 2017 from around 1.8 million Sri Lankans working abroad . <p> Although economic reforms as cited above have played a role in attempting to increase economic performance , there is still a long way to go in meeting the set targets in the Vision 2025 Sri Lanka policy report . Despite having measures in place to achieve these objectives , the most important transformation for Sri Lanka should be one that reflects sustainable economic growth that is inclusive while incorporating measures for multidimensional development in the socio , economic and political spheres . <p> Srimal Fernando is Global Editor of Diplomatic Society for South Africa and a Research Scholar at Jindal School of International Affairs , India .

@@40074238 <h> The heartbreak of ragging <p> There has been public outcry after an appeal from a mother of a student who committed suicide after allegedly being ragged mercilessly at the Sabaragamuwa University . The complaint to the police was made three and a half years after the tragic incident , according to reports , and underscores the devastation that can be caused by this inhuman practice . <p> Incidents of ragging are frequently reported but even though the maximum penalty carries 10 years of rigorous imprisonment , ragging has remained a significant problem within local universities . Last year 15 Peradeniya University students were arrested for ragging while in 2016 , 10 Kelaniya undergraduates were arrested after they forced a female first-year student to remove the jeans she was wearing and later slapped her . Both instances garnered much publicity but a comprehensive effort to stamp out ragging at local universities has failed to materialise . As with other forms of illegal and reprehensible behaviour , actual convictions that happen consistently would be the best deterrent . <p> Sri Lanka in 1998 passed the Prohibition of Ragging and Other Forms of Violence in Educational Institutions Act , which carries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tainted , with several world publications claiming that Sri Lankans practise the worst forms of ragging . It would be impossible for the Government to reform the higher education sector unless they tackle the issue of ragging and root it out of the system . <p> Statistics show 15 students have died , two have committed suicide , 25 have been disabled , six sexually abused and more than 6,000 students have left universities , all because of ragging by seniors and the failure of university and State authorities to take effective countermeasures or implement the law strictly . <p> Having first rejected ragging , the Inter-University Students ' Federation ( IUSF ) has defended it as a " subculture " , which is a gross and wholly inadequate reason to allow its continuance . Union activities , which are at their strongest in hostels , create the environment for ragging victims to suffer in silence . Students are also used to promote political ends and unfairly manipulated to disrupt the functions of universities . If organisations such as the IUSF want to be seen as genuine representatives of students @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Unions and academics have the responsibility to implement safeguards against the heinous practice . Officials of student unions need to educate their members on the physical and psychological negatives of ragging . Union members can report fellow students engaged in ragging and protect hostellers , who are often the worst-affected . Any student caught ragging should be immediately kicked out of the university and face criminal charges . Such tough measures to empower students are the only way to give victims the confidence to come forward . <p> Cooperating with authorities to punish offenders and eventually clean the university system of ragging will gain student unions and other stakeholders significant public approval and even increase the masses ' empathy on other issues that they campaign on such as adequate funding of State universities . If more students complained to Police and officials implement the law then Sri Lanka might finally see the end of a practice that has nothing to recommend it . Such tragedies such as what happened to this student should never be allowed to happen again . <h> Share This Article <h> DISCLAIMER : <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FT Web Editor . <p> 2 .

Ideology shapes populations , and must be protected against the flaws of humanity " <p> By Naveen Anandakumar <p> Leadership is what drives the success or failure of a family , relationship , company , sports team , and country . We have seen through history the failings of poor leadership , from small to large scale . <p> It is an innate social reality -- that a direction be driven and lead for a group to collectively make progress . A country is a group of people bound by the same oath to protect and serve each other , and this has been destructively misused by some leaders , whilst used for beauty and prosperity of others . <p> Humans , we must accept , are inherently flawed . Humanity has proved again , through history , to be capable of committing acts against humanity , such as killing , rape , genocide , etc. , where it is erroneous for us to blame such actions on ' bad people ' , but that these people could have been our brothers and sisters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behavioural makeup . <p> Notable experiments including the ' Milgram experiment ' on obedience or historical phenomena of Nazi atrocities and the Nanking massacre are examples of educated and highly intelligence people committing acts of atrocity , driven by an ideology where these behaviours were built in over time by those leaders for a particular purpose . <p> This is the risk at the extreme end of what humans are capable , and we ca n't simply dismiss these as random or evil acts -- these were committed by humans , people who had brothers , sisters , children , parents , like us , who over time became capable of committing such acts . <p> By accepting our vulnerability and innate human flaw when it comes to group survival and social ' groupthink ' bias , we can better appreciate the risks associated with what poor leadership built on flawed ideology can do to a population . <p> This is important today , given increasingly difficult macro-economic conditions primarily driven by climate change : less agricultural output , rising import costs , less energy output due to infrastructure not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expensive fuel imports , all in amidst the rising trade tensions between the two largest world economies . <p> And in this environment , we are seeing many examples of poor leadership : dangerous rhetoric , degradation of moral standards , normalcy of xenophobia , and less kindness -- notably from very influential world leaders . <p> My concern is with elections looming , how such methods are beginning to be employed in Sri Lanka , and efforts to use similar rhetoric and biases to create instability , when in reality life is far better than it was 10-20 years ago . <p> We have experienced the pain of inhuman thinking for the sake of a flawed ideology . One ca n't explain the ' greater good ' of a xenophobic ideology to a widowed mother or orphaned child .

We have one of the strongest state healthcare systems and lowest mortality rates among the developing and emerging economies , and this is only getting stronger . <p> Any leader who genuinely wanted to take this and make it better would focus on the good we have ahead of us , and aim to encourage this sense of national unity we currently have , than focus on fear and hate to lobby political and social support , because the latter is fundamentally dangerous .
