The Premier talked about many issues including good governance , human rights and exorbitant consultancy fees charged by lawyers . <p> We at The Guardian on Sunday would like to support the Premier 's call in the area of corruption that has clouded the legal fraternity in recent years , casting doubt about the integrity of lawyers , not only in Tanzania but also in the rest of East Africa . <p> We know that not all lawyers are corrupt or are involve in corrupt deals , because there are still some distinguished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have gone beyond the horizon . <p> But , surely , corruption has strongly eroded the moral values of the learned brothers and sisters in this country , to the extent of making many believe that ' justice is for sale ' through the court 's corridors . <p> Mario Puzo , one of the well respected novelists of our time , once said : " A lawyer with a briefcase can steal more than a thousand men with guns . " <p> Taking into considerations what has been happening behind the scenes within the judiciary system , we strongly concur with Mario Puzo that some of our lawyers with their briefcases steal more than thousands armed robbers in this country and elsewhere in East Africa . <p> We would like to see the underlying moral reflection and moral accountability to which individual lawyers hold them , in this country as well as within the East African region . <p> Writing about the importance of morals values among lawyers , Scott A Fredricks put it this way : " For instance , the morally responsible lawyer views his professional conduct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the moral values expressed in his professional conduct . In contrast , the morally irresponsible lawyer views his conduct in amoral or morally neutral terms . " <p> Scott further wrote , " That is , he divorces himself from moral reflection regarding the means or ends to which his technical proficiency is put . Therefore , it is not the conduct , per se , that defines the irresponsible lawyer ; rather , it is the way he views and understands his conduct . <p> To fight corruption within the legal fraternity should adhere to their moral values and ethics . Tanzanians ca n't afford to have a corrupt judiciary that serves not according to the justice principles , but basing on how much a client or the accused is willing to pay . <p> It is undeniable truth that the legal profession in Tanzania is under assault from all sides including lawyers themselves who are not satisfied by the way things are going within the legal fraternity . We agree that the law plays a crucial role now than ever in the lives of individuals in this country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ achieve good governance and equitable justice for all . That 's why the conduct of lawyers is under increasing scrutiny . <p> We , at The Guardian on Sunday , would like to urge our lawyers through their various professional associations to shun corruption and corrupt lawyers , who are tarnishing the image of their noble profession . We strongly concur with the call made by Premier on this crucial matter .

While CCM sees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to remove it from power , the opposition too , especially Chadema , falls into the trap of demanding the new law because it believes that to defeat the ruling party , it needs a new constitution . <p> This is a very wrong move and surely it ca n't give us a new constitution . We at The Guardian on Sunday are also appalled by the main opposition 's move to boycott the debate on Constitutional Review Bill , because it was ill-timed move . <p> By boycotting the debate about the agenda , which they initiated and marketed during the last year 's election , the just paved the way for their rivals to have a free time to ' hijack ' the constitutional review agenda . <p> We understand Chadema 's concern , but , it does n't warrant a boycott at the time when many expected candid and meaningful contributions from the original authors of the constitutional review process . <p> Chadema 's absence created a vacuum , which was then used by their counterparts from the ruling party and their allies , Civic United Front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Parliament , early , this week . <p> Chadema 's approach of refraining from debating national issues in the Parliament can only give the party a political mileage at the short-run , but in the long-run ; it 's an old approach , which ca n't help the future of this country . Though we understand the importance of the so called people 's power in the democratic society , sometimes , our politicians may abuse the process . <p> We at The Guardian on Sunday expected Chadema , which is currently , the country 's biggest opposition party to face their rivals , CCM , during the debate in Parliament by giving candid , well researched and meaningful contributions on which kind of the constitution Tanzanians need . <p> But , above all , some CCM lawmakers have exposed themselves before the public raising a concern on how they were elected or selected to join the most crucial organ , the Parliament of the United Republic of Tanzania . <p> For instance some CCM legislators accused the foreign diplomats , saying the latter were interfering with the ongoing constitutional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give any concrete proof to prove their allegations , casting doubt about the legitimacy of their claims . <p> It 's the same old and outdated mentality among some African leaders who , when confronted with challenges from their own people , instead of facing the reality , decide purposely to shift the blame to the foreign powers . What these CCM lawmakers mean is that Tanzanians , after fifty years of independence , ca n't reason logically without being pushed or funded by foreign powers . <p> This is an insult to the people of Tanzania especially those who have voiced their concern about the ' flawed constitution review process ' . The very same foreign donors accused of funding , and influencing the opposition against the constitution review process , are the ones who have been funding about 48 percent of the government budget for decades now . <p> Paradoxically , when these donors fund our local Non Governmental Organisations , they became intruders to our domestic affairs , but , when they dole out billions to the government formed by the ruling party , they change from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Who is a patriotic ? Those who ' hijack ' a public agenda and make it a political agenda , or those who want the hijacked agenda to remain the people 's property , controlled , and decided by the people ? So we have reached at the situation whereby when you differ with the legislators from the ruling party , you are simply a saboteur . <p> A constitution is a set of fundamental principles or established precedents according to which a state or other organisation is governed . <p> These rules together make up , i.e. constitute , what the entity is . A constitution is about the people , for the people and therefore the process to re-write or review it should n't be ' hijacked ' by a group of politicians . <p> A constitution is a document that manages and guards the theory of social contract . We , as the people , forfeit some of our rights to the so called government or State , and in return , we expect the same government to fulfill our social , political and economic needs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an intellectual device intended to explain the appropriate relationship between individuals and their governments . Social contract arguments assert that individuals unite into political societies by a process of mutual consent , agreeing to abide by common rules and accept corresponding duties to protect themselves and one another from violence and other kinds of harm . <p> According to Thomas Hobbes , human life would be " solitary , poor , nasty , brutish , and short " in the absence of political order and law . <p> In its absence , we would live in a state of nature , where each person has unlimited natural freedoms , including the " right to all things " and thus the freedom to plunder , rape , and murder ; there would be an endless " war of all against all " ( bellum omnium contra omnes ) . <p> To avoid this , free men establish political community i.e. civil society through a social contract in which each gains security in return for subjecting himself absolutely to an absolute sovereign , preferably ( for Hobbes ) a monarch . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tyrannical , Hobbes saw the only alternative as the terrifying anarchy of the state of nature . <p> Alternatively , some , including Jean-Jacques Rousseau , have argued that we gain civil rights in return for accepting the obligation to respect and defend the rights of others , giving up some freedom to do so ; this alternative formulation of the duty arising from the social contract is often identified with arguments about military service . <p> The central assertion of social contract approaches is that law and political order are not natural , but are instead human creations . The social contract and the political order it creates are simply the means towards an end the benefit of the individuals involved and ( according to some philosophers such as Rousseau ) , legitimate only to the extent that they meet the general interest ( " general will " in Rousseau ) . For many social contract theorists , this implies that failings discovered in laws or political structures can be changed by the citizens through elections or other means , including , if necessary , violence . <p> It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people want to own the entire process , excluding the majority whom that process holds their future politically , socially and economically . We ca n't expect the best constitution from the process that was technically flawed from the very first day . <p> We are all aware that the writing of a new constitution was n't the agenda of the ruling party during last year 's election . This was the agenda preached and championed by the opposition , Chadema , which promised to deliver a new constitution within a hundred days after being elected . Though the 100-days time was questionable , bearing in mind the resources required to write a new constitution , still it was Chadema 's agenda . <p> However in an expected move , the idea was accepted by President Jakaya Kikwete , even at the time when his own party was against it . On Friday , the President made it clear that he would ensure that we , the people , have a new constitution before the 2015 general election , and appealed for wisdom , unity and peace to prevail above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> We therefore appeal to all political leaders and the general public to put petty issues and personal interests aside , and come out in multitude to give their opinions on how they would like this country to be governed in future . <p> They should own this process by giving their meaningful contributions during the process to gather the people 's views on the proposed new constitution . <p> Mudslinging politics shown by some CCM lawmakers as well as the so called countrywide demonstration planned by Chadema , will not at all , take this country anywhere except plunging us into political chaos at the time when we are required to own the constitution review process by telling the State what we want .

At the same time , a young albino boy seated close to the two men was wondering how a father can dine with a stranger who wanted to kill his son just some few hours later . To this boy 's mind , the figures were just not adding up , but he just left time to tell what next . <p> Influenced by the lust for affluence , a father has just sold his albino child to the attacker , in a secret contract only attended by the man 's second wife , just two days before the deadly deal took place .

In a poverty stricken family , this may sound a lot of money , which could roughly give Adam 's father about 25 cows , but the blood of this poor child will always haunt the family forever . <p> His barn would be full of cows but obtained through blood money , resulting from his evil mission to sell his own son to the albino 's body parts merchants . As the darkness grows , so does the plan to attack this poor albino boy . In a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ below the poverty line , the amount can make someone the king of the entire village . This poor albino boy unaware about his father 's betrayal sits closely to his dad , knowing that he was his shield against any evils . <p> He never imagined that time would come when his father could conspire with an outsider to slaughter him like a goat . Suddenly the poor albino boy is grabbed by two men and thrown down like a sacrificial lamb ready to be slaughtered to please the Gods of ancestors , before the sharp bush-knife patrolled his body . <p> He feels terrible pain as his fingers are chopped off , and calls for his father 's help , but , his cry for help melts like an ice placed on the frying-pan , when he realised that his father was part of the two men holding him down .

The father then angrily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help . Adam moves slowly as he nurses terrible pains as well as feeling the pinch of his father 's betrayal , as his attacker disappears with three fingers . <p> How it all started <p> It was another evening like any others , when the young Adam Robert a 14-year-old albino took his cattle to the grazing area , just a few kilometres from his home located at the village of Nyaluguguna , Nyijundu ward in Nyang'wale constituency in Geita district . Like many African children especially those from nomadic societies , looking after cattle is part of the daily routine for boys and in some rare cases , girls too are involved in this task . <p> Unaware of the secret mission to kill him , initiated and carefully planned by members of his family , including his father , Robert Tangawizi , Adam was just happy to help his parents in various domestic activities . <p> According to Adam his attacker followed him at the grazing area on one evening and offered him a hat to protect him against sunrays . But , surprisingly , the attacker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his right hand he had a brand new brown hat , which he wanted to use as a hook against Adam on that evening . But , Adam strongly rejected the free offer , and opted to concentrate on looking after his father 's cattle . <p> The attacker then told Adam to take the cattle to a far thick bush where there were green pastures for the cattle , but Adam 's instincts told him to strongly reject the advice . Having sensed the fishy motive , Adam decided to return the cattle home quickly as his attacker disappeared . However to his surprise and disbelief , upon his arrival at home , Adam found the very same stranger chatting with his stepmother . <p> He tried to raise an alarm to both his stepmother and father about the attacker , but was totally ignored . Finally , Adam Robert , a 14-year-old albino child is forced to dine with the stranger he has just accused of trying to attack him , but , he rejects dinning with his attacker , choosing to stay closely to his father hoping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own father was a monster , who has also partnered with his attackers to attack him , perhaps he would have escaped smoothly and vanished somewhere else . <p> The past nine months have been calm sending signals that the killings have finally stopped , but the recent fresh events in Geita , Kahama and Bunda towns , reminds the albinos that they were still-hunted . Adam 's ordeal reveals the daunting task facing albinos in Tanzania a country that has been battling against the killings for the past four years . <p> The story of Adam Robert , a 14-year-old albino child , who narrowly escaped death in the evening of October 14 , 2011 shocked me terribly , and made me ask myself a lot of questions ; is it poverty , ignorance , lust , curse or what can really push a father to auction and butcher his son like a goat ? When I first heard about Adam 's tragedy , the first information that came out mainly from his father left many questions unanswered . <p> First , the father claimed that he , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when suddenly it started raining . The father then took ugali ( East Africa 's staple food ) and entered inside , instructing Adam to carry the rest of the food . <p> According to Adam 's father , when he left Adam outside with the attacker , he hoped that they would join him inside to continue with their dinner , after they were ' chased ' by the sudden rain . Lying is not a big deal , but remembering and defending the lies , is the most difficult part for all liars . <p> How do you leave your beloved albino son with the stranger outside during the night , while the very same guest of yours has been suspected by your son of attempting to attack him just a few hours ago when he was looking after the cattle ? Reading from what was reported by the local press the next day quoting Adam 's father , I was convinced that something was n't adding up somewhere . <p> Here is a father who was informed some few hours ago about an attempt to attack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after he was told that the attacker was just sitting there chatting with his wife . In a country where albinos are hunted day and night , you could n't expect the father to leave his child behind with a stranger and suspected attacker , but in Adam 's case , his father Robert left him with the devil according to the early version of the story . <p> That 's why I decided among other things to visit Adam 's home , where the attacks took place , as part of my investigations . When I boarded a plane from Dar es Salaam to Mwanza city , before driving to Geita town , I had made up my mind to follow Adam 's story by starting with where the attacks took place ( crime scene ) , before following other leads . <p> My hypothesis after reading media reports quoting Adam 's father as well as police was that there was a conspiracy involving some family members in this saga , and therefore I was in a mission to establish who did it , how and why it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took just one hour and fifteen minutes . I landed in Mwanza city at 8:15am , and quickly planned my trip to Geita , to investigate Adam 's story . <p> Established by the German Colonial agent , Emin Pasha in 1892 , as a cotton trading centre , Mwanza city is the second biggest city in Tanzania . Located on the southern shores of Lake Victoria Mwanza 's economy mainly depends on fish , cotton , mining and partly tourism . <p> From Mwanza , I drove to Geita town via Kigongo ferry , and it took me just two hours to arrive in Geita , thanks to the modern tarmac road built by the Chinese contractors . <p> A decade ago , driving from Mwanza to Geita town was a matter of five to eight hours , and during the rainy season , the roads were not passable . One of the legacies of President Benjamin Mkapa , the third President of United Republic of Tanzania is that he managed to build more tarmac roads during his ten-year period . <p> Though to some , he is seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the plunder of the country 's resources through Foreign Direct Investments , to majority , President Mkapa did the best job in building modern tarmac roads as well as creating capacity for domestic revenues collections from $20million in 1995 to $200million per month by the end of 2005 . Gone are the days when Tanzanians travelling from Dar es Salaam to Lake Victoria regions have to go through Kenya . Today , you do n't have to go through Kenya or Uganda to reach the Lake Victoria regions . <p> After arriving in Geita , I organised the logistic means to Nyaluguguna village , the home of Adam , which is located about 50km from the mining town of Geita . <p> Geita town is located 110 kilometres west of Mwanza and it first came into prominence as the site of a German colonial gold mine . A German gold prospector discovered the mineral in the early 1900s in the hills surrounding modern-day Geita town . <p> This and other discoveries triggered a gold rush in the surrounding area , attracting German and native prospectors alike . The colonial government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mining activities significantly declined , however , when Germany ceded control of its colonies to the British after their defeat in World War I. Geita regained prominence in the mid to late 1990s when the Tanzanian government opened the mineral sector to foreign investment . <p> A number of medium to large-scale mining houses , including Ashanti and Anglo-Americans , conducted extensive exploration activities in the surrounding areas . The most significant outcome of those activities was the construction of the Geita Gold Mine at the cost of $165 million in 1999/2000 , now owned by AngloGold Ashanti . The Geita Gold Mine is Tanzania 's largest open pit gold producer . <p> Gold rushes continue to occur in areas surrounding Geita , mainly in and around Rwamugasa and Matabe . These gold rushes have attracted tens of thousands of prospectors from all around the country . Being subsistence miners , their activities are highly unregulated , resulting in dangerous mining practices and considerable environmental destruction , not the least of which is increased mercury pollution and extensive deforestation . <p> But , the rush for gold has also created @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to bring luck for some fortune seekers in the mining sector . <p> Local buyers mainly miners and fishermen as well as their counterparts from the Democratic Republic of Congo , Burundi , Kenya and Uganda believe the legs , genitals , eyes and hair of people with albinism can help them achieve instant wealth . <p> Tanzania albinos have always faced discrimination in schools , or in the workplaces , but , in recent years their population has been decimated thanks to the growing demand of their body parts caused by the lust for wealth , power , magical power and luck . <p> The rough road to Adam 's village was somehow passable compared to other dilapidated roads in most parts of the rural Tanzania . But , my driver Evans , a Rwandese born in Tanzania about forty years ago was still not convinced by the condition of roads in this golden town of Geita . <p> " This land ( Geita ) is surrounded by million ounces of gold reserves ... We host Africa 's biggest open pit gold mine , but look at our roads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ potholes on our way to Adam 's village . Evans a tax driver in Geita for many years was born and raised in this gold town , before , he went to study in Burundi in early 1980s , but after the end of the tribal war that erupted in Rwanda in 1994 , he decided to go there and participate in the reconstruction of his native country . After spending a decade in Rwanda , he returned home in Geita , where he is settled now , doing a taxi business . <p> " God gave us gold so that we should use it to improve people 's livelihood , but in Tanzania , it 's the opposite ... look at the hospital , schools or roads here , the conditions are terrible . " Evans tells me . It 's the same cry from many Tanzanians as well as Africans whose land has huge natural resources , but their livelihood remains miserable as poverty continue to ravage their homes . <p> Today , Geita is the richest region in terms of natural resources and minerals , but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a company that owns Geita Gold Mine , produces about 600,000 ounces of gold annually valued at $900 million , but the people whose land produces this huge wealth ca n't access water , better health care and modern roads . Some call it globalisation under the new world 's order , but many here see it as a plunder of natural resources , done by foreign companies under the supervision of bad laws instituted by our institutions . <p> The Democratic Republic of Congo 's total natural resources is equal to a combined one year Gross Domestic Product for Europe and the United States of America , but , the country remains the poorest in the world . <p> Nigeria is Africa 's leading oil producer but more than half of its people live in poverty and oil prices in the West African nation are out of reach for many . In 2004 , Niger Delta activists demanding a greater share of oil income for locals began a campaign of violence against the oil infrastructure , threatening Nigeria 's most important economic lifeline . <p> This is why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the grounds , but as long as they do n't own the policy , their disappointments means nothing to the rulers . It 's just the usual crocodile tears , which vanish in the deep waters . <p> Our Journey to Nyaluguguna takes about one hour . From hundreds metres away we are welcomed by scattered houses , both of iron-sheets and grass roofed . The village is typical African rural village with no running water , electricity , modern roads and health centre . Ironically , fifty years after independence , villagers in this village still walk about 50km to a health centre in Geita town , and when Adam was attacked , it took his family about five hours to rush him to the hospital due to logistical problems . <p> Like many African villages , while poverty is one of the biggest problems , however to many people in Nyaluguguna village , their main worry is the witchcraft . Ironically , there are more witchdoctors than medical doctors . For just a quick survey , we are told that there are dozens of witchdoctors in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone a qualified medical officer . <p> " When people get sick here , they often visit the witchdoctors because they are the ones available ... but also witchcraft beliefs are very common among villagers here and sometimes even when a child suffers from Malaria , he or she will be taken to witchdoctor . " Isaac , a 42-year-old albino and a father of three children says . <p> " People in this village and the nighbouring communities fear witches and witchdoctors more than God ... witches and witchdoctors are the secret rulers of this village . " Isaac who is also the Chairperson of Albinos communities in Geita tells me as we drive through this village in search for Adam 's home . <p> In his research conducted in 2010 , titled Ideology and the Killing of Albinos in Tanzania : A Study in Cultural Relativities The Netherlands based researcher , Ralph Turner , writes , " The use of body parts in the preparation of magic medicines has long been reported in Usukuma land and its prevention has been given as a reason for burial in Christian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Sukuma land , in north-west Tanzania because of the belief that parts of their bodies could be used in the preparation of supposedly protective ' magic ' medicines which could be used to relieve a range of suspected and real misfortunes , ranging from witchcraft to the prevention of rain and the spread of AIDS as well as increasing the possibilities of success . <p> In their research titled , " In witchcraft , and murder : The plight of Tanzanian albinos , Alexander Alum Michael Gomez and Edilsa Ruiz , say , " To better understand the current situation in Tanzania , it is necessary to have a cursory understanding of witchcraft itself . <p> In Africa , witchcraft provides answers to many of nature 's mysteries , such as lightning bolts and illnesses . " " It often times explains social , and political misfortunes , such as losing a job or an election . Even if there is a plausible explanation for a particular misfortune , those who believe in witchcraft constantly seek physical and supernatural answers . " <p> Witchcraft is a wide range of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place , even within a single community , which is a controversial and ambiguous practice shrouded in secrecy leading people to do things they do not understand . In most African societies , witchcraft is the practice of using evil or dark forces from the Gods or spirits of the ancestors to achieve a personal goal . <p> Their practice relies on the alleged communication with spirits , the worshipping of shrines and rare objects , and ritualistic sacrifice , including that of humans . Traditional healers , on the other hand , combine their alleged supernatural powers with herbal remedies to treat illnesses and perform other good deeds , such as casting away evil hexes and identifying witches . <p> It 's therefore no doubt why in Adam 's village people here fear witches and witchdoctors more than even God or the government . In society where even ministers and prominent people flock to a miracle healer who attracted millions of people in the northern part of the country , at a place called Loliondo , early in 2011 , the villagers here have every right to fear witches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we finally reach at the Adam 's home . Adam 's home is surrounded by scattered bushes . One iron sheet-roofed house plus two tiny mud-houses that makes the empire of Robert Tangawizi , Adam 's father . <p> The place looks like it has never been occupied by human beings for years . When we arrived here , Adam 's father and his stepmother were in custody in Geita town after they were arrested about a few days ago . My first move is to establish whether on the day Adam was attacked it really rained as claims Robert Tangawizi in his story to a local press as well as the Police . <p> In a quick inquiry to neighbours as well as Adam 's Grandmother , I established that there were no rains on the day he was attacked as claimed by his father Robert , something that puzzles me . Why did Robert lie about the rain ? What was he hiding ? What was the motive ? My mind ponders these questions before being interrupted by my host , Salim , who tells me that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we are confronted by the shocking reality . First , we are welcomed by stains of blood on the wood that was used to aid Adam 's ' butchering ' , before seeing the place where Adam and his brother used to sleep . We first traced Adam 's elder brother Salim , who took us to his home a place where the attack took place a few days ago . <p> There are three houses here ; two tiny mud-houses including the one used by Adam and his brother Salim and the main house roofed by iron sheets . Just a few steps from the main house , there 's a barn , which is used for sheltering young cows . On entering the Adam 's ghetto , I found no bed let alone a door , a situation that shocked me especially after hearing that this is where the two albino brothers were spending their nights amid the growing attacks against them . <p> This tiny room can only fit for chickens but not human beings . However as the two albino brothers spent their nights in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was sleeping in a comfortable and secured house . Adam 's ghetto tells it all ; It shows that Adam and his brother were condemned from the very first day they were born , rejected by their father because of albinism , but even when they grew up by the grace of God , their treatment at this family remained miserable . <p> Here is a father who put his children to sleep on the floor , covering their bodies at night , using a torn bed-sheet that seized to see water many years ago . Worse still the small house , which deserve to be animals ' barn has no any strong door to protect Adam and his brother . <p> Their only guardian was a dog , which used to sleep at the door every night , trying to protect these poor kids , according to Salim . " This is not a calves ' barn but our place where we sleep ... as you can see there 's no stable door , there 's no bed , and our bed-sheet is the shirts that we wear . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Sometimes I do n't even now how we survived for so long without being killed ... we feared to sleep here but since we have no any other place to call a home , we accepted the reality . " Salim , a sixteen-year-old albino boy tells me as we sit down for an interview . <p> According to Salim , since their mother brought them to their father some years ago their step mother acted strangely and cruelty . " I was n't surprised at all to hear that she ( stepmother ) was part of those who attacked my younger brother ... She has always threatened to kill us . " Salim says <p> " The only thing that has saddened me is my father ... I never thought that he could sell my younger brother , and I think she might have been influenced by my stepmother . " Salim adds . <p> The day Adam was attacked , Salim was n't around . He went to his stepfather 's house to greet his grandmother about 1km from his home.Since Adam was attacked , Salim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stepfather 's home , which is just four hundred metres from his home , where at least he feels secured . But , one thing Salim was n't aware of was that even , his stepfather , Andrea Tangawizi , was also one of Adam 's attackers . <p> According to my investigation , Adam 's father and his brother , Andrea , are both witchdoctors who have inherited the practice from their ancestors . Andrea is a rich man as per the village standards , because he has dozens of cattle , two iron sheet-roofed houses , a milling machine that serves the entire village plus dozens of patients who flock to his home for remedy and fortune seekers . <p> In comparison , Adam 's father does n't match with his brother Andrea in wealth and traditional healing business . Andrea is one of the most prominent witchdoctors in this village , though his biggest rival and ally is called ' Ng'wana Yesu ' , a Sukuma word for ' Son of Jesus ' . <p> I am told Ng'wana Yesu was given this name due to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ witchdoctors in this village with over hundred cattle , lots of cash and many farms , thanks to his ancestors who gave him the power . During the secret ballot organised by the government to nab those behind the deadly albino 's body parts business in 2009 , his name was also on top , but surprisingly no any actions was taken against him by the security organs . <p> In this village , I learn that Ng'wana Yesu is the most feared person here , with no one willing to talk about him publicly , fearing that though he was still in custody in Geita town , he may through his dark forces get to know who said anything wrong in his absence . However after Adam was attacked , he was also arrested together with Robert , Andrea and other two suspects . But , in court , his charges sheet reads , " You are accused of threatening to bewitch your fellow villagers , hence denying them peace and security . " <p> Ng'wana Yesu strongly denies the charges and is bailed out because his charges are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Robert Tangawizi , his stepmother , Agnes Robert and stepfather Andrea were arrested by the police just three days ago , being accused of murder attempt against Adam . <p> They were later on then arraigned in court in October this year and denied bail , because under the Tanzanian law , murder charges are not bail-able offence . After returning from Adam 's village , I decided to meet him and listen to his story for the second time . <p> I had earlier managed to listen to his story by listening to the recorded interview that was done by ITV Correspondent , Cosmas Makongo , nearly ten hours after he was attacked . The next morning , I decided to visit Adam at the hospital , hoping that after he has recovered very well , he could now tell me how he was attacked . <p> When I arrived at Geita hospital for the second time during my investigation , just two weeks after he was attacked , I found him sitting outside his hospital room with his mother , trying to figure out where to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agreed to have another interview in Adam 's hospital room . <p> Adam does n't trust anybody since he was attacked , but , after seeing me with the District Chairperson for Albinos ' communities , he agrees to be interviewed . I wanted to get the real story of what transpired , especially after he has recorded strong recovery in two weeks . Before meeting Adam here at the hospital for an interview , I had a chance to visit his village as well as home , where the attack took place . After gathering more details from relatives and neighbours , I decided that it was time to get the real story from Adam . <p> My first question to Adam is how did the attack happen ? Though I have read various versions of his ordeal , I still want to get it from the horse 's mouth . He raises his eyes on the roof as a Priest who prepares to lead the morning mass , and scan the room , before eyeing his left shoulder that was cut by his attackers , without uttering a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a typical rural African health centre environment clouded with dilapidated infrastructure Adam finally utters a few words as he adjusts in his hospital bed . <p> " The truth is that during the attack my father was n't inside as he claimed ... he was with the attackers and helped him to hold me tightly as the sharp bush-knife painfully penetrated my body . " " After the attack , my father ordered me to go inside ... my sister alarmed by what has just happened in the dark rushed to bring a torch , which she used to light our tiny room . " <p> " She was shocked to see me bleeding ... I could n't explain what really transpired because I was feeling severe pains . " This is how Adam starts narrating his ordeal . He then pauses , scans the room again , before he answers my question by saying I never imagined my father could betray or sell me . <p> As Adam reveals this shocking truth ; I feel pain in my heart and suddenly I remember my children , Kelly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ temporarily to be an investigative journalist and become a father , asking myself whether it was the lust for money that pushed Robert to sell his child or something else . <p> As a parent , is there anything that can really make me sell my child ? The answer was very simple ; I would rather die in the shackles of poverty than doing such inhuman and brutal act not only to my children , but to any other children . <p> It takes me about five minutes to adjust myself into my normal situation to continue with my interview with Adam , but still , my heart was so broken . <p> Looking at the horrible image of a young albino boy sitting on his hospital bed , nursing the wounds , which are not resulting from any accident , but just the results of a wicked human being driven by ignorance , outdated beliefs , superstitious and lust for quick fortunes . <p> When I drove to Kahama town a few days after Adam was attacked to follow up on another fresh attack in which a young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with her right arm , it was another nightmare and striking image . A young albino girl called Kulwa has just lost her right arm to the attackers who came to her house fully armed in the midnight of October 26 , this year . <p> I tried to interview her , but nursing her wounds in pain and shock , she barely utters a word . But after waiting for one more day , finally , she had an opportunity to talk to me from her hospital room , where she has also become a crowd puller as hundreds flocked there to witness what happen to her . <p> All these events made me sick and reminded us the tough task ahead , hunting and exposing of all those involved especially the biggest players who are willing to pay up to $100,000 just for an albino arm . <p> Coincidently , Salum Khalfani Bar'wani , the first albino to be elected Member of the Parliament through the opposition party , Civic United Front , in the history of Tanzania was also in Geita and Kahama to witness what has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about what are his feelings after witnessing what happened to Adam and Kulwa . <p> " I never expected in my life to hear that a father can sell his child to make money ... Adam 's story is a proof that the battle for saving the souls of albinos is far from over and it 's getting complicated everyday . Bar'wani tells me adding that how do you win the battle in a situation where family members are part of the merchants of death . <p> Shocked by what he has just witnessed , Bar'wani says , " I think it was high time we involved the Interpol because it seemed that our police have failed to nail the real culprits behind this business ... those we see in custody are just middlemen who do n't know the syndicate behind this business . " <p> " At my level as an MP , I have been threatened so many times , but even after reporting the incidences , nothing happens ... If they(police) can ignore serious threats against the MP , what about the ordinary albinos who live in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have never stopped as the government wanted the people to believe . Though key suspects behind Adam 's attacks were arrested , those who chopped off Kulwa 's arm were not arrested and the Police have no clue . <p> However , till today , the real attacker who escaped with Adam 's fingers is yet to be arrested . Adam 's stepmother confessed to the Police , saying she has known the attacker for sometime , adding that her husband also knew the plan . She told the Police during interrogation that ' the original deal was attack without killing ' , but , declined to disclose further details . <p> While the parents are supposed to be the guardians of their children , in Adam 's case , they have become the merchants of death , selling their own child . Police says the parents might have been promised huge amounts of money by the buyers mainly fortune seekers as well as those who seek magical powers in politics and society . <p> This is a sad tale behind the albinos ' killings , and for years some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ members of the family were highly involved . Adam 's father sold his son in collaboration with his second wife and some scrupulous fortune seekers , a situation that indicates that the battle against the killing of albinos is far from over . <p> This is Adam 's ordeal . It 's his cross the cross he has been forced to carry without his choice . It 's the cross of persecutions , humiliation , rejection and betrayal . How do you win a battle , which the key culprits are some family members ? How do you tackle Adam 's situation when a father decided purposely to sell his son to get rich . Though he survived , Adam still has another storm to weather because since he is the only eye witness he is the potential witness in the murder attempt case against his father , stepfather , stepmother and other accused , and therefore he needs protection . <p> " I know the truth but my fear is that they may come after me again to silence me forever . " Adams tells me as we say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's fear is caused among other things by the fact that the man who attacked him managed to escape and is still on the run . Adam is at the crossroads on where to go after being discharged because he ca n't return home to place where he was almost murdered by his attackers , among them his father . <p> Rejected at birth , condemned in life <p> In their research Alexander Alum Michael Gomez and Edilsa Ruiz says , " In Africa , it used to be that a child who was born with albinism was killed at birth . Although this is no longer common among the general population , it still occurs in some African tribes , such as the Maasai . Some believe that a child 's albinism is brought about by a curse or a mother 's infidelity with a Caucasian man . " <p> " Others believe that albinos are ghosts from Europe who carry bad omens . Lastly , many mistakenly believe that albinism is contagious . As a result , albinos are often ostracised , making it difficult for them to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ researchers further writes . <p> Adam 's ordeal dates back to the day he came out of his mother 's womb . It 's not a tribulation that just erupted on October 14 , 2011 . It 's the climax of the sin that has been committed against albinos in many African societies . During my investigation , I established that when Adam 's brother was born , the entire family was shocked to see an albino baby and quickly concluded that ' the woman , Sabina Kuzenza , had committed adultery with the devil . <p> In some Sukuma tribe families , when a woman gives birth to an albino baby , she is seen as an adulterer who slept with the devil . Not only that but also she is seen as an outcast . That 's why when Salim , Adam 's elder brother was born in 1995 , his father and the entire family were angered by the move . Suddenly , the woman was condemned , abused and rejected by the entire family except , her father-in-law who requested that she should be given another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ albino baby , but when the grandfather , discovered , he strongly condemned the move asking his son , Robert Tangawizi to give his wife a second chance and also allow the baby to live . Finally , Robert agreed with his father and gave a second chance to his beautiful wife , Sabina , hoping to have a normal black child . After one year , Sabina became pregnant and delivered nine months later . <p> Contrary to her husband 's expectations , it was another albino child . The child was none but Adam , the young humbled albino boy who was to be sold fourteen years later by his father who rejected him on the very same day he was born in 1997 . Tanzania has an estimated 17,000 albinos by the end of 2008 . Albinism is common among East Africans ; 1 birth in 3,000 is albino , versus 1 in 20,000 in the United States . <p> Albinism is a debilitating condition that causes vision loss , extreme sun-sensitivity , and sometimes embarrassment and stigma . Albinos have long been villainized in literature and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Da Vinci Code , or the nefarious blond twins in The Matrix Reloaded . The word " albinism " refers to a group of inherited conditions . People with albinism have little or no pigment in their eyes , skin , or hair . They have inherited altered genes that do not make the usual amounts of a pigment called melanin . <p> But , in most African families especially in Tanzania 's Lake Victoria region , giving birth to an albino baby signals a curse to the concerned family . Therefore when Sabina gave birth to a second albino baby , she was rejected by her husband and family members by simply saying she has brought abomination to the clan . <p> " I was rejected , called all sorts of names ... adulterer , outcast , cursed mother and a witch . " Adam 's mother tells me when I ask her to disclose why she divorced her husband , Robert . " The entire family rejected me except my father-in-law ... I was thrown out of my husband 's house . My father-in-law accommodated me for about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I returned back to my parents with my two albino children ... My father received me with joys and promised to take care of me at any cost . " " Suddenly my dreams were shuttered when my father died and I was left alone with no help ... life was very difficult for me as I struggled to raise my two albino children . " <p> This is how Sabina , a 34-year- old , starts narrating her story : <p> Finally , Sabina decided to go to the mining town of Kakola , located just about a few kilometres from Kahama town , a home to some of Africa 's biggest gold mines owned by African Barrick Gold Company . With no education or enough capital , she fell into the trap of selling her bodies to small scale miners . Finally , she got the capital enough to start a food vending business , and stopped the prostitution . <p> However , it was n't easy to raise two children being a single parent without a strong job to support her , but by the grace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I had a sister who also supported me so much ... finally she asked me to take these children to their father because raising them in a mining town where miners believe in witchcraft was a very dangerous situation . " She says <p> Finally , she decided to take the two children to their father , Robert , and dumped them there in 2008 . " I have no option considering the growing threat about albinos ... but I also fell in love with a man who agreed to marry me with conditions that I should return these children to their father . " Sabina adds . <p> However , though Robert accepted the two children , he was also in love with another woman he married soon after divorcing Sabina , his first wife . Adam and his brother Salim are now forced to live in a new world confronted with harsh reality . At home their stepmother , Sabina , denies them food , and sometimes threatens to kill them . <p> In school , they ca n't study because of the growing threat caused by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parts . In the village they became the target by the fortune hunters . At school they faced stigmatisation or discrimination . At home they faced a danger of being killed anytime by the merchants of death , and at the same time , they have to confront the danger poised by sunrays as they look after the cattle or do the farming . <p> Confronted with such dangerous situation , their father is told to take them to Mwanza city , at a place called Mitindo , a school for albino children located about 40km outside the lakeside city . Mitindo is the school , which serves as a refuge from albinos who have fled their homes because of fear caused by the growing attacks , is a rare ray of hope in this region , but without enough learning materials . <p> But , after a few months , Robert 's second wife , Agnes , orders him to bring them back so that they can help in household chores including looking after cattle and farming . <p> The two brothers were finally returned home despite the facts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become the houseboys , working very hard under the orders of their stepmother , who in most cases persecuted them for no reason . <p> Though Ghanaian proverb declares that a woman is a flower in a garden ; her husband is the fence around it , in Adam 's case , the woman was the beast in the garden , and her husband was the devil in love with the beast . This is how Adam was rejected from the first day he came out of his mother 's womb , and that rejection has culminated to its pinnacle when his father , stepmother and strangers conspired to attack in October , 14 , 2011 . <p> " I am a rejected person ; a condemned child ... may be that 's why my father sold me . " Adams says as he closely looks at his injured shoulder , which was gravely wounded during the attack . <p> Editor 's note : Part of this Special report will be broadcast by Aljazeera English network in December , this year , as part of the new initiatives called ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that exposes corruption , violation of human rights and abuse across the continent .
