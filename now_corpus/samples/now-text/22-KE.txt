Every year since then , Africa has been the first overseas destination of a Chinese foreign minister in a new year . Upholding that tradition , Wang Yi , state councilor and current foreign minister of China , is presently on a three-nation trip to East Africa . His January 4-7 trip to Eritrea , Kenya , and the Comoros comes just over a month after the conclusion of the Eighth Ministerial Conference of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation ( FOCAC ) in Dakar , Senegal . <p> Zhao Lijian , a spokesperson for China 's foreign ministry , announced that the foreign minister aims to promote the implementation of the outcomes of the FOCAC Ministerial Conference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Africa , and support African countries in defeating COVID-19 and promoting economic recovery . <p> Wang 's first overseas visit of the year -- coming so soon after the FOCAC summit last November -- underscores the great importance that China attaches to its partnerships with African countries and also helps to highlight the strong ties that have developed between Beijing and the continent over the years . Although Sino-Africa relations have a long history that can be traced back centuries , in recent decades China and many African countries have noticeably grown much closer . Sino-African cooperation extends to a variety of issues and a wide range of fields , while economically , China has emerged as Africa 's most important partner . It is the continent 's largest bilateral trading partner , the biggest bilateral lender , and among the leading sources of assistance and foreign direct investment . <p> On the first leg of his trip , Wang arrived in Asmara , the Eritrean capital on the evening of January 4 , where he was warmly received at the airport by Osman Saleh , Eritrea 's foreign minister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two-day visit , Wang met his counterpart and President Isaias Afwerki . <p> In talks covering a range of domestic , regional , and global issues of mutual concern , Afwerki applauded China 's progress and contributions to a global order based on respect for international law , while the Chinese foreign minister expressed gratitude for Eritrea 's adherence to the one-China principle and China 's rejection of unilateral sanctions . Notably , it was announced that China would extend 100 million yuan ( $15.7 million ) in support of Eritrea and that there would be more cooperation on human capacity building , infrastructure , mining , and developments at the ports in Assab and Massawa on the Red Sea . Prior to Wang 's departure from Eritrea , he also signed a joint statement alongside the Eritrean foreign minister . <p> Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi is received at Moi International Airport in Mombasa , Kenya , by Kenya 's cabinet secretary for foreign affairs , Raychelle Omamo , January 5 , 2022. /CGTN <p> These developments reflect the strengthening of the China-Eritrea bilateral relationship . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country to ink a memorandum of understanding to join the Belt and Road Initiative ( BRI ) , a transcontinental infrastructure and development project announced by Chinese President Xi Jinping in 2013 . <p> For China , Eritrea represents a reliable partner , boasts tremendous untapped potential and important ports , and offers excellent positioning near critical transit routes for global trade . The Bab el-Mandeb Strait forms a vital link in the maritime route between the Mediterranean Sea and the Indian Ocean via the Red Sea and the Suez Canal . Due to its strategic location , Eritrea also offers considerable potential as a regional hub for markets in neighboring Ethiopia , South Sudan and Sudan -- countries where China has invested heavily and maintains significant economic interests .

Notably , during a recent inspection tour of the Nairobi Expressway , President Kenyatta expressed his appreciation toward China , explaining , " Our partnership with China is one that is mutually beneficial , that is based on win-win and we are very grateful to the Chinese government and the Chinese people for the support they continue to render not only to our country but to the rest of Africa .

@@63934236 <h> Why we should retool workforce to meet needs of the 21st century <p> Contractors refill part of a road in Kitale town . Collins Kweyu , Standard <p> In December 2018 , a senior government official from the Ministry of Transport visited Lamu Port and revealed some disturbing information . He said that out of the 1,200 youth who had already been employed as casual laborers at the Port , only 50 were from Lamu . Many Lamu youth were unwilling to work as casual laborers , citing low pay and long working hours . The Government Official proceeded to challenge parents to ensure that their children attained skills that would make them employable once the port became fully operational . <p> The industrialisation that we seek to achieve coupled with the ongoing green revolution will create new jobs that require new skills . That 's why our curriculum , all the way from primary to university must be responsive to emerging opportunities in the marketplace . Regardless of the dissenting voices and teething challenges , we must laud the Kenya Institute of Curriculum Development ( KICD ) for designing the Competency Based Curriculum ( CBC ) that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and application of these skills to real life situations . In line with this , colleges and universities need to revamp their courses and make them relevant to today 's marketplace . According to a 2018 employer survey , 30 per cent of employers blamed a poorly skilled workforce for their growth struggles . <p> In 2021 , the Kenya Youth Policy Development Report vindicated the 2018 survey findings . The report revealed that a glaring skills mismatch was keeping youth out of jobs . This mismatch stems from a weak link between education and industry . To address this , I suggest that we build strong bridges between education and industry . Our young people can not walk out of high school into university courses that may not secure for them jobs . The Kenya Universities and Colleges Central Placement Service is a State organ that is charged with the responsibility of providing career guidance and selecting students for admission into institutions of higher learning . I suggest that they enhance their ability to gather intelligence about marketable skills in today 's economy . For instance , what skills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are particularly relevant for the digital age that we are living ? With all the talk of Web 3.0 , should blockchain technology become a central part of our ICT courses ? <p> The answers to such questions must be unearthed from an elaborate multi-stakeholder process . Additionally , we must also retool the skills of those who are already working . This is what upskilling entails . In a jobs marketplace whose needs and opportunities are changing at breakneck speed , it is important to upskill our workforce so that they can work optimally for maximum benefits . <p> The Economic Survey 2021 revealed that eight out of ten teachers did n't have necessary skills for teaching CBC . This deficiency can be fixed through upskilling . Similarly , we need to conduct a skills audit in other sectors of our economy so that we can suitably realise upskilling .

After all , they are highly experienced in dealing with people . In order to make the most of the skills in our country , human resource departments should analyse skill sets , not just experience and academic papers .

It goes next after Facebook , Instagram and several huge chinese nets . <p> It says a lot -- people all around the world are choosing it as the social media platform of their choice and find time to spend here .

Yes , it grows as we speak -- and all of those people can potentially become your viewers . <p> Moreover , there are no stats that say that TikTok is being primarily chosen by men or women , it is equally interesting for both sexes and this is also a very important thing to keep in mind . <p> Also it is not that important what age your audience is , as there are people from the age 12 to the age 60 and older . <p> Everybody can find something appealing and interesting to them , and in addition to all of that , people who use TikTok are usually quite active on other social media platforms and are cross posting stuff almost daily . <p> This is also great news : these people can potentially become your viewers and can spread your content beyond the platform . <p> Are you interested in promoting your page now ?

@@94701232 <h> Strengthening health systems to improve access to health <p> The essence is uniting the competencies of government , universities , the private sector , NGOs , and financial institutes as well as the pooling together of various goals , funds , risks , and responsibilities . This way , innovations are more likely to come about and bring Universal Health Coverage ( UHC ) closer to realization . <p> As these factors play out in sometimes different and sometimes comparable impacts in all countries , international collaboration is called for . It was the trigger for the Netherlands to recently publish its first Global Health Strategy , in which it recognizes the importance of strengthening health systems to improve access to primary healthcare . Efforts to strengthen primary healthcare are an efficient and effective strategy for a more equal society and a healthier population . <p> The essence is uniting the competencies of government , universities , the private sector , NGOs , and financial institutes as well as the pooling together of various goals , funds , risks , and responsibilities . This way , innovations are more likely to come about and bring Universal Health Coverage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pandemic revealed how partnerships can lead to innovative solutions . Some examples from the Netherlands are : artificial intelligence experts supported governments in developing Covid-dashboards that helped predict and prevent outbreaks ; at the Delft University of Technology a team of students developed a safe , low-cost and easy-to-manufacture mechanical ventilator ; and at the Brainport Eindhoven , SARA Robotics developed a robot that provides companionship in elderly homes in lockdown . <p> So why do I raise this issue ? Globally , about one-third of the population does not have access to essential health services . In Kenya , this percentage is close to 50 per cent . UHC , a stated goal by the Kenyan government , means that all people have access to the health services they need , when and where they need them , and without financial hardship . Very often I hear Kenyans talking about the need for more and better access to health services , a formidable challenge . <p> This week a health sector trade mission from the Netherlands will visit Kenya to seek collaboration for tackling this challenge : between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in both countries . There are three central elements to this : access to high-quality health services , skilled health workers , and policy-makers that commit to invest in UHC . This mission aims to strengthen public and private sector alliances to achieve the SDG goals on health . <p> The upcoming mission can build on the longstanding support of the Netherlands to Kenya 's health ambitions . For instance , private collaboration with PharmAccess produced the SafeCare program which makes it possible to measure healthcare services against a set of internationally recognized standards . SafeCare benchmarking enables investors , insurers , patients , and donors to make informed , data-driven decisions . <p> Also , the PharmAccess ' Medical Credit Fund provides loans to SMEs in the health sector in Sub-Sahara Africa that previously had limited access to capital to improve or expand their services . Already , USD 100 million in loans has been committed to more than 1,800 companies . Lastly , Philips is widely known in Kenya to deliver highly valued equipment to many hospitals in Kenya through commercial partnerships with government and various health institutions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Brainport Eindhoven , a rich source of innovation to deliver even better equipment in the future . This exemplifies the Dutch Diamond Approach , in which science , private sector , government and civil society work closely together to bring the desired outputs about . <p> Advertisement . Scroll to continue reading . <p> The Netherlands is an important partner in multilateral forums and is among the leading supporters to the WHO , UNFPA , GAVI and GFF . It is fair to say that the Netherlands is bilaterally and multilaterally already a strong partner for Kenya in the field of healthcare . Now , we aim to strengthen and deepen this partnership further . <p> The success story of the Dutch health system is based on universal access to care , solidarity through medical insurance , and high-quality healthcare services . The Kenyan Government has laid out ambitious plans to enhance its UHC agenda . Coupled with the conducive environment for innovations , research , and digitalization , Kenya is indeed tackling its health challenges . Yet , the large array of health challenges calls for a broad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ various partners . <p> To achieve that , we believe that there is a need for a shift of mindsets to see the private sector as a co-investor and thought partner in the public health systems . To their benefit , Governments should relate to the private sector as to share knowledge and co-create as a means to unlocking innovation , building stronger African health systems and that deliver health for all . <p> Strengthening health systems to improve access to health is a shared goal of Kenya and the Netherlands .

@@95767235 <p> At a breakfast meeting at Strathmore University on November 19 , leaders drawn from public and private sectors discussed The role of public sector leadership in a nation 's competitiveness . <p> The ideas I gathered ignited my thinking in writing this article , going beyond the role of the public sector , and focusing on improving Kenya 's overall competitiveness . <p> When we talk of competitiveness , the idea of competition comes to mind . In Kenya , it is most likely competition among her world-famous athletes . It 's all about winning by coming first in a group of competing participants . <p> Several factors interact to help an athlete be competitive- nutritious food , being in form , regular exercise , and practice at running at various altitudes , and in all weather conditions , avoiding trappings of drugs and alcohol and voila , a positive , clear mindset focused on one and only one outcome : winning . <p> Similar broad considerations may be extended to a nation when discussing its competitiveness in relation to others . Kenya scored 54.14 points out of 100 on the 2019 Global Competitiveness Report published by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ report to write home about , if you ask me . What then is international competitiveness for a nation and how can its score be improved ? <p> First , eradicate the contagion of corruption , which is defined by Transparency International as the misuse of entrusted power for private gain . Corruption thrives where oversight over institutions is weak or absent , civil society is voiceless , and transparency and accountability do not exist . <p> Corruption festers like a wound where leaders entrusted with power have lost their moral compass and sense of service to the people and end up serving and enriching themselves instead . In such a scenario , national competitiveness takes the back seat and is not an issue to even talk about . To revive international competitiveness a nation must , as a priority , fight the good fight with all its might- a hymnal refrain- and slay the dragon of corruption . <p> Secondly , to be effectively competitive , a nation must make her governance system efficient . The idea of good governance keeps on changing . It has moved from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affair where all parties involved seek consensus through dialogue , discussion , and participatory debate in shaping the formulation and implementation of public policy for the delivery of services . Modern governance works at several levels -- county , national , regional blocs , and globally . This needs a flexible , inclusive , creative , participatory , harmonious and effective network . <p> Modern democratic governance of the public sector has borrowed considerably from the corporate sector . You hear buzzwords such as management by results , performance contracting , management by objectives , management by results , total quality control and involves auditing inputs and outputs in relation to budgets and a value system based on public service ethos . <p> Other value-based ideas rotate around democratic accountability , fairness , equity , social justice , and social inclusion forming a bulwark against leaders who may abuse their positions of power and privilege in making decisions that are not consultative and does not involve citizens who now are the wielders of sovereign power , which is held only in trust by their leaders . It 's only when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changing environment will it be effectively competitive . <p> Countries must invest in and spend an agreed percentage of their GDP on research and development to be innovative , grow their economies and have a competitive edge . <p> Figures for a few countries at the top of the competition ladder in 2020 stand at 3.48 per cent for Belgium , 3.14 per cent for Germany , 2.96 per cent for Finland and less than one per cent for most of the developing countries . The African Union is committed to a minimum of one per cent but this has yet to be met . <p> A country 's strong economy turns its competitive wheel , yet the global economy has taken a beating from geopolitical conflicts . The war in Ukraine has wiped out $2.8 trillion from the global economy , the equivalent of the GDP of France in 2022 , according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development . <p> The war is pushing up food prices , oil , and gas , fuelling inflation and likely triggering recession , pushing up the cost of living . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curb inflation and contain recession , but the damage inflicted already will reduce economic growth by not less than 0.8 per cent next year . <p> Upholding competitiveness at the economic level calls for a multi-pronged strategy -- fight inflation , stimulate and sustain economic growth by export-driven manufacturing , create jobs and strengthen domestic and international trade . <p> It also involves instituting a tax policy that attracts FDIs ; keeping the stock exchange vibrant to sustain and grow wealth and returns for investors and having a robust fiscal and monetary policy to preserve and grow the value of money and arrest the rise in the cost of living and forestall an economic meltdown . <p> The countries in the forefront of competition have invested in new technologies , such as in artificial intelligence , robotics , machine learning , nano technology , 3D imaging and printing , bioengineering , the internet of things , space exploration and launching satellites into space . <p> The advancement from the Hubble to the James Webb Space Telescope has generated thousands of high-resolution images and over 54 gigabytes of raw data and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the universe . <p> In the defence and security sector , development of drones , nuclear and missile technology , elements of biological and chemical warfare are in advanced stages to act as a deterrent and for defence . Unfortunately for humanity , the arsenals of war are so advanced that their deployment may bring about a mutually assured destruction , putting the planet in peril . <p> Infrastructure is vital in a nation 's competitiveness . It includes road and rail networks , sea and airports , oil and gas pipelines , waterways such as canals , rivers , lakes , and seas . The concept includes vehicles , trains , ships . One may even add power and communications infrastructure such as data transmitting cables and telephony . Paved roads make it easy to transport goods to markets in all weather . In-country and regional and international infrastructure connectivity in road , rail , sea and air transport networks and hubs enhance a nation 's competitiveness . <p> The quality of services available in a country can place it at a higher level on the competition ladder . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ India attracts medical tourism and generates income , bolstering its foreign exchange , besides generating more jobs , and upskilling her medical staff . <p> Consider another service industry , education . The internationalization of education , especially at university level has created demand for quality education across the globe . In Australia for example , revenue from international students , who are about 27 per cent to 42 per cent of students the student population , rose from A$25 billion in 2009 , to about A$40 billion in 2019 , the third highest export and foreign exchange earner after iron ore and coal . This makes Australia quite competitive . <p> Finally , international competitiveness may be attained by a highly skilled workforce that is imbued with business dynamism , self-drive , innovative capability that embraces digital technology , and a value system that includes integrity , transparency , accountability , agility , resilience , and patriotism . <p> Amb .
