@@42624240 <h> Tax Matters -- Are you aware of the time bar ? <p> 11 Jan 2021 / 10:00 H. <p> ARE you aware that the Inland Revenue Board ( IRB ) can not raise tax assessments or tax bills beyond a five-year period ? This applies equally to Real Property Gains Tax matters . The only exception is matters relating to transfer pricing which can be extended to seven years . <p> The five-year time bar also applies equally to a taxpayer who wishes to revise his earlier tax returns if he has overpaid taxes due to error or mistakes made , or to obtain a refund for any tax overpaid to the IRB . <p> This means that once a taxpayer has filed his tax returns and if the tax authorities do not come back within five years ( excluding the year in which you filed the tax return ) and review the tax returns , under the law , the authorities will not be able to raise any additional taxes for beyond the time bar period . Reversely , the same applies to the taxpayer who seeks a refund from the IRB . <p> This provides certainty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beyond the five years . Please note that taxpayers are legally required to keep records to support the tax returns for seven years . <p> Can the time bar be set aside ? <p> Yes , it can be set aside where any form of fraud or wilful default has been committed by or on behalf of any taxpayer ; or the taxpayer has been negligent in filing his tax returns . <p> Fraud and wilful default are serious allegations where the taxpayer has knowingly and intentionally gone about to provide false representation to obtain an unjust tax advantage . This is done made knowingly , or without belief in its truth , or the taxpayer is recklessly careless whether the information provided in the tax return is true or false . <p> Negligence refers to the failure to carry out the duty imposed under the Income Tax Act 1967 . It is a less serious misconduct compared to fraud or wilful default . Negligence is where a taxpayer fails to do something an ordinary man would have done or does something an ordinary man would not have done . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IRB appears more readily to set aside the time bar on grounds of negligence . This is usually the case where the positions taken by the taxpayer and the IRB based on the interpretation of the facts and the law are not in agreement with one another . <p> In such situations , the IRB tends to raise assessments beyond the time bar despite the taxpayer having good records to support its legal stand . An example here will be property groups filing an RPGT return vs. the IRB 's position that it should be an income tax matter . Another situation where the time bar appears to be breached are requests for capital statements beyond the five-year period . <p> The way forward <p> Both the taxpayers and the IRB should respect the time bar provisions . The time limitation provisions should be respected as sacrosanct . This is a basic right of the taxpayer . Once the time limitation provisions are regularly set aside , taxpayers will never be able to determine whether their tax returns are final or not . If this happens regularly , it sends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coming into the country . <p> At the same time , taxpayers must understand that if they file their returns and there are elements of fraud , wilful default or negligence , it is the duty of the IRB to guard the national " coffers " and punish such taxpayers . <p> The dividing line here is a thin one and both parties must tread carefully .

@@42753234 <h> Struggling around rubber trees <p> The rubber industry is of much significance to our countries . For millions of our smallholders , the rubber tree is a tree of life , serving as a crucial source of income for earning a living and raising families . <p> -- Thaksin Shinawatra , Thai ex-prime minister <p> Longhouse kids nowadays spend a very much different daily life than ours in the 50s and 60s . <p> There are only a few , if any , who still tap rubber . And there may be none who can pride themselves for being participants in wet or hill paddy farming . This is due to the simple reason that their parents no longer practise both of these two activities -- as opposed to the days of our childhood and later when we were teenagers . <p> I started rubber tapping at the age of eight , usually led by both of my parents and at times , my brother Jon who was then 14 . We were then residing at our rubber plantation known as Bukit Tinggi , about two hours on foot from our Kedap longhouse in Saratok . <p> Nanga @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only about a 30-minute walk to the school . <p> Apart from the rubber trees at Bukit Tinggi , we had another one at Sungai Belung just about a 15 minute-walk from our simple residence at the former and very close to Munggu Embawang , dad 's birthplace . <p> Dad , then 52 , usually led mom and Jon to Sungai Belung leaving me and my maternal grandma , then in her 70s , at the Bukit Tinggi garden . Starting as early as 4am , he would tap the trees near our residence and then leave with the other two to Sungai Belung . <p> Grandma and I were to collect the latex around 9am . Later the rubber processing would be done at Sungai Belung because Jon would come back for our collected latex at Bukit Tinggi . <p> My most memorable albeit a hilarious moment collecting latex at Bukit Tinggi was when I rushed to collect from one big tree known for its abundant rubber sap . The rush was to ' win ' over poor grandma in terms of the volume of the rubber fluid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ' chuban ' ( collecting container ) assigned . <p> Unfortunately , as if some unseen entity intercepted , a misstep occurred during my ascent to the tree at the hilltop causing me to stumble . This led also to unintended pouring of the rubber sap to the ground -- and worse , on my hair when I tripped .

Friends and colleagues are asking me this question almost daily . <p> Chief Minister Datuk Patinggi Abang Johari Tun Openg was the first in Sarawak to receive the vaccine on Feb 26 . He had his first dose at Petra Jaya Health Clinic , spearheading the first phase of the Sarawak Covid-19 vaccination programme . <p> The National Covid-19 Immunisation Programme officially began in Kuala Lumpur on Feb 25 with Prime Minister Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin as the first person in the country to receive the jab . <p> The first phase of the programme , which lasts until April , involves the frontliners while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the high risk-groups . The third phase , from May this year until Feb next year , is for those aged 18 and above . <p> So far , only the Pfizer vaccine is being used in both the national and state immunisation programmes .

Sivapalan February 27 , 2021 <p> Slow , organic growth method not the way to approach disruption <p> Enough of think small , build organic , time to think big , go global <p> In part 1 of this article I presented five macro elements that are roadblocks towards creating unicorns in Malaysia . In part 2 I will look at the micro elements of entrepreneurs and their businesses to see if they are ready to become unicorns . <p> 1 . Vision and Ambition <p> Over the last two decades I have trained and coached hundreds of companies ( 700 at last count ) in my personal capacity and in the various programs my company Proficeo has run . I 've also invested in more than 30 companies including via my accelerator ScaleUp Malaysia . <p> The one issue that stands out for me is a lack of vision on what they want to achieve and not having buckets of ambition to create a unicorn . You ca n't create a unicorn if you do n't have guts and ambition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ambition mostly centered on Malaysia and perhaps the region . Frankly , I have rarely come across an entrepreneur who truly believes he or she can build a company with potential to generate even US$100 million in revenue , what more create a a billion Dollar unicorn . <p> Perhaps they are conditioned by the environment to think fund raising is tough , they do n't have the right talent or even being conditioned to think that Malaysian companies just can not achieve such lofty targets . Even when I suggest higher targets they question their ability to achieve them . I also notice a sense of fear when talking about lofty ambitions . Yes funding is tough , but you 're not giving yourself a chance if you lack this ambition . <p> Accelerators , coaching programs and mentors can help you build a better company , but we can not compensate for lack of ambition . Building a unicorn needs audacity and ambition , both of which are sorely lacking among Malaysian entrepreneurs . <p> 2 . Hustle on Performance <p> To build a successful business you need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hustle customers , investors and your own team . You need that " never say die " attitude , the kind of attitude that goes after every sale with only success in mind . The kind of person who can persuade customers to sign on the dotted line and also energise your team to overachieve . <p> There are often negative connotations to being a hustler , but if you want to thrive and succeed then you need to be a positive hustler . You need to hustle on performance - set high targets , push your team to achieve targets , replace people who ca n't deliver and ensure the entire company is performance driven . <p> Frankly I rarely find founders who are performance driven like this . I have come across too many entrepreneurs who do things slowly , do n't push themselves and their team hard enough , do n't set lofty goals and do n't aim for the sky . They are also too paternal or maternal , and mollycoddle their staff too much and let them get away with mediocre performance . The slo-mo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ low levels of success , if at all and definitely not unicorn level of success . <p> 3 . Born Global <p> Founders in small markets can never build a unicorn , that 's a given . As I showed in part 1 , having a large homogeneous market is a primary requirement for building a unicorn . Southeast Asia ( SEA ) may be a large market , but it is not homogeneous with multiple languages , regulations and cultures . It takes a lot of effort to build a SEA play and you 'll need to raise a lot of money . Many VC funded companies also failed to build successful SEA companies . <p> Many Malaysian companies build products for the home market , grow organically and then when they want to grow regionally they start country by country and start localising the product country by country . You can imagine how difficult this is going to be and essentially you 're building products organically market by market . This is no way to build a unicorn . <p> Companies in small markets like Xero , Atlassian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ market from day one because they knew that they had to be born global if they ever wanted to achieve unicorn status . I 'm not saying they wanted to be unicorns , but they wanted to be highly successful companies and they can not do that by just serving their own markets . Imagine if Xero was to just serve a market of 5 million people in New Zealand , how small they will be today . <p> I wish we had more entrepreneurs who thought like this and built products like this instead of thinking small from day one and building organically market by market . That is the only way to build a unicorn out of a small nation like Malaysia - think big and be global from day 1 . <p> 4 . Build a Great Team <p> I have seen many good founders and reasonably good teams but not great teams . How often have we heard that the team is the most important part of any company , that you need an awesome team to build a great company , yet almost all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It 's also been said that you need to hire people who are smarter than you and yet I rarely see that too . Yes , often the problem is having sufficient funds to hire them , but I 've seen companies raise funding and yet still do n't do this because the talent is very costly . The question they should ask themselves is how do you build a successful company and if you need the money to hire the best why not raise sufficient funds for that , instead of raising money and still hiring mediocre teams . <p> Scale <p> The final problem I see is that even when companies have built some success , instead of building on that success and ramping up on the model , they diversify instead into other things and start experimenting with new things , build extensions to their product , everything but double down on their existing success to just scale up the business . <p> It gets more difficult when they are probably ready to go outside their market but instead try and expand with additional products within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what 's needed to scale the business but it seems to be a challenge for them . Sometimes it 's a fear of the unknown outside Malaysia other times it 's a confidence issue . Until they break this mentality of fear , growth will usually slow down and it will plateau . This is the reason why we have hundreds of companies with flat revenues after 5 or more years and they struggle to survive . <p> Can we build unicorns out of Malaysia ? <p> Let 's be honest , it 's not going to be easy . There are fundamental macro issues that need to be fixed and entrepreneurs themselves need to do more . <p> I am glad to say that the funding issue has seen a positive development with the creation of Penjana Kapital and the soon to be available RM1.57 billion of funding in the ecosystem . I do hope the funding is allocated as planned by end of this month . They have adopted the recommendations that my Technopreneur Funding Task Force made in early 2019 and allocated funds for all stages of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time in Malaysia . This is a good start and hopefully there is sufficient funding annually to keep the availability of funds in the ecosystem at a healthy level . Other macro issues still remain challenging and we can never overcome the market size issue . <p> All the micro issues I mentioned however , are founder focused . The only way to create unicorns is for founders to change their mindsets to build global instead of local . Malaysia can be a test bed to test out products initially , but founders must always have a global mindset from day one . They need vision and ambition to attract top talent and investors , they need to have a never lose mentality but they do need products that are built for the world . <p> All of these elements need to come together in one great package , only then can we create unicorns . <p> Can we create unicorns in Malaysia ? There are unicorns from other equally small markets that have done it . They have shown us the way and founders need to study these companies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It can be done and I for one would love it if we proved the naysayers wrong and built some awesome unicorns .

@@42807232 <h> 5G infrastructure -- the bottom line <p> IS the setting up of a government-owned special purpose vehicle ( SPV ) -- now officially named Digital Nasional Bhd -- to roll out Malaysia 's 5G infrastructure good or bad for the country , telcos and consumers ? <p> The announcement of the SPV has triggered an avalanche of opinions , mostly critical . The telcos are , understandably , unhappy . The main arguments presented by analysts and commentators , so far , are quite frankly made with a defeatist attitude , with little solid factual rationale . Here is what we think , based on real-life observations and maths , and yes , minus the hyperbole . <h> Why not let the telcos do what they do best ? <p> Simply put , because what is best for the telcos is not necessarily best for the country and the people . <p> We understand why telcos are against this proposal for a single shared infrastructure company . <p> The fact is , spectrum is their only sustainable asset -- network equipment and such are quickly depreciated and/or written off because of rapid technological changes . Therefore , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expecting to get -- must surely be a painful loss . <p> Telcos want the spectrum -- a prized resource in every country in the world and an asset that belongs to all Malaysians -- for a very low cost or even for free . The rationale is that if they have to pay a high price for spectrum , they would not have the financials to fund the subsequent rollout and would have to charge users a higher price for their services . <p> Our question is this : Why should Malaysians give away such a valuable asset to the private sector for cheap ? The telcos would argue that it is a quid pro quo -- that is , they should get the spectrum for cheap or even free in return for providing quality services at lower charges than it would be if they had to pay a high price for spectrum . <p> But is this true ? We will elaborate on this a little later in this article . Suffice to say , our current phone bills are in fact high relative to per capita incomes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Malaysian telcos enjoy some of the highest earnings before interest , taxes , depreciation and amortisation ( Ebitda ) margins in the world . The bulk of free cash flow ( after capex ) generated annually is used to pay dividends to shareholders , not to pay down borrowings ( see Chart 1 ) . <p> We suspect without 5G spectrum and network infrastructure , these telcos may find it harder to keep refinancing their debt , which means dividends may actually have to drop . Lower dividend yields will likely affect their share prices . This is a major reason why the telcos are mounting such a pushback against the rollout of 5G by a government-owned SPV -- and not because a shared infrastructure is bad for the nation . <h> A single , shared 5G infrastructure is the best option for the country , no question <p> Most utility infrastructures are natural monopolies -- for instance , the electricity grid , water and sewerage reticulation systems and gas pipelines . It is no different for telecommunications . <p> The cost for 5G is high -- some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 10 years . The bulk of this will be for operations and maintenance ( O&amp;M ) and future upgrades over this 10-year period . If each telco were to roll out its own individual network , the total cost would be astronomical . For starters , the bill for imported equipment will have negative foreign exchange implications for the country . <p> Malaysians are already paying higher phone bills ( relative to incomes ) compared with , say , our neighbours in Singapore for similar packages ( see Table 1 ) . One reason for this is because of the relative weakness of the ringgit , resulting in higher prices for imported equipment and , thus , inflating overall capex and related costs . The other bigger reason is that duplicative network infrastructure is costly . <p> Case in point , despite charging higher prices -- Malaysian telcos have higher Ebitda margins compared with their counterparts in Singapore -- return on assets ( ROA ) are not significantly better . In fact , ROA has been declining in recent years despite sustained high Ebitda margins . That means the telcos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( see Charts 2 to 4 ) . Why ? <p> That 's because , for each telco to build and maintain parallel networks -- all covering the same geographical area and targeting the same people -- is an inefficient use of capital and a waste of resources . Malaysia has a population of just 32 million . It does not take a genius to deduce that the average cost per capita to defray capex of RM15 billion must be significantly less than a capex of RM45 billion ( collectively for the three biggest telcos , Maxis , Axiata and Digi ) . <h> Why not then allow the shared infrastructure to be owned and operated by a consortium of all the telcos in Malaysia ? <p> In most instances , we are firm believers that private-sector-driven investments are the best option for optimum efficiency , productivity and effectiveness -- except in a case where the government has to be the catalyst . Businesses are profit-oriented -- they will invest when , and only when , there is sufficient demand and returns . But the user case for demand will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is therefore , a catch-22 situation . <p> Telcos have been talking about sharing infrastructure for years without ever coming to an agreement -- case in point , we have duplicating networks for 3G and 4G -- for very pragmatic reasons . How do you divide the equity stakes , share of capex as well as board and management representations among so many players ? Who leads and who follows ? Would the big players be content as equal partners ? And if not , would the small players ever get a fair shake ? <p> Critically , even if all the telcos can eventually come to an agreement -- which they may not , in which case the country would have wasted precious time in getting a head start on 5G -- hashing out all the details could take years . Years that Malaysia can not afford . <p> The SPV is tasked with the first 5G commercial availability by end-2021 . Can a consortium of all telcos meet this deadline ? <p> As we said , the private sector is profit-oriented . That means telcos will only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , there are few " killer app " reasons for consumers to upgrade to 5G while enterprise demand is still in the nascent stage . In short , current demand and return on investments will not justify a rapid rollout . <p> Yet , time is of the essence . It is no secret that Malaysia has dropped the ball when it comes to moving up the manufacturing value chain and in the shift towards a knowledge-driven economy . The new Digital Economy Blueprint -- of which 5G is a key building block -- is our opportunity to catch up , failing which , we will surely fall farther behind . <p> Globally , the race to build out 5G is on . <p> Accelerating the digital transformation is critically important to spur innovation , maintain competitiveness and sustain economic growth , create higher-paying jobs and lift standards of living for all Malaysians . <p> And we do mean all Malaysians . We would bet that when telcos start the 5G rollout , it will be in the highest-population density areas and for highest-paying customers first . Cherry picking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ businesses have a duty to protect their bottom lines and the interests of shareholders . <p> We saw this happen during 3G and 4G rollouts where small towns and rural areas had poor or no connectivity for years , far lagging those in big cities . <p> Only a government-owned SPV that is not under constant pressure by shareholders to give quick returns can afford to build the infrastructure first , without waiting for justification from user demand . <p> It is no different from the building of telephone and power lines many , many years ago . All these were done by the government because only the government could take the lead . <p> 5G is a utility , a crucial utility for Malaysia . <p> The digital economy must be inclusive -- connectivity must be available and affordable to all Malaysians . It is important for the rural communities to close the digital divide and participate in new secular trends and innovations such as e-learning , e-commerce and new business opportunities . <p> But the fact is , we think the big telcos want to roll out their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high upfront cost acts as a very effective barrier to entry . Without ownership of spectrum and infrastructure , the telcos no longer have the oligopolistic advantage , and must now compete for customers on the basis of price and services , which will lower prices for consumers , and offer better-quality services . <p> This is why telcos want to own and invest into the infrastructure , even if it means lower ROA for the company . But this is clearly not in the interest of the Malaysian public . <h> But telcos will ultimately gain without having to spend hefty capex <p> The SPV setup will mean some short and mid-term pain for the telcos . It is disruptive to the current industry status quo and will require a change in their existing business models . But change is not necessarily bad . <p> We believe that the telcos too will ultimately gain by not having to spend hefty capex to build and maintain 5G network infrastructure . We foresee these companies ending up with stronger balance sheets . <p> As mentioned above , the ROA for Maxis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not significantly better than that of telcos in Singapore , despite charging much more for their services and enjoying high Ebitda margins . <p> Malaysian telcos are over-investing in capex , which results in high borrowings . Operating profits are then eaten away by depreciation and interest expenses . For instance , the capital intensity for Maxis and Axiata is averaging more than 21% , compared with roughly 14% for European telcos . <p> They compete by outspending on infrastructure , relying on headline coverage ratios to attract subscribers . But in spite of the over-investments , customer experience is lagging global leaders , according to a recent survey ( see illustration above ) . <p> A common government-owned 5G infrastructure , with equal access for all , will force telcos -- existing and new players -- to compete on service quality and customer experience . <p> Ultimately , Malaysian consumers will benefit . <p> Over time , telcos will improve their cash flows . By saving on heavy capex requirements , they could gradually pay down their borrowings and lower interest expenses . As shown in Chart 2 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away by depreciation and interest expenses . In the absence of heavy capital investments , telcos can even lower phone charges -- without compromising profits . <p> An asset-light business model could leave more cash for dividends in the future . Both shareholders and consumers will benefit in the long run . <h> Can a government SPV execute to plan ? <p> It is quite pointless to argue over whether the government SPV can deliver on its promises . Only time will tell . But let 's not jump the gun by being a cynic . <p> The SPV is already starting on a positive footing , with the appointment of Ralph Marshall as CEO . Surely , his credentials and previous experience with Maxis will go a long way in leading the management team , which will consist of experienced and known industry specialists ? <p> Another objection is with regards to the risk of security and disruption of a single shared infrastructure . For those less technically inclined , besides the new 5G RAN ( radio access network ) that must be bought , installed and maintained , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , including towers , sites and fibre . <p> There are only six global manufacturers of 5G RAN . Whether it is this SPV or existing telcos , the technology will be exactly the same , as are the equipment and suppliers , installers and maintenance . <p> We have laid out all the reasons why we think a single shared 5G infrastructure , spearheaded by the government , is the most efficacious option for the nation and all Malaysians , whether you are a consumer , enterprise , investor or taxpayer . <p> The SPV has promised transparency , global best practices , an open tender process for 5G infrastructure development and accountability .

With the reimposition of the MCO ( MCO 2.0 ) on Jan 13 , which saw most sectors of the economy continuing to operate , the output loss stood at RM300 million per day compared with RM2.4 billion per day during the first MCO last year , he added . <p> " Challenges that are currently absent from the public discourse include how to fund healthcare in sustainable ways given our shrinking tax base . " -- Khor <p> The finance minister says the worst is behind us . Be that as it may , what are the immediate challenges facing the country ? <p> From a healthcare perspective , Covid-19 has not been contained globally . In fact , experts have raised concerns about the variants that have been discovered in several parts of the world , which may not only be more transmissible but also cause more severe complications . <p> " We have a need to get our citizens vaccinated as quickly as possible so that we do n't see a variant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ importing one of the established strains that then get disseminated into the community , " says Datuk Professor Dr Adeeba Kamarulzaman , professor of infectious diseases at the University of Malaya . <p> There is concern that if one or more of these more transmissible variants get a foothold in the country , it could cause the existing vaccines to be less effective , she points out . However , she adds that several Covid-19 vaccine manufacturers are already updating their formulas to combat these variants . <p> " There should be plans to enhance the necessary conditions and incentives for healthy businesses to expand and invest more vigorously in productivity improvements , among others . " -- Yeah <p> According to the NCIP , 66.7 million doses -- which will cover 109.65% of the population eligible for vaccination -- have been acquired from five vaccine manufacturers . To date , three of the five vaccines have been approved . <p> " I wish the rollout of the programme could be more aggressive . For example , we are giving ourselves until the end of August to vaccinate those in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would imagine that this can be carried out a lot quicker than the current timeline suggests , provided we can secure the supply , " says Adeeba . <p> The professor , who is a member of the Selangor Task Force Covid-19 , points out that there has to be more vaccination centres and vaccinators across the country to speed up the timeline . " At present , there is an over-reliance on staff from the Ministry of Health ( MoH ) , who are already bogged down with other aspects of the Covid response , not to mention the other non-Covid diseases . The general practitioners ' community , health-related non-governmental organisations and others should be mobilised to deliver the vaccines , " she opines . <p> " I wish the rollout of the immunisation programme could be more aggressive , provided we can secure the supply . " -- Adeeba <p> Another big roadblock to the immunisation efforts could be a hesitancy among the general public . A survey conducted by MoH at the end of last year showed that more than one-third of the 200,000 respondents were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot more education and awareness campaigns , particularly outside the urban areas , need to be done , " says Adeeba . <p> Health policy specialist Dr Khor Swee Kheng says that while some challenges are well understood and have been well discussed -- such as vaccine supplies , equitable distribution and public confidence in the vaccine -- other aspects have not been as openly discussed . <p> " Challenges that are currently absent from the public discourse , but are also crucial to the success of the vaccination programme , include how to improve the relationship between the health ministry and other stakeholders , how to fund healthcare in sustainable ways given our shrinking tax base and the reformation needed in hiring , retaining and motivating healthcare professionals in a non-piecemeal fashion , " he adds . <h> Vaccine effectiveness will drive economic recovery <p> As the country navigates through the challenges of getting the population vaccinated , economists are of the opinion that the effectiveness of the vaccines will be one of the drivers of economic recovery . It is a given that the economy will likely remain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the best way to contain the pandemic . <p> With an effective vaccination programme , the next challenge for the government would be to " repair " social problems that have been made worse by the pandemic , says Lee Heng Guie , executive director at the Associated Chinese Chambers of Commerce and Industry of Malaysia 's Socio-Economic Research Centre ( SERC ) . " Such issues include labour market exclusion , reduced income and wider income disparity , as well as other forms of social impact and exclusion experienced by vulnerable groups . " <p> UOB ( M ) Bhd economist Julia Goh sees the labour market as a key area that bears monitoring . She says wage subsidies and job retention schemes have helped to save jobs thus far . " But without an extension of such stimulus , will the job market be under pressure again ? " she asks . <p> Data provided by the Department of Statistics Malaysia show that the unemployment rate inched up to 4.9% in January from 4.8% in December last year . This follows closely the rising number of Covid-19 infections @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the year . <p> What has often been said is that it is not the pandemic that caused job losses , but the MCO that made it difficult for employers to keep their staff when their businesses were forced to close . Some believe that categorising sectors as " essential " and " non-essential " was not helpful , given that income loss ultimately affected people 's quality of life . <p> " Certain services may look non-essential from the consumer 's perspective , but they are not from the standpoint of the service provider . You can choose not to cut your hair for a month , but the barber can not afford to not feed his or her family for a month , " says Centre for Market Education CEO Carmelo Ferlito . <p> ( Photo by Sam Fong/The Edge ) <p> " We have been fed with the questionable distinction between lives and livelihoods , in order for us to digest policies that were forcing people to renounce their income . Livelihoods are lives ; people who lose their income are putting their lives and that of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> What is crucial is a clear and comprehensive economic recovery plan that will enable distressed firms and households to get back on their feet more quickly , says Dr Yeah Kim Leng , professor of economics at Sunway University Business School . " At the same time , there should be plans to enhance the necessary conditions and incentives for healthy businesses to expand and invest more vigorously in productivity improvements , upskilling , technology innovations and adoption , in line with the nation 's push towards an advanced digital and green economy . " <p> SERC 's Lee shares this sentiment , saying that concrete action plans that focus on the digital and green transformation of the economy , and improving competitiveness , are needed . <p> However , if countries keep their borders closed , there may be a few speed bumps on the road to economic recovery . Ferlito believes that real economic recovery can only happen if international travel is allowed again , and he says it is one aspect that needs to be looked into urgently . <p> " Mida ( the Malaysian Investment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business travellers ... this is the way to go . We need to push further in that direction and gradually allow tourists too . Malaysia ca n't afford isolation , " he adds . <p> " Certain services may look non-essential from the consumer 's perspective , but they are not from the standpoint of the service provider . You can choose not to cut your hair for a month , but the barber can not afford to not feed his or her family for a month . " -- Ferlito <h> Political stability <p> While the measures to contain the pandemic have consumed every aspect of our daily lives , Malaysia 's political scene has also dominated conversations and the headlines . <p> Following the fall of the Pakatan Harapan government in February last year and the establishment of Perikatan Nasional , many would agree that there has been much uncertainty on the political front . Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin , who became prime minister in March 2020 , has been grappling with a razor-thin majority in parliament . <p> One of the points of contention was the declaration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a proactive measure to contain the virus and flatten the curve of Covid-19 cases that had skyrocketed last December . Nevertheless , critics see it as a move that would help the prime minister avoid an immediate challenge to his leadership and the next general election . <p> " We must always have good sense and strong political will must prevail to reset our national development agenda . " -- Lee <p> Notably , Muhyiddin recently said he would have parliament dissolved once the Covid-19 situation eases and call for a general election . Many see this happening in the second half of this year . <p> " With the public health-economy nexus taken care of , the third imperative would be the politics-economy nexus . What is needed is an early exit from emergency rule and a clear mandate from a stable government with a leadership committed to pursuing institutional and structural reforms that are crucial to unleash the country 's potential and instil investor confidence in the country 's long-term growth prospects , " says Yeah . <p> Kenanga Research head Koh Huat Soon highlights that the question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the progress of the vaccination programme . " Going forward , cases will definitely ease , but the question is to what level and by when . We do n't know at what level the prime minister will consider it safe to hold a general election , " he adds . <p> " By August , cases should have eased substantially and the prime minister may consider lifting the emergency . Then , the chances of an election being held before the end of the year will rise considerably . " <p> SERC 's Lee points out that political stability is key to macroeconomic stability and growth amid the prolonged lingering impact of the Covid-19 pandemic . " We must always have good sense and strong political will must prevail to reset our national development agenda . Having a stable political condition will enhance the confidence of both domestic and foreign investors in terms of where the country is heading . The uncertainty associated with an unstable political environment may reduce investment and the pace of economic development , " he says .

This is true regarding the ethno-religious political parties in Malaysia . <p> For example , while Pas was pragmatic in joining the Barisan Alternative and Pakatan Rakyat , over the years , its main grievances were that the DAP always stood against Pas ' Islamic state goals . <p> Pakatan Rakyat ultimately broke up because of the incompatible goals of the DAP and Pas . The cooperation in terms of winning elections was a pragmatic one , but it failed in terms of the governance of the states under Pakatan Rakyat .

Anwar was not even invited to the so-called Malay Dignity Congress , which was held during PH rule . <p> Whatever coalition that is sought out , can PKR guarantee that Umno will not play the race and religious card when its demands are not met ? <p> Therefore , it is vital that Anwar come to his senses -- that his overriding goal of becoming prime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who are trying to escape from their crimes . <p> It is time to learn from history and processes why the coalition called Pakatan Rakyat and PH failed .

There was no announcement of a major funding round , rather , they have sold their startup for US$45 million ( RM186 million ) to allow the buyer , existing investor , Pine Labs Ptd Ltd to achieve its goal of scale , as Pine Labs pursues a target of getting listed in the US market in Q1 of 2022 , able to show it has a strong Southeast Asian footprint .

This explains why the Singapore Business Times describes Fave as a Singapore startup . Times of India and Reuters though , identify Fave as a Malaysian startup . <p> Ed : Whether Fave is a Malaysian or Singaporean startup is immaterial to this article ... unless you happen to be Malaysian or Singaporean . <p> For Joel ( right ) , CC and key staff , the journey does not end here as they will be receiving a mixture of cash and equity in Pine Labs with a three to four year vesting period while an ESOP pool will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with cash payouts from the acquisition . <p> Yet no investor , beyond the angel round , is walking away with rich multiples . Over the five years since it pivoted from being a health and wellness startup , Kfit , to an O2O fintech , investors , including a Singapore-based venture capital research firm , estimate Fave has raised close to US$50 million . This includes its Aug 2020 investment from Pine Labs , which some venture capital players believe was a down round ( the valuation was lower than in its previous fund raise round ) . <p> Fave in India <p> Be that as it may , although the big cash out dreams have ended for the founders and key staff , with shares in a possible US listing in Q1 2022 , there is still all to work for , especially an upcoming Q2 launch where Fave will introduce its platform to the 150,000 Indian merchant base of Pine Labs with its 500,000 merchant network points across 3,700 cities in India . Joel , who will run the Indian operations of Fave , is clearly excited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Southeast Asian startup in expanding to India . " <p> While Sequoia Capital India is a major investor in both startups and would have played a key role in the acquisition , Joel also tells DNA that both Fave and Pine Labs saw a clear opportunity in working much closer together . <p> " Pine Labs works mostly on the merchant side as a merchant commerce platform while we are a consumer facing app where we service merchant loyalty programmes through our platform . " <p> There was a clear path to scale the platform and grow both the customer and merchant base , and in the process , strengthen Pine Labs ' value proposition to merchants . Where it comes in helping to solve the payment and technology challenges of merchants , Pine Labs can now also help merchants increase customer loyalty . <p> Although it has a much larger engineering team than Fave , Pine Labs was impressed with the QR based loyalty platform that Fave built . Its CEO , B Amrish Rau ( pic , left ) tells DNA , " I think Fave has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundreds of different brands to a single app . " <p> He believes that very few companies have been able to build their loyalty and engagement programmes with a QR code base . They generally adopt physical loyalty cards even though these have been proven to be unpopular with consumers , especially from a convenience point of view . " But the QR code allows you to do this carry multiple loyalty programmes on one app and I think , this is what Fave does really , really well . " <p> Adding to this , Joel explains , " what we have built that is quite unique is that we have 40,000 merchants on the platform and we have 40,000 loyalty programmes on the platform , all integrated seamlessly into the QR payment flow which allows customers to pay now and get cash back from the merchants immediately . " <p> Describing this as their " core product " Joel notes that both companies also offer merchants a gift card service with Fave planning to integrate this into their app in preparation for the India launch .

How many startups in Southeast Asia can claim that ? " <p> Indeed the duo and the company they built , which is also an MDEC GAIN company , will inspire and motivate many in the Malaysian startup ecosystem as they ramp up their Pay It Forward drive .

@@42990237 <h> Climate and Environmental Governance : Natural capital and the true cost of living <p> At this year 's 26th United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP 26 ) in Glasgow ( Nov 1 to 12 ) , we can expect delegates to dedicate a significant portion of their deliberations to the mounting rate of biodiversity loss from unsustainable exploitation of land and sea for food and industrial materials production . <p> These resources , or natural capital , include the planet 's stores of environmental assets such as geological reserves , soil , air , water and living organisms . Quantifying the true value of these assets and making users pay accordingly for their consumption will be critical to our success in limiting climate change . <h> Unsustainable consumption <p> Today , humankind consumes the planet 's natural capital 1.75 times faster than it can be regenerated -- an ecological footprint of 1.75 planet Earth . More than 50% of the world 's GDP , about US$44 trillion , depends to some degree on nature . <p> This astonishing total includes intensive agriculture , which drives habitat destruction and threatens microorganisms , insects and plant varieties . Population @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ developing countries in Asia and beyond , not to mention demand for manufactured products and resource-intensive services . <p> In just one example , our reliance on meat for dietary protein -- an increasing trend in emerging markets -- often drives deforestation and land and water degradation . It can also release more greenhouse gases into the atmosphere . Raising cattle for food , for example , accounts for 65% of all livestock emissions . <p> In the oceans , overfishing and destructive harvesting techniques are causing irrecoverable losses of species . Reducing the sum of life in the oceans also diminishes their capacity to sequestrate carbon . <p> Counterintuitively , this ongoing industrialisation of food production will lead to food poverty in the future as resources become exhausted and severe weather events become more frequent . <p> Loss of biodiversity reduces the resilience of the planet 's ecosystems by creating overdependence on a narrower range of resource types . At a genetic level , biodiversity means a healthy , balanced interaction of species , which provides a robust defence against threats . As the mid-19th century Irish potato famine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no alternatives if a pathogen should devastate the species -- with terrible consequences . <p> Asia-Pacific alone is home to 17 of the world 's 36 biodiversity hotspots and more than half of the world 's remaining fertile mangrove areas . Its freshwater ecosystems support more than 28% of aquatic and semi-aquatic species , 37% of which are threatened by overfishing , pollution , infrastructure development and invasive alien species . <h> Calculating the cost <p> To limit climate change and extensive economic loss , this unsustainable rate of consumption must be reversed and our natural capital restored . The cost of such comprehensive long-term initiatives will be considerable : the World Economic Forum ( WEF ) expects that US$2 trillion of capital investment a year is needed between 2020 and 2030 for effective ecosystem restoration . <p> The returns should also be substantial though . The WEF estimates that restoring global ecosystems can create annual business opportunities worth US$10 trillion over the next decade . <p> But funding the restoration of our natural capital is not yet commercially attractive to investors . While green financing and transition financing tools @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for ecological restoration projects is simply too long to emulate this progress . Investors require a quicker return on their capital than these projects can provide . <p> In addition , the scale of remediation initiatives is too great for individual institutions to take on -- and the inherent risks are too concentrated for most investors ' appetites . Undertakings of this magnitude will require major changes in the way natural capital is valued and fundamental changes to consumer habits if we are to succeed in reversing the potentially disastrous overconsumption of the Earth 's resources . <h> What it 's worth <p> As we seek to tip the balance toward an economy which keeps consumption and recovery of the planet 's resources in equilibrium , the first challenge is valuation . Investors increasingly expect businesses to recognise the true cost of the natural resources they consume , evaluating the full lifecycle of a product , including all externalities resulting from its production , distribution , consumption and disposal . As negative externalities are factored in , a shift in what constitutes a viable business model will force a shift @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gauge the full environmental impact of products and services such as the Natural Capital Protocol : a global standardised framework to measure and value impacts and dependencies on natural capital . <p> Government subsidies that support polluting businesses , which are still common in Asia , will need to be phased out . Instead , governments and supranational bodies could direct real capital or guarantee support to projects that ameliorate damage to our natural capital . Individuals and businesses will also need to accept that sustainably sourced raw materials and products will likely cost more in the future , compelling purchasing choices that are based on holistic valuations . <h> Making it work <p> Templates for success already exist . A 2015 project initiated by Michelin and Barito Pacific Group in Indonesia demonstrates how stakeholders can cooperate in establishing a sustainable business that also promotes ecological and social benefits . <p> Under the auspices of the Tropical Landscapes Finance Facility ( TLFF ) , a rubber plantation covering 88,000ha is being developed on land previously devastated by deforestation . About 50% of the area is reforested with sustainable high-yielding rubber @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ territory , left to regenerate . In addition , the project creates 16,000 jobs , ensuring local communities share in the benefits . BNP Paribas was proud to be involved , securitising loans from the TLFF platform so that fixed-income investors could buy them . <p> As preparations for COP26 continue , unsustainable exploitation of the planet 's resources and threats to biodiversity will feature on many countries ' agendas . More action like that project in Indonesia is needed to address the unsustainable deterioration of our natural capital , and find ways to finance its restoration . <p> Humankind 's long-term prosperity , as well as the health of the entire planet , depends on it . <p> Chaoni Huang is head of sustainable capital markets ( Asia-Pacific ) at BNP Paribas

" ( Sitec staff were absorbed into Sidec ) <p> E-commerce was not as popular then as it is today , but the state government felt it was going to be an important aspect of doing business , hence the focus . <p> With an annual budget of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been trained in various aspects of doing business through e-commerce . <p> Add to this , more than 9,000 individuals have learned to make online sales through its E-Commerce Class , Master Class , Online 100 and Brands 100 programmes . <p> The onset of the pandemic in March 2020 and the shock this delivered to small and micro businesses that depend on face to face transactions also triggered the state government to accelerate its e-commerce drive to the merchant community , both small and micro SMEs , through the introduction of its e-Bazar series of voucher promotions . <p> It worked better than expected . <p> " We allocated RM5 million for this , yet it resulted in RM79 million in direct sales , " Teng said . Even more impressive was the multiplier effect from this initiative which is estimated at RM2.003 billion throughout the value chain . <p> " There were even some merchants who saw sales shoot up from RM2,000-RM3,000 a month to RM12,000 to RM30,000 thanks to the e-vouchers we launched , " said Teng . <p> This success in turn helped motivate more merchants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to adopt e-commerce . <p> But the state did not get carried away by this success . Having been involved in helping its SMEs adopt e-commerce since 2015 , the state government also knew that just adding an online sales channel was not enough to strengthen the competitiveness of its SME community . <p> " The broader picture is the digital economy . E-commerce is just one part of the picture , " Teng points out . <p> This broader strategy started taking shape in 2018 with the launch of the Selangor Accelerator Programme which focuses on picking promising startups from Selangor and giving them the support to accelerate their growth . <p> 90 startups have gone through the programme from three batches which included a 2019 visit to the Alibaba Campus in China and with a small group even taken on a trip to the Silicon Valley in early 2020 before the pandemic hit . <p> This broader focus on the Digital Economy has now taken yet another step forward with the incorporation of Sidec with a mission of further driving adoption of the digital economy in the state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " We know that everything in a business has to be digitised for it to be competitive , " notes Teng . <p> This is where its recently introduced RM5 million Selangor SME Digitalisation Matching Grant comes into the picture . <p> To further spur the digitalisation of SMEs , a 50% matching grant or a maximum of RM5,000 is being offered to SMEs that subscribe to an accredited digital service provider , of which there are 100 such companies approved by the state government . <p> SMEs may choose to subscribe to up to three of these services .

" <p> And , pointing to the recently announced MyDigital blueprint , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ create unicorns . Well , at least one . <p> But the state government knows it can not achieve this on its own . <p> " This will require a strong ecosystem , collaborating together , " says Yong , adding that expanding the ecosystem and strengthening the links between the various parties , including federal and state agencies , angel clubs , venture capitalists and various business groups , will be a key principle of how Sidec operates . <p> " Just look at the MyDigital roadmap and its ambitous targets . You can not just leave it to the Federal Government to drive this forward . " <p> He acknowledges that State Governments need to do more and increase their commitments driving digital adoption and supporting startups . <p> " At Sidec , we also need to pull in the private sector and this is why we are working with the Malaysian Business Angels Network ( MBAN ) . " <p> Sidec plans to leverage the existing investor education initiatives driven by MBAN and encourage business owners from large and mid-sized companies to attend the sessions to open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ typical property investment . <p> In fact he is ambitiously hoping that Sidec can help change society 's thinking .

" <p> With an increased allocation of RM365 million from the State Development Fund for 2021 allocated to Digital Economy initiatives , a 33% rise over 2000 , no one can say Selangor is not doing its part . <p> Apart from the new SME digitalisation grant , there is also a proposed Selangor Innovation Ecosystem Alliance , a new initiative with experienced company builders , serial entrepreneurs and investors to create market-leading companies that will rise as Southeast Asia 's tech icons . <p> As Yong states , " We want to create high-impact entrepreneurs as highlighted in the World Economic Forum report - " The Bold Ones " - by applying entrepreneurial and operational experience from our ecosystem partners to accelerate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their hands full in achieving the mission of Sidec but one suspects they are relishing the challenge of uplifting Selangor and its companies into becoming digital economy leaders .

Plans to strengthen existing connectivity include investing in wider fibre optic network coverage , more international submarine cable landings , 5G technology and cloud-computing services . <p> The government has taken a step forward to accelerate 5G technology rollout in the country by awarding a single 5G licence to Digital Nasional Bhd ( DNB ) , a special purpose vehicle established by the Ministry of Finance .

For a successful deployment , they could consider offering incentives to attract buy-in . This includes open access to existing infrastructure to support low-cost deployment , pricing flexibility to offer wholesale prices , autonomous operations with independent regulatory oversight and the agility to meet demand . <p> Other countries that have attempted to implement the WOAN model include Kenya , Mexico , Russia , Belarus and Rwanda . <p> In 2011 , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 4G LTE rollout .

Mexico 's WOAN structure achieved several key objectives in promoting competition , enabling smaller players ' participation and increasing access to underserved market . However , limited buy-in from major mobile operators led to scaling difficulties . <p> In 2010 , Russia trialed WOAN to build a new national LTE network . However , the trial was abandoned due to lack of alignment from operators . <p> Two key take-aways <p> Darryll believes Malaysia can learn from and analyse the practices of these WOAN case studies across the world .

This is absolutely imperative . " We can not emphasise enough the importance of good governance , operational efficiencies , and alignment from all mobile operators , " Darryll stresses . <p> Returning to the billion-dollar question , can a WOAN model work in Malaysia with accessible and affordable 5G connectivity to all ? <p> The answer is yes . While there has been successes and failures with WOAN globally , it is certainly feasible with sound execution and implementation . It also has to be future technology ready with the right strategy , commercial models , policies , governance and partners . With all these , there is no doubt Malaysia can become a world reference for a 5G WOAN model . <p> With connectivity being a lever for digital and social inclusion , Naza Communications is ready to support 5G rollout in the country as a strategic deployment partner .

@@43127231 <h> Formalities to convene Parliament -- Hafiz Hassan <p> JUNE 19 -- Even if we agree with the view that the King has the power to reconvene Parliament under emergency , there are formalities to convening Parliament . <p> This explains why the Melaka State Assembly is reportedly expected to convene in the middle of July at the latest after the actual date is gazetted . The key word here is " gazetted " which is explained <p> The King 's statement or decree as announced by the Controller of Royal Household that Parliament should convene as soon as possible can not be likened to the announcement by the Keeper of the Ruler 's Seal on when Muslims in Malaysia will celebrate Hari Raya Aidilfitri or Hari Raya Aidiladha . The announcement usually reads as follow : <p> " In keeping with the command of the Yang di-Pertuan Agong , following the consent of the Rulers , I hereby declare that the date for Hari Raya Aidilfitri/Aidiladha for the states in Malaysia has been set for . " <p> With that , mosques can be opened on the declared date for the Hari Raya prayers -- in times of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( SOP ) for sure . <p> An oral announcement suffices . <p> There are , however , formalities to convene Parliament , just like there are formalities to proclaim a state of emergency . Article 150(1) of the Federal Constitution does not require the proclamation be issued in any particular form . It says that the King " may issue a Proclamation of Emergency making therein a declaration to that effect . " <p> But the accepted view is the proclamation must be in document form and published . As a matter of fact , all the proclamations in respect of the four previous emergencies -- 1964 , 1966 , 1969 and 1977 -- and the Jan 11 proclamation have been in document form and published in the Gazette . And the proclamations have all taken effect from the date of publication in the Gazette . <p> By definition , a proclamation is a subsidiary legislation section 3 of the Interpretation Acts 1948 and 1967 . Cyrus Das , in his doctoral thesis " Emergency Power and Parliamentary Government in Malaysia : Constitutionalism in a New Democracy " explains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be published in the Gazette , and takes effect only upon publication in the Gazette . <p> Now , convening Parliament can be made by way of proclamation to summon Parliament under Article 55(1) . A situation where proclamation to summon is used is where Parliament has been prorogued . Proroguing Parliament is also by way of proclamation and made under Article 55(2) . <p> A view of the Parliament building in Kuala Lumpur March 19 , 2021 . ? Picture by Yusof Mat Isa <p> The current Parliament last sat on Dec 17 . It was adjourned and not prorogued , as there seems to be no proclamation proroguing Parliament which would have been gazetted . Parliament was in fact adjourned to March 8 as published on its website before the date was removed as the date was no longer valid with the enforcement of the Emergency ( Essential Powers ) Ordinance 2021 . <p> The other way to convene Parliament is under the Dewan Rakyat Standing Orders ( DRSO ) . DRSO No. 11(2) requires the prime minister to give at least 28 days ' notice for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minister represents to the Dewan Rakyat ( DR ) Speaker that the public interest requires that the DR should meet at an earlier date , the Speaker must give notice forthwith and the DR must meet at the time stated in such notice . The business set down for that day must be appointed by the prime minister and notice thereof must be circulated not later than the time of meeting DRSO No. 11(3) . <p> In short , there are formalities to convene Parliament . The reason or reasons are not rocket science . The members of Parliament ( MPs ) must be notified in writing of the dates of meeting of the DR , although in cases of urgency as may be determined by the Speaker , notice may be dispensed with . Even so , the longest notice possible must be given DRSO No. 9(2) ( a ) <p> MPs need also be supplied with a copy of the Order Paper for that meeting DRSO No. 9(2) ( b ) . Each sitting must be transacted in the order as provided by DRSO No. 14 . Parliamentary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a more serious note , Parliamentary sitting is also unlike a court sitting which may proceed ex parte ( only one party is before the court ) on application of a party . Parliament , on the other hand , must sit with a quorum DRSO No. 13 ( 1 ) . <p> Now , even if the King were to summon Parliament by way of proclamation under Article 55(1) , the longest notice possible must be given .

@@43161233 <p> THERE are not many success stories when it comes to conservation , but here in Sabah there are a group getting it right . <p> Dedication , teamwork and forward thinking are enabling the team to take huge steps forward to save endangered sea turtles around Borneo . <p> Sabah 's Turtle Island Park lies off its east coast , 40km north of Sandakan . It comprises three small islands , Selingan , Gulisaan and Bakunggan Kecil and covers an area of around 1,740 hectares , including the surrounding reefs and sea . <p> ADVERTISEMENT <p> The islands became a marine park in 1977 , and they have had resident Sabah Parks staff managing the islands ever since . <p> The reason for this ? To safeguard the park and to protect the green and hawksbill turtles that visit throughout the year , who build nests and lay eggs on the sandy beaches surrounding the islands . <p> Alex Alexander , the local presenter for Scubazoo.TV 's Borneo Ocean Diaries ( BOD ) , is off on her next adventure . <p> This week , to visit the Turtle Islands Park and to understand more about how the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but are thriving due to the long term planning , scientific methodology and hard work of their guardians . <p> Alex met up with Nazir bin Nujum , the Park Ranger and officer in change of the Turtle Islands . He heads up a team of 22 staff , 6 of them lifeguards , with the rest working as turtle researchers . <p> During the day , they keep the islands clean and the tourists safe . But their main works starts at night , when they organize activities for tourists , as well as undertaking the turtle monitoring and research . <p> This involves : ensuring the turtles safety , recording data on visiting turtles and safeguarding the eggs laid by the turtles . <p> Nazir has been lucky enough to form a real connection with the turtles . " During my sixteen years working here , I am proud to be part of the Sabah Parks team . <p> When it comes to the turtles , the first time you see them you will instantly fall in love with them and the more you get to know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important for you on a personal level , but also important for the country and our future generations . " <p> And the future generations of turtles are the main concern here . <p> Malaysia 's first turtle hatchery was established on Pulau Selingan way back in 1966 . <p> The park is now part of south east Asia 's largest green turtle nesting sites or rookery as they are known . <p> An astonishing 15-20,000 nests are made each year in the whole park . <p> Each nest is logged by Sabah Parks staff . Firstly , details of the female turtle laying the eggs are recorded , such as size and if the turtle has visited before , and turtles are tagged if they are new . <p> ADVERTISEMENT <p> This data gathering does n't disturb the turtle as they enter a trance-like state during egg laying . <p> Then the eggs are removed , counted and placed into hand-dug nests within the safety of the hatchery . <p> This is to protect them against natural predators such as monitor lizards , birds and snakes . <p> They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and from beach erosion by high tides and storm surges . <p> Every detail has been considered , such as using only plastic and wooden materials within the hatchery as metal materials can disturb the island 's natural magnetic fields and in turn affect the turtle 's " internal compass " . <p> The sex of the baby turtles is determined by the incubation temperature of the nest and this plays a critical role in the turtles population dynamics . <p> A balanced nest temperature that produces both equal numbers of male and female turtles is know as the Pivotal Temperature , about 27oC for green turtles . <p> If the incubation temperature within a nest rises about this Pivotal temperature more females develop and hatch out and conversely if the incubation temperature for the nest drops below the Pivotal temperature more males develop and hatch out . <p> Sabah Parks rangers go to great efforts to offer a balanced environment within their hatcheries with certain areas shaded and others open to the sun 's heat , to ensure the same proportion of male and female hatchlings are produced as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ detail is recorded and carefully analysed . Because of this , the Turtle Island Park is now considered one of the best examples of turtle management in Southeast Asia . <p> With a staggering 18.2 million hatchlings released between 1979 and 2017 , they truly are giving endangered turtles hope of survival . <p> One of the greatest moments for Alex was as she watched the release of the baby green turtles into the ocean to start their life 's journey . <p> But even this activity is carefully controlled to provide the best start in life for the turtles . The hatchlings are not released directly into the sea , but up on the beach as it is vitally important that the hatchlings are allowed to find their own way down across the sand and into the water . <p> It may not seem like much , but this step at the start of their lives allows them to orientate themselves to the earth 's magnetic fields , and if female , in helping them to find their way back to the general area where they were born when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some 20-30 years in the future . <p> It is small yet important details like this that have so successfully merged conservation with tourism , as Alex 's experience was not unique -- Sabah Parks offer activities for all , including a video presentation , the chance to witness a turtle laying eggs and watching the hatchlings being released upon the beach before they rush down to the ocean . <p> " Witnessing the turtle life cycle on Pulau Selingan was definitely an amazing experience for me . I got to see hatchlings erupting out of their nests , see them collected and released to the sea . <p> At night , I went flat on my belly in the sand , watching a mother turtle dig a nest . <p> I felt incredibly lucky as a Sabahan to know that the Turtle Islands Park is part of the most important sea turtle rookeries in the whole of Southeast Asia . " <p> So by allowing tourists , both local and foreign , a chance to experience the turtle lifecycle , it is hoped that more people will care and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Tourism will open up again and the sooner people can visit the Turtle Island Park again the better , for the turtles and the local economy . <p> Alex is positive that tourism is part of the future for marine turtles . <p> " I think the Turtle Islands Park is an important tourist destination as I believe if any tourists are interested to see sea turtle life cycle for themselves , this is definitely the right place to go . " <p> There are many dedicated people in Sabah who are devoting their lives to the ocean . <p> Over the next few episodes of Borneo Ocean Diaries , Alex will continue to champion their work and will learn more about the marine life that surrounds us . <p> Turtle hatchlings are placed in a basket before they are released . <p> Alex taking a closer look at turtle eggs buried under the sands . <p> The new series of Borneo Ocean Diaries will be shown for free on www.scubazoo.tv with the latest episode released on the 28st June 2021 .

For more information , please access to Headline news in Daily Express on 24 June 2021 <p> ITPs and natural forests are not mutually exclusive nor are they locked in a zero-sum game . They are important complementary parts in Sabah 's future . Successful ITPs plus downstream industrialization can , in fact , reduce or totally eliminate the need to cut down trees from our natural forest . <p> The ITPs will replace the Government 's revenue source from natural forest timber . This will also give a chance for the existing logged over forests to regenerate for perpetual preservation .

Relying on natural forest logs will become a thing of the past like 1G or 2 G smartphone users . They ca n't survive on natural logs any longer . <p> ITP logs will benefit the pragmatic present down-stream players if they can embrace reality and grab opportunities in ITP logs especially those produced by ITP plantation companies like Gerak Saga which have achieved worldwide recognition certifications . <p> ITP owners have debunked the myth/excuse of oil palm plantations not to give employment for Sabahans .

@@43280237 <p> While all the companies reported losses throughout the pandemic period , what is also critical is looking at their net cash or debt level and how that changed over the course of the past fifteen months . ( See summary table ) From the chart , the first observation is that over the past five quarters , that means for the whole of 2020 and up to the first quarter of this year ( Q12021 ) , these four companies alone chalked up total losses of RM11.3bil , led by AAG 's RM5.9bil loss . This was followed by the RM2.75bil loss at GENM , RM1.36bil loss at Genting , and RM1.34bil loss at MAHB . <p> However , some of these losses were not operational and hence had no impact on the company 's financial cashflows . <p> For some of these companies , the losses experienced for the cumulative five quarterly periods were also driven by impairments . <p> In fact , between 22% and 66% of the losses reported were impairments made due to the deterioration in the value of assets held . <p> This includes impairments that came from receivables , amounts due from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ associates , property , plant and equipment , rights of use lease assets , and even casino licences . <p> The next two columns are related to the net debt levels of the four companies . <p> The first column refers to the level of net debt as at end of December 2019 and the next column is as at end of Q12021 . <p> From here , the change in each of the four companies ' net debt level over the past fifteen months is calculated , which in total amounted to RM21.82bil . <p> Genting Highlands Resorts <p> Among the four companies , Genting had the largest change in its net debt , from RM1.85bil to as much as RM15.2bil , a jump of RM13.35bil . <p> This was followed by GENM and AAG 's RM4.27bil and RM2.85bil deterioration in their respectively net debt levels while MAHB experienced RM1.35bil higher net debt for the fifteen months period . <p> Accounting losses are not the same as worsening net debt level <p> One thing for sure from the table is that accounting losses and deterioration in net debt level @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like depreciation and amortisation as well as impairment charges . <p> For example , in Genting 's case , while it reported losses of about RM1.36bil but its net debt level deteriorated by more than eight-fold . <p> Looking at Genting 's financials , Genting had massive investments that were carried out over the past fifteen months mainly due to the purchase of property , plant , and equipment amounting to RM10.7bil . <p> Similarly , in GENM 's case , although its net debt level more than doubled over the same period , it was mainly due to the purchase of property , plant , and equipment amounting to RM1.3bil and another RM0.9bil in relation to investment in an associate company . <p> However , in AAG 's case , where fortunes were impacted severely by the pandemic , its financial condition deteriorated mainly due to operational losses . <p> Very little of the RM2.85bil change in AAG 's net debt was due to the purchase of assets . <p> The change in AAG 's net debt would have been higher by another RM336.5mil as that was the amount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early this year . <p> Similarly , for MAHB , much of the change in net debt is related to the operational losses rather than investments , as the airport operator too was affected by reduced air travel . <p> Preparing for the recovery <p> Among the four companies , the fortunes of Genting-related companies appear much brighter than AAG and MAHB , mainly due to the diversified nature of Genting 's business , not only in terms of different sectors but also geographically . <p> In addition , both Genting and GENM have healthy shareholders ' funds and their respective net gearing of 46% and 54.7% appears reasonably acceptable , despite the massive capital expenditure over the past fifteen months . <p> For MAHB , their current net gearing level of 59% is also seen as reasonable too , although it has jumped from the 32% net gearing level as at end of 2019 . <p> This is mainly due to the double whammy impact from higher net debt and the drop in shareholders funds by about RM1.47bil or 17.7% over the past fifteen months . For AAG , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its financial statements as at end of Q12021 , as against a surplus of almost RM4.5bil as at end 2019 , a reversal of more than RM6.11bil . This is after the first two tranches of new AAG shares were issued earlier this year which boosted its shareholders ' funds by RM336.5mil . Hence , AAG needs to address the negative shareholders ' funds in its books urgently . This can only be done via a fresh capital injection and perhaps even a capital reconstruction exercise . <p> In fact , about three weeks ago , AAG proposed to undertake a seven-year Redeemable Convertible Unsecured Islamic Debt Securities ( RCUIDS ) right issue exercise on the basis of two RCUIDS with one free warrant for every six AAG shares held . As the RCUIDS are priced at RM0.75 each , AAG is expected to raise some RM1.02bil from the exercise . Effectively , these RCUIDS are hybrid securities as they are both convertible to AAG shares on the basis of one for one , and redeemable from the fourth anniversary onwards , at the rate of 25% of the issue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ordinary shares . <p> Based on the unaudited financial statements as at March 31 2021 and post certain events that took place after the close of the quarterly period which boosted the shareholders ' funds by RM108.7mil , the RCUIDS issuance will enhance the company 's shareholders ' funds by another RM145.1mil . Hence , AAG 's shareholders ' funds , before taking into consideration the impact of the RCUIDS or warrants conversion , will remain in deficit or at negative RM1.38bil . <p> Whether RCUIDS holders will convert to ordinary shares or whether warrant holders will exercise their options to convert to new AAG ordinary shares in the future is dependent on AAG 's business operations and fortunes over the next one to two years and whether AAG can return to profitability . Hence , it is rather too early to tell the impact on AAG 's future shareholders ' funds position as to whether it can turn into a surplus due to the conversion of the hybrid papers and warrants that are issued with the subscription . <p> Clearly , the RCUIDS are insufficient to address AAG 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is likely necessary . Even AAG 's plan to issue another 198.2mil shares via a private placement priced at an indicative price of RM0.89 per share will not help as that would only raise some RM176mil . <p> AAG 's options are not only financial engineering but whether everyone can fly again . <p> Pankaj C.

For the former , we anticipate one rate hike around end-2022 and up to two hikes in 2023 .

This implies that bonds should be relatively more attractive than equities . <p> For our central case -- we expect equities to be able to digest a 10-year yield of below 2.7 per cent . An earnings yield of 6.1 per cent and 10-year yield of 2 per cent -- 2.6 per cent would imply an excess yield of 3.5 per cent to 4.1 per cent , which is above the 10-year historical average . <p> This implies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The US inflation debate remains top of mind for many investors right now . At the moment , US inflation prints ( core PCE of 3.4 per cent in May ' 21 ) are at the highest since the early 1990s , with many pondering will such hot prints will be ' transitory ' . <p> To determine our inflation outlook , we examine the core PCE inflation , the Fed 's primary measurement of inflation which excludes food and energy prices . <p> A breakdown of core PCE inflation shows that Covid-sensitive categories ( likely transitory ) have been the predominant driver of inflation ) . These are categories where either prices or quantities were significantly influenced by the pandemic . <p> In fact , over the past two months , these categories contributed to more than 75 per cent of the inflation reading . On the other hand , Covid-insensitive categories have just rebounded to their pre-pandemic rate . <p> Base effect is also a major transitory factor contributing to higher inflation prints as lower comps in 2Q/3Q resulted in a significant skew in prints . Adjusting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the core PCE ends up 30 per cent lower than reported . <p> As data suggests , a big part of inflation can indeed be attributed to transitory factors , captured by both Covid-sensitive categories and base effect . <p> We believe this pressure may gradually fade as supply constrain eases , which will take time , likely over the next 2-3 quarters as the global re-opening sequence play out . <p> However , as these factors fade , it is likely to unveil a certain level of persistent inflation , underpinned by housing-related and monetary inflation Red flags are showing up in housing-related inflation , which represents around an outsized 19 per cent of core PCE . <p> Over the past year , US median home sales price growth has skyrocketed catalysed by the combination of base effect , higher material cost , and lower mortgage rates . <p> With rising home prices often portending higher housing inflation ( former leads the latter by approximately 13 months ) , we expect housing-related inflation to bottom and turn higher soon . <p> A run-up in housing-related inflation towards pre-Covid levels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years . <p> The impending reversal in interest rate cycle <p> We expect a reversal in the interest rate cycle in late-2022 <p> Through our observations from the Fed 's meeting minutes thus far , we believe the cue for a rate hike is likely the product of 3 considerations : core PCE at 2 per cent and above ; core PCE exceeding 2 per cent for some time ; and maximum employment . <p> Our current inflation outlook -- both central and hawkish case -- implies that the first and second criteria can be met by end-2022 , leaving the Fed 's employment target as a wildcard to watch in our opinion . <p> Firstly , payroll gains will have to impress to the tune of 530,000 jobs added monthly on average to close the existing unemployment gap of an estimated nine million jobs between now and pre-pandemic trend .

Any upside to inflation risk ( our hawkish case ) can certainly bring forward rate hikes as well , even before maximum employment is achieved . <p> Thus , both our central and hawkish case points to a reversal in the interest rate cycle in late 2022 , invoking an end to the low interest rate environment . <p> For our central case , we are anticipating one rate hike around end-2022 and up to two hikes in 2023 .

And who knows , there may have been larger flowers out there , simply unmeasured . <p> So here 's a challenge - to find and measure Sabah 's largest Rafflesia flower ! <p> Both Rafflesia keithii and the smaller ( about 30cms across ) R. pricei have been found around the Kinabalu Park and in the Tenom area , while Rafflesia pricei is also found in the Rafflesia Information Centre near Tambunan . <p> Rarest of all is R. tengku-adlinii , with flowers up to 25cms in diameter . <p> And the largest leaf ? The longest leaves in the world are the fronds of Raphia palms . <p> The longest of all , is Raphia regalis from West Africa , which can grow to over an amazing 25m ( 80 ft ) ! <p> The leaf fibres were once used widely in weaving and made a wonderful biodegradable twine , before the brightly coloured plastic string that is so common in Sabah took its place . <p> Like the coconut , leaves of Raphia are divided into smaller leaflets that allow the wind to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appearance . <p> These palms do not grow in Sabah , but the largest undivided leaf in the world does . <p> This is not a palm , but a species of wild ' keladi ' or Elephant 's Ear ( Alocasia robusta ) , that grows in the Tawau area in Sabah , where the rich volcanic soil seems to breed giants ! <p> The Guinness Book of Records for 2007 records a leaf of Alocasia macrorrhizos that was measured in 1966 , as being over 3m , ( nearly 10 ft ) , in length and almost 2m , ( just over 6 ft ) , in width , with a surface area of 3.17 sq.m.

@@43507235 <h> Are water services being centralised ? <p> THE National Water Services Industry Restructuring ( NWSIR ) initiative , which began in 2003 , has been years in the making , involving long and protracted negotiations between the federal government and state governments in Peninsular Malaysia , as well as requiring amendments to the Federal Constitution . <p> Now , 18 years after the NWSIR was first mooted by the federal government , industry restructuring appears to be taking a different step -- one that has raised the ire of the Association of Water and Energy Research Malaysia ( AWER ) . To AWER , it appears that Putrajaya is attempting to centralise water services across the peninsula , a move that is against the spirit of the NWSIR and the Water Services Industry Act 2006 ( WSIA ) . <p> " Under the WSIA model , concession agreements will be phased out and state governments will form companies to manage water treatment and supply to increase transparency and efficiency , " AWER president S Piarapakaran said in a Sept 9 statement . <p> " IWK is supposed to have been broken into state-based entities and merged with water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the model that was presented to state governments and the Conference of Rulers , which was agreed upon before the amendment to the Federal Constitution . " <p> AWER was referring to the Cabinet 's approval , on Oct 21 last year , of the extension of Indah Water Konsortium Sdn Bhd 's ( IWK ) concession to Dec 31 , 2034 . <p> Given that the concession was scheduled to end on March 31 next year , it appears to signal a change in Putrajaya 's earlier intention to parcel up IWK and transfer operations to the states . <p> Indeed , the federal government 's intention to create a centralised water services company is apparent , as in March , Environment and Water Minister Datuk Seri Tuan Ibrahim Tuan Man disclosed that Putrajaya was establishing a parent water utility company that would act like Tenaga Nasional Bhd . <p> In the Tenaga model , Tenaga is the sole company that operates the national grid , which traverses the peninsula . In the water equation , a similar " grid " that traverses the peninsula does not exist , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but rarely apply to the whole region . <p> For example , Pengurusan Air Selangor Sdn Bhd caters for residents and industries in Selangor as well as the Federal Territories of Kuala Lumpur and Putrajaya , but not the whole of Peninsular Malaysia . <p> As for the Langat 2 water plant in Selangor , raw water from Pahang is treated for Klang Valley consumption . <p> Which model the national water company will adopt is still anyone 's guess . One point is clear , however , from Tuan Ibrahim 's statement in March . The national water company is set to be the umbrella company for all state-based water services companies . <p> The move towards a central water services company that houses different state-based companies has already started with the extension of IWK 's concession , although IWK has pointed out that it will continue to be a standalone entity for sewerage services . <p> " IWK has been given the mandate to operate and maintain the sewerage systems efficiently , and the extension is purely to extend the agreement period and allow IWK to explore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Edge . <p> The intention of the NWSIR is for the entire water services of each state to be merged and operated by the state but funded by the federal government . Water services are more efficient when managed from source to sewage . <p> According to AWER 's Piarapakaran , a combined water treatment , supply and sewerage system under one operator is better for managing the human consumption water cycle . This is because treated effluents from the sewerage will be released into rivers , and is a point of source pollution , he says . <p> He points out that the water treatment component needs good-quality raw water to minimise water treatment costs . At present , rivers are the normalisation ground . By merging the operations , the same company would not want to pollute the river water it uses as raw water . <p> Citing the Department of Environment 's ( DOE ) Environment Quality Report , Piarapakaran says IWK is the single-largest polluter of raw water sources , as various pollution sources have been recorded and linked to the company . <p> In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or 54% , were linked to IWK , he points out . In terms of the biochemical oxygen demand ( BOD ) load , domestic treated and partially treated sewage remained the largest contributor , with an estimated load of 944,533.8kg a day , he says . <p> In 2018 , an estimated total of 653 tonnes a day of pollution load for BOD were generated , says Piarapakaran , still quoting the DOE report . Sewerage treatment plants ( STPs ) remained the largest BOD-load contributor , with a total load of 242 tonnes a day . <p> In the same year , the overall estimate of suspended solid ( SS ) loads was 835 tonnes a day , with STPs contributing 303 tonnes a day , or the second largest after piggery activities . <p> Ammoniacal nitrogen load in 2018 was estimated to be a total of 205.3 tonnes a day , in which STPs remained the largest contributor , with a total load of 162 tonnes a day , he says . <p> " The proof is published annually by DOE and there is no way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is the reason DOE put requirements on IWK to upgrade its treatment plants . <p> " IWK will blame delays on tariff revision as a reason ( not to upgrade ) and it ends up as a chicken-and-egg situation . AWER does not see this as a chicken-and-egg situation , as IWK can follow the WSIA model to end capital drought . " <p> Nevertheless , IWK 's Narendran maintains that , as at August 2021 , the total compliance rate of IWK 's STPs stood at 97% and its sewage load continues to be below the permissible level of DOE 's performance bar for pollution sewage . <p> Moreover , IWK stresses that the country 's sewerage charges were last updated more than 27 years ago and that it has borne the burden of rising operational expenditures to ensure environmental sustainability and good public health . <p> It says that various engagements have been carried out with the relevant ministry and departments -- along with committees and the proposed tariff review , which is being held in phases and involves only minimal changes -- have been well received @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " IWK 's main challenge is to ensure that all the sewerage assets operate optimally and , at the same time , to upgrade the system and bring in new equipment . Since IWK started operating in 1993 , the tariff for sewerage services to consumers has never been reviewed , " says Narendran . <p> The average maintenance cost of the sewerage system for linked premises is RM17 a month , compared with the current tariff of between RM2 and RM8 a month , he says . Currently , domestic consumers are billed every six months . <p> IWK 's financial performance has suffered . The wholly-owned company of Minister of Finance Inc posted a net loss of RM96.35 million in the financial year ended Dec 31 , 2020 , on the back of RM741.64 million in revenue . This was almost twice the net loss of RM49.5 million recorded in the preceding financial year , despite a 2.6% year-on-year increase in revenue . In 2020 , IWK 's total assets amounted to RM1.2 billion while total liabilities stood at RM3.2 billion . Retained losses were a staggering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ STPs ? <p> According to Piarapakaran , DOE has increased the wastewater discharge standard for IWK 's treatment plants to reduce pollution loading from the sewerage system . Using the increased standard by DOE as a benchmark , IWK came up with an estimate of RM60 billion to RM80 billion needed to upgrade its STPs , he says . <p> " We believe it is much lower and , if we break IWK into state-based entities and follow the WSIA model , we can keep the capital injection low and shut down many smaller plants , as bigger plants can perform better treatment processes than smaller and non-mechanical old plants , " says Piarapakaran . <p> " This can be done using critical , sub-critical and non-critical plant categories by coming up with a matrix of energy consumption , pollution loading , capital , savings and final output parameters . Following the WSIA model and holistic forward planning towards zero waste is the key to minimising capital expenditure . " <p> Under the WSIA model , state water assets are transferred to Pengurusan Aset Air Bhd ( PAAB ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operators . PAAB funds the development and upgrading of water assets through government-guaranteed debts , which are long term . <p> The long-term tenure of the debts makes it possible for capital costs to be lowered and much lower than what the private concessionaires , in the case of Selangor , could get . At the same time , the state government , which had developed its own water services companies previously , could offload the debt to PAAB . <p> Previously , federal government loans provided funding for states that did not privatise their water services . But the states were then saddled with huge debts that ate into their revenue . <p> For example , in March , Tuan Ibrahim said the federal government had written off RM699 million worth of debt owed by the Kedah government to supply water to rural areas in the state . <p> Another RM1.12 billion of Kedah 's water infrastructure-related debts were then absorbed by PAAB . The debt was restructured for a period of 45 years , and recovered through lease charges receivable from Syarikat Air Darul Aman Sdn Bhd . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had approved a budget of RM142 million in 2020 to upgrade 644 STPs to ensure proper functionality of these plants , resulting in better compliance to discharged effluent standards . <p> Up to the 11th Malaysia Plan , RM26.5 billion had been spent for the development and upgrade of STPs nationwide . In the 12th Malaysia Plan , RM1.3 billion has been allocated to upgrade and build centralised sewage treatment facilities nationwide , says Narendran . <p> " Under the Sewage Capital Contribution fund , we are currently upgrading 644 existing STPs to meet the Environmental Quality ( Sewage ) Regulations standard . We plan to further upgrade the remaining 2,306 STPs under the Phase 2 and 3 implementations within the next five years , " he says . <p> While the jury is still out on whether establishing a national water department and national water company will be a better move in restructuring the water industry , there are quarters that question the need for such a centralised body and company .

@@43705234 <p> Hype and hypocrisy are often two sides of the same coin . The BBC and The Guardian editors should prove that they are not just being media and increasingly dogs of war in their China coverage . <p> The grand prize for the biggest media hype in recent years must go to the British-led media . Since 3 November , when the Peng Shuai story first broke , foreign readers of The Guardian and BBC have been inundated with a flood of daily articles focusing on her case and attempts to tie it with what the papers identify as associated issues such as the charges of China 's crimes against humanity , alleged genocide in Xinjiang , use of slave labour , repressive policies in Hongkong and Taiwan , and efforts to dominate the world beginning with the South China Sea . <p> Television coverage of the story with pictures of the tennis star and interviews with an array of commentators , including from the community of famous tennis players , and ' in-depth ' analyses by armchair critics have kept the story hot and alive to a larger audience . <p> To be sure , the plight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two , but what are the real reasons for making it hog and clog the national and global news coverage of these media outfits day after day over the past three weeks ? <p> The most important but not obvious objective of this story is to leverage on it and to manipulate it to deflect public attention towards their real target -- the Chinese government . And from the number of inches -- now reaching feet -- of news columns given to it , the objective of this particular sustained anti-China narrative in reaching a wide readership appears to have succeeded . <p> Confirmation of success and the invigorated role of Western media in being the handmaiden of war- mongering elements in Britain , the US and Australia can be seen in the way the Anglo Saxon-dominated governments have latched on to the Peng Shuai case to demonise further China 's record on human rights and media freedom and the Communist Party leadership . <p> Although statements by the US , the UK and Australian governments had initially demanded that China provide " verifiable evidence " of Peng Shuai 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing so , it is also clear that this campaign to tarnish China ahead of the Winter Olympics will continue whatever happens . If effective , the boycott of the winter games is intended to serve as a big body blow to Beijing 's international image . <p> Thus recent publication of photos and videos of Peng Shuai at a tennis tournament in Beijing and at a restaurant with friends and the most recent statement by the International Olympic Council president , Thomas Bach -- that she had spoken to him for 30 minutes in a video call and assured him that she is safe and well and would to like have her privacy respected -- have had no effect at all in stopping the propaganda onslaught , which the two paper 's editors must be congratulating themselves for initiating and sustaining . <h> China 's restrained response <p> The Chinese government 's response has been remarkably restrained on the Western media overkill on the Peng Shuai story . Initially noting that it was not a diplomatic matter , the latest Beijing statement called on " some people to stop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ politicise it " . <p> Notwithstanding Beijing 's calm reaction , the Western media will continue to be deeply engaged in attempts to damage China 's image at every possible opportunity . However , this propaganda war , spearheaded by what was previously regarded as more open and independent media , is not doing the international community and the domestic audience any favour or good by sensationalising and spinning stories aimed at arousing anti-China and anti-Chinese sentiments . <p> If the justification is the need for news stories to sell , there are many other international and domestic concerns that they can move on to cover .

But at least today , the anonymity that social media offers has given ordinary Malaysians the space and courage to speak ' publicly ' . <p> I remind myself often that my personal experience -- even if it includes teaching Malaysian politics and working for 30 years in a Malay-majority organisation , engaging with human rights activists and taking part in many forums over 45 years -- is still limited and not representative of the whole reality . <p> Who and what we hear and ' know ' depends on what we read , where we get our information from and who we socialise with . In my circle , I have met many more Malays who not only speak up publicly but also act on it . I have read caustic and sometimes vulgar comments on Facebook and Twitter from Malays against Malay politicians from both sides of the divide . So , it depends where we look . <p> However and undeniably , we often live in our own echo chamber and seem to be unaware of our own biases . As the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is no such thing as an unbiased position . The best we can do is own and be honest about our own filters . " <p> I believe the more we aim for a 360-degree perspective of any issue or situation , the better our understanding of it and the closer we come to the truth . <p> So , how much is ' enough ' ? It will always be ' not enough ' for some people . Yes , it is a matter of perspective ; where I stand , I see a glass either half full or half empty . But let us not ignore the facts . <p> The indomitable Ambiga Sreenevasan recently said non-Muslims must speak up when human rights are infringed . " Everybody should loudly condemn " any breach of fundamental rights . <p> Yes , majority rule in a democratic system must not be at the expense of minority rights ; minority rights must be equally protected . <p> But what is the tipping point ( if any ) or size of the critical mass needed to bring about change ? <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the University of Pennsylvania , found it only requires 25% of the relevant group to stand up for an issue to shift group norms . Simply put , " a minority group of change-makers can have a profound , powerful , and lasting impact . " <p> Wow , that 's music to my ears ! This just strengthens my belief in the ' power of one ' . <p> We actually saw evidence of this in the 2018 general election . Most Malays continued to vote for Umno and Pas , but the other Malay votes were ' enough ' -- about 25% to 30% of them voted for Pakatan Harapan in 2018 -- to bring about a major change at the ballot box , which most people did not expect or predict . <h> How long do we ' fight ' ? <p> I remind myself regularly that building a better Malaysia will always be a work in progress -- as with most things . The ' fight ' has been going on from before I got into it and will continue even after I leave . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paying a heavy personal price for it . Thank God for all those who continued the good fight from the early 1970s , many of whom did not live to see Barisan Nasional lose its two-thirds ' majority in Parliament or the Opposition govern a string of states at state level . <p> We owe them a lot . They fought for the rights of others -- even sacrificing their personal freedom and livelihoods for the majority who did not have the guts or the inclination to speak up or even show some support . <p> Over the years , I have heard many people say Malaysia is " beyond redemption " . Ironically , some of these same people have actually prospered in Malaysia ! <p> We should stand up and fight for justice , even if no one seems to be listening . Everyone lives in the real world , but we each handle the real world in different ways . <p> Yes , there are many policies that discriminate against the non-Malays . But it is not a simple , clear-cut , one-dimensional Malay versus non-Malay situation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other . <p> The rich , from all the various ethnic groups , are often able to benefit disproportionately or can choose to get out of the system or mitigate the effects of discrimination . <p> Remember , there are many Malays and other bumiputras who are unable to access the ' special privileges ' to buy a house or shares , to get contracts or to go to college . They struggle to put food on the table , even today . <p> Everyone blames the politicians , but who put the politicians there ? And how are we going to kick out the crooked politicians ? Do we ' fight ' only if or when we can ' win ' or because it is the right thing to do ? <p> So , rave and rant , gripe and groan all you want . That is your freedom of expression . <p> But aim to be fair while you are at it and do n't just stop there . People have different ways of getting involved in the ' fight ' . Not everyone can speak out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or lead a Bersih street protest like Ambiga Sreenevasan , let alone walk 5km ! <p> All we need is for people to do their part , according to their abilities , within their own circles of influence and in their own way , as there are many ways to contribute to change . <p> For example , there are Malay groups and individuals who are trying to re-educate the Muslims on the actual teachings of the Quran , emphasising justice and integrity . <p> There are people who are collaborating to expose and prevent corruption . <p> There are groups working together to forge a real ' Bangsa Malaysia ' identity . <p> I choose to support and collaborate with those who are doing so much more to bring about a better Malaysia , both from within and from outside Malaysia . Many Malaysians have been involved in that endeavour for decades , as individuals or collectively . <p> So I am cautiously optimistic with realistic expectations . While I agree wholeheartedly with political scientist Dr Johan Saravanamuttu when he says there is still hope for Malaysia 's fragile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half full , not half empty " , we should go a step further and ask , " How can I help fill the glass ?

He cited how the Court of Appeal had done so last week for Najib 's appeal in the SRC International case . <p> Last Tuesday , Shafee had requested to postpone the SRC hearing after one of his lawyers tested Covid-19 positive and Najib was a close contact . <p> The Court of Appeal rejected the request and ordered the SRC hearing to continue online or an arrest warrant will be issued against Najib immediately . <p> Hariharan today objected to Akram 's suggestion , saying it would be prejudicial to Najib . <p> " The ( SRC ) situation does not have witnesses . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the witness or the reaction of the accused .

It has no camera island , and has a matte back compared to the glossy glass backs on its smaller siblings .

It also shows the bottom of the Galaxy S22 Ultra with its stylus silo where an S Pen will sit , while it 'll also be the only one of the three devices to have a curved edge display . The Galaxy S22 Ultra is alleged to have a 6.8-inch , QHD+ AMOLED display with a 120Hz refresh rate . As for the S Pen stylus that comes with the device , it seems to be part of Samsung 's effort to incorporate S Pen support across all of their flagship smartphones . The Galaxy S22 Ultra is also seen as the new ' Note ' smartphone in their product stack , as the Galaxy Note series itself has since been discontinued . <p> These new leaked photos and video also happened just as Samsung inadvertently made live the support pages for the SM-S901U , SM-S906U @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ numbers for the Samsung Galaxy S22 , Galaxy S22 Plus and S22 Ultra respectively .

Curiously , the support pages for these phones were up on the Samsung China website , though it was later quickly taken down . <p> As for when we can expect the Galaxy S22 series to launch , well that 's still up in the air right now . While the Galaxy S21 line up was revealed in January of this year , the rumour mill seems to suggest that Samsung have delayed it to February .

@@43774233 <p> We have witnessed regular , if not annual , flash floods over the years . In fact , we were told to expect one at any time . <p> But the one we faced in Selangor last weekend and what happened in the days after , shocked the nation . It was reminiscent of the January 1971 Kuala Lumpur floods , and it seemed as if we were totally unprepared . <p> It was not the supposedly rapid response teams that took charge of serious life-and-property-saving measures on site . Instead , it was good-natured local Malaysians from all ethnic groups as well as migrants who first responded . Others responded to the various MPs in Klang , Segambut and elsewhere . <p> The national political leadership and more so , the civil service , especially the National Disaster Management Agency ( Nadma ) , appear to have failed miserably . <p> Prime ministers , chief ministers and even MPs come and go , but it is the civil service that remains to ensure that the public services in all their forms , including the rapid response teams , operate . The political bosses largely depend and follow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At least , that is what it was supposed to be . The civil service do have valid grouses but seldom stand their ground . That is how the civil service name came about . <p> The netizens ' outburst of anger , while understandable , is misplaced . It is not that the ruling politicians are not to blame . A large part of the blame still lies with the ruling politicians , in that the civil service grew mediocre a long time ago , starting in the 1980s , from the bottom up . <p> Support the struggle to build a Malaysia based on Justice , Freedom , Solidarity : <p> They failed to focus on the technical skill sets required for the development , operational management and upkeep of the drainage and irrigation apparatus -- specifically , the storm water drainage and river management systems . It is totally related . <p> They were told of the lost pumping sets and failed generators required for the operation of sluice gates at critical irrigation structures , eg Taman Sri Muda . If Nadma did not know that then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all those expensive evacuation boats bought for politicians to use ? <p> Only incompetence can be the source of the delayed response , especially as Nurul Izzah Anwar and others had warned the government of impending severe floods . Floods at these times are also a known regular annual affair . <p> Nadma , set up after the 2015 flash floods , was put under the charge of a ruling party politician . His name did not even turn up in the media in the days that followed the latest floods . He surfaced only to retort that he was still in charge -- except that the dirty work of being in charge of the Selangor floods allegedly lay with the state menteri besar . How touching ! Or should it be how awesome a job responsibility ? <p> They know no shame . A three-day delay resulted in at least 17 deaths in Selangor , now standing at 38 nationwide , with more reported missing -- plus unascertained hundreds of millions of ringgit of lost and damaged public and private property . <p> That nomination of the head of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decisions like this does not know how to do its basic job . What Nadma needs is hands-on expertise on the subject so that it can ask the right questions and follow up on the state 's preparedness measures prior to potential flood times . It should have been ready to spring rapid response teams into action on Friday , 17 December . <p> A political head with no professional operational management expertise and current mediocre technical capability support would only end up pointing fingers at anything other than himself rather than what he had failed to do . Apologies ? None forthcoming . An apology is a sign of strong character , but the political elite do not believe this . <p> Did n't we hear our PM explaining why rapid response teams could not help Taman Sri Muda residents in distress early enough . The flood victims were camped on the roof of a surau , extremely visible , but the rescue teams , in the words of Ismail Sabri Yaakob , apparently failed to locate them because the street names were submerged ! The PM trusted this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> It was left to Malaysian civil society groups and others to jump in to help , however possible , with their own resources within hours , while the nation 's valuable resources were idle for over three days . <p> The minister responsible was apparently overseas on leave -- and remained not heard of as of 23 December -- perhaps celebrating his 90% KPI rating . Sorry , I stand with the people not salaried ministers . <p> All this is something that can be resolved with a concerted effort , but only if there is the political and civil service will to do so . But that 's another story . <p> We will continue to hear more of the same , unless a professional is tasked with the job with full authority and reporting responsibility to the PM instead of a politician who would probably direct aid to his or her preferred segment of society . <p> It is exasperating for the environment and water minister to blame flood victims for not taking government warnings seriously . Really ? What did he mean ? That victims should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He stopped his brilliant piece before he could come to that bit . <p> What we have largely failed to discuss are the major structural causes of the permanent damage to the natural habitat over the last six decades . This damage has taken place in our frenzy to increase and modernise the built habitat , to meet national requirements , especially since the 1980s . In contrast , Singapore has done what we failed miserably to do . <h> Two critical issues <p> Hydrological cycle <p> This is something that future generations should be educated about and made aware of . <p> There are two critical areas ( see below ) that have failed the test of a successful cohabitation of the built habitat with the natural environment . A serious mismatch of the natural and the built habitat has upset the balance in maintaining a healthy natural habitat . <p> The hydrological cycle explains all this very well . We have allowed massive development of city and town-built habitats without a balanced approach that ensures that the natural habitat is retained close to the built habitat . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last six decades . <p> We have stressed building bigger and taller to announce our entry into first world status . One former prime minister even proclaimed Malaysia had reached first world , developed status . Wonder where he is now . <p> A more complete discussion of this will involve wider issues , ie urban planning and storm water management . We should leave this to the experts -- the urban planners and civil engineers with expertise in storm water management . <h> Critical issue no. 1 : Excessive plinth area ratio <p> The first critical issue addressed here is just one major component of existing Town Planning Act provisions within the purview of local authority building by-laws . This component provides a guide to the planned development of all built habitats . <p> The plinth area ratio is a guide for the cohabitation of the built habitat and the natural environment , by ensuring a balanced hydrological cycle ( See Figure 1 ) . <p> Whether the current standards in Uniform Building By-Laws are adequate in view of climatic change is itself in question . It is best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and not politicians , please . <p> What is lacking is lay people 's awareness of the need to comply strictly to the predetermined maximum plinth area ratios . <p> This lack of public knowledge and its associated impact on the urban water cycle has unfortunately let regulators and professionals who compromise on the guidelines off the hook . They are thus undeterred in their regulatory and professional negligence . <p> The demands of climate change require not just a tightening of these guidelines on plinth area ratios . We also need an awareness campaign through public media education and even in our children 's education curriculums . <p> Figures 1 and 2 show the hydrological cycle and the urban water cycle and the effects of high-density development in cities and other urban areas . <p> In a natural vegetation habitat like green lung areas , the rainwater runoff is just 10% and even lower in forest reserves . <p> In an urban habitat setting , the runoff increases to about 55% or much more , in my estimation , exerting tremendous stress on storm water drainage management . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retention reserves ponds in local precincts has almost killed what we planned . <p> Why public education ? Well , even home builders like most of us , especially if we can afford it , take pains and spend enormous amounts on turning the free ground areas in our own home premises into hard surfaces for many reasons , eg ease of maintenance , additional carparks and an entertainment area for outdoor parties . Such hard outdoor surfaces in our homes result in complete rainwater runoff into storm drains . <p> What are the cumulative effects of such modifications in most households and commercial spaces ? The grounds under their built habitats turn into a dead environment over just a few years . Just think about it . <p> Figure 1 will impress even clear-thinking children for the rest of their lives -- a battle of minds won ! A simple tutorial in primary school will help drive this point home for the betterment of future generations . <p> Sadly , where are the experts , some of whom are in government agencies and private practice , in educating the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The World Environment Forum made lots of noise in meetings over the past few months but paid lip service in the agreements they signed . Our minister spoke in support , but we hear Sabah is intent on working with its coal reserves . We are no different , after all , are we ? <p> The plinth area ratio basically is the ratio of the footprint of a built habitat over the development land area . The current maximum ratio permitted in building by-laws for residential or commercial areas is around 50% . This may be higher for major complexes and 70% for industrial sites . <p> But in reality , the actual built area could be much higher , if we include all ancillary structures , hard landscape and circulation tarmac areas , which escape regular scrutiny . <p> Local authorities should hang their heads in shame over this . We can only wonder how well developers and regulatory authorities comply with the stipulated plinth area ratios . <p> Kuala Lumpur City Hall has rules about on-site storage detention ( OSD ) even for new home construction , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how religiously regulators and developers comply with the stipulated ratios -- especially for major complexes -- is something that must be verified . <p> That is not an exaggeration considering the extent of the hard landscape ( roads , pavements , open and covered drains and other forms of sealed grounds , eg carparks ) . These hard surfaces actually seal the ground from absorbing rainfall . <p> Effectively , much of the city and urban land masses is dead , devoid of measures to prevent water ingress ( water penetrating into buildings from outside ) . It will shock us to find hardly any open green lung capable of directly absorbing rainfall . The saving grace is the federal hills , which unfortunately are also earmarked for development . <p> Even the Merdeka Padang ( Royal Selangor Club/former general post office ) is actually a built habitat , not a natural habitat political minds might say otherwise . Think of the underground carpark that gets flooded by any heavy rainfall-cum-floods with cars submerged at their owners ' risk ! <p> An aerial view would give us an idea of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ natural local precinct water ponding reserves is non-existent -- a critical fault . <p> If this is how cities are built -- not just in greater Kuala Lumpur , Mont Kiara , that stretch of development from Megamall/Eco City to Kuala Lumpur Sentral , Bangsar South , and Pusat Bandar Damansara but also many sections of Petaling Jaya eg Kota Damansara , and many more areas such as Penang , Johor Bahru and Seremban -- then we have a major problem . That is the trend . <p> All local area precincts seriously lack open green lungs that create a healthy open-air habitat to allow rain water to permeate into the ground . This is like not allowing the earth to breathe and live . <p> I believe Japan has put into practice innovative ideas that improve ground water permeability in existing hard landscape areas . This could improve the hydrological cycle balance in built habitats in cities and towns . Indeed , rapid solutions are available to mitigate the challenges of climate change . <p> The second critical issue is poor storm water management , which has been neglected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mediocrity in its development and operational management . <p> The Drainage and Irrigation Department has certain storm water management plans for all the major towns and cities in Malaysia , and distinct skills also prevail . But one wonders how much down-the-stream ground and operational management there is . <p> However , a critical review of it all -- in light of climate change , rising sea levels and feeder river invert level controls or desilting -- is much needed . <p> In this age of technology and software and hardware capabilities , such a review and masterplan updates should look into on-site storage detention capabilities , with strategic plans at the regional , state , district and local precinct levels . <p> This review should cover built habitats , drainage invert levels and new water storage detention -- namely , precinct-level onsite storage detention water reserves ( ponds and lakes ) -- if the latter is currently inadequate . <p> These issues put pressure on both effective design and operational management of storm water drainage . <p> It also requires a masterplan for all components of storm water drainage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any major built habitat development . <p> Fundamental to such a plan is that physics dictates that ' water finds its own level ' . Any design of a storm water drainage system must work within this parameter . <p> Where this is not possible , effective management requires the incorporation of many available options : <p> Natural water catchment areas must be retained and local precinct storm water retention ponds should be increased , where deemed necessary . This is needed due to seemingly irreversible climatic change . This could still be done . Singapore does that admirably well . It has a Gardens and Parks Department and irrigation expertise that is active and engages even relevant foreign talents . <p> In Malaysia , a reversal of the situation is the reality : we can see examples at Taman Tun Razak , Ampang and Taman Sri Muda , both in the early 1980s and potentially others ( I stand to be corrected ) , where catchment areas have been turned into largely built habitat . Blunders arise as existing green lungs ( other than the Lake Gardens ) are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inadequate development land . An example is the Federal Hills . The Kota Damansara development area too suffers from a lack of green lungs in local precincts . <p> We should have a storm water drainage masterplan at state , district and local precinct levels that considers approved development zones and plinth area ratios based on the current realities of climate change . <p> Subject to approved development zones and the masterplans , river invert levels must be dredged and maintained periodically , in line with the masterplan , due to silting from upstream development work . <p> Wherever required , tidal wave sluice gates with pumping stations and redundant standby power should be in place , as deemed necessary , for all rivers in all major cities and towns . Is it not a fact that most of our major towns expanded from river-mouth settlements ? <p> The unusually heavy rainfall is not the prime reason for the flash floods , although it is a contributory factor . The flash floods are largely the result of a high tide , rising sea levels , siltation of rivers ( higher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gates and pumping stations . <p> The net result is a sudden disastrous reversal of water flows ( known as backflow ) . This explains why we saw muddy sludge in the flood waters . Otherwise , the water from rainfall would be clear and relatively clean . The public must know this . <p> The high tide and failure of the sluice gates and pumping stations caused a rapid backflow of sea and river water along the storm water drainage system itself , instantaneously resulting in flash floods . We can judge it by the deep sludge that appeared with flash floods . <p> Having the required skills sets and expertise in the civil service is key for all the above to work effectively and to salvage our natural habitat heritage . It requires political and civil service will power to implement meritocracy in skills and management down the line . <p> We must have this in all matters that the civil service deals in , especially in development , education , health and environmental management .

Costs were high ( into the hundreds of thousands of ringgit ) , and some insisted that a certain percentage of tenants ask for it before they would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was a lot of self-learning to gain experience , which takes a long time and I made a lot of mistakes , " he reminisced . " My advice , get a mentor and learn as much you can before you start , " he said . " Mistakes can cost you a lot money and time . " <p> Eventually he bought over Kedah ICT , renamed it as email protected , and invested RM5 million ( US$1.2 milion ) of his own money into it . After building the business , in 2017 he sold it to ViewqWest , a Singaporean broadband company , for an undisclosed amount . <p> Showing customers the value of choice <p> " As an entrepreneur , I am always challenging myself to do the things that nobody has done before . " He explained that the point of iFIBER is to solve issues in the infrastructure , by leveraging existing fiber in a new way . <p> Whereas other networks like Telekom Malaysia 's high speed broadband ( HSBB ) are built on a Gigabit Passive Optical Networking ( G-PON ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AON ) and makes it an active Ethernet platform . So while changing service providers on the G-PON requires a visit from a technician to install a new customer-premises equipment ( CPE ) , iFIBER can make the change immediately through their portal . <p> However , Shaharin was quick to say that iFIBER is not in competition with other ISPs , and that the company only installs infrastructure . " Our business model is similar to a telco Tower Operator , providing tower infra sharing for mobile operators , " he clarified . <p> He 's open to any of the ISPs to ride on his network . But guess what ? It 's the more established telcos that baulk at the idea . <p> " The toughest challenge is to convince the big boys , especially existing fixed line ISPs , to join the iFIBER network , " he said , explaining the incumbents have stringent requirements before deciding whether they can join his network . " ( It is ) always a wait-and-see status . " <p> " ( But ) Things are different when we approach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ existing ISP market . " As a result , iFIBER has focused attention on them , as well as PayTV and mobile operators . <p> Regardless , he is confident the incumbents will eventually come around . " I believe as soon as iFIBER has connected 100,000 homes by the end of 2020 , TM and TIME will have no choice but to consider joining , " he said . " It is a matter of time . " <p> Update : As the target was set before the onset of the pandemic in March 2020 , Shaharin says he hit 15,000 homes connected by Dec 2020 . He has reset the 100,000 homes target to be achieved by end of 2022 in Klang Valley , Johor Bahru and Kota Kinabalu . <p> According to Shahrin , the winners are the customers . He pointed to data that showed over 70 percent of their customers choose access via their marketplace , over a dedicated service or network provider . " Customers prefer a Trivago-like marketplace where they can choose which ISP they want to subscribe to , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Implementation-wise , Shaharin is currently focused on property developers . " Property developers that have adopted our open access fiber concept for new development townships and highrises have saved millions of dollars , " he claimed . Although it was difficult for them to accept the idea at first , he managed to persuade a number of developers , including Sunway , SP Setia , Mah Sing , Tropicana and UMLand . <p> 700,000 homes in the next 5 years <p> iFIBER spent most of 2019 developing and testing its gigabit open access platforms , while simultaneously pitching the idea to developers . " We successfully secured and built two pilot Gigabit City projects in Cyberjaya and Johor Bahru . " As of June 2020 , iFIBER is supplying access to 127 high-rise buildings , and 16,190 units . " We anticipate we will start to generate revenue from line rental fees from Q3 2020 . " <p> Shaharin also said he believes that the pandemic made consumers more aware . " I think Covid-19 validated the need for good fixed line connectivity , " he said , pointing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " All this has created a demand for faster internet . " <p> Shaharin also has an eye on the next round of the National Fiberization &amp; Connectivity Plan ( NFCP ) , where the government is offering matching funds to construct fiber infrastructure . " iFIBER is participating in NFCP3 tender , " he said . " We are targeting 20% , about 700,000 homes , over the next 5 years . " <p> " Now we have a big task ahead of us , " he confided . He has to somehow convince stakeholders that his solution of choice is one that makes sense . " How do we educate the customers ? " <p> Regardless of where he will eventually end up , Shaharin knows he 's going to enjoy the ride . To him , it 's showing people the light , and when they do understand his proposition , he feels it 's a worthy breakthrough . " It feels like victory to me ! "

Covid-19 served as a dramatic test case , rewarding companies that built up their capabilities ahead of time and exposing the institutional inertia of those that did not . <p> " Our predictive analytics equips executives with intelligence to not just recover from the recent economic blow , but better respond to tomorrow 's disruptions -- like Omicron -- with lessons on how not just to survive , but thrive , in the future " explains Professor Howard Yu ( pic , left ) , author of the Future Readiness Indicator at IMD . <p> China beat the rest of Asia with most ( 7 ) companies in the global ranking with Geely ( 9th ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , Ping An ( 7th ) , Alibaba Group ( 8th ) , Tencent ( 11th ) , Xiaomi ( 14th ) .

TSMC is the only Taiwanese company that made it into the ranking at 21st out of 29 companies in Technology , while for Singapore , DBS ( 17th ) in Financial Services was its flag bearer . <p> On the US dominance of the rankings , Yu explains " The research shows that there is much convergence across industries , and that means the digital ecosystem and intellectual capital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proximity , companies in the US get exposed to the Silicon Valley tech giants , and the vibrancy of VC capital and its sophistication also helps . Executives from corporate America are more aware of the need for change and are therefore closer to the talent pool . Because what we measure is a balanced composite score , you need to have a balanced portfolio from a strong financial balance sheet for substantial innovative momentum . From this regard , US companies overall remain highly competitive , which reflects in their dominance of the ranking results . " <p> In the Technology sector , Google ranked the highest overall for future readiness , with Amazon coming second and Microsoft third . Sony ranked last out of 28 companies , and Dell ranked 27th . <p> Some other surprising positions in the list include Apple , which landed at 9th place , some way behind the top three and Facebook , AMD , NVIDIA , Netflix , and Alibaba ( in places 4 through 8 ) .

This is what distinguishes companies that scale from those that do n't . <p> Digitising is essential to future-readiness , though the concept has different meanings in different industries . Top sportswear brands involve comprehensive behind-the-scenes automation of their entire supply chain . For luxury brands , digitising means using advanced data analytics to shape relationships with their high-end customers . For the top financial services companies , it means AI-driven applications and APIs .

When companies lack the talent or technology they need , executives of top-ranking companies are confident and curious enough to learn from their competitors . Mastercard and Visa have been willing to open their infrastructures to Google , Paypal , and other tech companies . Automakers without software expertise collaborate with electronics designers from the gaming , entertainment , and programming sectors . <p> A big part of successful reinvention is drawing on knowledge from other sectors .

LVMH and Burberry , respectively low-ranking and high-ranking in digital savviness , are the two fashion/retail brands that rank highest in positive sentiment .

The average price for 2017 is also expected to be slightly higher , at above RM2,600 a tonne . <p> Despite the upbeat prospects for palm oil , several analysts surveyed maintain their " neutral " call on the sector as they have adopted a cautious stance . <p> Leading industry analyst James Fry , in an article quoted by Reuters , said global palm production would rise in the second half of 2017 by over two million tonnes from the same period of 2016 . <p> Fry also said : " MPOB ( Malaysian Palm Oil Board ) stocks would settle at 1.75 million to 1.8 million tonnes in October to December , and will then fall back until they soar from the second quarter of 2017 . " <p> Last Wednesday , MPOB reported that Malaysia 's palm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rose 5.18% to 1.66 million tonnes in November from 1.57 million tonnes in October as exports fell . <p> CIMB Investment Bank Bhd equity research head Ivy Ng said the El Nino effect that reduced production from 2015 onwards is expected to fade in 2017 . <p> " The outlook for 2017 is decent with CPO ( crude palm oil ) price expected to be high till the first quarter next year but it could go lower later due to higher production , " Ng said . <p> In a Dec 8 note , Ng said CPO prices could also benefit from factors including the fall in palm oil supply from the 2015 El Nino , higher usage of biodiesel in Indonesia , a La Nina event that could impact soybean supplies , high biodiesel mandates in the US and Indonesia , and higher crude oil prices . <p> " So , while prices would be lower due to production , earnings would be higher .

He expects recovery in fresh fruit bunch production to be neutralised by insipid growth in average selling price . <p> " We expect a year-on-year ( y-o-y ) growth of 12.4% in view of the low base in 2016 . The downside risks include prolonged dry spell effect of El Nino , stagnant growth in market demand and labour issue , " he said . <p> In the meantime , Low said the stronger US dollar against the ringgit would have a transient positive effect for the average selling price because prices are relatively cheaper for foreign buyers . <p> Affin Hwang Investment Bank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ production in 2017 in Malaysia and Indonesia might cause CPO to become unsustainable . <p> " We opine that CPO prices have remained high for the past few weeks due to concerns over tightness of supplies as well as weakness in the ringgit . We are forecasting CPO average selling price at RM2,400 per tonne for 2017 . The volatility of the forex ( foreign exchange ) does affect trading , " she told The Edge Financial Daily via email . <p> On risks , she said renewed weakness in the global economy could affect demand apart from unfavourable policies ( changes in biofuel mandates ) , major disruption in harvesting due to extremely bad weather conditions and competition from other vegetable oils . <p> MIDF Amanah Investment Bank Bhd research analyst Alan Lim ( pic ) , who in contrast has placed a " positive " rating on the sector , expects 2017 to be a " year of two halves " . <p> " The first half ( 1H17 ) would be dominated by ongoing low stockpiles at well below two million tonnes , and the second half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indonesia . For 1H17 , we expect CPO price to stay at the higher range of RM2,800 to RM3,300 per tonne . <p> " As for 2H17 , the strong production recovery should limit CPO price upside but we see the downside to be well supported at RM2,300 per tonne . If Indonesia biodiesel industry continues its excellence in absorbing the additional supply , we may see the higher downside at RM2,500 per tonne , " he told The Edge Financial Daily via email . <p> Lim said output growth for 2016 would decline by about 13% y-o-y to 17.4 million per tonne while 2017 production growth is expected to climb 11% to 19.3 million per tonne , assuming the weather remains normal in December 2016 and throughout 2017 . <p> " We maintain our positive view on the sector as we continue to believe that CPO price will stay strong at above RM2,800 per tonne all the way to June 2017 .

If Malaysia 's GDP had remained the same as in 2019 instead of contracting 5.6% in 2020 , the debt-to-GDP ratio would have been 58.2% . <p> Yet , the Ministry of Finance ( MoF ) says the 60% statutory debt limit has not been breached , although it acknowledges that direct federal government debt stood at RM879.6 billion or 62.2% of GDP at end-2020 . <p> " Statutory debt , which comprises outstanding Malaysian Government Securities ( MGS ) , Malaysian Government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( MITB ) , stood at 58% of GDP , still below the 60% limit , " the MoF said in its report on Malaysia 's economy for the fourth quarter of 2020 . <p> The comparative figure for the headline 58% used by the MoF is 48.7% at end-2019 and 47.4% at end-2018 , according to data appended in the report . <p> " As such , the government still has the fiscal space to continue helping the rakyat , support businesses and strengthen the Malaysian economy , InsyaAllah God willing , " says the latest Laksana report dated Feb 18 . <p> The confusion arises because the " usual " figure used when referring to Malaysia 's debt-to-GDP ratio is direct federal government debt , which was 62.2% of GDP at end-2020 and 52.5% at end-2019 . Put another way , the MoF appears to have redefined what is counted under the statutory debt limit . The difference between the MoF 's 58% of GDP and the " usual " figure of 62.2% of GDP is around RM58.8 billion , our back-of-the-envelope calculations show . <p> It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government does not include some short-term borrowings or conventional treasury bills , to " bridge " immediate cash flow shortfalls arising from a mismatch in the timing of the government 's revenue receipts and a sudden rise in cash disbursement needs .

This could not be officially confirmed at the time of writing , but the amount is separate from LPPSA debt that is directly guaranteed by the federal government , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 4Q2020 GDP report , it would seem that the 58% headline figure used by the MoF does not include offshore borrowings or foreign currency debt , which stood at RM28.28 billion or about 2% of GDP at end-2020 . Debt in foreign currencies is capped at RM35 billion under the External Loans Act 1963 . <p> Apart from the RM879.56 billion ( 62.2% of GDP ) in direct federal government debt at end-2020 , debt directly guaranteed by the federal government stood at RM294.68 billion ( 20.8% of GDP ) , central bank data show . Collectively , these direct debt and debt guarantees constitute RM1.17 trillion or 83% of GDP at end-2020 , our calculations show . This is up from RM1.07 trillion at end-2019 ( 70.7% of GDP ) when direct federal government debt stood at RM793 billion ( 52.5% of GDP ) and debt directly guaranteed by the federal government was at RM275.38 billion ( 18.2% of GDP ) . The total for 2020 would have been 77.7% of GDP had Malaysia 's nominal GDP remained the same as in 2019 instead of contracting . <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that 2% of GDP debt headroom -- the difference between the MoF 's headline 58% and 60% statutory debt ceiling -- translates into between RM28.3 billion and RM30.2 billion , if one were to consider both Malaysia 's nominal GDP of RM1.42 trillion for 2020 and RM1.51 trillion for 2019 . <p> The government is also benefiting from higher oil prices , with Brent crude oil hovering above US$62 per barrel at the time of writing , 48% higher than the US$42 a barrel assumed in Budget 2021 . Every US$1 increase is said to add RM300 million to the government 's coffers . <p> For comparison , the RM15 billion Permai assistance package announced on Jan 18 , for instance , only involved a direct fiscal injection of RM6.6 billion -- a move that does not change the 5.4% fiscal deficit forecast for 2021 . Excluding the RM17.1 billion allocated to the Covid-19 Fund under the RM322.5 billion Budget 2021 , the stimulus packages announced in 2020 totalling RM305 billion involved only a direct fiscal injection of RM55 billion . <h> GDP growth rate matters <p> Still , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government debt that was already near 60% of GDP last June , some economists had expected the government to further raise the temporary statutory debt ceiling from the current 60% to 65% to have more headroom . <p> It is not immediately known why the government chose to redefine what constitutes as statutory debt instead of temporarily raising the debt ceiling further to 65% of GDP . Last November , Finance Minister Tengku Datuk Seri Zafrul Abdul Aziz did not rule out the possibility of the statutory debt ceiling being raised again , should the need arise . <p> In a Jan 22 interview with Bloomberg , however , he said the government had no plans to raise the debt ceiling at the moment . " If we look at where the debt level is today , we will continue to forecast that our debt level will be below the 60% debt ceiling that we set earlier on .

@@52726238 <h> Condivergence : Paradigms , policies and strategy <p> When I was learning the craft of central banking , the focus was all about formulating policy -- monetary , financial stability , fiscal , consumer , competition and so on . The word " strategy " -- how to achieve a satisfactory outcome in policy objectives -- was hardly used or mentioned at all . <p> Of course , any policy or strategy will depend essentially on your paradigm , the world view that comprises your experience , perspectives , values , and essential likes and dislikes . Most of us think we are open , objective and unbiased , but our paradigm shapes the way we make decisions , which is why groupthink ( everybody must think alike ) makes bureaucratic behaviour predictable to your competitors . <p> Systems thinker Donella Meadows observed in her book The Global Citizen ( 2000 ) : " Your paradigm is so intrinsic to your mental process that you are hardly aware of its existence , until you try to communicate with someone with a different paradigm . " <p> In their book The Art of Strategy , game theorists Avinash Dixit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ art of outdoing an adversary , knowing that the adversary is trying to do the same to you . " <p> They added , " It is also the art of finding ways to cooperate , even when others are motivated by self-interest , not benevolence . It is the art of convincing others , and even yourself , to do what you say . It is the art of interpreting and revealing information . It is the art of putting yourself in others ' shoes so as to predict and influence what they will do . " <p> In essence , we need to read the paradigm and strategy in our adversary 's head , whether we are an individual , business or state . Competition under uncertainty is why strategy is much more important than policy . <p> The US-China rivalry puts strategy centre stage in the competition , cooperation and confrontation game . You can see the Americans and Chinese poring over each other 's policy and strategy documents to figure out how the other side thinks , and will react , to changes in each other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complex because we are dealing with multiple players , in which minor events can blow up to change the whole direction of the game . <p> This has happened time and again in history . In World War I , the assassination of Austrian Archduke Franz Ferdinand by a Serbian nationalist sparked the war between the European powers . Germany was not ready to take on Russia , Britain and France at the same time . And when the Americans entered the war , the game was over . What no one understood was that WWI led to Germany 's defeat , but also ended with the Russian Revolution , creating the conditions for WWII . <p> The Big Picture ( the environment ) creates small events that change the Big Picture in an unending cycle of history . <p> Who would have predicted in 2019 that the coronavirus would create a worldwide pandemic and global recession ? Science has enabled a rapid response through the discovery of vaccines , but the coronavirus is mutating as fast , to upset prospects for a sharp recovery in , at least , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longer about health policy , but a strategy of controlling the virus , and the ability to execute that strategy effectively . <p> We therefore need strategy for matters pertaining to the military , politics , business and daily life . <p> Underdogs have to use their wits to outfox superior rivals who are smarter , stronger , faster and/or better endowed . They win through bluff , deceit , ruses , tricks , allies or action that confuse the opposition . When the opponents hesitate , the strategist acts with speed , nimbleness and decisiveness before the other side even guesses what is going on . <p> But the game theory is complicated because not only are you reading your opponent , but he is also reading you . Hence , the Chinese strategist Sunzi is explicit in reminding everyone to " know oneself " . If you are blind to your own weaknesses and biases , and your opponent knows them , you will be attacked and be put on the defensive . <p> Policies tend to be static , with broad goals or aspirations . Strategies are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advance , and to react quickly in the light of rapidly changing conditions . <p> Strategy is therefore the game plan to achieve overall goals , and policies are sub-goals for different departments or organisations to implement . Institutions or organisations are executing agencies which use projects , processes and programmes to achieve the policy objectives . Thus , the inability to deliver is not just paradigm , policy or strategy failures , but execution failure or weaknesses . <p> My own experience working in domestic and international institutions taught me that we must always reflect on whether our basic policies are working or not , and why not . The free market model , embodied in the Washington Consensus that democracy , free markets and rule of law were the correct paths to national development , argued for following best practices . <p> In other words , if you followed the ideal market system , basically the US or British model of parliamentary democracy , transparency and free press , independent institutions , and adopted international standards , then every country could become like the US , the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Not necessarily . This strategy of " follow the leader " suggests that the " rest " can become the " best " by copying the West . But what happens when the " best " stumbles ? Will the " rest " go down with the " best " ? <p> As behavioural economist Daniel Kahneman observed in his book Thinking Fast and Slow , " we are blind to the obvious , and we are also blind to our blindness " . <p> This policy blindness is clearly seen in the current global liquidity trap . A domestic liquidity trap was first identified by the British economist John Maynard Keynes , who observed that there was ample liquidity and savings in Britain and the US in the 1930s , but their economies kept getting into deflation with huge unemployment . <p> His General Theory of Employment , Interest and Money ( 1936 ) was the first coherent framework to look at why an economy could get into a liquidity trap . The classical economists argued that since aggregate demand is by definition equal to aggregate supply , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pointed out that economic behaviour was ruled by dynamic expectations . If savers expect conditions to get worse , they will not spend or invest , so hoarding liquidity creates the liquidity trap . The classical economists argued for fiscal balance , a return to the gold standard , and everything would be back to normal . <p> Keynes broke this " free market equilibrium " mode of thinking by pushing for governments to intervene through the creation of a growth cycle . Create jobs , then people will spend and the economy will get out of the trap . <p> Keynes was correct and the world got out of the 1930s Great Depression through government spending , but it got out of hand from war spending . After the US overspent on the 1970s Vietnam War , inflation got out of hand , and the neoclassical Chicago School pushed aside Keynesian economics and argued for free markets . As US President Reagan famously said in 1981 , " Government is not the solution to our problem , government is the problem . " <p> This intellectual tilt to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Monetarism -- meaning if governments stick to fiscal discipline and central banks keep money supply to " fine-tune " financial markets and prices , all will be well -- claimed credit for nearly 40 years of " Great Moderation " , in which there was good growth and almost no inflation . But in practice , there were three financial crises -- the 1980s Latin American debt crisis , 1998 Asian financial crisis and the 2008 American sub-prime/European debt crisis -- each larger than the other in scale . <p> Just as excessive use of fiscal policy ruined Keynesianism , excessive use of monetary policy has now punctured monetarism . We have arrived at another global liquidity trap in which excessive use of loose monetary policy through central bank liquidity expansion ( quantitative easing or QE ) has generated very short-term liquidity , but low growth , low inflation and rising income and wealth inequalities . <p> Who needs strategy when after 2008 , politicians discovered that they could have their cake and eat it ? Politicians need not take any painful structural adjustments , such as raising taxes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of any liquidity stresses . The rich loved loose monetary policy because it boosted short-term asset bubbles . The middle class became more and more upset that their wages got eroded and they seemed to be losing out in both income and wealth and , now , access to health . <p> Policies , strategies and paradigm have to change when the context has changed through technology , financialisation , climate warming and politics . <p> The global liquidity trap manifests itself in lots of short-term liquidity at near-zero interest rates , and short-term financial markets at record highs , but there is a UN Sustainable Development Goal financing gap for long-term investments of roughly US$2.5 trillion a year to 2030 . Indeed , the Asian Development Bank has warned that Asia will need to invest US$1.7 trillion annually in infrastructure until 2030 . In short , everyone is borrowing short and few invest long . <p> You would have thought that as Asia is a high-growth , high-savings region -- with high foreign exchange reserves and a young population -- its infrastructure needs should be met easily . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the excess liquidity and channel this to long-term funding ? <p> In short , what is wrong with Asian financial policy or strategy ? After all , the region maintains good fiscal and financial discipline with strong macro-prudential regulation relative to the rest of the world . <p> The unfortunate answer is that Asian savings are financing more and more the US as the biggest borrower , and less and less Asia 's own requirements . Based on International Monetary Fund data , the US ran a net liability to the rest of world ( net of foreign assets held ) of US$14.1 trillion or 67% of GDP , with roughly three-quarters funded by the net surplus foreign positions of Japan , South Korea , China , Taiwan , Hong Kong and Singapore . <p> Is this situation , where the banker consumes much of the surplus savings in the world , sustainable ? <p> Asian financial policymakers should therefore review not just their prudent policies , but ask whether their current strategy is still viable in a world of growing risks and uncertainties . Surely , it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not only growing the fastest but is also the factory and growth engine of the world . <p> Indeed , experienced project lenders in Hong Kong and Singapore complain about a shortage of " bankable projects " , with " too much money chasing too few good projects " . We are not short of funds , and yet there is no pipeline of good projects on hand to finance and implement . <p> The reason for this project shortage is not lack of funds , but lack of implementation capacity . Post-Covid 19 , we need to upgrade our health facilities , focus on education and job reskilling , tackle urgent zero-carbon targets , improve digital access and boost energy efficiency using non-fossil fuels . This is a public sector capacity problem because the private sector does not have the data nor access to help design these large , complex projects . <p> The obvious blind spot is that the best blueprints , plans or policies are useless if you do not have the design-manage-operate and implementation capacity . We have relied too much on macroeconomists , MBAs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk very elegantly at a high level , but can not put their plans into action on the ground . We need real engineers with real-life experience in executing large-scale projects to lead this important work to provide jobs and get good green infrastructure going .

Through June 13 , food and beverage establishments will be limited to take-away and delivery only . The measures are similar to those from last year 's so-called circuit breaker , so most places have experience this time around . The question for many of the city 's upscale establishments was whether to follow last year 's trend toward comfort food , or to appeal to the population of high-income and wealthy people in Singapore who might still cling to a more elevated experience . <p> Many restaurants have embraced simplicity and are offering dishes that were popular during last year 's circuit breaker .

Odette , a three-star Michelin establishment and currently No. 2 in Asia 's 50 Best Restaurants , is sticking largely to the dishes it created when restaurants shut in the middle of 2020 . It has a slightly expanded food selection for this round , including a S$98 ( $74 ) Kampot pepper crusted pigeon and a S$118 honey-glazed Burgaud duck with apples and miso jus from chef-owner Julien Royer . Bestsellers include the dark chocolate cake Le Balinais . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pastries , as they make for great gifting options , especially with us having to celebrate special occasions from afar , " says general manager Steven Mason . <p> The Michelin-starred Nouri , meanwhile , has pivoted to a new , more informal specialty . The S$48 " perfection burger , " served with nori fries and a milkshake , is a contrast to the S$210 multicourse dining-in menu made up of dishes like pigeon marmalade -- fire-grilled Brittany pigeon with mole and cacao nibs . <p> Ivan Brehm , Nouri 's chef and owner , says it 's hard to figure out exactly what people want because this break is scheduled to be only a few weeks long . In addition to the burger and other , more fast-casual-style meals , he 's offering a weekly delivery of farm-to-table vegetables . <p> " There is a definite preference for things that are less complicated .

The developer has an US$83.5 million coupon due Thursday , with a 30-day grace period to make the payment . <p> There 's no indication that regulators offered financial support to Evergrande for the bond payment , and it 's unclear whether officials believe the company should eventually impose losses on offshore creditors . Policy makers are trying to learn more about who holds Evergrande 's bonds , the person said , asking not to be identified discussing sensitive information . <p> A lack of clear public communication from senior Chinese leaders on Evergrande has left the company 's fate shrouded in uncertainty . Dow Jones reported @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enterprises to step in only at the last minute should Evergrande fail to manage its affairs in an orderly fashion . Authorities have signalled a reluctance to bail out the developer , according to Dow Jones , which cited officials familiar with the discussions . <p> Fears of an Evergrande failure have caused a sharp rise in borrowing costs for other junk-rated Chinese developers and cast doubt on the health of some smaller Chinese banks .

Offshore bondholders are widely seen as near the bottom of Beijing 's priority list of Evergrande creditors , though that assessment may depend in part on how worried authorities become about Chinese companies ' access to dollar funding .

@@62775237 <h> Toyota Launches The 2021 Corolla Cross - 2 Variants From RM124k <p> Through the newly launched Corolla Cross , UMW Toyota Malaysia has finally plugged up a gaping chasm in their arsenal of vehicles offered here , but just because this newest model to join their line-up has arrived , its success is far from guaranteed . <p> That said , from what we know so far about the compact SUV , it does come into the ring ready to fight . With prices starting at RM124,000 ( on-the-road without insurance ) , the Corolla Cross is simultaneously a rival to other C-segment class contenders like the Mazda CX-30 , Subaru XV , and Peugeot 3008 , but also the larger varieties of B-segmenters like the Honda HR-V . <p> 2021 Toyota Corolla Cross 1.8G - Automatic - RM123,240.60 <p> 2021 Toyota Corolla Cross 1.8V - Automatic - RM133,240.60 <p> Visually , it does n't take too many cues from the E210 12th-generation Corolla sedan , so despite the derivative relation , it could be perceived more independently as a standalone product . If anything , it resembles the handsome RAV4 most evidently among the other members of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are most notably the shared TNGA ( GA-C ) underpinnings as well as that 1.8-litre naturally aspirated 2ZR-FE engine . <p> Even dimensionally , the two models do n't correspond so neatly . Surprisingly , its the four-door sedan that 's longer overall ( by 170mm ) and has a longer wheelbase ( by 60mm ) . However , the Cross is taller by 185mm and has 33mm more ground clearance . <p> Power and torque are equal here at 139PS and 172Nm , which should match up to fairly identical pace on the road given very similar kerb weights between the sedan and Cross . Drive is sent to the front wheels exclusively via a CVT , though manual override is available through 7 preset ratios . <p> At launch , UMW Toyota presents two variants starting with the 1.8G and more fully equipped 1.8V at RM134,000 ( OTR without insurance ) . For the moment , both are fully imported but locally assembled units are confirmed to appear by the end of 2021 . <p> Between the duo , only a few items worth mentioning set them apart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 1.8G receiving smaller 17-inch alloys on Bridgestone tyres . Meanwhile , larger 18-inch dual-tone ones are fitted to the 1.8V along with Michelin tyres for good measure . <p> Besides that , the entry-level G also misses out on those much nicer LED headlights and ' Light Curtain ' type daytime running lights , having to make do with decidedly lower-rent looking halogen projectors and DRL bulbs instead . <p> Inside , both variants get a black interior with standard leather seats , though only the driver receives electric power adjustment . It 's no Lexus UX but there 's still an air of the ' upmarket ' when sat in either of the Corolla Crosses . The dashboard , control layout , and general ergonomics are , again , a dead ringer for the Corolla sedan . <p> The 9-inch infotainment screen is a particularly impressive bit of kit given the sharpness of the LCD touchscreen panel and the responsiveness of the interface itself , which is also quite intuitive to use . Aside from the USB and Bluetooth audio support , smartphone connectivity is provided via Apple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that stood out , though . It would have been nice for a more sophisticated climate control solution , but it 's a single-zone only for either the G or V , but at least there are rear air conditioning vents . Also , those looking to impress their friends with fancy graphics on their digital instrument display might be disappointed to discover a more old-school analogue cluster . Personally , we prefer the latter . <p> There are 7 airbags , anti-lock brakes , and stability control . As you 'd expect , Asean NCAP has given the Corolla Cross a 5-star safety rating . That said , one area where the Corolla Cross went above and beyond was in regard to active safety features . Typical practice for most mass-market automakers is to provide active safety ( and/or driver aid ) functions to upsell their most expensive variant , leaving the lesser specified ones empty handed . <p> Here , even the 1.8G receives a very impressive 360-degree around-view monitor with 3D perspective augmentation , Blind Spot Monitoring , and Rear Cross Traffic Alert as standard . Upgrade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suite can be enjoyed , adding such things as Pre-Collision ( AEB ) , Lane Departure Warning , Lane Tracing Assist , and Dynamic Cruise Control , among others . <p> The more comprehensive list of safety features , clearly , is where the bulk of the 1.8V 's extra RM10k asking price was spent . <p> Against its class competitors , the Corolla Cross ' practicality and credentials make it a rival most worthy . Rear passengers get ample leg and headroom with a bench that 's also reclinable by 6-degrees and folds down in a 60:40 split , behind which is a commodious 440-litre boot with a convenient kick-operated tailgate as standard . <p> Right now , there 's no telling how exactly the buying public will respond to this new contender in an already packed SUV marketplace with so many good options . It very convincingly ticks all the boxes , but may lack that unique X-factor to seal the deal . The Corolla Cross certainly might be UMW 's best - albeit late - foot forward , but is it Toyota 's ? <p> There 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's a liability , it 's a tool ; but it can also be a source of joy , pride , inspiration and passion . It 's much like clothes versus fashion . And like the latter , the pursuit of perfection never ends .
