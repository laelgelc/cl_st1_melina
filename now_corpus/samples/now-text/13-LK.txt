President Mahinda Rajapaksa at the 68th Session of the United Nations General Assembly , New York on September 24 , 2013 <p> Mr. President , <p> Excellencies , <p> Ladies and Gentlemen , <p> At the outset , I offer my condolences to the families whose loved ones died as a result of a terrorist attack in a shopping mall in Kenya . Having suffered from many terrrorist attacks , for nearly three decades , we Sri Lankans condemn this cowardly act . <p> Mr. President , <p> The UN has consistently ensured cooperation between States , and provided a universal platform for discussions on a range of issues , contentious or otherwise . It is imperative that we jealously protect and abide by , the principle of equal treatment of countries , which has been the very basis of this global organization . Be it economic or political issues , equality must form the bedrock of all international interaction . <p> Reflecting on the work of the UN , matters of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affect the under-privileged and marginalized , who dominate world society . The commitment to the Millennium Development Goals ( MDGs ) brought a real sense of optimism . The theme for this session is timely , as progress in MDGs could be evaluated with its deadline fast approaching . <p> Appreciable progress has been made in the MDGs , with the results being uneven among and within countries . According to World Bank projections , by 2015 , Sub Saharan Africa and Southern Asia will be home to approximately 40% of the developing world 's population , living in extreme poverty . This only diminishes the sense of our optimism . It is fitting for the UN system to examine the causes for the failure in improving the lot of the deprived . <p> In the context of Sri Lanka , my vision has been to distribute the benefits of growth across all segments of the population and prevent inequalities , social exclusion and adverse environmental effects . Socio-economic achievements in my country are the results of people centric government policies . <p> Mr. President , <p> Despite contending with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the 2004 tsunami and the global food , energy and financial crises , Sri Lanka 's attaining the MDGs is salutary . Statistics speak for themselves . Sri Lanka was ranked 92nd out of 187 countries in the Human Development Index in 2012 . Absolute poverty in Sri Lanka declined to 6.5% in 2012 from 15.2% , over a period of five years , surpassing the MDG mid- term target . <p> The goal of universal primary education will be easily achieved by 2015 . The key dividend from this strong educational infrastructure has been a drastic reduction in the unemployment level . Sri Lanka 's accomplishments in healthcare include the infant mortality rate of 9.4 per 1000 live births , highlighted by UNICEF as a success story . <p> The early recognition of the crucial role women play in political and socio-economic development amply warrants Sri Lanka 's sense of pride with the world has first elected woman Prime Minister , the late Mrs. Sirimavo Bandaranaike . Sri Lanka has been rated 16th in the world Gender Parity Index . <p> Mr. President , <p> Sri Lanka has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the forefront of advocating internationally the interests of youth . Sri Lanka will be hosting the Commonwealth Youth Forum 2013 , this November and the UN World Conference on Youth in May 2014 . <p> I take this opportunity to extend an invitation to you all to join in celebrating youth at the World Conference . I also call upon the United Nations to declare an International Skills day as recognition of skills development of youth , <p> paving the way for reduced poverty . An innovative development has been the establishment of a Youth Parliament to sharpen the awareness of democracy and skills of the new generation and prepare them to assume leadership . <p> It is of the foremost importance that Member states decide individually the means for achieving these MDGs . The unique socio-cultural practices and traditions of countries should be taken into account when designing these processes . <p> Mr. President , <p> The post 2015 Development Agenda needs to be an intergovernmental process , in line with the outcomes and agreed principles of Rio + 20 . Centuries of growth in advanced economies have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their growth . The thin lines of balancing economic development and protection of the environment will remain a great challenge , in future development policy setting . It is therefore critical that developed countries honor their commitments and compensate damage to the environment , based on common but differentiated responsibilities . <p> Eradication of poverty must be the primary goal of the post 2015 Development Agenda , and promote accelerated economic growth in developing countries . Ensuring sustainable growth with social equity , demands a balanced approach towards development . High rates of investment , strengthening the quality of human capital , and technology transfers are crucial for sustainable growth . <p> Mr. President , <p> The mechanisms on financing and technology mandated by Rio + 20 , need to be urgently implemented . The sustainable development financing strategy in its formulation , must seek to provide for enhanced predictable financial support to developing countries . Sri Lanka supports the establishment of a Technology Facilitation Mechanism under the UN , recommended in the UNSG 's report . The mighty advocates of the rights based approaches , should also honor their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reforms in the current international financial institutions continue to be relevant . Their ad-hoc policies prove to be untenable in the long run . It is imperative for the international monetary and financial institutions , to give expression to the solid voice of the developing world . Also , those countries that are economically blessed must shed their practices of leveraging through these institutions . A comprehensive structural reform of the existing imperfect global economic order needs to be fully addressed to reflect current realities . <p> The world is in need of a fair international economic system to revitalize partnerships for development . This includes State and non-State actors and blue-chip companies , emerging as new partners . Moreover , South-South Cooperation is crucial due to the shift in economic power , which should be actively promoted to complement North-South Cooperation . <p> Mr. President , <p> It is disturbing to observe the growing trend in the international arena , of interference by some , in the internal matters of developing countries , in the guise of security , and guardians of human rights . Therefore , we continue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and forcing political change accompanied by turmoil . <p> It is timely to contemplate whether such movements have led to better stability in these countries , or produced different results , due to inappropriate external factors . In fact , the positive outcomes envisaged by those responsible have not come to pass , but indeed contributed to making those countries unstable . Does this not erode the authority of the Security Council because of unilateral or group actions ? <p> This trend needs to be arrested , as it has now extended into areas , detrimental to the well-being of populations . This turmoil results from attempts to impose a type of democracy , upon countries with significantly different cultures , values and history . The world needs no policing by a few States , particularly when the UN is mandated to ensure international security , through multi-lateral engagement . This engagement , to be complete in our time must ensure protection of the human race against the flagrant abuse of modern science in such forms as nuclear and chemical weapons . <p> Mr. President , <p> Deepening uncertainties in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Israel to co-exist on the basis of pre - 1967 borders .

Sri Lanka continues to demonstrate solidarity with the African people , in their pursuit of further socio-economic growth . <p> Mr. President , <p> Unilateral measures such as embargoes and economic sanctions , imposed on countries are disturbing . Such initiatives bring suffering not only to those specifically targeted but also to a wide range of humanity without any justification . Yet again , I stand in support of the people of Cuba in overcoming economic hardships and full access to economic opportunity . <p> Mr. President , <p> Permit me to consider briefly the post-conflict developments in my own country . I am proud that Sri Lanka has eradicated separatist terrorism , spanning three decades , and is in the process of addressing the issues of development and reconciliation . Sri Lanka 's government , at all times responsive to the priorities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ required for meaningful progress in these fields . <p> A significant event in this regard is the opportunity , which the people of the Northern Province enjoyed at the elections , held three days ago , to elect their representatives in the Provincial Council . It is a matter of legitimate satisfaction to me that this was made possible after the lapse of almost a quarter of a century . There can be no doubt regarding the crucial importance of this measure in the context of political empowerment and reconciliation . It is clearly the responsibility of the international community to assist with these efforts and to ensure their success for the benefit of all the people of Sri Lanka . <p> Mr. President , <p> In spite of the visible progress made , and consistent engagement with UN mechanisms , many countries are surprised at the disproportionate emphasis on Sri Lanka , and the unequal treatment through the multi-lateral framework . The basis for this relentless pursuit is also questioned . It is my conviction that the UN system should be astute to ensure the consistency of standards applied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the UN System by interested parties to fulfill their agendas . <p> By nature , human beings have the capacity to achieve the most challenging and noble goals in life , through strong commitment and dedication .
