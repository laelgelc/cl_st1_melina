@@42701235 <h> How Beijing works to force Hong Kong 's compliance with the party 's way of thinking <p> Shaping public opinion is a major aim of China 's state media but its managers are finding Hong Kong a tough nut to crack . This is because most of its people -- or at least a majority of those who care enough about politics to vote -- have not yet fully grasped the meaning of official words and declarations . Or in the new official language , knowing the politically correct thing to say is not enough . The new political order must also be " embraced . " <p> Most Hongkongers , after all , are not members of the Chinese Communist Party , so pronouncements by the party-led government in Beijing are not automatically understood or accepted upon arrival here . As an alien import , the party 's way of thinking is more often either ignored or misunderstood , or -- even worse -- resisted . <p> School children place their hands on the Communist Party flag during a class about the history of the Communist Party at a school in Lianyungang , in China 's eastern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stringer/AFP . <p> This must change , say Chinese officials . Since there is still resistance more than two decades after the 1997 transfer from British to Chinese rule , the time to force compliance has arrived . <p> But Hong Kong in 2021 is not China in 1949 , and the revolutionary overthrow of the established order in all its economic , political , and social dimensions is not possible here . Those upheavals that ultimately subdued all forms of mainland dissent belong to another age . The most that can be done here and now is to force compliance . <p> Maybe hearts and minds will follow . Or maybe they wo n't . It does n't really matter . Beijing 's main concern is to enforce the new rules and eliminate all overt signs of resistance , both violent and non-violent . That means resistance such as the street protests of 2019 , and the democratic opposition 's 2019 election victories in all but one of Hong Kong 's 18 District Councils . <p> The new rules were introduced on June 30 , 2020 with the promulgation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officials to oversee its implementation . That law 's new standards are now being introduced everywhere , but they derive from the four offences criminalised on June 30 : secession from China ; subversion of its government ; terrorism , meaning politically motivated violence ; and colluding with non-Chinese citizens as a means of political protest . <p> Photo : GovHK . <p> Yet despite the dramatic roll-out last year , timed to coincide with the July 1 anniversary of the handover , no one knew what the words might mean or what actions might actually constitute the four crimes . Much is still unclear because the crimes can only be defined in practice , via formal allegations , criminal proceedings , and precedent-setting court judgements . This work has only just begun . <h> Defining the crime of subversion <p> The first major case under the new law , obviously intended as an object lesson for the public at large as well as those directly involved , began Hollywood-style with dawn raids all across town that netted 53 well-known suspects . They included all the democracy movement 's most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken part as organisers or candidates in last year 's pre-election exercise to select pro-democracy candidates . <p> Billed by the organisers as an informal primary election , It was held on the weekend of July 11-12 , just days after the new security law was promulgated . Aspiring candidates and their political parties had organised the event as a means of generating public interest in the coming Legislative Council ( LegCo ) election by helping to winnow the field of candidates beforehand . <p> Andrew Chiu , Au Nok-hin , Benny Tai . Photo : Rachel Wong/HKFP . <p> The idea was to let voters themselves have a say in candidate selection and try to prevent the perennial problem of too many pro-democracy candidates chasing too few seats . In order to participate , everyone had to agree to abide by the results of the poll and allow the winners to stand as the pro-democracy camp 's only candidates in the formal election . Originally scheduled for September 6 , the LegCo election was postponed , ostensibly due to the Covid pandemic , and has yet to be rescheduled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organised at informal polling sites all over town , with volunteer poll workers , and votes cast via mobile phone after check-in at the sites . Over 600,000 voters took part , some standing in line for hours , and far more than the organisers had dared to expect . <p> The impact of the January 6 raiding parties was naturally wide-ranging given the community-wide nature of the targets . On the day itself , the suspects were accused by Hong Kong 's Secretary for Security , John Lee , of subverting state power due to their participation in the July primary . <p> But within 48 hours , they were being granted bail and all were released without charge . Even more curious , people close to the Hong Kong government publicly stated that they could not see how the informally organised poll had violated any law . <p> Most prominent was barrister Ronny Tong , a member of Chief Executive Carrie Lam 's advisory Executive Council . Despite his decision to cross the dividing line that separates his old pro-democracy friends from his new government colleagues , Tong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Ronny Tong . File photo : Catherine Lai/HKFP . <p> In contrast , retired top judge Henry Litton helped the prosecution make its case by explaining just how sinister and subversive the July primary had actually been . Litton is now speaking in his new self-declared role as a critic of Hong Kong 's old-style British-inspired common law ways in an effort , he says , to save them from extinction . He says that without reform , Hong Kong 's judiciary will eventually be absorbed within China 's party-led legal system . <h> The case for subverting state power <p> In a South China Morning Post opinion piece on January 27 , Litton explained how the July primary election could be a crime of the first order under Hong Kong 's new National Security Law . He focused on the organisers ' intent and pointed for evidence to the Apple Daily opinion pieces written in early 2020 by Benny Tai Yiu-ting who was then still a University of Hong Kong law professor . <p> Writing months before the National Security Law was promulgated , Tai had outlined the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whereby the Legislative Council can veto the government 's budget and eventually force the Chief Executive to resign ( Articles 50 , 51 , 52 ) . Those were the provisions , written into Hong Kong 's Beijing-drafted Basic Law , that made the proposal seem perfectly legal , according to Ronny Tong and others . <p> Henry Litton . Photo : Youtube via FCC . <p> Benny Tai was chief promoter for the July primary and its 35 + tagline . This signified half the seats in Hong Kong 's 70-seat Legislative Council , or the number needed to form a majority that could perhaps make it possible to bring down the government . But he warned that promoters should brace themselves for a drastic response from Beijing should such an event actually come to pass . <p> The aims of the democratic majority could nevertheless be pursued , which might also make possible the reform of the electoral system . This would entail the long-sought goal of universal suffrage elections , also a possibility written into the Basic Law . <p> Article 68 says that the ultimate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Democrats have been pursuing that goal since the 1980s , even as it has continued to recede like a mirage in the desert with each passing year . <p> Benny Tai in a demonstration held on January 1 , 2019 . Photo : Etan Liam , via Flickr . <p> In Beijing eyes , argued Litton , this was certainly a proposal for subverting state power . He concentrated on a later more melodramatic version of Tai 's argument , from the April 28 issue of Apple Daily . Here Tai used the street protesters ' 2019 justification for violence with their battle cry " If we burn , you burn with us . " This is the version now being circulated for maximum effect in retroactively building the case against him . <p> Even though the new National Security Law ( Art . 39 ) states specifically that it is not to be applied retroactively , retroactive application of intent went into effect immediately as the basis for enforcing the new national security standards . <p> Lest he allow himself to digress too far into the realms of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his case by acknowledging that " no facts have been established but what is known seems to point to all the elements of a conspiracy to subvert state power ... " A serious crime , indeed , and one requiring a " high standard of proof , " which is why investigations are continuing . <p> File photo : HKFP . <p> But then he moved into the realm of interpretation , chiding those who were quoting chapter and verse of the Basic Law . Rather it was a " living constitutional instrument " and according to common law principles must be interpreted in a " broad and liberal manner . " That means , not in accordance with the letter of the law but with its " true intent and spirit . " And from there it was just a short step to Beijing 's favourite refrain about maintaining Hong Kong 's " prosperity and stability . " The Basic Law should be construed in that light as well . <p> In conclusion , however , Litton departed far from the realms of both investigative fact and judicial interpretation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least some of his sources . In 2014 , the street-level adversarial gossip was about American bankers handing out hundred-dollar bills so activists could buy tents and camp out on the streets . That was during the Umbrella-Occupy Movement , also inspired by Benny Tai and also launched in the name of universal suffrage elections . <p> Litton concluded by noting that police were just beginning their investigations . There was much that remained to be revealed and many questions yet to be answered . Such as , what was it that really motivated voters to come out for the July primary ? <p> A polling station in Tin Shui Estate during the primary election for the since-postponed Legislative Council election . Photo : Stand News . <p> It could only be one thing according to this line of reasoning , and he wrote his answer without trying to fact-check or corroborate it . " According to police , participants were paid substantial sums to take part . " <p> Probably , Beijing is none too pleased with the efforts of its Hong Kong surrogates , unfamiliar as they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Soon after the poll last summer , the central government issued a more straightforward statement explaining the lessons Hongkongers were expected to learn . It also anticipated the events of January 6 . <p> In its July 14 statement , the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office in Beijing said the informal poll was an illegal manipulation of the electoral process , designed to build momentum for the pro-democracy camp and give its candidates an unfair advantage in the coming LegCo election . <p> The statement also described the poll as a direct challenge to the new National Security Law and the Basic Law . Accordingly , Benny Tai was an agent working for foreign forces and an investigation into the nature of these illegalities should be conducted .

I have been reading a book about the relationship between Winston Churchill and Clement Attlee , who at various times were Prime Minister and Leader of the Opposition facing each other , and could hardly have been more different in their political ideology . They managed to remain remarkably good friends . Neither was ever arrested . <p> They did have the advantage , it is true , of having been colleagues in the Coalition government during the Second World War , in which Churchill was PM and Attlee his deputy who filled in when he was away .

But I digress . <p> What is Ms Lam going to do with her new-look legislature which , she noted , would no doubt be willing to approve things which the old one would have choked over .

I notice in the Education Bureau 's latest guidelines on national security education that students will be told that the new national security law did not diminish Hong Kong people 's rights and freedoms . <p> This is nonsense . A law which makes new criminal offences certainly diminishes people 's freedoms .

The first is that it is a clear usurpation of the powers and functions of the people who put the Oxford Dictionary together , and spend a great deal of time and effort on chasing an accurate definition of word meanings by looking at how they are actually used . I am proposing for next year 's update a new word -- dictatwit -- which I have just made up .

@@42827240 <h> Pro patria mori <p> But why would you want to die for your country ? Especially if it is someone else bidding you to do so . <p> I understand the phrase to means that it is a glorious thing to be prepared to die for one 's country . <p> The Oxford English Dictionary definition of a patriot is one who loves his country and is prepared to defend it against an enemy which , falls a trifle short of a willingness to sacrifice one 's life in the endeavor . <p> I concede that if you are willing to defend your country in armed conflict against an enemy there is always the possibility that you may be killed whilst so engaged , but that still falls demonstrably short of considering it noble to die in the attempt . <p> History is replete with individuals who are venerated because , it is said , they died for their country . Yet close examination of the circumstances in which these heroic figures met their end tends to indicate that the object of their personal sacrifice was on behalf of those far more proximate than the tenuous concept of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most famous phrase ' Greater love hath no man than that he lay down his life for his friends .

Yet the basic nuclear family revolves around the mother , father and children . <p> Had historians been less male-centric , it would probably have been matriotism , and we would be talking about matriots rather than patriots . <p> Oedipus complexities aside , the closest natural affection in the human race is love of one 's mother . She is the one who nurtures the child in the womb , gives birth , suckles it and provides the earliest cocoon of care and love in which the child grows . <p> This is both biological and environmental . <p> A not dissimilar affinity occurs as between siblings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go to the aid of their kindred facing an external threat . <p> Love , within the context of the nuclear family is natural and normal . <p> Now let us examine a non-biological relationship which also generates a fierce , protective instinct of loyalty : that which exists between soldiers . <p> Take a military unit of a regiment comprising approximately 800 soldiers sub-divided into 100 strong companies , 25 man platoons and 6 man sections . Regiments are identified by name or number . <p> Armies have centuries of traditions of regiments formed from a defined geographical territory . Broad and local cultural associations gave these units a cohesive identity which was cultivated to develop esprit de corps . <p> The young soldier on first being recruited into such a unit would soon be steeped in his regiment 's history of distinctive service . <p> The aim is to inspire in the rank and file a familial loyalty to " the regiment " so that it acquires the characteristics of an extended family . <p> But in the heat and terror of battle , when death is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are not to the regiment , or the company but to those members of the smallest unit with whom the soldier shares the daily threat of injury and death . <p> Real loyalty is not to the abstract but to the flesh and blood of those immediately around you with whom the risk is shared , those who you protect and by whom you are protected . <p> These are the people who command the fiercest affection and whom , in extremis , you grow to love . <p> So , when people speak of loving a country , to what or whom is that emotive word being applied ? Is it appropriate use of the word ' love ' ? It is much abused both as a transitive verb and as a noun . <p> How often do you hear someone say that they love the Yorkshire moors or Ireland 's rivers or Nepal 's mountains ?

@@42841236 <h> Biden 's sensible stimulus <p> The United States and the world entered recession a year ago . Normally , economists ca n't predict the onset of a downturn . But because this recession stemmed from the COVID-19 pandemic , they could reliably discern its beginnings without waiting for the standard economic indicators . <p> By the end of the second quarter of 2020 , US GDP had plunged by a record 11% , taking the economy from an estimated 1% above potential output at the end of 2019 to a level 10% below it . Forecasters now expect such rapid growth in 2021 that GDP will return to its pre-pandemic peak very soon . By 2022 , it will probably be well above potential . The global economy is also expected to recover , though not as rapidly as that of the US . <p> Some now warn that the US economy could overheat . Given this possibility , is President Joe Biden providing too much stimulus with his $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan , enacted earlier this month ? <p> After all , the rosy forecasts for the US economy reflect not only the ongoing vaccine rollout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and services . American households saved an estimated $1.5 trillion of the government transfers that Congress approved a year ago , and appear keen to spend some of it as soon as they can . Moreover , the monetary easing that the US Federal Reserve introduced in spring 2020 has lowered short-term interest rates to zero , and Fed Chair Jerome Powell has repeatedly pledged to leave rates at that level for several years . <p> A third factor turbocharging demand is the recently renewed fiscal stimulus -- not only the Biden package , but also the $0.9 trillion in outlays that Congress approved in December . And the Biden administration plans a fourth boost to demand through increased infrastructure investment spending . No wonder , then , that Fed officials on March 17 hiked their projections for US growth in 2021 , to 6.5% . The OECD has done the same . <p> The basis of the overheating assessments is simple enough . Let 's say that federal government outlays in 2021 exceed last year 's by $1.9 trillion , equivalent to about 9% of the $22 trillion US @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Keynesian multiplier could be as high as 1.5 . But when additional government spending takes the form of income transfers , only the part of the increase in disposable income that households actually consume enters the demand stream . Households usually save some , as they certainly did in 2020 . <p> So , assume a multiplier of one . In that case , a fiscal stimulus equal to 9% of GDP results in a 9% output increase . Given that US economic output was an estimated 3% below potential at the end of 2020 , a 9% boost would put GDP about 6% above potential . <p> Some economists , most notably former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers , support the basic idea of Biden 's relief program but think it 's too big , warning of rising inflation next year . Financial markets have reacted , too : the interest rate on ten-year Treasury bonds has now risen to 1.7% , up from 0.9% since January . <p> The counterargument is that we do n't really know the level of potential output , and are perhaps underestimating it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 2018-19 was really performing above potential after all , given that inflation rose to only 2.3% in 2019 despite the unemployment rate falling as low as 3.5% . <p> But a likelier explanation for the small rise in inflation in the pre-pandemic period is what economists call a flat Phillips curve . In other words , variations in US employment and output have only small effects on wage and price inflation . Before the puzzle of why inflation did not rise more than it did in 2018-19 , there was the puzzle of why it did not fall more than it did in 2010-15 , in the aftermath of the Great Recession , when unemployment was coming down only slowly from its 10% peak . <p> So , although US output growth is likely to be above potential next year , a relatively flat Phillips curve implies that inflation is unlikely to rise inordinately . In fact , the Fed would actively welcome a small pickup in price growth . <p> To be sure , providing so much stimulus may have other downsides . The US national debt is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GDP , and will become less sustainable if interest rates rise . Money-financed expansion risks fueling asset bubbles . The trade deficit is bound to increase , which could exacerbate protectionism . And if the sky 's the limit on spending , some of the money could be wasted . <p> But Biden 's advisers are clearly trying to ensure that America does n't repeat the mistake of 2009 , when President Barack Obama 's $800 billion stimulus -- though big by historical standards -- was too small and short-lived to enable the economy to recover fully after the global financial crisis . Although the Great Recession ended almost as soon as Obama 's American Recovery and Reinvestment Act took effect , the subsequent recovery was too slow . <p> It is not clear that the insufficient size of the 2009 stimulus was really the Obama administration 's fault ( unless , perhaps , Obama erred in seeking a modicum of bipartisanship ) . Administration officials would argue that they got the biggest stimulus through Congress that was politically feasible , given Republican opposition . <p> It may be off-limits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But many reflexively blamed the weakness of the 2009-10 recovery on Obama and the Democrats , and gave the Republicans control of the House of Representatives in the 2010 midterm elections -- thus enabling the GOP to block further measures to boost the economy . <p> America did indeed err in 2009-10 in limiting the size and duration of the fiscal expansion . Regardless of where precisely one locates that mistake , Biden is right to make sure it is n't repeated now .

Yet this members-only supper club is a relatively modern addition to Hong Kong 's dining scene , opened in the midst of the SARS epidemic of 2003 by the late Sir David Tang and fourth-generation owner Giuseppe Cipriani . <p> That 's not to say that Cipriani does n't bear the weight of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elevator doors on the 12th floor , guests enter a space redolent of a classic Venetian watering hole -- or rather , one in particular .

With the coronavirus pandemic following on the coattails of social unrest , the impact on the club revenue is starting to show ; in an effort to attract more members , Cipriani has just revamped its membership scheme , with joining fees starting from HK$10,000 for single memberships , and a recurring annual fee of HK$3,000 thereafter .

@@42923235 <h> Newsletters <h> Newsletters <p> It 's mid-afternoon on a Tuesday and Nikhil Kamath is in his study . At 34 , Kamath , recently named India 's youngest billionaire by Forbes India , has been working more from home lately , but not because of the pandemic . In fact , Kamath 's home base of Bangalore has recorded remarkably few infections of late , so life in the city has marched on , more or less , as normal . Kamath , the chief investment officer of two finance companies he started with his older brother Nithin -- True Beacon , an asset management firm , and Zerodha , the country 's largest stock brokerage -- works at home , alone in his bookshelf-lined office because , well , he prefers it . <p> " I think I 'm better at thinking in silo , " he says . We 're talking on a video call , one of many on his agenda today , packed back-to-back in the six hours between the 3:30pm market close and his daily late-night workout routine -- personal training most days and the occasional badminton match -- before bed . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been more market- focused . I do n't really manage people and stuff like that . I 'm more interested in what happens in the markets . " <p> In the last ten years , Zerodha has been hailed for making the Indian stock market more accessible to everyday investors , with more than four million active users , ten million daily transactions and US$10 billion in daily turnover . True Beacon , started in August 2019 , operates differently from most wealth managers in that its fees are based purely on performance , which the Kamath brothers believe will bring a higher level of accountability to the industry . <p> At home today , Nikhil sits on a high-backed chair in a room lined with dark-wood bookshelves . He 's casually dressed in a red , white and blue checked shirt , elbows propped on the desk in front of him , sunlight streaming in from a window on his left casting shadows across his face . This study , where he spends the bulk of his time making money moves as well as launching projects like Rainmatter , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most subdued of all the rooms in his sprawling 8,000 sq ft apartment , which is perched high above the city skyline in its most luxurious development , Kingfisher Towers . Beyond the office doors , Kamath 's home is swathed in soothing neutral tones and textures , with nature-inspired pops of colour : green , gold and floral accents . <p> Even as a teenager , young Nikhil exhibited a headstrong independence . Somehow , he convinced his parents to let him quit school at 14 so he could play chess on the competitive circuit , even without any formal qualifications . A few years later , he and his brother started trading . <p> " I was n't the most responsible child . I was fairly naughty and I was n't very academically inclined , " Kamath recalls . " The starting point was definitely about wanting the things I did not have : ' I want to buy a nice car . I want to have this , I want to have that . ' And it was also about solving a problem that we faced as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and selling equity on the stock markets . The brokers of the time were so inefficient that people like us found it very hard to survive . " <p> For Kamath , this early exposure to the stock market and the lure of its possibilities blossomed into a lifelong obsession . And while hobbies , like motorcycles and exercise regimens , have come and gone -- " I 've had many fitness goals over many decades and I have never achieved any of them , " he says -- his most ardent relationship has been with his work . He has gone 16 years without missing a single day . <p> " I fail to understand moderation in life , " he says . " Everything , in relationships , in my professional life , in physical fitness , is extreme . " <p> So is his obsession with his own mortality . Earlier this year , he posted on social media a photo of Ernest Becker 's 1973 book The Denial of Death , tweeting , " Book of the year for me , so at 34 , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Avg life span 70 ) So easy to forget the finite nature of life , if u were to live backwards with awareness of how much time ( approx ) is left , what would you change ? " <p> Surely this newly minted billionaire -- and he 's single -- is not having a mid-life crisis already ? <p> " I think it comes from the fact that I do n't have any dependents , " he says . " So I often wonder in life if tomorrow , I 'm walking down the road and a bus were to run over me , what would have been the point of everything ? Am I going to my deathbed thinking about what I have achieved or what I have missed out on ? " <p> In the context of a place like Silicon Valley , a precocious teenager turned bootstrapping mid-career billionaire in search of meaning in life is practically a meme . But in India , Kamath is a rarity , as a leading figure in the country 's rising generation of fintech superstars . And his unconventional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boundaries of societal expectations . It would be an understatement to say that , in the cultural context of India , it is rare for someone of Kamath 's background , success and profile to be single , but the amicable dissolution of his short-lived marriage two years ago has not reinvigorated any burning desire in him to find The One . <p> Suffice to say , if this interview were a first date , it would not be going well . <p> " At this point I 'm gradually shifting towards living a more complete life with many other facets outside of just work , " he says . " The concept of marriage as our parents and our ancestors knew it is no longer relevant . For two people to live together and be happy , both of them are compromising at a certain level . " <p> Oh , Nikhil , you charmer . This personals ad practically writes itself : <p> " I do n't need to have kids . I think we make too much of what will happen after we are dead and what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fullest , do the best you can , and after you 're dead , everything is gone anyway . " <p> Wait , wait . Do n't swipe left just yet . <p> Devoid of context , Kamath might sound a bit cold and callous , but his tone is thoughtful and considered . He 's a self-professed adherent to stoicism and displays heightened self-awareness when discussing his values and how they impact his personal and professional pursuits differently . <p> " I 've been this way for a long time , as far back as I can remember , " Kamath says . " I think it 's important to be able to take professional failures , put them in a compartment in your head and not fret about them . I do that a lot professionally , especially working in an ecosystem like the stock market . You ca n't predict the outcome of every event , so the ability to remain objective is a good example of stoicism , professionally . <p> " But stoicism is bad for relationships , " he says . " If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you as emotionally unavailable and you 'll start behaving like a robot because you 're not reacting to anything . " <p> Kamath , a proponent of the contemporary stoicism movement has tattoos reminding him to stay in the moment . This one says " Be Here Now " <p> Kamath 's tattoo , " Shalom " in English and Hebrew <p> As a reminder to live in the moment , Kamath has a tattoo that reads " Be Here Now " , a phrase associated with the contemporary stoic movement , on his right forearm . On his left wrist , another tattoo reads " Shalom " in English and Hebrew . <p> " I like the fact that it 's a reminder of peace , " he says . " Peace of mind is the closest notion to happiness that I know . " <p> But what is he looking for in order to have absolute peace of mind ? Unsurprisingly , it 's not a billion dollars in the bank . And it 's not a mate , either . <p> " I want the fate of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says . " I can wake up tomorrow and go anywhere in the world and live there for however long I like . I can work on what I want . I would much rather have that than the traditional construct of a family , just because society and moral policing mandates me to . " <p> In January , the Kamath brothers committed US$100 million to launch the Rainmatter Foundation , a non-profit fund and incubator that supports individuals and organisations working on climate change -- specifically afforestation and ecological regeneration . <p> " As an entrepreneur , I feel my time is better spent making the money required to go into these causes , " Nikhil says , ever the pragmatist . ' We 'd rather allocate the money to someone very well-versed , who can make an actual change and impact , versus running these causes on our own . " And climate change is only the first of many causes Nikhil plans to throw his weight and wallet behind . He 's a very millennial sort of billionaire . <p> " I do n't think it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think there will be everything , " he says . " The great thing about not having children is you do n't have anything else to do . I have to put money towards these causes and what I believe will make society better . " <p> Even though he has n't taken a holiday in nearly two decades , Kamath has aspirations to travel , to go backpacking across the world , to catch a train , to live in a hostel , to experience a city for what it truly is . <p> " I think the pandemic has taught us one thing : the future is unpredictable , " he says . " We are all so fixated on this notion of success and having more . But I think it 's a good start to try and think about what we really , really want , and not what society has made us think we want . "

@@43083231 <h> Hong Kong needs a more cogent population policy <p> Hong Kong -- a city with one of the highest life expectancies in the world . A city packed to brim with wealth , affluence , and decadence . Also -- a city with a rapidly ageing population -- and whose demographic crisis has no end in sight . There 's an imminent and real problem , and it behooves us to tackle it . <p> Tracing Hong Kong 's ageing population should be a relatively straightforward task . The city is well-equipped with unrivalled infrastructure and health services -- with world-class doctors , medical practitioners , and a copious level of capital invested into the quality of life of its citizens . The inequality certainly is regrettable and abhorrent , but a vast majority of Hongkongers lead largely placid , unperturbed lives that stretch easily into the mid- to late 80s . <p> On the other hand , we 've seen a continued decline in birth rates and fertility rates . From the record sub-one lows in the early 2000s ( 0.92 in 2004 ) to the latest figure of 1.05 babies per woman , Hong Kong 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -- well below the natural replacement rate of 2.1 . This is in stark juxtaposition to the mainland , whose dwindling births have ruffled plenty a feather in Beijing -- and triggered the drastic pivot to three-child policy last week . <p> We should be worried . An ageing population imposes substantially greater burdens on the city 's infrastructure , welfare services , and active workforce . It also -- in the long run , if unaddressed and unaccompanied by genuine transformations -- paves the dangerous way for a skyrocketing dependency ratio , thereby crippling our productivity and jeopardising the foundations underpinning our advanced economy . <p> More fundamentally , perhaps , a graying population may end up leading longer , more extended lives -- yet beyond a certain point , the enhancement to one 's quality of life is bound to stagnate , such that with each additional year , sans the apropos technological adaptations and innovation , we 'd see substantially decreasing marginal utilities . In other words , the number of years can not and does not matter , unless we could -- as we should -- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least comfortably humane conditions , regardless of their socioeconomic standing . This could well be a tall order -- but is also an order of moral necessity . <p> To replenish our capital stock , to rejuvenate our city , to lure in investors and firms attracted by a healthy and robust consumer market ... Hong Kong needs a more concrete and visionary population policy . <p> For starters , it 's high time the city considered how it could attract quality migrants -- whether as medium-term to short-term workers , or , even better , as long-term citizens . For far too long we 've rested on our laurels , as a highly cosmopolitan , international , and economically vibrant city . Yet as our competitors -- including other cities in China , e.g. Shanghai and Shenzhen , as well as regional hubs such as Singapore and Seoul , play catch-up , Hong Kong can ill-afford to wait it out . We must offer structural incentives -- ranging from subsidies , rent waivers , tax rebates , to economic opportunities and more access to capital -- to appeal to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ China 's inexorable rise , yet plausibly put off by the mainland 's stringent legal and cultural restrictions . We need young , talented migrants to help ameliorate ( or avert ) our economic downturn -- we also need them to transform and enliven our population at large , to " de-gray " our demographics , whilst ensuring that our city remains sustainable and self-sufficient . As for the worry that this would induce an excessive expansion and growth in our population ( surely Hong Kong is crowded as is ! ) , overcrowding is indeed an issue in our urban centers , but let 's not kid ourselves : there is much room in the New Territories that can and should be developed into new urban centers and areas to accommodate the rising population . In any case , the housing crisis does not stem from Hong Kong 's population -- it stems from governmental and private market failure ; discussions of this nature are best left for another day . <p> Furthermore , the government must grapple with the root causes underpinning the phenomenon of declining birth rates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , given the exorbitant living costs , political uncertainty , and socioeconomic inequalities that threaten to thwart the life chances of many a yet-to-be-born Hong Konger . Families who are adamant on having children of their own are increasingly drawn to migrating abroad -- even if it is to countries or regions that are dispositionally hostile towards foreigners . Hong Kong is ceasing to be a home for many , for reasons largely with nothing to do with politics : instead , it 's rapidly losing its glow and appeal as a livable city , and it behooves our government to plug this gap , to the extent that they are willing to do so . <p> Finally , there 's the question of incentives . Why should young women with aspirations and careers start families of their own ? More specifically , why do so in Hong Kong , where the cutthroat work environment and implicitly discriminatory corporate culture render motherhood effectively an antithesis to a successful , flourishing career ? The status quo lacks adequate protections for female workers who choose to bear and care for children -- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a core political right that individuals are entitled to , just as the right to religion , the right to free speech , and the right to reproductive freedom . If we are genuinely a city that is cosmopolitan , that runs on the basis of the rule of law , then it is imperative for us to lend a helping hand to women who are unjustly and structurally shut out by employers and firms hostile to the idea of them nurturing children . <p> Only by tackling the root causes of our population challenge , could our administration rebuild a Hong Kong that is for all -- including the elderly , the downtrodden , and the women who lack a say over their reproductive decisions today .

Whatever it is , the Secretary for Justice wants to change it . <p> Focus , if you will , on the word counsel which is a synonym for barrister , of which there are two ranks , Senior and Junior . <p> All barristers who are not Senior Counsel ( SC ) , regardless of their age , are designated Junior counsel . <p> The word barrister is derived from the physical barrier in a courtroom between counsel and the judge or judges who sit on the bench . <p> Traditionally , the procedure by which someone becomes a barrister in England and Wales is termed ' Called to the Bar ' and historically , only the Inns of Court , Gray 's Inn , Lincoln 's Inn , the Middle and Inner Temples are permitted to call someone to the Bar . <p> Though their origins are somewhat obscure , the Inns of Court emerged from about the 14th century as Honourable Societies of barristers devoted to the study of the Common Law . <p> The Inns confer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who are called to the Bar of the individual Inn . <p> The word utter is mediaeval English for outer and distinguishes the holder from membership of the Inner Bar , which is reserved for the leaders of the profession who , in common law jurisdictions are called Queen 's Counsel ( QC ) or Senior Counsel . <p> The nomenclature and the route to becoming a barrister are deeply ingrained in the history and traditions of England and Wales , Scotland and Northern Ireland . Prior to the independence of Eire , the same applied to Ireland . <p> Prior to the handover in 1997 , as a British colony , Hong Kong observed the same terminology , the major distinction being that barristers are called to the bar of the High Court.Understandably , once Hong Kong was no longer a colony but a Special Administrative Region of China , the title became Senior Counsel ( SC ) , though the role and rank remained intact . <p> Under the Basic Law , the concept of one country two systems incorporated the common law as the governing legal system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ QC is ' One of Her Majesty 's Counsel learned in the law ' , the title gives them precedence over other barristers in any court in which they appear . <p> Barristers , like doctors and clergymen are members of the learned professions . <p> Junior barristers wear a gown made of cotton or ' stuff ' , whereas SCs wear a silk gown , which is why they are called ' silks ' . <p> The division of the legal profession into barristers and solicitors , is a practical division of labour . <p> Lawyers decide whether they want to be barristers or solicitors and select their career path accordingly from the outset . <p> One critical difference is that solicitors are officers of the court whereas barristers are not . This distinction has significance because it emphasises that barristers are totally independent . <p> Prohibited from forming partnerships or limited liability companies , barristers must be self-employed .

The legal officer owes loyalty to the government and looks to it for promotion and preferment . <p> The private Bar 's Code of Conduct is partly written but also derived in large part from a body of unwritten ethics and conventions which are largely absorbed during the 12 month pupillage served with an experienced barrister . <p> The professional rules are set very high and the Bar polices this Code jealously . <p> Barristers are , first and foremost , specialist advocates . Their skills lie in the ability to present a case in court . <p> Solicitors , by way of contrast , are far more commercially oriented . They deal directly with the members of the public for whom they are the first point of contact and have the primary responsibility for gathering the evidence , advisory work , interviewing the witnesses and processing the legal documentation . <p> Solicitors may form partnerships and legal liability companies and the majority of them do so .

This demonstrates that the SJ 's ploy is just to provide short term gratification to such legal officers during the currency of their office . <p> One may stick a label on a duck and call it a swan but it remains a duck . <p> Within the DoJ there are legal officers who are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officer want to dissociate himself from government ?
