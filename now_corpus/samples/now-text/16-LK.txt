I have established a medical centre , a research laboratory and a factory in Maharagama where my products are manufactured . I used to observe monkeys eating papaya leaves . I conducted research on papaya leaves and found that papaya leaves had been used by aborigines to treat malaria . At the time there were no suggestions that papaya leaves were a remedy for dengue , but as monkeys consumed it , we knew it was n't toxic .

He recovered without been admission to a hospital Some three wheel drivers of the Watthegedara area close to my clinic my clerk was friendly with also took papaya leaf syrup when they contracted dengue and were cured proving the efficacy papaya leaves in treating dengue . It was then that I decided to conduct scientific research on the papaya leaf treatment . 12 patients who came to my clinic voluntarily agreed to take papaya leaves and then take blood tests when it was found that their platelet count and WBC counts had increased with improvement of their overall medical condition . So , papaya leaves not only increase the platelet count but helps to increase WBC counts and reduce fever and the duration of the illness simultaneously .

The rat experiment was done in other countries after my human experiment . In late 2009 I wanted to conduct a randomised control clinical experiment . I needed approval from ethical clearance committees such as the unit at the Sri Lanka Medical Association to conduct the control trial . If they approve it , they have to take the responsibility in case something happens to the patient . In 2009 the ethical clearance unit at the Sri Lanka Medical Association did not permit me to conduct the experiment because they were not convinced of its safety and efficacy .

If the platelet count increases despite the fact that the patient 's condition ( fever etc ) was not improving , it becomes a complication to the physician . This is where my control experiment played a major role as it was able to clear the previous misconception that papaya leaves only increases the platelet count . As part of the experiment we reached patients who had not yet reached the critical stage warded at the Kalubowila Hospital . We divided them into two groups and checked them to ascertain how many had reached the critical phase and how many had not in the two groups .

There are no side effects . The only problem is the bitter taste in the syrup . However , patients must take the medicine in the first spike of fever , and they must take it regularly to obtain optimum results . <p> Q Is the papaya syrup more of an Ayurveda product ? <p> A Herbal medicine is generally categorised as Ayurvedic but most western medicines are derived from plant material or originally identified in plant extracts .

@@8686238 <h> Good governance gasping ... breath <p> The name Nimal Bopage did n't ring a bell a few weeks ago . However , this individual suddenly became the focus of attention when , as the newly appointed Secretary of the Media Ministry , he declared that the media should not identify a particular political group as the ' Joint Opposition ' . <p> Bopage has had his fifteen minutes of fame . Unfortunately , he did n't make the most of it . Now , he has been shown the door . The government hopes that his removal as ministry secretary will bring the curtain down on a saga that was much ado about nothing , really . A few questions do remain , though . When Bopage made his infamous declaration , was he acting on his own accord ? Surely a neophyte ministry secretary would not make a statement with such far-reaching implications without the blessings of his political masters ? Or , did he ? He says he did . <p> Bopage 's Minister , Gayantha Karunathilaka , was quick to disclaim any contribution . What Bopage said was his ' personal opinion ' and was not the government 's position @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also endorse the statement . In-fact , he is understood to have summoned Bopage and given him a tongue lashing . <p> Bopage 's statement did raise a few issues . It highlighted the issue of delegation of authority from the political powers that be to bureaucrats . We may be on the way to good governance , but make no mistake , the bureaucracy does not run the country ; politicians do . We need to be grateful to Bopage for clarifying that , even if inadvertently . <p> Then there is the issue of media freedom . When Bopage said what he said , the media was strident in its protests . How dare you tell us how we should be doing our job by instructing us what not to call a political group , they asked . If what Bopage wanted was to limit the exposure of the Joint Opposition in the media , what he achieved was exactly the opposite : even ' middle of the road ' media outlets which are usually impartial stood firmly with the Joint Opposition on this issue . <p> Finally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Joint Opposition a separate political entity of its own ? This is where Bopage 's timing was really off . His comments came during the lead up to May Day when the Joint Opposition was attempting to create an impression that it commanded more numbers than the mainstream Sri Lanka Freedom Party ( SLFP ) . That is why his comments riled them even more . <p> May Day is now over and we are still searching for answers . The decision the SLFP Central Committee takes regarding the dissidents who attended the Joint Opposition May Day rally at Kirulapone will determine the future directions of both the SLFP and the Joint Opposition . <p> We are not privy to who , if any , sanctioned Bopage 's comments . However , by calling for his removal , the government has changed gears and got in to damage control mode . Even if it did so in hindsight , and regardless of which faction of the government masterminded that , it is a step in the right direction unless , of course , Bopage is now being made a scapegoat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the latter , however , Bopage could always speak up and he has n't . <p> If Bopage 's comments were bad governance and his removal is good governance , so be it . But there is way to go . Take the case of Kamal Indika , another name that does not readily ring a bell . <p> Kamal Indika was recently appointed SLFP organiser for Hiriyala in the Kurunegala district by President Maithripala Sirisena . This is the same person who allegedly engineered an attack on artistes of the ' Aluth Parapura ' at Kumbukgete when they were campaigning for candidate Maithripala Sirisena during the presidential election . Indika was then firmly on former President Mahinda Rajapaksa 's side . <p> As far as ethics are concerned , this is far worse a transgression of good governance than the few words that Bopage uttered . So , do n't fool yourselves : good governance is not alive and kicking . In fact , it may be gasping for breath . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @

@@10080233 If you are lucky enough you would have flawless , healthy skin and nothing to worry about . However , most people are born with oily or dry skin , endowed with the struggle to treat it . It is not the end ; maintained properly , you could twist your luck to gain healthy skin , no matter how greasy or how chapped and grey your skin is . <p> The crucial step is to identify your skin type . Extensive skin care carried out without proper knowledge of your skin type does not help . Therefore , before you start treating your skin , follow this method for proper identification . First , remove any makeup and wash your face with lukewarm water . Wait for an hour for your skin to come back to its natural condition . Take a tissue and dab your face , paying attention to your forehead and nose -- this is called ' T- zone ' . If there is grease on the tissue , your skin is oily . Another common characteristic of oily skin is large pores with a shiny surface . Flakes of dead skin on the tissue would indicate that your skin is dry . Also the skin would feel taut . If there is no grease or flakes on the tissue , this means you are blessed with normal skin , with fewer worries than the rest of us . If the skin is oily in the T- zone , and normal to dry elsewhere , then you have combination skin , the most common skin type . Sometimes , the skin on your face and body could be of two different types . Therefore , it is always better to test for the skin on your body separately ; for example you can test your hands and legs , using the above method . <p> Remedy for oily skin Oily skin is the result of your sebaceous glands ( oil glands ) secreting too much sebum . Do not despair ! Oily skin tends to age better than other skin types , and it forms less wrinkles . All you need is a remedy for excess grease and you will be set . <p> Method First , wash your face with warm water ; this would dissolve excess oil and remove it from your face more effectively . Then , massage your face with a fine grain powder , such as gram powder . This would remove dead skin and bacteria , along with excess oil . Next , you need a face mask to remove the excess grease . For this , mix one teaspoon of honey with egg white . Add a bit of flour , to make a paste . Apply on your face and body . Make sure that you avoid the eye area . Leave for 10 minutes , and wash off with warm water . Try this two times a week . This would tighten up pores and regulate the secretion of sebum , making the skin grease free . To round off , apply a thin layer of plain yoghurt all over your skin , leave for 15 minutes and wash off . The lactic acid in yoghurt would exfoliate your skin and absorb excess oil simultaneously , without drying out your skin . <p> Remedy for dry skin Dry skin is usually due to hereditary factors or nutritional deficiencies . It has little or no moisture and oil . Consequently you have to retain , as well as add moisture to the skin . <p> Dimuthu AttanayakeDimuthu Attanayake First of all when you are taking a shower , make it short , and try to avoid hot showers as much as possible , as hot water tend to remove natural oil present on your body . Do not overdo cleansing or scrubbing . In fact , you could do it Cleopatra 's way , using milk ; however be a little more concerned about being wasteful . Mix few drops of rose water with four tablespoons of milk . Rub on your body , leave on for 10 minutes , and wash with cold water . For best results , repeat this daily . Anti-inflammatory powers in milk would sooth your skin , while lactic acid would help exfoliate and retain skin moisture . <p> Use a body wrap made of avocado , prepared using avocado pulp , to restore dry skin . Spread on your skin , leave on until it dries and wash off with cold water . Repeat once a week . Follow with an extra virgin olive oil massage , which would condition and moisturize the dry skin . You would experience smooth , silky skin in few weeks ' time -- be confident !

Do n't worry , you 're not going off to war . These are basic tips for the beginner birdwatcher . This is the first in a line of birdwatching articles by Nation in consultation with Colombo University Professor in Environmental Science and Field Ornithological Group of Sri Lanka ( FOGSL ) Co-founder , Sarath Kotagama . <p> " Birds are colourful , active creatures with one intriguing aspect ; they can fly , " he says . Bird watching is one hobby recorded throughout history . In Sri Lanka , there have been parks for birds , which allowed people to feed the birds and watch their behaviour . The reason may very well be that birds are the only animals that have not generated phobia among the humans . <p> " When you see a bird , it looks so different and cuddly . Chick is like a ball of cotton and as it gets bigger , the change is in its size is generally accompanied by a vivid colouring . Adults use birds as a mean of pacifying the kids . Most behavioural studies on areas such as imprinting and conditioning were theorized , using birds as experimental subjects . " All this brings about a familiarity with birds that is not found with regards to other animals . <p> The concept of birdwatching evolved in developed countries with the rise of protests against using feather on clothing and accessories . Royal Society for the Protection of Birds ( RSPB ) is one such example . Bird Shooting is another controversial hobby that contributed to bird watching . Ducks Unlimited is one North American group , which promotes safe and regulated waterfowl hunting . <p> Today , it is a form of enjoyment , at times even an expensive and lucrative one at that . It has certain financial gains , in addition to personal satisfaction . It has its health values , considered all the walking you have to do and the fresh air you inhale . It is a major form of tourist attraction , from the ' crazy birders ' or ' tickers ' , whose only aim is to see the maximum numbers of birds and tick them off their list , to the more serious nature lovers . For organizations such as Birdlife International , the purpose of bird watching is conservation . <p> An introduction " Anybody can be a birder , " confides professor Kotagama . " All you need is the desire and patience . You should have the ability to interpret what you see . Everybody has the ability to distinguish between a crow and a chicken . It is this inborn ability you have to develop in order to discriminate when you do bird watching . Identification comes with practice . You should develop your own guide and come up with your own method to discriminate among the birds . An average person has the ability to label 15 different types of birds . So , what a beginner could do is make a list of the birds you know and then ask how each of them would differ . " <p> He believes that you should refer a field guide available in the market only after this . " However , any field guide is only a guide . What matters most is how you apply what is in the guide . " Roger Peterson field guides are informative , with the Peterson 's method for identifying birds . Basically , this involves drawing a line in the book to indicate the features that distinguish it from other birds . There are also guides based on colour , and on distribution of bird families . <p> You should be dressed in earth colours , such as greens and colours that blend with nature , as camouflage is an important aspect when approaching a bird . It is also important to dress in a way to break the human profile , for example , you could wear a hat , a cloak , a poncho or baggy clothes , and carry a hide on your shoulders . Birds should be approached with stealth ; hiding behind trees and squatting rather than walking are good ways . It is crucial that you freeze if the bird recognizes you , especially if it is a water bird . " Watching birds with the naked eye makes you a proper birder , at the same time silence is a vital factor . Do n't make yourself the element of destruction , do not harm the environment , " he concluded .

@@10080237 <p> Diabetes , often referred to by doctors as diabetes mellitus , describes a group of metabolic diseases in which the person has high blood glucose ( blood sugar ) , either because insulin production is inadequate , or because the body 's cells do not respond properly to insulin , or both . <p> Patients with high blood sugar will typically experience polyuria ( frequent urination ) , they will become increasingly thirsty ( polydipsia ) and hungry ( polyphagia ) . <p> It is quite a common disease that is going rampant around Sri Lanka . As a result , there are many myths about diabetes that make it difficult for people to believe some of the hard facts -- such as diabetes is a serious and potentially deadly disease . These myths can create a picture of diabetes that is not accurate and full of stereotypes and stigma . This week , FYI decided to give you some Myths and Facts about Diabetes For Your Information ... <p> MYTH : Diabetes is not that serious of a disease.FACT : Diabetes causes more deaths a year than breast cancer and AIDS combined . Having diabetes nearly doubles your chance of having a heart attack . The good news is that good diabetes control can reduce your risks for diabetes complications . <p> MYTH : If you are overweight or obese , you will eventually develop type 2 diabetes.FACT : Being overweight is a risk factor for developing this disease , but other risk factors such as family history , ethnicity and age also play a role . Unfortunately , too many people disregard the other risk factors for diabetes and think that weight is the only risk factor for type 2 diabetes . Most overweight people never develop type 2 diabetes , and many people with type 2 diabetes are at a normal weight or only moderately overweight . <p> MYTH : If you have diabetes , you ca n't do too much exercise or you might get a low blood sugar attack.FACT : If you are on insulin or a medication that increases insulin production in the body , you have to balance exercise , insulin , and diet . However , many type 2 diabetics are not on insulin , and the most commonly used oral medications for diabetes , such as metformin and sitagliptin , do n't cause low blood sugar at all , no matter how much exercise you do . In fact , exercise is crucial to controlling diabetes , along with weight loss . <p> MYTH : Diabetes means your body does n't produce enough insulin.FACT : This is true in type 1 diabetes , where the pancreas stops producing insulin completely . People who develop type 2 diabetes , which is the most common type of diabetes , usually have sufficient insulin , at least when they are first diagnosed . Their problem is that the insulin does n't work properly . It fails to cause the cells in their bodies to absorb glucose from the food they eat . Eventually their pancreas may stop producing enough insulin , so they will need injections . <p> MYTH : Diabetes means having to give yourself shots , and I ca n't stand needles.FACT : Only people who are on injectable medications need to deal with needles . Today there are insulin pens that do n't require you to inject yourself and blood sugar meters that make drawing blood painless . Plus , there are many new medications that control diabetes without needles or risk of low blood sugar reactions . <p> MYTH : People with diabetes should eat special diabetic foods.FACT : A healthy meal plan for people with diabetes is generally the same as a healthy diet for anyone -- low in saturated and trans fat , moderate in salt and sugar , with meals based on lean protein , non-starchy vegetables , whole grains , healthy fats and fruit . Diabetic and " dietetic " foods generally offer no special benefit . Most of them still raise blood glucose levels , are usually more expensive and can also have a laxative effect if they contain sugar alcohols .

@@10080238 Today , we live in a world that is overshadowed by crime . Even the most serene towns are seeing an increase in delinquent activity . Penal Codes are being amended globally to abate the new types of criminal violations . Even hate speech or words that create dissension are a criminal offence . The word crime originates from the Latin word crimen -- meaning offence . There have been various thoughts and philosophy in tracing and understanding the fact as to why people engage in criminal acts ? What inspires such deviant behaviour ? Has the Law not been a deterrent to crime ? In its basic definition , a crime is an act which is prohibited by the Criminal Code . In other words an act or omission punishable by Law . We must strive to understand that it is punishment -- accountability to a set of rules -- that maintains social order . Whether it is maintaining discipline in a classroom , to playing by the rules in a rugby encounter or driving on an expressway . Society is held together by the knowledge that one must uphold the laws and moral obligations , or in the least form abstain from unethical actions and transgression . <p> In ancient times , when civilization was strongly influenced by superstition , deviant behavior in humans was often attributed to demonology . The understanding was that people who committed crimes such as murder and rape were possessed by evil spirits , for those with a conscience and divine belief could not commit such dark deeds . <p> The father of criminology , Cesare Lombroso , strongly believed that criminals were born . Criminals were throwbacks to primitive beings . He argued that criminals were insensitive and never experienced guilty feelings . During his incarceration at a Florida prison serial killer Ted Bundy , told court that he never felt guilty for the rape and murder of 36 young women , over a killing spree that lasted almost eight years . Lombroso further emphasizes that criminals are incapable of resisting the impulse to commit a crime . However as he further studied deviant nature he also began to realize the impact and influence of social factors that led to criminal activity . <p> There was much scientific research which also supports the claim that there are biological elements that influence criminal tendencies . Some argue that criminality is inherited . Today we can observe a variance to this theory and notice that at times criminal behaviour is copied . A teenager may adopt unethical actions to be accepted into a group of seniors , a street gang for example . Medical research highlights that criminal or deviant attitudes can also be traced to glandular malfunctions and learning disability . <p> A modern study done in the corporate sector also concludes that people are led to commit crime or violent actions due to strain and stress . This is termed as Strain Theory , where people become frustrated due to stressful environments or negative influences of others . This yields to anger . When anger blossoms into a rage , people suddenly shoot co-workers as often witnessed in western countries . <p> Ceasare Beccaria of Italy shed some light on criminal motivation when he states that criminal behavior originates from rewards relating to pleasure . All human actions need some level of inspiration . We seek reward in some form such as cash or social acceptance or recognition . Even criminals plan their dark and foul deeds . They initiate a risk assessment . It requires more planning to rob a bank than to steal a jack fruit form a village garden ! Greater material reward motivates the criminal to advance in crime . Reverting to Ted Bundy his motivation for serial rape and murder was pleasure . This pleasure can be divided into two segments : <p> 1 . Sexual gratification 2 . Control derived over his helpless victims We can even tie Victor Vroom 's ( 1964 ) Theory of Expectancy , to criminal motivation , although this is a management related theory . Victor teaches us that Valence ( Reward ) , Expectancy ( Performance ) and Instrumentality ( Belief of reward ) ultimately combine to yield Motivation . The same fundamentals are true for criminal desires . The once dominant dictator of Uganda , Idi Amin , is a prime example of a criminal mind aspiring for fame and fortune . He envisaged rising to power , whilst still a military cook under the British . He engaged in many crimes , including murder . <p> Sadly , his superior officers failed to punish him . His motivation was fuelled by greed for a luxury life and control . He did achieve this , yet success without dignity is failure . <p> Finally , we reflect on Plato 's theory that criminals are not afraid of punishment . This is so true , and corresponds to any era in history . There is always a loophole in the legal system of any country for a good defense attorney to vindicate an accused . Perhaps this is why Socrates says " Evading punishment is the action of uneducated men . " Punishment must never be understood as being an act of revenge . Laws must be translated to reflect the rehabilitative value of punishment , and must always serve as a deterrent to deviant behavior . The conscience of society must be enlightened .

@@10080239 Kids have a world of their own . There is laughter , tears , anger , frustration and all of that . But they do not deal with these emotions the way grown-ups do . They do not harbour hatred or anger . They want to be themselves , and expect the parents to accept them the way they are . <p> It 's a world which grown-ups , especially parents find difficult to understand , and sometimes comprehend . Pasanga 2 : Haiku is a take on such an issue . <p> The film begins with a quote ' The best classroom for a child is the mother 's womb ' . The film revolves around the quote and points out several aspects that parents fail to keep in mind during pregnancy . <p> The film starts with a timeline of events which starts from the day Divya ( Vidya Pradeep ) and Vidhya ( Bindu Madhavi ) find out that they are pregnant . Their lifestyles , eating habits , mood swings , behavioural patterns , arguments and their work and home environment are descriptively shown during the timeline sequence up until the time the children are born . What follows are a sequence of events that these parents face owing to their hyperactive kids . <p> The film revolves around Kavin ( Nishesh ) and Naina ( Vaishnavi ) , children from these two families , who are frequently pushed from one school to another owing to their hyperactive nature . The parents of these children find it difficult to understand their children and are driven to the extreme level of frustration with their hyperactiveness . <p> Every school that these children attend ends up suspending them citing that they are uncontrollable and are suffering from one illness or the other , forcing the parents to shift from house to house . Eventually , both Kavin and Naina end up going to the same school where Venba ( Amala Paul ) is one of the teachers . Her husband Tamizh Naadan ( Surya ) is a child psychiatrist who helps both families change their attitude towards children . <p> Even though Pasanga 2 primarily revolves around these two children and their parents , it can not be called an out-and-out children 's movie . It deals with several social issues that affect today 's children . The rat race to put the children into a school at a tender age and the lack of open space for children to play in homes are some of the key aspects dealt by Pandiraj . <p> For Pandiraj , dealing with kids is not a new thing . He had already tasted success with similar subjects in movies such as Pasanga ( 2009 ) , and Marina ( 2012 ) earlier . However , this time around he has focused on the issues faced by kids in urban areas . <p> All actors , including Nishesh and Vaishnavi have played their part to perfection . The two kids , their pranks , their tears and their mischievous acts keep us glued to the screen at all times . Karthik Kumar and Ramdoss do justice to their roles as husbands of Vidhya and Divya respectively . Ramdoss also adds to the comic relief through his dialogues and as a kleptomaniac . <p> On the technical side music plays a huge role in conveying mood of the scenes . The moods keep changing frequently and the music compliments the changes accordingly . The usage of flute and violin express the emotions perfectly . The songs too are well placed in the film and do not hamper the flow . This is the second film for composer Arrol Corelli after the horror flick Pisasu . It is a completely different genre from his debut film and he has done justice to the script . <p> Kudos for Surya for funding such a project through his 2D Entertainment . The film is a must watch for parents and those who deal with children on a frequent basis .

@@10080240 ? <p> There 's a saying ' distance ' is often the least of your problems when you 're in a relationship . However , when your significant other has to either go abroad or you do n't meet as often as you used to because life gets in the way , we often blame distance as a cause for all the tension . The real challenge implicit within the long distance equation is the discrepancy between your expectations for the relationship and the reality of your current situation . It is within the ' gap ' between these dual ends of the long distance dynamic that all the long distance relationship problems vacillate . This week , Annie received many emails regarding long distance relationships and means to salvage the sinking ship , probably because the holidays are over and the significant other has to return to his or her work ... <p> Q : Annie , my boyfriend and I were engaged in a very physical relationship ever since we started going out . We eventually fell so in love that it got to the point where I , who hated the idea of marriage did n't mind being married to him . But then he suddenly had to go abroad on a scholarship and we talk all the time , but I have a fear that he might not be as into me as before because we do n't meet physically . What do I do ? A : The three largest problems a long distance relationship often faces are communication problems , relationship problem and psychological problems . The problem you seem to have is the lack of physical intimacy , which comes under the category of relationship problems . However , according to what you said , a lack of physical intimacy would n't be enough to drive away this young man from you . If he prioritizes you over everything else , maintains communication and makes you a part of his world every time , then your relationship is one of the least likely to sink . When he comes back and he will , make sure he knows you feel the same way . <p> Q : Annie , my husband had to go to Australia on a business trip , and he will be taking a co-worker along with him . The said co-worker is actually very pretty , and they will be away for a couple of months . If I ask him not to go , I know he wo n't but I do n't want to be a jealous wife that keeps her husband from achieving new heights in life . What do I do ? A : Jealousy is one of those emotions that eat you from the inside if not handled in the right manner . Well , the first thing to understand is that jealousy is an instinct that we humans have to protect us from losing the person we love . Now , the question is how to express jealousy in the right manner ? And the simple answer to this question is that you have to be reasonable about it . Avoid the two extremes : ignorance and neediness . Let your partner know when you feel jealous and clarify it together , so that it does not " boil " inside your mind . Therefore doing that , instead of trying to repress the feeling , or become over controlling and aggressive as a result . <p> Q : My girlfriend went abroad with her family for a few months and I feel an overwhelming loneliness . Sometimes when she 's busy and ca n't talk to me , I just stare at the ceiling with nothing to do . What do I do , Annie ? A : Loneliness is a common problem that plagues most long distance relationships , at some point or other . The absence of your significant other and an awareness of the long time span that has to elapse until you get to see them in person can make the feeling a rather overwhelming one to bear . I suggest you engage yourself in activities that do n't give you much time to think . Stop revelling in the loneliness and enjoy the time . The more you occupy yourself , the faster the time will travel , and she 'll be back to you in no time .

@@10301233 <h> The UN Determination Relating to Julian Assange and Some Pertinent Lessons for Sri Lanka <p> The UN working group on arbitrary detention has determined that Mr Julian Assange , who has been holed up in the Equadoran Embassy in London as a political refugee for almost four years , was being subject to arbitrary detention by the United Kingdom . The working group said , in addition , that he should be entitled to compensation for being deprived of his freedom of movement . Countries , such as the UK , which assume the elevated role of white hatted human rights enforcers , could have been expected to take this determination seriously <p> Very seriously . After all it was made by a body which some may regard as commanding the highest level of esteem within the UN system and whose determinations are used to name and shame the recalcitrants . But not the UK which sits in splendid judgement and hectors others on the necessity of complying with global standards , especially with those endorsed by the UN and its organs . <p> Ironically the British Foreign Secretary dismissed the working group 's determination as " ridiculous " . The Swedes who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to extradite him . <p> A salutary British lesson to all . Especially to the weak and the meek . <p> The Working Group based its determination on the European Convention on Human Rights and other relevant human rights treaties , including the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights , to which both the UK and Sweden are parties . The UK and Sweden participated in the investigation conducted by the working group and submitted evidence to it . One would have expected these countries to be morally bound if not legally obliged to comply with the final determination , especially given its strong international law foundation . Previously , Myanmar 's Aung San Suu Kyi benefitted from a ruling from this Committee . That determination was followed by a thunderous and pained outcry from the West , with the UK joining the front ranks of the agonized and self-righteous . One could have argued that Ms Suu Kyi had committed a breach of the laws of her country resulting in her detention . <p> Do as I say . But not as I do . <p> One recalls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sri Lanka comply with its international law obligations relating to accountability relying on the report of the Secretary-General 's Panel of Experts ( Darusman Report ) which was later to provide much substance for the report of the High Commissioner for Human Rights and the HRC Resolution of 1 October 2015 . The Darusman Report was denounced by the Sri Lankan authorities as being " highly flawed " . Sri Lanka did not contribute at all to the Darusman endeavour . To say the least , Darusman 's evidence gathering was imaginative and selective , analysis defective and conclusions unlikely to withstand judicial scrutiny . Despite his dubious effort at report writing , Darusman has succeeded in securing further contracts with the UN while another member of the Panel , Yasmin Sooka , has openly appeared on platforms promoting the campaigns of the backers of the defeated terrorist Tamil Tigers . Their objectivity was challenged by many a critic but this did not prevent the UK and others from relying on the Darusman Report to flagelate the Sri Lankan government . <p> Furthermore , the Secretary-General who had publicly maintained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and him alone , on applicable principles of international law and practice on accountability , made the report available in the public domaine without the courtesy of even informing the Sri Lankan government first , despite its numerous and evident shortcomings . A highly irregular action for the head of the UN , bringing in to question the integrity and objectivity of the SG and his senior advisors . But these irregularities had no impact on the pressure piled upon the Sri Lankan government , initiated by a small number of Western governments , who tended to call themselves the " international community " . Convenient double standards , one might suggest ! ! ! <p> What is obvious is the the lack of consistency between the UK government 's reaction to the Darusman Report and the determination of the working group on the arbitrary detention of Mr Assange . Ironically , the UK Minister of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs , Rt Hon Hugo Swire , insisted that Sri Lanka faithfully implement the UN HRC resolution , with its dubious antecedents , including the provisions requiring the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crimes and violations of human rights allegedly committed by Sri Lankan security forces . <p> Secretary-General Ban Ki Moon , joined , expressing support for international participation in such a judicial mechanism . The High Commissioner for Human Rights , Prince Zeid al Hussain , a highly regarded international lawyer , took a similar line , perhaps swept along by the Western enthusiasm for international participation in the judicial mechanism . Importantly , the enormous and destabilising challenges , both legal and political , that will confront the democratically elected government of Sri Lanka in seeking to satisfy the messianic goals of these luminaries seem to have been missed by them . <p> President Sirisena , perhaps conscious of the legal and political mine field of giving domestic effect to a resolution so enthusiastically consponsored by Sri Lankan authorities in a spurt of obsequious accommodation , has said in interviews with the BBC and Al Jazeera , that he was for a purely domestic inquiry mechanism without foreign judges or personnel , because he had faith in the Sri Lankan legal system and processes . In other words , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pursuant to the UNHRC resolution . As Professor Dayan Jayatilleka astutely observed , " An external accountability drive could stimulate a backlash that destabilizes all other gains and Indo-US objectives in Sri Lanka , namely devolution and a stable , liberal , civilian democracy . Grounded and pragmatic , President Sirisena knows that domestic credibility and legitimacy are necessary for domestic survival ... " The Prime Minister has been more nuanced . <p> The HRC , an entity consisting of 47 members elected from the membership of the UN , is resposible for strengthening the promotion and protection of human rights around the globe and for addressing situations of human rights violations . It has the authority only to make recommendations on them . Its mandated goal is to make the world a better place by exerting moral authority and by providing assistance to countries , at their request , not to act as an autonomous human rights enforcer . The creators of the HRC were acutely conscious that such an approach will fail utterly in the contemporary world of sovereign states . No one can honestly claim that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and objectivity , given their ready exploitation to serve political ends . <p> The government of Sri Lanka could take an approach similar to that of the UK in the case of the Assange determination and refuse to implement the UNHRC resolution or implement it consistent with its domestic imperatives . A resolution of the UNHRC has no binding effect as has been amply demonstrated over the years . The only complicating factor is that the resolution was co sponsored by Sri Lanka itself which would create , if nothing else , a moral obligation to comply with it . <p> As to whether Sri Lankan authorities considered all the implications and its options carefully before being carried away by its misplaced enthusiasm to curry favor with its perceived friends in the West remains unexplained . Given that the US and other Western countries were themselves eager , at the time , for a plausible excuse to extricate themselves from the Sri Lankan question , and their barely camouflaged relief at the defeat of Mahinda Rajapaksa , it may have been possible to negotiate a less onerous outcome . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ undermine the newly elected President and the Prime Miniater who are pro - Western . Perhaps the eagerness to be perceived as effusively pro Western , even at the cost of upsetting Sri Lanka 's traditional international sympathisers , may have blinded those who guided the negotiations to the possibility of driving a better bargain . The precedent set could not have been to the liking of many of Sri Lanka 's like minded friends , including India . <p> Other critical issues remain . Whether Sri Lanka 's governing party could muster the parliamentary majority necessary to adopt the requisite legislative measures , including Constitutional amendments , to implement the UNHRC resolution against a background of simmering , and , potentially explosive , discontent in the country remains a daunting challenge . Already considerable divisive resentment has begun to smoulder over the apparent compromise of Sri Lanka 's sovereignty by obsequiously cosponsoring the resolution which recommends the engagement of foreign judicial personel in the investigation of alleged human rights violations and war crimes by a hugely popular military that comprehensively defeated a ruthless terrorist group over six years ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lankans .

@@10315238 <h> Racial Slur On India <p> There was a countrywide uproar in India when about five years ago following a series of ' racial ' attacks on Indian youth in Australia . The outrage in India is equally strong when there are reports of attacks on people of Indian origin or Indian nationals living in the US . Some of these attacks resulted in death . The host countries generally refuted the allegations of a racial angle in the attacks on Indians . But few in India were willing to accept that . <p> Something similar seems to be happening in India . The manner in which a young African woman and a few other African men were treated by the police and violent mob in Bengaluru , the so-called Silicon Valley of India , has brought India the opprobrium of practicing ' racism ' . The country 's image as a ' tolerant ' and ' secular ' democracy has already been under strain in recent months . The Dalits in the country are up in arms after the suicide by a young scholar in Hyderabad who thought he faced discrimination because of his low caste . <p> It hurts India badly because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against racialism in South Africa . In fact , it can be argued that Gandhi would not have become the great freedom fighter and the ' Mahatma ' but for a personal experience of racialism when he was in South Africa . <p> The Bengaluru incident has another worrisome aspect to it . The attack on African youth came after the southern metropolis ' worldwide reputation as a high-tech city came under threat because of increasing number of rapes . The city and the state of Karnataka had also got a bad name for ' intolerance ' towards ' rationalists ' ; and the vigilante groups as moral police have been attacking young couples in public places . Now on top of all that comes a glaring example of ' racism ' . <p> Worrying as it must be for Bengaluru , the fact is that ' racialism ' has existed in India for a long , long time . Most Indians have a thing about ' fair ' and ' dark ' skins . The Dalits have suffered discrimination , another name for racialism , for centuries . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ violence in many parts of India because of their ' Chinky ' looks . <p> About five years ago , there was mass exodus , luckily temporary in nature , of people from the North - east from Bengaluru and other towns in Karnataka because of a fear of violence against people from the North east . The problem was caused by a ' rumour ' but that rumour was taken seriously because it looked plausible in the prevailing atmosphere in the state . <p> True , ' racial ' violence in India is condemned by both the civil society and politicians . Political parties lend their strong voice though only to derive political mileage in some form or the other . And that seems to be the problem and perhaps explains the reason why ' racialism ' or whatever you call it continues to thrive in the country . <p> Most forms of protests and condemnations in the country are in danger of looking like sham exercises because the acts they denounce go on reoccurring . That makes the protests somewhat of a meaningless ritual -- maybe hypocritical . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ various segments of the society all across the country , explaining not only the harm caused by the unacceptable acts but also initiating some ' action ' that makes integration and easy acceptance of people who look ' different ' . <p> It is doubtful if the people in Bengaluru who attacked the African women and men were aware of the damage they were causing -- to their city , state and the country . One can bet that they were even less aware of the importance of having Africans as friends of India . That is because most of the elements who indulge in ' racial ' and similar undesirable activities have very narrow visions and have no chance of being better informed , much less being enlightened . <p> There must be not many Indians , for instance , who realise how important the continent of Africa is going to be in the years to come .

There are other developing countries waiting to attract the African students . <p> Indians have invested heavily in many African countries .

The Africans do not open up when they find an unfriendly atmosphere . It then becomes the duty of the Indians to find ways for regular meetings and interactions . This , however , can be done better at the institutional level . <p> There can be no doubt that the job of making the society more equitable and just is tough . Discrimination of one form or the other has been in vogue in the country for generations . It may be surmised that it has not gone because so far efforts to eliminate it have been inadequate .

Can the Tamil Diaspora tell us Canadians what are the minority rights that they have been denied , other than wanting their mono-ethnic , racist Tamil state , Eelam , carved out of one-third of the island bordered by 66% of the coast line that they have been agitating for since the 1930s . <p> If it is education that they are griping about , they got it . When the riots happened in July 1983 , Jaffna Educational District was well supported and qualitatively superior in comparison with the situation elsewhere in the island . They had 555 Government Schools for a Tamil student population of 207,524 , where as the capital Colombo had only 251 such schools for 231,690 multi-ethnic students . Then the Tamils enjoyed a literacy rate of 88.3% compared to 86.5% for the majority Sinhalese . The Jaffna District schools had 41% of approved science laboratories compared to the all island average of 19.6% . <p> The Tamils had their own University in Jaffna , which they sanitized the student undergraduate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 400 Sinhalese lecturers and undergraduates out of campus on 13th August 1977 , who were brought South in buses escorted by the Army and Police , while the Tamil students enjoyed the privilege of studying in the southern Universities , untouched . On July 18 , 2016 , the Tamil undergraduates at the Jaffna campus brutally attacked the Sinhalese undergraduates and 10 were hospitalized . The Sinhalese undergraduates went home and are refusing to return to campus . So what is the problem the Tamils are griping to the Liberals when they are denying the right for the Sinhalese to be educated ? <p> Was it employment that they feel denied as their minority right ? <p> When the riots happened on July 1983 , the Tamils were holding the senior positions in most Government Departments . The Supreme Court Chief Justice was a Tamil as is now . The Inspector General of Police was a Tamil and so was the Auditor General a Tamil . Senior diplomats posted to Missions abroad , like London , UK , were Tamils too . So what are they griping about And I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Tamils in Sri Lanka today . <p> While the majority Sinhalese can not own one-square-inch of land on the Jaffna peninsula , the Tamils own 75% of prime real estate in Wellawatte , a rich suburb of Colombo , which is Colombo 's Rothwell Heights . And these Tamils refuse to rent an annex to the majority Sinhalese in Wellawatte , Such calculated actions are poison for harmony and a precursor for ethnic trouble . <p> Forty percent of the population in the capital Colombo are Tamils , Inter-marrying with the Sinhalese and living happily ever after . <p> What have they got to reconcile about ? They have already reconciled through their vows of marriage . Fifty-four percent of Tamils live in the South of the island , and they have harmonized their relationships with the majority Sinhalese . And they are happy with themselves . <p> And what is most important to note is that along the mile long strip of shops along Main Street , Pettah in Colombo , every third shop is owned by the Tamils and patronized by the majority Sinhalese . <p> They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already reconciled that they are partners of a multi-ethnic society , <p> I think Canada should stop meddling with Sri Lanka 's domestic politics as we have hurt them too much by aiding and abetting surreptitiously the Tamil Eelam war . Canada let the Tamil Diaspora collect two million dollars a month for 13-long years during the former Liberal Governments of Jean Chretien and Paul Martin to stuff the Tamil Tiger war-chest to purchase war weapons to keep fighting the Tamil cause of separation . <p> " He ( Dion ) also encouraged the Sri Lankan embrace " peaceful pluralism " , the news item reported . This is nothing knew for the Sri Lankans . They enjoyed " peaceful pluralism " for scores of decades , until the Tamil politicians spoilt it for them with their 1977 Vadukkodai Resolution wanting their Eelam for the Tamils even if they had to take up arms . <p> " Canada is strong not despite but because of its diversity , which is a source of openness , acceptance , progress and prosperity . Why should it not become true for Sri Lanka @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simple . Remember , Canada had its worrying days too with Quebec wanting to separate , In Sri Lanka 's case , ask the Tamil separatist politicians to come down from their high-horses and give up their wanting to win their mono-ethnic racist cause wanting their mythical Tamil Eelam .

@@13854234 <h> From Lanka 's ... to the Rio Olympics <p> August 15 , 2016 , 8:17 pm <p> By Dr. Rohan H Wickramasinghe <p> Several years ago the waters of the Beira Lake in the heart of Colombo changed colour practically overnight to a bright green . This gave rise to considerable bewilderment and comment and word was conveyed to President Premadasa that an industrialist had dumped a large quantity of green paint into the Beira . Acting on this advice , President Premadasa instructed the Police to investigate the matter immediately and identify who was responsible for this . <p> At the time of this incident , the Central Environmental Authority ( CEA ) had ( after a long delay since being set up ) commenced functioning . The matter concerning the Beira Lake was raised at the next Board Meeting and the investigation as to who was responsible for the dumping of green paint was discussed . Professor B. A. Abeywickreme , former Vice-Chancellor of the University of Colombo , who was a Board Member , did not join in the speculations , which were being batted around , but looked thoughtful and asked that a sample of the Beira waters be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ university . This was done and he phoned the writer the same afternoon to say that he had examined the specimen under the microscope and had found that the green colour of the Beira water was not caused by paint but by a profusion of minute ( single cell ) green algae . ( This was confirmed independently later , when this writer was walking along the embankment of the Beira that evening looking at the green water . A street urchin on a bicycle , guessing what was attracting the writer 's attention shouted " parsi , parsi " ( algae ) at him ! ) The writer reported Professor Abeywickreme 's conclusion to the Officer-in-Charge ( OIC ) of the Kollupitiya Police in order that he could call off his sleuths , who were engaged in investigating who was dumping green paint into the Beira . The OIC was extremely grateful for this information as he was under pressure from the President 's Office to expedite his inquiry and identify the culprits responsible . <p> The green colour acquired practically overnight by the Beira was due to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have taken place when a body of water has acquired levels of dissolved nutrients sufficient to exceed a ' tipping point ' for a " bloom " of micro-organisms , such as unicellular green algae , to occur . The tipping point may be influenced by factors such as the presence of water plants ( eg. Water Hyacinth , a native of the Amazon Basin ) . <p> ( This is not the place to enter into a treatise on Water Hyacinth , which is considered an invasive or pest species in most tropical regions where it has been introduced . However , its pretty blue flowers lead to it being considered an ornamental species commanding a price of well over $5.00 per plant from some vendors in the US ! Its practical uses include ' bioremediation ' or ' phyto-remediation ' meaning growing it in polluted waters , such as sewage effluents , to make use of its ability to take up compounds of excessive phosphorus or nitrogen or those of pollutants such as lead , mercury or strontium-90 . Other uses described include the production of bioenergy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water hyacinth plants in the Beira at the time it changed colour indicated that the content of relevant dissolved nutrients ( presumably principally nitrogen and phosphorus ) in the water exceeded the capacity of the plants available to absorb them . A very likely source of these dissolved nutrients in this location would have been the discharge of sewage . <p> The foregoing preamble is presented as an introduction to an observation made by the writer while following some of the events staged at the ' Olympics 2016 ' presently ongoing in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil . He was surprised to observe that a swimming pool shown on the screen had water that was undeniably green . Others had , of course , observed this as well and in the ' Comments ' section on the computer screen it was remarked on and there were speculations as to the cause . Going by our Beira experience the first thought that crossed my mind was that this was a case of ' eutrophication ' . However , on second thoughts , I dismissed that possibility as not being possible in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though , it was reported in THE ISLAND of 11 August 2016 by Rebecca Bryan and Talek Harris that ' Green Water -- In diving , competitors were perplexed to find the water had turned from light blue to green overnight , although organizers insisted it was safe .

If it is a case of eutrophication , the nature of the pollutant should be ascertained . The capacity of an Olympic swimming pool is not that of a small puddle and the amount of dissolved pollutant necessary to cause eutrophication is correspondingly greater .

@@13854235 <h> Government 's decisiveness ... all round support <p> August 15 , 2016 , 8:19 pm <p> By Jehan Perera <p> The issue of fulfilling the pledges made to the international community in Geneva seemed to threaten the unity of the government even a month ago . In October 2015 the government co-sponsored the resolution on Sri Lanka that was sponsored by the United States and backed by the majority of countries in the UN Human Rights Council . There were publicly articulated differences of opinion in which Foreign Minister Mangala Samaraweera sought to reassure the international community that the government would be standing by its pledges while President Maithripala Sirisena sought to reassure the ethnic majority population that the country 's sovereignty would not be jeopardized or the soldiers who fought in the war would not be hauled before international tribunals . <p> The passage of the law setting up the Office of Missing Persons ( OMP ) has laid to rest doubts regarding the government 's commitment , and ability , to take forward the reconciliation process , to remain politically strong within the country and also to deliver on the promises it made in Geneva . The OMP is one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in response to the international pressure for Sri Lanka to agree to international mechanisms to ensure accountability for war crimes and serious human rights violations . The other three mechanisms are a truth commission , an office of reparations and a special court . <p> Due to co-sponsoring the UN Human Rights Council resolution in October 2015 that was originally intended to establish a hybrid special court , the government was able to reduce the international role in the investigation of the past . The government was able to negotiate and obtain a resolution in which the international role was open to interpretation . The current approach indicates that the international community will only be able to participate as advisors and experts , not as decision makers in Sri Lanka 's internal processes . However , the government 's acceptance of even a reduced international role in probing the past has been highly controversial in Sri Lanka as the opposition has been using it to mobilize the nationalist sentiment of the ethnic majority against the government . <p> GOVERNMENT STRENGTH <p> The passage of the OMP bill in parliament without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parliament that comes from the UNP-SLFP alliance has given it enormous decision making power that the opposition has no answer to . With the SLFP component of the government falling in line with President Sirisena 's support for the OMP bill , there was an overwhelming parliamentary majority ready to vote in favour of the bill . So long as the government leadership , in particular the President and the Prime Minister , are united on any matter it will not be possible for the opposition to stall them in parliament . <p> Unlike in the case of other controversial issues such as the VAT tax rate on which parties such as the JVP are also critical of the government , in the case of the OMP all parties in parliament with the exception of the Joint Opposition were in favour of passing the bill . The Joint Opposition was numerically too small to stand in the way of the passage of the bill through a vote . This may explain why they took the rowdy alternative of imagining themselves at a street demonstration in parliament . Not only did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , propose their amendments if any and thereby educate the general public . They also lost the opportunity to vote as they were too busy demonstrating when the vote took place . <p> It was unfortunate that those who were human rights champions in the 1980 and 1990s , and widely admired for this , displayed their opposition to OMP by word and deed . A widely circulated poster on social media was of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa , who was then an ordinary opposition MP , calling for a meeting of the Mothers Front , an umbrella group of organizations that supported the rights of victims during the period of the JVP insurrection at the end of the 1980s and early 1990s . The underlying rationale of the OMP is not much different from the message on the poster that former president Rajapaksa was bold enough to put out two decades ago . It is that people , whatever their ethnicity or political affiliation , need to know what happened to their loved ones so that they can stop the endless search for them . <p> MAXIMUM EFFORT <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happened to those missing that stretch back decades and the insurrections that took place in both the North and South of the country and were bloodily suppressed . The OMP is to help them to end the search , and to bring closure to that open wound that exists in the body politic . The OMP law constitutes the maximum effort that the Sri Lankan state can take to find out where they are if they are living and if not living what happened to them . This is why the law provides that evidence that is not admissible in courts of law is admissible in the OMP investigation . This is also why evidence that is confidential is permissible , which even the Right to Information Act can not access . <p> The OMP is a very important element of the country 's transitional justice process and the set of institutions and measures outlined by the government . But it is only one part of the process of transitional justice . After the successful passage of the OMP bill in parliament , government spokespersons have said that the government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to deal with accountability ( and punishment ) issues and an office of reparations . These additional mechanisms that the government has still to set up will offer more avenues for truth and accountability seeking . Truth , justice and reconciliation will be delivered via the totality of these bodies , and not just the OMP . <p> The swift passage of the OMP bill into law in parliament is a possible prototype for the reconciliation mechanisms that are to follow . Foreign Minister Mangala Samaraweera has said that the next mechanism that will be making its appearance will be the Truth Seeking Commission . The government is awaiting the outcome of the deliberations of the Consultations Task Force that it has appointed . The Consultation Task Force on Reconciliation Mechanisms ( CTF ) was appointed by the Prime Minister in January 2016 to conduct public consultations on the design of the four mechanisms that would advance truth , justice and reconciliation in Sri Lanka . <p> GLOBAL SUPPORT <p> The task force headed by veteran human rights activist Manouri Muttuwegama has already come out with a comprehensive and intensive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience of a wide range of persons affected by disappearances , including those who experienced the war in the North and East , families of servicemen missing in action , disappearances from the hill country Tamil Community , fishermen of all ethnicities who disappeared in waters in the North and East of Sri Lanka , disappearances attributed to the LTTE and other armed militant groups , or occurring in the context of the political violence of 1987-91 period . <p> The submissions made to the task force raised concerns about the lack of public awareness of the government 's intentions and objectives with regard to the reconciliation process and the OMP , and the lack of official information available on the consultations , which also impairs public participation . The lack of awareness on the OMP bill among victim families for instance contributes to their feeling of isolation and marginalisation by the government . Some submissions recognise the need for a public awareness campaign in the South to address the lack of awareness and to counter racist rhetoric . <p> With the passage of the OMP bill it appears that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high . The United States was the first country to welcome the OMP , even before local groups could get round to it .

" Interestingly it was the US which was also the driving force behind the UNHRC resolution that started in 2009 and went on getting stronger and stronger till 2015 , when the present government succeeded in reversing the worsening trend . <p> The visit of the Norwegian Prime Minister Erna Solberg and the welcome accorded to her , with even welcoming billboards announcing her presence , was no doubt in appreciation of the role played by that country in Sri Lanka 's economic development and reconciliation processes over the decades .

Rights Of IDPs <p> A new National policy on war displaced , which was approved by the cabinet last week , will ensure the rights of internally displaced persons is protected and all their issues are addressed . <p> The full cabinet paper submitted by the Minister of Prison Reforms , Rehabilitation , Resettlement and Hindu Religious Affairs D.M. Swaminathan and seen by The Sunday Leader , goes into detail on all the issues concerning war displaced which needs to be addressed . <p> The policy paper notes that the provision of durable solutions to displacement , whether this is return to places of origin , local integration , or relocation in other areas of the country , is central to addressing the rights of IDPs and displacement-affected populations . <p> The provision of durable solutions is also inextricably linked with the wider political task of healing the wounds of war and forging a strong sense of unity within a diverse polity . <p> The policy takes a conflict-sensitive approach , paying due regard to the perspectives of the various groups of displaced communities , as well as communities hosting IDPs , to ensure that assistance is designed and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , strengthens peace and promotes justice , unity and reconciliation . <p> Minister Swaminathan notes in the policy paper that the rights of IDPs must be respected , protected and fulfilled while they remain in displacement , and at all stages of their search for durable solutions . More than six years after the war , it is time for urgent and comprehensive solutions that leave noone behind . <p> The new government has since 2015 made its intention clear that the displacement relating to the war needs to be urgently addressed and durable solutions found for IDPs , returning refugees and those who have chosen settlement options but are still struggling to find durable solutions . <p> The development of the National policy has been based on wide-ranging consultations with key stakeholders , both in the war-affected areas and the centre , consultations that began in June 2015 and culminated with a presentation to , and endorsement by , the National Steering Committee ( NSC ) on resettlement in Colombo on 21 March 2016 . <p> The draft also drew upon earlier efforts to address the displacement issue including @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ report which recognised the importance of finding durable solutions for IDPs in the medium and long term and noted that , absent this , " a sustainable and all-inclusive reconciliation process can not be achieved . " It incorporated the findings of the September 2008 National Consultation on the Status of Internally Displaced Persons ( due to conflict ) within the framework for Durable Solutions ; the Draft bill on Protection of IDPs ( 2008 August , Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka ) and the MoR 's Draft Resettlement Policy ( 2013 ) . While the government has taken measures , including drawing up this policy , with a view to rapidly ending the war-related displacement , this policy notes that for specific populations the struggle to achieve durable solutions , particularly in securing adequate shelter , employment , safety , security , and equal access to essential services , may take longer and will require targeted assistance . <p> Land to be returned <p> One of the major obstacles noted in the police to address the IDP issue is the land issue , particularly the occupation of civilian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policy notes that Ministry of Defence in coordination with the Ministry of Law and Order must ensure that an accurate mapping is made of all land that is or was owned , claimed or used by civilians and is currently occupied by any of the three security forces -- army , navy or air force -- or by the police . <p> All such lands , particularly private land , should be released and returned to civilian use and ownership urgently , unless the State determines that it is required for public purpose . <p> The policy paper also notes that the purpose , be it national security or development , should be carefully scrutinised , including to ascertain that no alterative land can be found for the stated purpose . This also means , inter alia , releasing land that is being used by the military for purposes not related to security including but not limited to agricultural production , tourist enterprises , or recreation . It must be ensured that land that is released is made safe from unexploded ordnance or other sources of danger , and returned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and owners for their residential or economic pursuits . <p> The National policy also notes that there are a number of cases where government departments and authorities , including but not limited to the Forest Department , Wildlife Department , Archaeology Department , Mahaweli Authority , and Urban Development Authority , have demarcated lands for state usage that were formerly owned and occupied by persons now in displacement , sometimes without consulting district and provincial level authorities or adequately informing those affected . <p> " It is imperative that the relevant Ministries take steps to address this practice and to take corrective measures to ensure that the land and property rights of those being prevented from returning to their land and/or property are recognised , " the policy paper notes . <p> It says where government departments or authorities have gazetted or otherwise laid claim to land belonging to displaced persons , these cases need to be reviewed in consultation with district-level authorities in a transparent manner , and where possible the land must be restored to the rightful owner . <p> The National policy also states that in exceptional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purposes , then this land will be acquired as per the existing laws . Those affected must be accorded their full rights in accordance with Sri Lankan law and national standards , including the NIRP . The owners/former occupants of that land and property must receive acceptable alternative land , and/or appropriate compensation for their lost land/property . <p> For persons who have to relocate , needs such as shelter and livelihood should be met , access to essential services should be provided and social integration issues should be addressed . <p> Assisting refugees to return <p> The government has also been told to take policy decisions and actions to address key problems faced by refugees who are attempting to return . This includes , inter alia , outreach and information campaigns to refugee communities abroad , facilitating the provision of key identification documents , assisting refugees to transport goods and personal possessions acquired in exile , ensuring that refugee returnees will be eligible to receive the same types of assistance that are available to IDP returnees , ensuring that educational and professional qualifications earned abroad are recognised where applicable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ programmes are conducted without undue delays . <p> Targeted assistance programmes , including for livelihoods and for social integration , need to be developed . <p> Refugee returns are likely to continue over a period of several years and will extend beyond the period targeted for ending internal displacement . While the Ministry of Resettlement will play an active role in this task , including in ensuring more effective monitoring of refugee returnees at the district level , Swaminathan says it will require the assistance of other ministries including Education , Health and Social Services amongst others . <p> The policy recognises that displaced persons , returning refugees and displacement affect communities are not just recipients of assistance but also key partners in governance , development and peace , and play a vital role in finding and implementing durable solutions for themselves . <p> The policy also recognises community-based organisations ( CBOs ) , non-governmental organisations ( NGOs ) , citizens ' committees , other civil society actors and humanitarian agencies , and relevant private sector actors -- both national and international -- as partners in dealing with the issue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take the proposed National policy forward , it has been proposed that In the Northern and Eastern Provinces , the Provincial Governor and the Chief Minister convene and co-chair regular Provincial Steering Committee meetings , which bring together members of the Provincial Council and relevant officials at the district and divisional level . <p> These committees will be established to ensure that assistance and development needs and the protection of IDPs , refugee returnees and displacement-affected individuals and communities are provided for and integrated into national and provincial economic plans , housing and infrastructure programmes , livelihood projects , and other areas of durable solutions support falling within their responsibility . <p> In every district where there are IDPs or refugee returnees , a Grievance Panel will be established to hear , decide and act on complaints filed by IDPs or refugee returnees and other persons of concern under this policy .

@@13944235 -- Bimal Rathnayake <p> by Thushari Nathaniel <p> JVP MP Bimal Rathnayake is of the view that the OMP bill passed last Tuesday is a step taken in the right direction and that the government should have established a truth and reconciliation commission right after the war ended to deal with the grievances people had at the time . Instead , he said , the government let them fester . In an interview with The Sunday Leader he said that mistrust they have in the central government now deepened . He added that it is not so easy now to erase that notion from the minds of the Tamils . <p> Following are excerpts of the interview : <p> Q : The Office of Missing Persons ( OMP ) bill was passed last Tuesday and the JVP was in favour of the bill . What is your view on the OMP bill ? <p> A : We do need such a law and state mechanism to deal with issues of missing persons . Since 1971 , thousands have disappeared without a trace . These disappearances have taken place within periods of numerous struggles . However justice has never been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the police , military establishments and numerous other organisations , so far none of these cases have been properly investigated and no clear verdict has been given as to what actually has happened to them . <p> Therefore , it is of utmost importance to have such a State mechanism to investigate the thousands of disappearances , as most of them have been done by past governments . We also believe that having such an institution will be very helpful in the future as well in similar situations . We in fact supported this bill because of these factors . <p> Q : There are allegations that the OMP does not have to abide by the country 's laws . Do you agree with this claim ? <p> A : None other than the Rajapaksa clan , who broke every law in this country , went above even the judiciary and even threw out the chief justice according to their whims , no one make these allegations . Bills first passed by the Supreme Court before they reaches parliament . The Supreme Court has not highlighted that the OMP bill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is well within the legal framework of the country . However , although OMP has no issues concerning the laws of the country , we identified three issues in this bill which may cause political issues . So we pointed those issues out and they were amended . <p> Q : What were these issues ? <p> A : The OMP was given the authority to enter into agreements with local or foreign organisations . We wanted that phrase removed and the government amended it . The next was that the OMP had been given the authority to inspect any institution or premises that they believe holding someone . We wanted that clause amended too , because it would be used to disrepute any organisation or institution for political reasons . <p> The other one was that when relatives have given the OMP information on a missing person or information that a person is being detained at a particular location , the OMP could can go there and return claiming nothing was found . Hence we forwarded an amendment to that clause that in the event the OMP enters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entry , they should submit a report to the IGP on their investigation . With this amendment , they can not raid any place without proper information ; neither can they investigate it for whatever reason . <p> This too was amended . The other was that the OMP was given the provisions to gather funds . However , we felt that a State institution need not gather funds from external projects . This clause too was amended because of our objections . With those amendments , this act was approved and passed properly . <p> Q : Are the JVP satisfied with the work carried out by the government so far ? <p> A : No , we are certainly not completely happy with the actions of the government . This OMP bill too was something that should have been done right after the war . Disappearances also occurred . However , other issues that took place during the war cover a wide spectrum . During that period the government security forces as well as non-governmental forces were said to have harassed people . Some people had to face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ factions of people harassed other factions of the community . <p> That is why right after the war , on May 27 , 2009 , we suggested that the government should establish a truth and reconciliation commission . Had they done that , any victimised person/s could have come to the commission and they could have taken action as per the judiciary of this country providing justice to such people . <p> Now what has happened is the government is trying to treat the wound without properly cleaning it . Therefore , setting up this OMP will not cure overnight all the grievances that the Tamil people suffer . Geneva suggested even the OMP act . It is something that this government has to do . Had we done this earlier , no foreign country could have interfered in the affairs of our country . <p> Q : Do n't you think that the Tamils too should make an effort to achieve reconciliation ? <p> A : I think that the general public has no issue in this regard . The Tamils too do n't want any divisions or separate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the North too , extremists operate . They want the State separated for their own political survival . <p> For example , certain Tamil leaders who are unable to share the water from the Iranamadu tank want the central government to divert water from Moragahakanda to the North -- this they know is a sheer impossibility . But they are just doing it to indicate that they are the ones fighting for the rights of the Tamils in the North . But the people I think are smarter now , and they will not get hoodwinked by these cheap tactics . <p> Some of these extremist Tamil parties contested the election , and but they got defeated . This clearly shows how they see these extremist leaders . Similar to those in the North , the Rajapaksa group in the South is also doing the same .

If I happen to agree with Mahinda Rajapaksa , I will have to label him as the number one traitor . This missing persons issue first came into Sri-lankan socio-political vocabulary in the 1980s .

Can he deny it today ? He and Vasudeva named the action of the then UNP government as ' State Terrorism . ' Therefore , if Mahinda considers the screening of any wrongdoers in the army , police and state political goon for enforced abduction , extra judicial killings as treacherous , he is the pioneer traitor in this country .

To Become Gypsies ! <p> Hiran Yattowita <p> by Ashanti Warunasuriya <p> Dumbara Nindagama has a key significance in the recent social discussions regarding land issues . For many years , the residents of Dumbara Nindagama have been doing everything they could to obtain legal titles to their ancestral lands . Although this issue was reported in the media from time to time , it received little attention from the authorities . As such the residents are continuously being harassed and oppressed by corrupt politicians and their stooges . <p> Over the last few years the situation has turned from bad to worse as these politicos and their henchmen have been accused of ripping off the lush green forests in Dumbara Kiri Ella area that expands up to 8,317 acres in a massive timber racket . According to the residents in the area this operation is sphere headed by a powerful politician and his high profile underworld partner . In order to find out whether there is any undue political influence over this issue , Minister John Seneviratne was asked about the relevant powerful SLFP politician in the area . According to him , this whole area had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cleared due to human settlement . Pointing out that there are constant conflicts between the Nadun Raja Maha Viharaya and the people in the area , the minister said that there have been recent allegations about an illegal timber racket . However , he said that the issue was not brought to his attention in recent times and said that he had been engaged in both protecting the lands that belongs to the temple as well as giving appropriate lands to the people . <p> The Dumbara Kiri Ella area also comes under his political authority . His statement also backs the claim that illegal deeds are being carried out in this area . As the residents have complained , these racketeers have robbed valuable trees from 12 villages that belong to -4 GS divisions in the Dumbara area as well as trees in forest reserves . This ongoing racket has destroyed many endemic and rare plants that are unique to this area , while the responsible authorities have been disturbingly " quiet and ignorant " about this atrocity , many villagers say . Accusing the Kiriella police , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ police have taken steps against those who come to the police to make a complaint against these atrocities . <p> Hiran Yattowita <p> Accordingly , " The Sunday Leader " hopes that this issue would soon come to an end . It was the names of Hiran Yatowita , husband of MP Hirunika Premachandra , and the Notorious " Weli Chula " that were mentioned with regards to the alleged timber racket . However , attempts made to obtain a comment from the parliamentarian over the allegation were unsuccessful . <p> When queried from the Police media unit regarding this issue , they denied any knowledge of the matter . Thus we contacted the Officer in charge of the Kiriella police station IP Bandara . He too was not aware of an ongoing timber racket . Instead , he refused to comment on the subject as the matter has been taken before Supreme and District courts . Although they had not received any reports about illegal timber rackets , he said that matters regarding the land ownership in the Nindagama have been directed to the courts . However , civil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The police would continue to preserve the peace and help the judiciary decide what is right , Mr. Bandara said . He emphasised that the police can not arrest anyone under civil law and that the land issue has been referred to the court . In 1909 the lands in Dumbara has been released by the British Colonial government for the use of its inhabitants . However , in 1994 , the chief incumbent monk at the Nadun Raja Maha Vihara , Ven . Handapangoda Wimala thero has started a dispute with the villagers claiming that the area belongs to the temple . Due to these issues , the villagers have even set up an organisation to protect the Dumbara area . At present Ven . Handapangoda Mahinda thero is the chief incumbent monk of the Nadun viharaya . According to villagers , 2500 acres of land that had belonged to a traditional Nindagam land in Dumbara had been leased out to Horana Plantation Company for 30 years by Mahinda thero and he has been harassing the villagers claiming that the remaining 5500 acres of land also belongs to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to over 2500 families at present . In 2012 the villagers had complained to the then Minister for Land Janaka Bandara Tennakoon about their plight . Accordingly a four person committee had been appointed by the minister to provide recommendations to solve the land issue in 2014 . The committee has decided that the lands had belonged to the people and had recommended giving the land back to the people . Furthermore , a petition that had been filed against the villagers at the Ratnapura District court has been dismissed . The petitioners had appealed to the Civil Appellate High Court and the case it still being heard . <p> After hearing the story of the villagers we then asked the chief incumbent monk of the Nadun Raja Maha Vihara Ven . Mahinda Thero for his side of the story . " There is a group of people who are against the temple . If the lands are truly theirs then they can prove their title at the court and get it cleared . Although we went to court against this matter the court removed the sanction . During the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my knowledge . These lands come under the Buddhist Temporalities Ordinance . They can not do so . We complained to Mahanayake theroes , the President and the Land Minister to get it stopped . There are many court decisions that had been issued regarding the Nindagama . As they are unable to prove their ownership these people are trying to lie about it " the thero said . As Mahinda thero justified his action , we asked about the alleged lease of 2500 acres of land to Horana Plantation Company for 30 years . In response , the thero said , " Yes . The land has been leased . They must root out old rubber trees and must plant new trees . Apart from that there is no timber racket that is going on there " . <p> According to Mahinda thero there is no timber racket in Dumbara and he is not involved in the land disputes in the area . " The law is not in my hands . If anyone thinks this is illegal he can take legal action against me . We have all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> After querying both parties , we also sought out the opinion of former JVP provincial councilor in the area Mr. Pushpakumara regarding the matter . He said that this issue had been dragged on for many years and said that the biggest question is the extent of land that has been claimed by the temple . Claiming that there is no clear information about an ongoing timber racket , the JVPer said that the disputes had escalated during the 2004-2008 time period when the CEB had taken steps to provide electricity to the villagers . He however said that the government should give priority to the needs of the people . However , further information has revealed that while a court case between the monk and the villagers had been dismissed , a group of villagers had cut down trees in an area above the waterfall and had sold the timber . Since the monk had been unable to stop the action , it had later been halted from a Supreme Court order . According to the law , permission of the Central Environmental Authority must be sought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acres . Many of these villagers had been living inside this 8317 acre land for several generations . Yet they still have not received any deeds for these lands .

Those who have lived in these lands for many generations can not be removed by force . Those days we tried to get deeds from the temple . Even the incumbent monk agreed to it . But the whole scheme was disrupted by a separate group . This issue must be resolved soon . There are 3000 acres of more land that is still disputed over ownership . However the residents must be given their due rights . We can not remove those who we had settled in these areas after building the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solution for this issue . Since the matter is now being heard at the Supreme Court nothing can be done till it 's resolved , " he said . When asked why the issue was not resolved during the previous government , the MP said , " A committee was appointed to survey the land and to prepare the deeds . But that programme has now been stopped . So we urge this government to restart the program . " <p> Luckily , the Kiriella bridge had been opened before the election . Many other development works have grounded to a halt . However , according to local politicians , the temple had supported the development work that had been going on in the area . It was also heard that Mahinda thero is said to be willing to give the land to the villagers if they are willing to accept that the land belongs to the temple . Accordingly we asked Mahinda thero whether he is willing to give the land to the people . " I 'm working under the Buddhist Temporalities Act . I can not go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these lands are now trying to spread false allegations . These lands can not be surveyed without informing the temple . I am trying to formulate a programme to give legal titles of these lands to the people . But that has to be done properly , " the thero said . <p> However , there are no records to prove a possible timber racket . But these people can not be compelled to live in their ancestral lands as gypsies forever . According to the villagers if they receive titles to their lands most of their problems would be solved . Hence the government must direct its attention towards the task . Accordingly we asked the Land minister of the present government T.B . Ekanayake about the government 's stance over the issue . He made a positive response claiming that the problem is known to him and the delimitations are being carried out by the Uva provincial council . The minister also said that he would look into the possibilities of releasing the land to the people in accordance with the Buddhist Temporalities Ordinance. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @

" Had they been so transparent we request them to go through a government audit , " Salley alleged . <p> " For example if they collect Rs. 10,000 from the mosques they deposit around Rs. 8,000 and Rs. 2,000 goes to their pocket which does not appear in any of the audits or the accounts " , lamented one of the officials of the Wakf Board @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the audit , they added . <p> Salley stressed that if the department is to be audited by the government they will not be able to vandalise the charity funds that were given to the board as they request for all the vouchers , cheque books , receipts and questions over , if they fail to submit proper documents . " The Dewatagaha mosque alone had given nearly Rs. 7 million after I took office and the trustees of the mosques all around the country want to know what happened to the money sent to the wakf Board , " Salley said . <p> And also , over Rs. 30 million worth of charity funds which are under the maintenance of one of the clerks in the department is yet to be audited . <p> Meanwhile , Salley also alleged that on the instructions of the minister secretary Fahim , the selection of trustees is done during the weekend so that the officials of the board could enjoy the benefits from the ministry as they use ministry vehicles to travel outstation to enjoy the weekend , <p> Buildings and construction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ department to undergo a government audit , all the charity funds as well as the expenditures approved by the executive committee under the influence of the Ministry Secretary , could have been well managed saving millions of rupees that could have been used in the completion of the building of the ministry . <p> Even though the foundation for the Ministry building construction was laid in 2006 , it had not been completed to date . It was learnt that the government had recently allocated money to complete three floors out of nine , but the department is in need of proper building spaces for the Wakf Tribunal and the Board . Salley further stated that had the ministry have properly managed their financial management and audited their accounts they could have easily managed to complete the construction of all the nine floors as the department has adequate money in possession . <p> Due to the weakness of the former Director for Department of Muslim Religious And Cultural Affairs the construction was abandoned but the current minister A.

It lacks a proper court room for the judges as well as an auditorium which has become a major issue in the department . <p> Meanwhile , allegations have been levelled against the minister for failing to handle the Wakf Board properties in the country . Salley claimed that number of lands and buildings worth of several millions that belong to the Ministry are not taken care of as some private individuals sublet the buildings on 99 years lease . Nevertheless , given the circumstances the ' Temple Law ' amended in the parliament stipulates that noone can own the properties of the temple at any time and the law should be applied even to the properties of mosques , Salley stressed . <p> Removing of the Secretary <p> Meanwhile , the former secretary to the Ministry , Mr. Majeed was removed from his position during the election by the election commissioner in the claim of using ministry vehicles for election campaigns which is considered a violation of the law . <p> But it was alleged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minister 's brother Fahim in the intention of getting him removed as he would not dance according to their tunes . Following the removal of the former secretary , Fahim had appointed many private employees under his influence to which he has no right , for he is only a co-ordinating secretary to the minister . <p> Adding insult to the injury , it is learnt that the minister is not aware of what his brother does using his influence while he is also alleged to have been threatened the employees who attempted to voice against him . <p> Moreover , it was revealed that it has been four months since a burglary took place in the Department of Muslim Religious And Cultural Affairs but a detailed report on it is yet to be submitted by the officials . It was suspected to be an inside job and no one knows what documents were removed to date . It is unfortunate that the ministry seems to turn a blind eye on investigating into the case . " The doors of the department were not damaged nor the locks were broken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some officials in there who are behind it , " protested Salley . <p> In addition , several allegations were levelled against the secretary Mr. Fahim as he interferes with trustees ' appointments , activities of Wakf tribunal and Wakf board which he has no right to while , he also dictates the members of the Board on what to do , Salley added . <p> However , it is unfortunate that All Ceylon Jamiyyathul Ulama ( ACJU ) which is one of the powerful bodies and capable of handling the Muslim affairs turns a blind eye to the money vandalizing in the Ministry . It is the responsibility of all the institutions under the department of Muslim affairs to voice against the illegal and influential activities taking place in the ministry , Salley added . <p> Minister responds <p> Responding to The Sunday Leader the Minister H. Hasheem said that he completely denies all the allegations levelled against him and the ministry as there were no ministers for the Muslim Religious Affairs during the previous regime , and it will take some time to organise and to make it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accounts can be audited by a private auditor approved by the board and if there will be a need for a government audit we are ready to do that too .

He further stated that he is unaware of a clerk being appointed to look into 30 million charity funds and will look into the matter . <p> The Minister also claimed that it has been two years since he took office and since then the ministry is looking into issues that were not solved before . New lawyers were being appointed to look into the properties that belong to the ministry and they will soon sort out the problems one by one . <p> When questioned about the burglary that took place in the department the minister said that they followed the usual procedure and lodged a complaint but it was confirmed that nothing was lost hence , there was no need for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ claimed that none of the appointments to the ministry can be made by the minister or the secretary to the minister for there is a Post General Manager to do that .

@@13944239 <h> We 're Giving ... Our Fullest Support -- D. Sidharthan <p> by Thushari Nathaniel <p> PLOT leader and TNA MP D. Sidharthan says he has confidence in the current regime that it will deliver justice to the Tamil people . He said that even though the government has good intentions , they implement these mechanisms extremely slow , so the Tamil people are fast losing faith in the government . In an interview with The Sunday Leader he said that the passing of the Office of Missing Persons ( OMP ) Bill was also a good sign that the government is doing its best for the Tamil people . He , however , said that it is far too early to comment on this issue and time will prove the government 's sincerity . <p> Following are excerpts of the interview ; <p> Q : OMP bill was passed Thursday without a vote . How confident are you that the OMP bill will ensure justice for the Tamil people ? <p> A : What is more important is the implementation of the bill than passing it . Any bill can be passed but there is no purpose if it can not be implemented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be seen . Only time will prove if OMP will be of any use . This we can not decide at this juncture . We have to wait and see . <p> The implementation is the most important factor , and we must see who will be appointed to this commission and what powers will be given to them etc . The bill as it is now may contain some weaknesses ; but TNA amendments and all , it 's a good start . The government has stepped in the right direction . As the co-sponsors of the UN resolution , they have started moving in the right direction . However , it 's too early to speculate . <p> Q : Former president Mahinda Rajapaksa had said that anyone who supported the bill was a traitor to the country and its armed forces . Do you agree ? <p> A : I think it 's more of a political statement . It will not happen that way . I do n't think that the OMP has powers to indict anyone . What Mahinda said should not be taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statement . <p> Q : As many Tamil organisations have expressed , do you find some lack of focus on accountability in this bill ? <p> A : Yes it does ; still I think that this is just a start in right direction . I witnessed the turmoil in parliament when this bill was brought in , so it must move slowly . <p> On the accountability factor , the government has made many promises , and I feel that their promises are genuine . However , we can not predict anything at this point ; we should wait and see how things progress . The country 's situation is such that we have to give it time . <p> Q : The OMP was established during the previous regime . How do you see the commission doing anything different now ? <p> A : At that time the commission was functioning under the president . This time it 's under the laws of the country . That is the main difference . This government is also a party to the UN resolution and they have made certain commitments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time the commitment is more serious . If the government fails to keep their promises , the international community will lose faith in them . So there is a vast difference between the previous government 's and that of the present one . We believe that this government will keep their pledges . <p> Q : What are the drawbacks that you see of the OMP bill ? <p> A : I really ca n't say at this point . Right now , all we see is the joint opposition 's disapproval of this bill . They are on the view that this bill will betray the army , which I do n't agree with . Other than that , I do n't see anything negative about this bill right now , mainly on the political side . <p> Q : The government made certain pledges to the UN that the foreign judges will be included in the investigations . However they later stated that no foreign judges will be accommodated . Under this backdrop , how credible do you think the current regime is ? <p> A : We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is with the input of international participation in the inquiry . Even top members of the government make conflicting statements in this regard . However , they have to fulfill their obligation as co-sponsors of the UN resolution . They ca n't just shrug their obligation off and decide on a totally domestic inquiry . <p> I am not sure how the government plans to fulfill their promises to the international community . We just have to wait and see . I do n't want to comment on the issue prematurely . Let 's see how the government conducts themselves . <p> Q : Are you satisfied with the progress of the reconciliation efforts ? <p> A : It is very slow . Certain things that the government should have done , they have failed to do . This has created a lot of mistrust among the Tamil people in the government . Unless something positive is done , the gap of distrust will widen . The government , therefore , should conduct in a manner that will build that trust ; unfortunately that is not happening . We , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We supported this government and are giving them our fullest support even in parliament . However the pressure is mounting on us as well that we are maintaining silence when the government is letting down the Tamil people , in terms of the missing persons , releasing of lands etc . The government is very slow to address these issues . Providing employment opportunities for the people in the North is also slow . These things have created a lot of mistrust and the government has to address these issues ASP . <p> Q : The Sinhalese feel that the Tamils expect them to make all efforts while they are not doing much to reciprocate the efforts of the Sinhalese . Do you agree ? <p> A : The problem is that the majority community , especially the government , has to make certain provisions . We do n't have the power to do it . The government needs to do something to convince the Tamil people that they too are equal citizens of this country . This is a shortcoming of the government . They feel that on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ antagonise the military etc . <p> Q : It is alleged that the rehabilitated LTTE cadres have been systematically poisoned and they are dying . Do you endorse these allegations ? <p> A : I can not comment on that issue as I only know of some rumours in this regard . These rumours , however , are very serious because when certain people are still in prison , these rumours can create a big fear psychosis among them and also among the general public . I really do n't know how true these allegations are . But there is a lot of fear among the detainees and the rehabilitated cadres . <p> So , something must be done , but I am not sure how it should be done . I do n't have conclusive evidence to prove that this has really happened . All I know is that the people are in fear . 
@@13944240 What Is Behind ? <p> by Ashanthi Warunasuirya <p> The government passed the Office of Missing Persons ( OMP ) Bill in parliament recently . Before and during the process , there were heated debates about the issue in parliament and amongst society . The controversy over this the OMP is still at large . While some say that the OMP is an attempt to take certain politicians and army personnel to the gallows , some others say that it is a positive step taken towards the long sought after reconciliation between the Tamils and the Sinhalese in the country . The opponents of the OMP also say that it has been given power to surpass the country 's present law and even power to take autonomous actions in certain circumstances . But the OMP proponents say that it has no such power but just the power enough to investigate alleged crimes and persons and submit relevant reports to the superiors . Amidst this OMP controversy , The Sunday Leader sought the comments of some prominent members of society on the issue . <p> Brito Fernando -- Chairman , Association of the Parents and Family Members of the Disappeared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has promised the international community at Geneva that they will take steps to investigate disappeared people . Accordingly , the government took steps such as signing the UN declaration against disappearance , setting up a task force and obtaining parliament 's approval to set up an Office for Missing Personnel ( OMP ) . These steps can be regarded as positive developments towards keeping its promise . Although the government is not moving fast in this regard , we are optimistic about the future . <p> Certain extremists in the South including Mahinda Rajapaksa and Vasudeva Nanayakkara are trying to disrupt these proceedings by claiming that there are attempts made to take the army to the gallows . But if Mahinda and Vasu had brought in parliament a bill in 1989 against State sponsored abductions and executions , it would be the same bill as this one . As those who backed it then are against it today , people such as Mangala Samaraweera who backed it then is backing it still . As representatives of the family members of the disappeared , we are glad about the government 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Especially , as to how these findings could be linked to justice and the steps the government should take with regard to compensation . But at this instance , we will stand by the government to defeat the agenda of racists . <p> It would have been better if the OMP was given some more power . We would propose for a better mechanism that would make use of the information received from the people . The government has promised to set up a separate bureau for this purpose . We urge the government to implement it soon . <p> It is a good sign that the government had agreed to look into the disappearances that had taken place since 1971 instead of 1989 . Even the Geneva report had focused on the years -- 2002 -- 2009 . The office would also look into the disappearances of military and police officers . This is a good step towards reconciliation . I see this as a central institution that could combine all disappearances . But we must keep in mind that this is going against the will of the racist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ try to make the best of it . By finding out the truth behind disappearances and by punishing those responsible for them , any future atrocity could be discouraged . It is a progressive step the government has taken by criminalizing forced disappearances . It sends a strong message to those who think of protecting these culprits to retain power . Further , the apologies made by Ranil Wickeremesinghe and Chandrika Kumaratunga to portray their honesty must be admired . The promise they have given about preventing such atrocities from taking place again in the country is good news for everyone . <p> -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- <p> Pubudu Jayagoda -- General Secretary , Frontline Socialist Party <p> We have continuously said that there should be credible investigations into disappearances , killings and attacks during and after the war . The people deserve to know the truth about these alleged cases . The government had not claimed that there is a legal barrier against disclosing such information . They could have done a lot more under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything during the past 1 1/2 years . In April 2012 , comrade Kumar Gunarathnam was abducted . In November 2015 , during an interview with the Sath Handa newspaper , Gotabhaya Rajapaksa admitted that he was involved in it . So we can see a clear crime here . We have so far made three complaints to the IGP about this issue . But to this date , nothing has been done . This is only one among many examples to show the government 's inefficiency . <p> Justice must be done to the disappeared . We are firm on the stance that the truth must be revealed . But we can not be satisfied about the recent Act . The government must justify their decision to bring in new legislation after failing to execute even the existing laws . They must show the inadequacy of existing legal remedies . But instead , they have just brought in a new bill only to show off that they are committed to the task . At present Sri Lanka 's lack of democracy has been criticised by other countries . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to set up this office . We see no genuine intention behind this measure in finding the truth . However , we will make complaints to this new office as well . <p> We have information about disappearances taken place since 1980 's . We also possess credible information about almost all the cases of disappearances taken place in Colombo and outstation areas during and after the war . After the present government assumed power , we have made hundreds of complaints about these cases . We even made a petition to the President . The government who kept mum in all those instances can not be trusted in setting up a proper mechanism to find the truth about disappearances . So , we would continue our struggle forward . It is only by pressurizing the government we could win our demands . On the other hand , the Joint Opposition ( JO ) has said that the military would be betrayed by this measure . This is a joke . If that was the case , then it 's the politicians who commanded the army that has to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those whohad obeyed the commands while those who have given the command are set free . That is a political issue . However , we also oppose the opinion of the JOon preventing investigations into disappearances claiming that that they may affect war heroes . <p> However , we are strictly against the policy of the government in living off by selling the slogan that they are committed towards finding the truth . By doing these meaningless things without taking any progressive step to establish reconciliation , is only going to create more social problems in the long run . So far the government has taken no steps to change the minds of the people . We must now focus on laying down the foundation to future reconciliation . If the government tries to aggravate racism , that is going to be disadvantageous . We need a mechanism that is different from ordinary legislation . We are committed towards creating a social dialogue on the subject . We see no judicial powers vested on this entity . It is just another ' investigative body ' . <p> -- -- -- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -- -- -- -- -- - <p> Sandya Eknaligoda -- Disappeared Journalist Prageeth Eknaligoda 's Wife <p> I took part in a discussion about this bill before it was brought in the parliament . There the issue of families of disappeared persons in both North and South were discussed . We made many suggestions to this mechanism . The main request was to change the name of the body . Unfortunately , our suggestions were not accepted . Generally , it is good that such an entity is set up . This provides some opportunity to look into the problems of the disappeared people 's families . However , still there are many weak points in this system ; it is like what the pro Rajapaksa group is claiming about hunting down war heroes . This has been set up to do something progressive towards finding out what really happened to these disappeared people . Since it was the Rajapaksas who had allegedly ordered many of these disappearances , they are now against any investigation into the matter . <p> But there are several structural weaknesses in this system . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mechanism . We asked the government to consider the problems of these victims under this mechanism . But the entity that has been set up t can not do anything helpful for the victims such as family members of the disappeared . <p> This is the beginning of a new institute . The appointments would be carried out by the President and duties for the office as well . The office and its officials would be given adequate authority . But still there is no judicial action or a compensation mechanism included in this Act . The only thing this office can do is to summon the witnesses and carrying out investigations . I have not studied this act thoroughly . But prima facie I see these lapses . <p> Still there is no clear idea as to what is going to happen after the investigation phase . So it is important to include the victims in this mechanism . In a country where literally nothing was done on this issue for many years , setting up this office is indeed a progressive step . What is important is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take part in the discussions only once before it was passed in parliament . Most of our suggestions have not been considered . We have clearly emphasized that the name should be changed to ' forces disappearances ' as there are no voluntary disappearances in this problem . It is also important to look into cases that had taken place even before the war . <p> -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- <p> Ruki Fernando -- Human Rights Activist <p> This was something promised by the Sri Lankan government to the international community . It is clear that over a hundred thousand people in the country have disappeared . Even the present government has claimed that over 65,000 people have disappeared since 1995 . So far the family members of these disappeared people have not been given any answer to their plight . No one knows whether they are dead or alive , why they were abducted , or what had happened to them . <p> The main objective of this office for the disappeared is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hundred thousand people have disappeared , finding out the truth and informing their families the truth is essential . Without doing that , we can not have good hopes about the future . <p> But unfortunately I 'm not yet clear about the structural format of this institute . As parliament has approved , the entity would consist of 7 members . They are to be given equal status of commissioners . Under their supervision , investigations are to be held into various issues such as mass graves and protecting the victims . It is also allowed to seek expert advice on the issue . <p> Knowing the truth is expected by all family members of these disappeared people . It is equally important to compensate these victims . In many a case , bread winner of the family disappeared . So the government has a responsibility to care for these family members as well . <p> -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - <p> Keerthi Tennakoon -- Executive Director , CaFFE <p> The basic structure and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is going to execute a task that the people much yearned for many years .

What we must not forget is that it is not only the Tamils in the North that have suffered disappearances . It is common to many Sinhala and Muslim families as well . It may be true that the most number of complaints about disappearances have been made by the Tamils . But there have been a lot of complaints made by other ethnic groups especially in Batticaloa and Vavuniya Districts . So justice must be equal to all . <p> Finding out the truth is an important aspect of any civilised society . People have a right to know the truth . For that , we must have a mechanism to find out the truth . Those who talk about truth , hardly know about it . It is only after knowing the truth , we could decide whether to punish the wrongdoers or not . So , it is clear that the government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was long overdue .

@@14197232 <h> Needs Of A ... Political Party <p> An outstanding feature in the history of most democratic political parties is one of threatened splits . The essence of a democratic organization is one where free expression results in dissent and different factions threatening to go their own way splitting the parties . <p> Today , in the so-called greatest democracy in the world , the Republican Party is being rocked by the antics of a maverick billionaire and a deep fissure has emerged in the party with its establishment being critical of heretical statements of the candidate Donald Trump and some not even endorsing his candidacy . In Britain the Conservative and Labour Party too are being threatened with splits . These parties have survived such crises before but are unlikely to disintegrate because of party members giving priority to hold their parties together at whatever cost , the interests of those involved in leadership struggles being secondary . <p> The Sri Lanka Freedom Party 's 65th Annual Convention takes place with mutual accusations of being responsible for party disintegration ringing in the ears . The threat to the party is being considered very seriously by its members but it need not be necessarily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of party members as the history of their party is a history of ongoing party squabbles and conspiracies . <p> The much celebrated birth of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party was the outcome of a political struggle between its leader Solomon Bandaranaike and the UNP leadership that governed the country . <p> While glorious , noble , patriotic and altruistic motives are being attributed for Bandaranaike breaking away from the UNP and creating his own party , the realpolitik of the walkout is undeniable . <p> Prime Minister D. S. Senanayake was aging and succession stakes were on the cards . Bandaranaike , though eminently qualified for leadership , was unpopular with the parry while the Premier 's son Dudley was popular and likely to win the premier stakes which he did . <p> Bandaranaike having formed his own party , winning the general election and becoming Premier was unable to stop party squabbles within his own party . He was assassinated by his own loyalists . <p> Wife Sirima ruled the party with an iron fist and her attempts to stifle the press of the country resulted in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government . <p> Squabbles within the SLFP and its coalition partners resulted in the making and breaking of governments . The 18 years in political exile while Jayewardene and Premadasa were in power saw continued squabbling among Anura Bandaranaike , Chandrika Kumaratunga and the interloper Mahinda Rajapaksa , which continued with Chandrika Kumaratunga as leader and Mahinda Rajapaksa with Anura Bandaranaike lurking behind the screen with drawn knives . <p> Under Mahinda Rajapaksa the SLFP became ' one man rule ' with his family as the kitchen cabinet . True , there was hardly any dissent against him till finally the end came in the way it happens to all strongmen . <p> Democratic parties continue as functioning political institutions for long by abiding to the rules of democratic practices . A sine qua non of democratic governance is that once a politician is rejected firmly by an electorate he or she bows out of the scene . If such persons continue clamouring for power , then the democratic process is severely hampered . When former British Prime Minister David Cameron lost the Brexit vote , he bowed out even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do so . He simply could n't lead the country after opposing such a major move . <p> Rajapaksa having lost presidential and parliamentary elections and also his party leadership , refuses to give up ; wants to form another party and lead the country even though he is debarred constitutionally from becoming president . Apparently he wants to throw out all democratic practices lock , stock and barrel . <p> While a political party can last for a considerable period changing its policies in accordance to the demands of the times , political leaders are not forever . When they retire from politics for whatever causes they should try to rejuvenate the party with new blood -- not necessarily family blood . <p> Mahinda Rajapaksa , we are told , is to form a new political party . He should tell the people who its new leaders are to be . Going by political indications they are to be the same old Rs -- Rajapaksa , Rajapaksa , Rajapaksa and still more Rajapaksas with a few family sycophants around him ? <p> A hard fact for politicians to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when they assumed power -- certainly about a decade later .

So did Saddam Hussein who claimed over 75 per cent endorsement by the people . What happened to them is history . <p> Strongmen who want to repeat histories of the Assads and Saddam should learn from such history . <p> If Mahinda Rajapaksa wants to rejuvenate the SLFP or build up a new party he should seek new leaders with talent , education and knowledge capable of leading Sri Lanka to a glorious future . He can not do so with the same old Rajapaksa , Rajapaksa and Rajapaksas with a few hack horses grazing around Medamulana.

If it holds for a week , the U.S. and Russian militaries would then begin steps to combine operations to eliminate obstacles to peace -- including militant groups the Islamic State and Jabhat Fateh al-Sham , formerly known as the al-Nusra Front . The plan also calls for a demilitarized zone and uncontested access for humanitarian aid . " If implemented , if followed , the plan has the ability to provide a turning point , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Syria over the course of five years now is really beyond inhumane . " The United States is going the extra mile here because we believe that Russia , and Lavrov , have the capability to press the Assad regime to stop this conflict and to come to the table and make peace . " <p> Earlier , the US President Barack Obama said he is not optimistic about the future success of a possible cease-fire in Syria despite ongoing talks between the United States and Russia . Obama , speaking Sunday at the G20 summit in China , said he does not think any new deal would last long enough for a political resolution in Syria . John Kerry , who met with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov on the sidelines of the economic summit , said " a couple of tough issues " remain , but did not elaborate . Despite the nearing impasse , Obama said he is committed to continuing efforts . " It is worth trying , " Obama said to reporters . " To the extent that there are children and women and innocent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know , get some relief from the constant terror of bombings , that 's worth the effort . And I think it 's premature for us to say that there is a clear path forward , but there is the possibility at least for us to make some progress on that front . " <p> Obama said it 's essential for Russia to be involved in a political solution . Obama and Russian President Vladimir Putin plan to meet Monday . " Our conversations with the Russians are key because , if it were not for the Russians , then Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and the regime would not be able to sustain its offensive , " he said . <p> Obama 's relations with Putin are strained now not only because of the Syrian situation but Moscow 's moves in Ukraine and the possibility the Russian leader is trying to help Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump get elected . Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov told reporters the two sides are close but it is important for the United States to distinguish " the so-called moderate opposition from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ al-Nusra Front , which is now known as Jabhat Fateh al-sham or the Syria Conquest Front . " I will say that we are close to reaching a deal with the United States ... there are no grounds to expect that everything would collapse . " <p> Kerry , at a news conference , reiterated the continuing efforts to make a cease-fire work . He did not comment about a July information-sharing proposal that would include coordinating air attacks against Jabhat Fateh al-sham in exchange for Russia pushing to stop offensives by Assad 's government . <p> Kerry later told reporters : " An awful lot of technical things have been worked out , a lot of things are clear , but there still remain , a couple of tough issues . " We 've got to figure out how to make certain both of us can be comfortable with the resolution to those issues , so that 's what we 're working on . " Yesterday Obama also met with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan , whose military has recently clashed with US-backed Kurdish fighters in Syria . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in that regard , " Obama said after meeting with Erdogan , who survived a failed military coup Erdogan 's government is unhappy with the United States for not extraditing Fethullah Gulen , the Turkish cleric who now lives in exile in Pennsylvania . Erdogan blames Gulen for plotting the coup . <p> USA is supposed to respect the NATO member and help Turkish government and not those who sought to kill President Erdogan and destabilize Turkey , but U.S. officials say they are awaiting sufficient evidence to justify the request to extradite Gulen , who is 75 and says he is in failing health . Erdogan said the United States and Turkey should adopt a " common attitude " against terrorism . Double speak is not good for allies . He noted there is a distinction between " good terrorists or bad , " he said , an indirect reference to Gulen and United States support for Kurdish fighters in Syria . 
@@14398231 <p> Party anniversaries over ... What 's good in them for People ? Posted on September 16th , 2016 <h> By Kusal Perera Courtesy The Daily Mirror <p> Anniversary celebrations of the two main political parties were held in two consecutive weekends this September . Sri Lanka Freedom Party ( SLFP ) in Kurunegala on Sunday 4 , and the United National Party ( UNP ) in Colombo on Saturday 10 . The UNP was formed in 1946 to take over from British colonial rule , celebrated 70 years . Bandaranayake and his Sinhala Maha Sabha clan broke off from the UNP in 1951 to form the SLFP . The party thus celebrated 65 years . <p> These two political parties have been racist parties and have always exploited Sinhala Buddhist sentiments in very racist terms to harvest Southern votes . They still remain the same and probably the only issue the two would work on the same frequency . And together they have ruled this country on their own and in coalitions led by them for 68 years since the sitting of first the parliament in 1947 to take over governance with the declaration of independence in February ' 48 . Thus for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economic crises , for all the armed conflicts that bled the country pale and for all the trauma and agony this country went through for 68 years , none but these two political parties will have to share total ( ir ) responsibility . A mere apology in passing without any hint on bloody and arrogant mistakes made over and over again , proves how callous these leaderships are . <p> The people ! Well , the people who kept voting them in and out of power at all the elections during 68 long years , will have to equally share responsibility for the crisis and the chaos now at hand.The academia , the professionals , the media and other social and political opinion makers no less responsible . <p> Yet , questions remain without answers.What trust , what credibility and what honesty is there when President Maithripala Sirisena tells the UNP convention the SLFP and the UNP can work together for the benefit of the country and would establish an undivided democratic country ? Only a week before he promised the SLFP membership in Kurunegala , he would make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Contrary to what he said in Kurunegala , a year before in August 2015 , he prevented the SLFP forming a government . He sacked the party Gen. Secretary to appoint his own , the Central Committee was muted through Court order and vowed he would not allow a SLFP government with MR as PM even if he won the August elections . If MS did not rabidly oppose MR , there was every possibility of MR closing that gap of 10 seats between SLFP and UNP to form an SLFP government . <p> On the UNP platform , what trust , what credibility and what honesty is there when PM Ranil Wickramasinghe as party leader tells his party men , debt would be significantly reduced this generation and 500,000 houses constructed with 3 State Banks amalgamated for easy housing loans and then sweet talks of a nation in unity by 2020 ? He had openly backtracked on his loudest promise of completely scrapping the Colombo Port City project . <p> His promise of investigating all Chinese projects entered into during the MR regime have now become his own development @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promises to repeal the PTA , his government continues to detain Tamil youth held under the PTA without any charges filed . His government messed up the budget for 2016 very amateurishly . His own select men are seriously and openly accused of mega corruption from day one , leave alone cleaning up corruption and fraud in the MR regime . <p> Though tested and proved failures within 18 months , these leaders continue to promise new and better beginnings at these celebrations . No different to what they said at two election rallies within a year . These are no party conventions that hold them responsible for the membership . <p> What then are these hyped events for ? Both political celebrations were geared to establish the leaderships as legitimate " owners " of their respective parties . MS tried his hand in mobilising the rank and file in support of his leadership , with Chandrika Kumaratunge by his side . MR 's stake in the party still seems much bigger and stronger . He is a SLFPer for over 48 years . He has not defected from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1968 . Both MS and CBK were opposites . <p> They betrayed the party , broke off and have opposed the SLFP . <p> MS thus serves Ranil and his UNP in having a fractured SLFP providing political space for him to project himself as the " leader " of this coalition government . That was evident in the two speeches by MS in Kurunegala and Ranil in Colombo . MS was out to assert himself as the legitimate leader of the SLFP . Ranil was out to prove himself as the " powerful " PM who would take the country forward . One who decides the future and for the government . <p> It is this projection that needs to be examined . Ranil 's leadership is carefully avoiding the trap it fell into in 2002-2003 , when they went into a collision course with CBK . His government was thrown out of power . Ranil this time prefers a weak President . With MS fighting to save himself as SLFP leader , UNP is on fast track to push through " reforms " that on the surface @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mechanisms to make the PM an executive power . For all that MS is allowed to play Sinhala Buddhist to encroach on the MR base . That would also allow the UNP to reach the Sinhala Buddhist majority . Ranil at this 70th celebration made certain he looked a Sinhala Buddhist patriotic . Said he never had any deals with the LTTE . So was the statement that read , UNP would not allow foreign interference , will ensure the right of Sinhala Buddhists as the privileged majority , while trying to pacify the minorities they would be taken care of . <p> Though Ranil projects himself a liberal democrat , his economic policy in contrast needs a completely tamed , " atomised " labour force and that is being allowed . His economic plan is totally dependent on FDIs . They do n't come any more from the rich and decent corporates . Sri Lanka has had " fly by night " businessmen only who do n't believe in management systems and patience of decent , modern corporates . <p> Truth is , JR 's unrestricted " Open market @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only helped evolve a " new rich " community of businessmen without a " rich " class consciousness . " Rich " businessmen you could only meet in casinos , five star hotel restaurants , night clubs and in transit at airports in a growing black market economy . They have turned the UNP into a wholly different party led by corrupt politicians . Very different to the UNP put together 70 years ago with rich landlords and urban elites . We would thus have to wait for 2017 and a Constitution that would be manipulated to see a Constitutional Bonapartist evolve . Reforms the urban elite social activists would applaud as having won the day . <p> A Bonapartist who may make a midget of MR , yet compelling people to seek out MR once again for absence of any valid alternative . <h> One Response to " Party anniversaries over ; What 's good in them for People ? " <p> It is also anniversary for army intelligence officers who are still in remand without bail , why ? Duminda Silva , who killed a man in broad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for politicians they allow bail out , for those who did the most important duty ? No bail . What a outrageous country are we ? <p> This is one of the greatest betrays in the country . Those officers have nothing to do with Ekneligoda , why should they kill him ? If they have abducted someone it is under the order of a politician/s ? Why ca n't this politician , if they are LEADERs with a BACKBONEs come forward and let these people out ? Surely these buggers are not LEADERs but corrupt thieves and killers .

@@14398234 Ansar in KL Airport by Malaysian " We Tamils " Posted on September 16th , 2016 <h> By D.B.S. Jeyaraj Courtesy The Daily Mirror <p> An official Ambassador is defined as a diplomat of the highest rank accredited to a foreign Government as the resident representative of his or her Motherland . The equivalent designation to an Ambassador among Commonwealth Nations is High Commissioner . Since an Ambassador or High Commissioner is the premier representative of his or her country any honour bestowed upon him or her in the host country is a respect afforded to the envoy 's country . Likewise any insult or injury caused to a High Commissioner or Ambassador is an affront to the envoy 's own country . It is in this context that the recent assault on Sri Lanka 's High Commissioner to Malaysia , Ibrahim Sahib Ansar at the Kuala Lumpur International Airport by a gang belonging to the " We Tamils Party " has to be viewed and condemned . <p> September 4 , 2016 being a Sunday was a holiday but not so for Lankan envoy in Malaysia Ibrahim Sahib Ansar . He and his loyal staffers at the Sri @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) in accordance with protocol requirements were busy catering to the arrival and departure of Sri Lankan Ministers to and from Malaysia . Industry and Commerce Minister Rishad Bathiudeen was to arrive in the morning to participate at the annual Pangkor International Development Dialogue ( PIDD ) . Primary Industries Minister Daya Gamage and Deputy Petroleum Resources Development Minister Anoma Gamage along with two Sri Lankan MP 's were scheduled to depart in the afternoon . They were returning after attending the 9th International Conference of Asian Political Parties ( ICAPP ) held in Kuala Lumpur . <p> High Commissioner Ansar was at the Kuala Lumpur International airport ( KLIA ) in the early hours of the morning to receive Rishad Bathiyudeen and his delegation . The envoy was accompanied by his deputy chef de Mission Majintha Jayasinghe holding the substantive position of Minister , Protocol officer Senthooran and Consular officer Shuhaib . All four had airport passes for the entire day . The foursome made their way to the KLIA after parking the vehicles near the gate No:4 close to the VIP lounge where they received Rishad Bathiudeen and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's residence and then left for Perak to attend the PIDD in Pangkor Island . <p> Cabinet Minister Daya Gamage At 12 noon , Ansar along with Jayasinghe , Senthooran and Shuhaib arrived at " Hotel Istana " in KL where the delegates participating at the ICAPP were staying . The High Commission team then escorted Minister Daya Gamage , Deputy Minister Anoma Gamage , former minister and present opposition MP Dinesh Gunawardena , Kegalle District MP Sandith Samarasinghe and former Parliamentarian and ex-Muslim affairs minister A.H.M. Azwer to the KLIA . This time the vehicles had to be parked near gate No:8 which was further away from the VIP lounge.When they entered the VIP lounge , the High Commissioner observed two " suspicious " people at the entrance to the VIP lounge . While leaving the VIP lounge after seeing the Ministers and MP 's off , the envoy saw the same two people talking to the Airport Security personnel and pointing to the Sri Lankans . When they reached the exit the Lankan diplomats saw about 15 to 20 people with distinctive " South Indian " appearances loitering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tee-shirts with images of a growling tiger and that of former Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam ( LTTE ) supremo Veluppillai Prabhakaran . Some wore black jackets covering the tee-shirts partially . <p> Despite assurances that adequate security would be provided to High Commissioner Ansar and the Sri Lankan Mission nothing tangible materialized for many days . This led to much heartburn within official circles in Colombo . A note of concern at the delay was conveyed to Kuala Lumpur at the highest level . <p> Realising it would be imprudent to proceed outside in such an environment , the Sri Lankan diplomatic personnel went inside the airport precincts again . Ansar and his deputy Jayasinghe went to the Airport security guards , identified themselves as diplomats and informed them of the potential threat posed by the people assembled outside . They requested that security be provided for them to leave the Airport premises unharmed . To their shock and dismay the Malaysian security personnel at KLIA were unmindful and unresponsive to their concerns and needs . No security escort was forthcoming . High Commissioner Ansar then telephoned Assistant Superintendent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Police . The Special Branch is the intelligence arm of the Malaysian Police Department . It had been ASP Kanthan who interacted with the Sri Lankan High Commission on Security intelligence related matters . Ansar who was well-acquainted with ASP Kanthan told the Special Branch cop about the prevailing situation and asked for security . Kanthan assured Ansar that he would contact Sepang area Police under whose jurisdiction the KLIA fell and do the needful . The Lankan diplomats waited patiently but there was no Police escort.Sonia Raminder Kaur They also saw that more and more of the " tiger tee-shirted " persons were coming into the Airport building in twos and threes . The time was nearly 3 PM.The Lankan Diplomats decided to go one floor below and leave through the exits at the arrivals section . They went down by elevator and started walking towards the Arrivals section . At one point they ran into Sonia Raminder Kaur , the Sri Lankan Airlines Station Manager in Kuala Lumpur and engaged briefly in conversation with her.When talking to Kaur , the High Commissioner stood with his back to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Suddenly Jayasinghe saw several men clad in tee-shirts with images of a tiger and Prabhakaran descending on the escalator . Some were seen clutching bags . Jayasinghe alerted Ansar to what was happening and both started walking away from the spot . The gang that came down the escalator first approached Sonia Kaur in a hostile manner shouting " Are you Siree Lankan , Siree Lankan " . One snatched away the identity tag around her neck.The SLA Station Manager who is a Malaysian National of North Indian origin replied " No I am not Sri Lankan . I am a Malaysian " . The mob then pointed to the Sri Lankan envoy and asked who he was . Sonia Kaur said " He is the Sri Lankan High Commissioner " . <p> The gang then started following the Sri Lankan diplomats who changed their plans suddenly and went through a side entrance to a restricted " No Entry " zone . All four Lankan diplomats had passes allowing them entry into the restricted area . They thought the mob would not be able to follow them into a restricted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other end.The gang however followed them into the area marked " No Entry " . Seeing the gang following , Protocol officer Senthooran and Consular officer Shuhaib stayed back instead of going with Ansar and Jayesinghe . In a futile bid to protect their High Commissioner both tried to block the gang from proceeding further by stretching out their hands . <p> The pursuing gang simply pushed them to a side . Shuhaib grasped the shoulder of one man to restrain him . He was punched in the face and fell down . The tiger-tee-shirted gang continued chasing after the Lankan envoy . After entering the restricted area , High Commissioner Ansar had thought the gang would not follow and slowed down his pace . Jayesinghe however kept moving fast and was much ahead of Ansar . Upon realising the gang was still in pursuit , Ansar too hastened his pace but the gang caught up soon with the 60 year old envoy . <p> " Poathum , Poathum " ( enough , enough ) <p> After surrounding Ansar they pushed him to the wall and started raining blows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to block the punches and ward off a few blows . The gang comprising seven persons continued to hit him . A couple of men began kicking him . Ansar 's spectacles fell on the floor and were damaged . His mobile phone too fell and was misappropriated by one of the assailants.The beating was done in silence by the gang . The blows were aimed at the victim 's face , chest and stomach . There was no exchange of words between the gang and the envoy before , during or after the assault . One man however kept saying " poathum , poathum " ( enough , enough ) in Tamil . Finally the Airport security personnel arrived at the spot and stopped the assault . <p> High Commissioner Ansar then introduced himself to the security guards and asked them to arrest his assailants.The security men however declined to do so saying the assailants could be arrested only if a Police complaint was made . The High Commissioner protested at that and pointed out that the men would have escaped by the time a Police complaint was made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can catch them after the Police complaint is made " . The assailants were then allowed to go off scot free in what appeared to be a flagrant security breach . <p> The security personnel then escorted the Lankan diplomats to the Police station within the Airport premises . The High Commissioner was bleeding from an ugly gash above his eye . His lips too had cracked and blood was oozing . His staffers brought ice and applied it to the injuries as a first aid measure . Shuhaib had not sustained injuries in the attack while Jayesinghe and Senthooran were virtually untouched . On their way to the Police station , the Lankan diplomats saw a lot of broken eggs on the floor . Presumably the gang had brought them in their bags to chuck at the Lankans . After lodging the complaint , the High Commissioner asked for security escort to the Gleneagles Hospital on Embassy Row of " Jalan Ampang " where most diplomatic personnel in Kuala Lumpur obtain medical treatment . The Police however refused saying they could only provide escort to a Govt hospital and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wan Abdullah <p> The Lankan diplomats then went off on their own to Gleneagles hospital where High Commissioner Ansar obtained medical relief for his injuries . Thereafter he went home after informing the Foreign Affairs Ministry in Colombo of what had happened . Acting promptly Esala Weerakoon who assumed duties as Foreign ministry secretary on August 1 this year summoned the newly-appointed Malaysian envoy to the ministry on Monday Sep 5 . Sri Lanka 's feelings of outrage and condemnation over the attack on the High Commissioner were conveyed in the strongest possible terms couched in diplomatic phraseology to Wan Zaidi bin Wan Abdullah , the Malaysian High Commissioner in Colombo . It was urged that adequate security be provided to the High Commissioner and mission and that punitive action be taken against the assailants . The Malaysian envoy deeply regretted what had happened and tendered an apology on behalf of his Govt for the incident . <p> The Premier 's disclosure about the involvement of " Naam Thamizhar " or " We Tamils " activists in the attacks is certainly correct . However , his references to their citizenship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ camera footage of the assault had been " leaked " out by suspected " elements " at the KLIA to certain media outlets . Scenes of Ansar being assaulted were shown on some Malaysian TV Channels and You Tube.Though the actual assault had been done in silence with only one person saying " enough , enough " some other words in Tamil had been added to the clip . Voices in Tamil said Mahinda had escaped but this man got caught and now he is being torn apart ( Pichu Edukkiraanga ) . Certain news reports said that Malaysian Tamil activists had accosted the High Commissioner and inquired from him where Mahinda Rajapaksa was and that the envoy had replied " Go ask the Police " . It was insinuated that the envoy 's insolent retort had infuriated the " activists " who had then assaulted Ansar . In one more version of the ' blame the victim ' syndrome it was being propagated that Ansar brought the attack upon himself . The truth was that the High Commissioner had at no stage spoken or talked to his assailants . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough . Ansar himself had not uttered a word even while trying to defend himself . <p> Another news report was that High Commissioner Ansar had been recalled to Sri Lanka . This too was false and circulated perhaps by interested parties in Malaysia to embarrass the envoy . Ibrahim Sahib Ansar is a senior diplomat hailing from Erukkalampitty in the Mannar District . After graduating , Ansar worked as a Customs officer for a while before entering the Sri Lanka Foreign service as part of the 1985 batch of recruits . He had served in the UK and Indonesia as a diplomat and as Ambassador to Oman , Egypt and Saudi Arabia . He was also chief of protocol at one time . Ansar who is also a qualified lawyer was posted to Kuala Lumpur after K. Godage was recalled prematurely from Malaysia when Prof. G. L. Peiris was Foreign Minister . Ibrahim Sahib Ansar 's term of office ends in October this year . Former Colombo Mayor A.J. M. Muzammil has been designated as the new High Commissioner to Malaysia . <p> CCTV Security Camera Footage <p> After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began to crack down . The District Suprintendent of Police for Sepang Abdel Azeez contacted High Commissioner Ansar . The Kuala Lumpur International Airport is located in the Sepang District . The envoy was told that the security personnel at the Airport were new and inexperienced and therefore had not responded correctly to the attack . The Sepang Police perused much CCTV Security camera footage but were unable to identify any of the assailants clearly . When told of this High Commissioner Ansar said that he could identify some of the assailants . Thereafter Police stepped up efforts and with the help of " informants " in the Malaysian Indian community arrested five suspects . The High Commissioner 's stolen phone was also recovered . Police told the media that they had arrested five and were searching for four others . <p> Another news report was that High Commissioner Ansar had been recalled to Sri Lanka . This too was false and circulated perhaps by interested parties in Malaysia to embarrass the envoy <p> Malaysian Inspector-General of Police , Tan Sri Khalid Abu Bakar announced that police had arrested five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dengkil , Ipoh and Kuala Lumpur . Four more suspects have also been identified , and an operation has been launched to bring them into custody , the IGP stated . Khalid further said that police were probing local groups to check on their possible links with the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam ( LTTE ) in Sri Lanka . There were also news reports that the arrested suspects were being detained and interrogated under Malaysia 's Security Offences ( Special Measures ) Act known generally as SOSMA . The SOSMA was created in 2012 under Article 149 of the Malaysian Federal Constitution to combat internal security issues including public order , acts of terrorism , sabotage and espionage etc . <p> The fact that the men who assaulted High Commissioner Ansar wore Black T-shirts with images of a tiger and Prabhakaran led to a widespread belief in Sri Lanka that the assailants belonged to the LTTE . Some Opposition politicians stated openly that the LTTE was responsible and described the assault as an act of terrorism . Cold water was poured on such assertions when Malaysian Deputy Home Minister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the assault on Sri Lanka 's High Commissioner to Malaysia Ibrahim Sahib Ansar at the Kuala Lumpur International Airport ( KLIA ) was a " political act " and not a " terrorist act " . " It was an isolated incident triggered by political conflicts , " Nur Jazlan said . " The incident had nothing to do with terrorism . However , necessary action has been taken against five people , currently in police custody , " the New Straits Times , quoted him as saying . Nur Jazlan assured that Malaysia would not meddle in Sri Lanka 's affairs , and that the incident would not have any impact on Malaysia . <p> Kalaimughilan and Balamurugan <p> The arrested suspects were arraigned with some others in an identity parade by the Police . High Commissioner Ansar identified two out of the 20 persons produced at the Identity parade . On September 9 , two men were charged at the Sepang Sessions Court for assaulting Sri Lanka 's High Commissioner to Malaysia , Ibrahim Sahib Ansar , on September 4 . Malaysian newspapers reported that the two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ driver V. Balamurugan 32 , pleaded not guilty to charges of rioting and causing injuries to the victim at about 3.00 pm at the Kuala Lumpur International Airport ( KLIA ) . The charge was read under Section 147 of the Penal Code , which carries a maximum two years jail term , a fine , or both upon conviction . <p> Deputy Public Prosecutor Fariza Hamzah requested for bail to be set at 20,000 Malaysian Ringgit each , saying their act had smeared the country 's image . Lawyer M. Manoharan , who represented the two accused , pleaded for a lower bail amount as he said the accused were from poor families and had no criminal records . Another counsel for the accused , A. Sivanesan said his clients had cooperated with the police during their detention and argued the bail amount was unreasonable .

Incidentally one US dollar equals about four Malaysian Ringgits . <p> Despite assurances that adequate security would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mission nothing tangible materialized for many days . This led to much heartburn within official circles in Colombo . A note of concern at the delay was conveyed to Kuala Lumpur at the highest level . Finally , after a week long delay security was provided by Malaysian authorities with effect from Sep 12 . Round the clock security has been given to both the Sri Lankan High Commission and his residence . Also a security detail of three Personal Security officers has been provided to the Lankan envoy . <p> Special Screening of " Kabali " <p> The attack on High Commissioner Ansar sent shock waves down the Tamil- speaking community in Malaysia . The envoy had interacted very closely with all concerned and had been immensely helpful to both Sri Lankans in Malaysia as well as Malaysian nationals of Sri Lankan origin . Being fluent in Tamil , as a Northern Province Muslim , High Commissioner Ansar had moved with the larger Tamil population of Malaysia consisting predominantly of Tamils from India . He maintained friendly links with the Malaysian Indian Congress a constituent of the ruling " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Sri Haji Mohammad Najib bin Tun Haji Abdul Razak . Ansar had been invited as an honoured guest of Datuk Murugan Saravanan the Deputy Minister of Youth and Sports in the special screening of the movie " Kabali " organized by the Malaysian Indian Congress . The movie starring superstar Rajnikanth is about a Tamil gang leader in Malaysia . Ansar has also participated in Tamil literary meetings and delivered the keynote speech at a " Thirukkural " research conference . <p> Against this backdrop , the attack on Ibrahim Sahib Ansar was not welcomed by the larger Tamil community in Malaysia . In an attempt , perhaps to contain this tendency , a well-known Malaysian Tamil politician and one time supporter of the LTTE jumped into the fray with a hard-hitting statement against the victim of the assault . Palanisamy Ramasamy is the Deputy Chief Minister of the Penang State in Malaysia and the Opposition Democratic Action Party ( DAP ) and a Member of Parliament for the Batu Kawan constituency . He is the shadow Foreign Minister in the " Pakatan Rakyat " Opposition Coalition . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " by Vanesha Shurentheran , Ramasamy had said at a press meet in Komtar that while not condoning acts of violence against anybody , the assault against Ansar , had a background . Ramasamy alleged that when some Tamil youths approached Ansar at the Kuala Lumpur International Airport ( KLIA ) and asked about the whereabouts of former Sri Lankan President Mahinda Rajapaksa , he ( Ansar ) had apparently replied : " We will wipe out the Tigers in Malaysia as we wiped out the LTTE in Sri Lanka " . Ramasamy said " Such a hostile act , rather unbecoming of a diplomat was responsible for the subsequent assault and detention of the five by the police " . <p> Palanisamy Ramasamy <p> Palanisamy Ramamsamy further said that Ansar is no ordinary diplomat in Malaysia , he added that the latter was sent to gather information of the activities of the Tamils , especially those who are in support of the creation of independent Tamil Eelam , a separate State for Tamils in the North and East of Sri Lanka . " In the last few years , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the country and passing them to the Malaysian Police . " As the result of the nefarious activities of Ibrahim Ansar , a number of Tamil refugees have been deported back to Sri Lanka by the Malaysian authorities to face detention , torture and lengthy imprisonment in Sri Lanka , " said Ramasamy . <p> Ramasamy said that he strongly condemns the " unhealthy " role Ansar had played and added that the latter was not suitable to serve as diplomat in the country any more . " While the police were overzealous in arresting the five protestors , they have remained silent on the provocative statement made by Ibrahim . " We want the Malaysian Govt to expel Ibrahim Ansar as soon as possible before he creates further problems between Tamils here and the Malaysian government , " said Ramasamy . <p> In an interesting development Ramasamy 's unfounded allegations against High Commissioner Ansar were echoed faithfully by Tamil Nadu politician Vaiyapuri Gopalaswamy who now calls himself " Vaiko " , the leader of the Marumalarchi Dravida Munnetra Kazhagham ( MDMK ) was a known acolyte of LTTE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Tigers . The identical sentiments expressed against High Commissioner Ansar by Ramasamy and Vaiko and the joint demand for the envoy 's withdrawal seemed to suggest that the Malaysian Deputy Home Minister 's statement about the assault not being a " terrorist " act warranted a re-scrutiny . <p> While the likes of Ramasamy and Vaiko ranted and raved against Ansar there was much sympathy for the envoy in his home and native land.The assault of Sri Lanka 's High Commissioner to Malaysia naturally evoked much indignation and concern in Sri Lanka . People of different ethnicities and religions were united in condemning the attack . The national mood was reflected in the legislature too when Parliamentarians cutting across party affiliations -- From Prime Minister Wickremesinghe to Leader of the Opposition Sampanthan -- raised their voices unitedly against the attack . The Malaysian Govt was strongly urged to provide adequate security and also bring to book the perpetrators of violence . <p> " We Tamils / Naam Thamizhar " <p> Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe revealed in Parliament that the persons involved in the assault belonged to the " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Premier had stated " It has been found that the attackers were from the Malaysian branch of the ' We Tamils ' / Naam Thamilar of Tamil Nadu . They live in Malaysia and have Indian citizenship . They are not Sri Lankans . We are taking action against the LTTEers in Malaysia . This group has links to the main Opposition of Malaysia . We are ready to send a delegation to discuss with this group " . <p> The Premier 's disclosure about the involvement of " Naam Thamizhar " or " We Tamils " activists in the attacks is certainly correct . However , his references to their citizenship status seems to be incorrect . Those at the forefront of " Naam Thamizhar " in Malaysia are Tamils of Indian origin but most of them are Malaysian citizens . Generally persons with Indian citizenship alone do not get involved in active politics particularly political violence for fear of being deported . <p> In this instance , those suspected of engaging in violence seem to be Malaysian Tamil adherents the ' We Tamils ' Movement or party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who is an LTTE fellow traveller . The party symbol is a tiger and activists generally wear black T-shirts with images of the tiger and Prabhakaran . <p> Prime Minister Wickremesinghe 's assertion about the ' Naam Thamizhar/We Tamils ' being responsible for the Ansar Assault is correct but the premier 's assertion about being ready to send a delegation for discussions with the group is indeed bizarre ! Whatever for ? Rational dialogue is not possible with these elements . It would serve no useful purpose whatsoever except to boost the image of " Naam Thamilar " . Anyone who really understands the true nature of this neo-fascist movement would not countenance such a move . If the Premier persists with such an intention then he would only lend himself vulnerable unintentionally to charges of appeasement in the future . <p> Interesting Questions <p> Many interesting questions arise in the present situation . <p> What is the background of the " Naam Thamizhar/We Tamils " Movement or party ? How and why did former President Mahinda Rajapaksa 's visit to Malaysia to attend the International Conference of Asian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off protest demonstrations against his entry to Malaysia ? <p> Was it only the " We Tamils Party " alone which organized the anti-Rajapaksa protest campaign or were other political formations also involved ?

If Mahinda Rajapaksa was the real target of the protest campaign and assailants , how did the ex-President manage to be in Kuala Lumpur and return home unscathed ? Have the pro-LTTE Tamil diaspora elements launched an anti-Mahinda campaign to target him whenever he travelled abroad to a country where there is a significant Tamil presence ? <p> Was the assault on High Commissioner Ansar calculated to disrupt the good relations between Malaysia and Sri Lanka and hamper the on going efforts undertaken by that country to apprehend and deport LTTE suspects living in Malaysia ? <p> Why were the Malaysian Police who provided security from Sep 2 to 3 to the High Commissioner due to a perceived fire bomb threat so lackadaisical on Sep 4 ? <p> The above mentioned and other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a forthcoming article . <h> Leave a Reply <p> Disclaimer : The comments contained within this website are personal reflection only and do not necessarily reflect the views of the LankaWeb .

He decided not to prioritise the royal birth story , partly -- he said -- because it was the 30th anniversary of Black July ( a wave of anti-Tamil violence that saw thousands killed in Sri Lanka ) . <p> The tribunal appeal found that BBC bosses erred by giving him a final written warning following the Prince George incident , despite his previously good disciplinary record over the previous 18 years . <p> Among those to give evidence on his behalf were Callum Macrae , an award-winning documentary maker who has chronicled the targeting of civilian Tamils at the end of the Sri Lankan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he told Press Gazette today : " I 'm delighted that Bandara has been vindicated . This really was a shameful episode . " It seemed very clear that the BBC Sinhala service gave the impression of toeing the government line , particularly when it came to the tragic events at the end of the war . <p> " Bandara 's attempts to tell the truth , a truth that 's now been vindicated by various UN inquiries , was stymied by editorial decisions which -- for whatever reason -- appeared to be consistent with the interests of the discredited government . " <p> Macrae 's documentary No Fly Zone chronicled how thousands of Tamil civilians were killed by government shelling at the end of the Sri Lankan civil war . <p> Bandara claimed he was unfairly targeted because of his belief that the Tamil people of Sri Lanka have been persecuted by the Sinhala-dominant government . <p> Most his colleagues were said to be of Sinhalese , rather than Tamil , heritage . <p> He said : " I am delighted and very relieved to have been vindicated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truth about what was happening in Sri Lanka in the face of constant criticism and editorial interference was a difficult and painful experience . <p> " Having to then spend two years trying to clear my name and restore my reputation as a committed and professional journalist was even worse . <p> " I 'd like to thank everyone who believed in me and supported me throughout this process . " <p> A spokesperson for the BBC World Service said : " We are disappointed with the outcome on the unfair dismissal claim . The BBC takes disciplinary matters very seriously .

The BBC 's Ayeshea Perera explains why people in the capital Colombo are so outraged . <p> At first glance , you would be forgiven for thinking it was a page from a cheap fashion magazine . <p> The poster on display outside St Joseph 's College -- one of Colombo 's elite private schools -- has no text of any sort . <p> Instead it shows 16 pictures of women in a variety of outfits , with tick marks against half and crosses against the rest . <p> I <p> A picture of this poster has generated massive debate on social media <p> No , it 's not a crash course in what is and is not fashionable in Colombo right now . <p> Instead , it 's a notice to women about what they can and can not wear when they enter school premises to meet teachers , or pick their children up from inside the school . <p> Traditional saris are allowed , as are apparently baggy shapeless dresses and what look suspiciously like hospital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strappy tops , mini skirts and anything without sleeves . <p> Image captionAt first glance the poster looks like the page of a cheap fashion magazine <p> The furore began after a former St Joseph 's student put a picture of the poster on Facebook . <p> A member of the administrative staff at St Joseph 's confirmed the strict dress code for women entering the school premises . " If they want to come into the school they have to be dressed appropriately , " the staff member told the BBC . <p> Another leading private school in Colombo , St Peter 's College , confirmed it has a similar notice outside its gates . " This is a boy 's school after all and we have a notice so that women know what they should and should not be wearing , " an office member said , adding that women who did not adhere to the dress code were turned away . <h> What about midriffs ? <p> Many of the responses to the poster were of outrage .

When my mother would visit she would wear formal Western clothing , including skirts that were either knee length or a little shorter -- outfits that are likely to be on the wrong side of this new dress code . <p> It 's difficult to say why the school authorities have suddenly seen a need to tell women visiting their schools what they should and should not be wearing . <p> One reason could be a rise of conservative values in Colombo due to the expansion of the middle class in the city , which means that these private schools are now open to people of more traditional backgrounds . <p> The Sri Lankan president is among those who have expressed dismay at the behaviour of the modern Colombo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been an upsurge of conservative values in Sri Lanka , particularly since the end of the civil war in 2009 .

@@14430230 <h> Double Jeopardy <p> ... Project Mooted At Double Cost On Hold <p> by Wiraj Silva <p> Part I <p> Muhammed Fazl and R. Sampanthan and M. A. Sumanthiran <p> With the present government deciding to re-scrutinise a controversial proposed US$ one billion housing for 65,000 war-affected families in the North and East , a Treasury official told The Sunday Leader it was highly unlike to be given ' all out ' to ArcelorMittal . <p> Many segments of the society from government ministers , opposition politicians including Opposition Leader and Tamil National Alliance MP R Sampanthan , Parliamentarian M A Sumanthiran , the Northern Provincial Council ( NPC ) , good governance activists raised concerns which climaxed with an independent expert panel finding the project ' to be very unlikely to foster the local economy and generate employment ' and cost the taxpayer double the price . These discrepancies even led a public activist to file a Fundamental Rights application averring that the deal in principle and in procedure infringed his rights as a citizen of Sri Lanka . <p> Earlier highly-renowned panel of top two civil engineers and a renowned architect attached to the University of Moratuwa states that a staggering Rs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ construction method such as block wall houses is utilised . <p> Speaking to The Sunday Leader , Petitioner Muhammed Fazl of No.35 B 1/1 , Watarappola Road , Mount Lavinia states that he is an independent social/political activist and a columnist for a website among inter alia engages in investigative writing and runs social media campaign against corruption and for rule of law . <p> Breach of fundamental rights <p> " All Sri Lankans whether they are Tamils , Sinhalese or Muslims suffered under the brutal civil war that was waged for more than 30 years . First and foremost , since this is a project paid back with public funds , the criteria on which the beneficiaries are selected must be made public , " noted Fazl . <p> " This is not a small amount and involves a staggering US$ one billion . However some persons involved in the deal have stated that the local construction industry is incapable of handling such a big project . This is an insult to the local industry and entrepreneurs , " he added . <p> " Why ca n't a consortium @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be paid back by the tax-payer at the end of the day ? " he queried . <p> " There are many who feel that the tender procedure was skewed and the criteria themselves were custom-made to favour the announced winner , " lamented Fazl . <p> " In addition when a highly-renowned panel of top experts in the country had raised concerns , I ca n't understand why the government has turned a deaf year to those concerns . " <p> " The masses brought the United National Front for Good Governance ( UNFGG ) to put an end to government-led corruption but I feel if this project proceeds as it is the UNFGG government would be complicit in corruption , " he lamented . <p> The highly-renowned panel of top experts in the country raised serious concerns pointing out that steel houses suffer from the following key drawbacks compared to the block wall houses : ( i ) inadequate foundations ; ( ii ) insufficient roof support ; ( iii ) risk of steel corrosion despite the coatings provided ; ( iv ) poor ventilation ; ( v @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poor or non-existent capacity for extension or repair ; ( vii ) much shorter lifespan ; ( viii ) unlikely to create a sense of ownership ; ( ix ) very unlikely to foster the local economy and generate employment ; ( x ) at least double the cost . <p> Furthermore the expert report states that although steel houses have certain advantages over the block wall houses namely : - reduced consumption of natural resources , ( primarily sand and timber ) , reduced erection time and a ' reported financing arrangement ' for their construction ; in the above context it is clear that the way forward is to construct block wall houses , while finding ways to overcome any disadvantages they may have ( e.g. finding new sources of natural resources ; alternative technologies to reduce natural resource usage ; arranging financing ) . <p> The full text of the report : <p> A Comparison of the Proposed " Steel House " with Constructed Block Wall Houses in the Jaffna Peninsula : Preliminary Findings <p> Professor Priyan Dias , PhD , CEng , MIStructE , FIE(SL) <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Archt Varuna de Silva , MSc(Architecture) , AIA(SL) , RIBA3 <p> Introduction <p> This report covers the preliminary findings of a two day visit to the Jaffna Peninsula ( 10-11 April 2016 ) undertaken by the authors to compare the proposed " steel house " with constructed block wall houses . Two model houses of the former were inspected ( Note : 65,000 are proposed for construction over the next 4 years ) ; as were several of the latter ( of which over 50,000 have been constructed over the past 4 years ) . The inspection focused on technical aspects , although other aspects are also commented on . The model houses are commented on in the light of the block wall ones . Both are essentially rectangular and cover 550 square feet . A full research report is under preparation . The motivation for the comparison is the public interest that will be served ; especially in the light of the relatively novel and untested nature of steel houses in Sri Lanka . <p> Structural Aspects <p> 1 . The steel houses are founded on a 150 mm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in one case raised above existing ground level by around 450 mm . This will be unsuitable for flood conditions or even heavy rains that could erode the soil under the foundations . In comparison , the block wall houses are founded on random rubble masonry around 450 mm deep with a 300 mm plinth ; this foundation depth and plinth height will be much more stable , especially under flood conditions . <p> 2 . The wall panels of the steel house are made of a sandwich of two corrugated steel sheets enclosing polyurethane foam insulation . There are reportedly vertical galvanised steel channels at intervals along the perimeter , although these can not be seen since covered by the sheets . This arrangement would generally be satisfactory for in plane and out of plane lateral loads and for vertical loads . The block wall house , with 100 mm ( min ) cement : sand block masonry would however be much sturdier for all types of loading . <p> 3 . The roof panels are also made of sandwich panels such as the above , but probably somewhat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not possible to observe this . The span from roof ridge to wall supports is around 3.1 m . There are no intermediate purlin supports . This appears somewhat inadequate , because the maximum span recommended for corrugated sheets is generally 1.2 m ( less than half the span utilised ) . In this panel of course there are 2 sheets separated by insulation , but they are unlikely to act compositely . The block wall houses have timber framed clay tiled roofs , which have been tried and found to be satisfactory over a long period ; provided the timber is either properly chosen and/or treated . <p> The steel house has a roof slope of 14o , which is reasonably satisfactory for sheet type roofing ; it should be noted however that the greatest wind uplift , which would be a concern in the north and east of the country , will occur for roof slopes of around 10o . The slope of the tiled roof in the block wall house is however around 25o , which would relieve uplift significantly ; in addition the relatively loose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reduce uplift pressures . <p> 5 The corrugated steel sheets are prone to corrosion , especially in environments close to the sea , if the coating is compromised by cutting , drilling , punching/riveting or even scratching . The electrochemical compatibility between bolts/rivets and the sheet must also be ensured . Such corrosion can take place in under 10 years . The block wall houses have very few materials than are subject to corrosion . <p> Non structural aspects <p> 1 . The fixing of the door frames to the panels in the steel houses appear to be quite flimsy . Parts of it have been fixed to wall panels with double sided tape . In one case the jointing to the panels had not been carried out properly . Electrical fittings ( plug sockets and external conduits ) were found to have been dislodged already in one of the houses . The door hinges are also very small and appear quite fragile . The block wall houses do not suffer from such defects because the walls and fixtures are quite sturdy . <p> 2 . There are no openings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and roof in the steel house . This is poor design for hot climates because it does not allow hot air to rise and escape ; such a design is better for cold climates or for air conditioned spaces in hot climates . Grills are routinely provided in the block wall houses . In addition , there is always a gap between wall plate and roof covering , allowing hot air to escape and making these houses much more comfortable thermally . <p> 3 . The windows in the steel houses are small in size and may not satisfy standard ventilation requirements ; also only half the window can be opened because of the sliding action . They have also not been provided bars , thus posing security issues ( especially for vulnerable recipients ) , since windows would need to be opened for better ventilation . Such bars are provided in many of the block houses , where in any case the need to have windows opened is not as great because of the better ventilation at roof level . <p> 4 . The steel houses have not been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recipients would be using firewood for cooking ( and unable to afford cooking by gas ) . The steel house concept does not appear able to accommodate such an arrangement , because in one of the houses , a separate kitchen was being envisaged outside the house . Block wall houses have long been constructed with hearths and chimneys that appear to be working well . <p> 5 . The use of the prefabricated panels appears to make future extensions in plan area infeasible for the steel houses , because of the specialist jointing techniques required . On the other hand , there were a number of examples where block wall houses ( including the roof ) had been extended in plan . <p> 6 . The unfamiliar technology of the steel houses would also make repairs difficult if not infeasible . Where block wall houses are concerned , materials and operatives are readily available for repairs . <p> 7 . The stated guarantee period of a steel house is 30 years , whereas a block wall house would probably have a life of 50-60 years . Also steel panel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The block wall houses are capable of being handed down for at least one generation . <p> 8 . The erection time of a steel house would be much less than for a block wall house ; although the proposed 4 years for constructing 65,000 steel houses is not very different to the 50,000 block wall ones constructed also over 4 years . <p> Other Aspects <p> 1 . The steel houses would require much less sand and hardly any timber for construction , thus helping to reduce the demand for natural resources . The block wall houses would require both ; although such requirements appear to have been met without too much difficulty in the construction of the 50,000 houses over the past 4 years . <p> 2 . Most of the recipients of owner driven block wall houses displayed a positive sense of ownership , allowing them to plan and even extend what has already been constructed with their involvement . ( Note that the following of Vasthu principles seemed to be of great importance to them ) . The steel houses would require an essentially contractor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ownership . <p> 3 . The construction of the above 50,000 block wall houses has reportedly created employment and also promoted the local economy ( e.g. retail shops for materials ) . The proposed contractor driven steel houses will not deliver this advantage . <p> 4 . Despite furniture and other features being incorporated in the steel houses , they are still around at least double the cost of a block wall house of the same area . The steel houses are supposed to have a financing arrangement however , that has not been matched by any proponent of block wall houses . <p> Conclusions : <p> 1 . The steel houses suffer from the following key drawbacks compared to the block wall houses : ( i ) inadequate foundations ; ( ii ) insufficient roof support ; ( iii ) risk of steel corrosion despite the coatings provided ; ( iv ) poor ventilation ; ( v ) absence of hearth and chimney ; ( vi ) poor or non-existent capacity for extension or repair ; ( vii ) much shorter lifespan ; ( viii ) unlikely to create @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to foster the local economy and generate employment ; ( x ) at least double the cost . <p> 2 . The steel houses have the following advantages over the block wall houses : ( i ) reduced consumption of natural resources , primarily sand and timber ; ( ii ) reduced erection time ; ( iii ) a reported financing arrangement for their construction . <p> 3 . In the above context it is clear that the way forward is to construct block wall houses , while finding ways to overcome any disadvantages they may have ( e.g. finding new sources of natural resources ; alternative technologies to reduce natural resource usage ; arranging financing ) . <p> The Fundamental Rights Application <p> The Petitioner Muhammed Fazl of No.35 B 1/1 , Watarappola Road , Mount Lavinia filed a Fundamental Rights Application stating that he is an independent social/political activist and a columnist for the Colombo Telegraph website among inter alia engages in investigative writing and runs social media campaign against corruption and for rule of law . <p> When the case was taken up before two-member Supreme Court @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on May 30 , the Attorney General brought to the notice of the Court that five committees have been appointed in respect of the tender adding that the tender process had not been complete . Directing the Petitioner to issue notices to all Respondents ( except the Attorney General ) the Court fixed the matter for support on October 14.

The airline did previously have a procedure in place but it has been further streamlined , Renuke Senanayke confirmed . <p> Tensions arose between SriLankan Airlines and the Pilots Guild of SriLanka when one of the senior pilots Sujith Jayasekera was suspended by SriLankan Airlines for allegedly refusing to take a casual breathalyzer test which was revived after the incident at the Frankfurt Airport on August 19 . <p> " SriLankan Airlines claims the pilot was suspended for harassing the security officers , which is not true and there is no inquiry conducted by the management with the pilot and the reason why he was suspended is yet to be revealed , " said Senanayke . <p> Any individual of the country has the right to question the officer as to why he has been tested and it is the duty of the officer to explain the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would do unlike what happened at the Airline . <p> " It is a simple procedure to explain why the test was being done and not to suspend the pilot , " protested Senanayke . <p> Although demands regarding the breathalyzer procedure have been met , pilots are continuing their objection in support of Captain Jayasekera 's suspension . The Pilots Guild of SriLanka claimed that the breathalyzer test is indeed a requirement and that they are not against it . <p> " If the company wants to test the pilots every day and every time they get into the aircraft let them do it but pilots should not be suspended for no proper reason and not for questioning the shortcomings of a procedure . " <p> The Pilots Guild of Sri Lanka said that the company has bought down the equipment for breathalyzer tests which is expensive and they hope the procedure will be implemented properly . However , the Pilots ' Guild of SriLanka said media reports published claiming the Guild was defending the pilot who was under the influence of alcohol at the Frankfurt Airport and they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pilot who was suspended for no appropriate reason . The senior pilot did not refuse to undergo the test he only ' questioned ' why he was being tested as no such tests were conducted earlier . <p> " No pilot will stand for alcohol abuse neither did the Pilots Guild of Sri Lanka , " said Senanayke . <p> The Sri Lankan Airlines pilot was not caught by the Frankfurt Airport management , it was the assertiveness of the other two Co-Pilots Nuwan Gunaratne the current Assistant Secretary of the Airline Pilots Guild of Sri Lanka and Shane Livera who informed their Chief Pilot Capt . Praveen Wettimuny in Colombo of Capt . Ranaweera 's abnormal behaviour at the time of pick up from the hotel . <p> However , SriLankan Airlines responding to questions says that this is standard procedure if an individual refuses to undergo a random breathalyzer test and therefore , the pilot is suspended from flying duties pending an investigation . <p> Since the incident is currently being investigated and two staff members have been served with " show cause " letters it is company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prejudice the outcome . <p> SriLankan Airlines said that once the individuals have responded to the show-cause letters , the matter will be looked into by an independent investigation officer or arbitrator .

This process is taking place now . <p> The tests take place under guidelines issued by the Regulator the CAASL . All the relevant procedures are available in the public domain .

@@14430232 <h> UN Involvement , ... Rights Violations And Terrorism <p> by Laksiri Fernando <p> UNHRC sessions in Geneva <p> When Sanja De Silva Jayatilleka wrote about " This September in Geneva : Sri Lanka at the UNHRC , " I expressed my agreement on two main points , having realised that the government inaction or ' meek submission ' ( like the other extreme of the previous government 's ' aggressive denial ' ) not only might harm the national interest , but also would derail the reconciliation process that the present government is keen in promoting in the country . <p> My proposal was ' constructive and active engagement ' with the UN Human Rights Council ( UNHRC ) and not outright rejection or denial of the UN concerns . The two points I highlighted were the following in respect of the Report of the Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances on its mission to Sri Lanka . <p> Two points <p> ( 1 ) Sri Lanka should have and should even now record ( strong ) reservations on the inclusion of an unsubstantiated sentence from a HR High Commissioner 's speech which would prejudice the Council . Otherwise it would create @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and should at least now request clarification or modification of the wording in Para 6 which claims ' deliberate massive and systematic ' war crimes for many decades . <p> An undiplomatic question here is what the hell the UNHRC or the Working Group was doing all these decades ? The sentence on which the suggested reservation to be placed was the following . <p> " In its report on its investigation on Sri Lanka , the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights stated that " there are reasonable grounds to believe that a number of military cadres , who had laid down arms and were thus hors de combat , were unlawfully killed after having surrendered unarmed to the security forces " and that " a number of LTTE cadres , such as those belonging to the political wing , and other individuals not or no longer taking direct part in hostilities , including children , were also extra judicially executed . " <p> The reasons are clear . ( 1 ) UNHR Commissioner 's statement has no direct relevance to the Working Group 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's statement says " there are reasonable grounds to believe " without any evidence . ( 3 ) It is a pre-judgement which could again prejudice the Council . This is already done once . ( 4 ) It has the appearance of building up of a case for ' genocide ' perhaps with political motives . ( 5 ) What was suggested is placing of a ' reservation ' and not a rejection of the whole report . <p> Second , I suggested a request of ' clarification on or modification ' of Paragraph 6 which Jayatilleka also has highlighted . The paragraph reads as follows . <p> " Enforced disappearances have been used in a massive and systematic way in Sri Lanka for many decades to suppress political dissent , counter-terrorist activities or in the internal armed conflict . Given the context in which they occurred , many enforced disappearances could be considered as war crimes or crimes against humanity if addressed in a court of law . " <p> The reasons are again clear . ( 1 ) The claim is farfetched saying ' used in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decades . ' ( 2 ) The claim or rather rhetoric can be build up for a ' genocide ' claim already in circulation . ( 3 ) Although ' counter-terrorism ' is mentioned , there is no mentioning of the LTTE Terrorism that the country and all communities were inflicted with . ( 4 ) There is a clear accusation of the government only . <p> Constructive Engagement <p> If a government does not at least place ' reservations ' and ask for ' clarifications and modifications ' on what is placed before the UNHRC , that is not constructive engagement but meek submission . <p> The past regime 's ' zero-casualty ' claim or denial should not be an inhibition , if the present government is straight forward and genuine in its efforts to find the truth and move for reconciliation . It has to be underlined that the incidents referred to in the quoted statement in the report pertain to the period in which the present President was the Acting Commander in Chief . Therefore , inaction would be suicidal . <p> The present government and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ positive role in the UNHR Council proceedings particularly because there is a clear imbalance in its present approach where ' genocide ' or ' near genocide ' is highlighted in dubious ways while ' terrorism ' is not at all recognised or discussed as an ' international crime , ' ' war crime ' or at least as a threat and a ' catalyst for massive human rights violations . ' <p> It is not clear whether this lacunae or neglect merely stems from ( 1 ) the non-recognition of terrorism as an international crime in the Rome Statutes or ( 2 ) whether this is part of a political scheme where Sri Lanka could be kept submissive or under continuous suspense . <p> In the case of the Working Group , it is possible that the first is the reason , but in the case of the UN Secretary General or even the UNHR Commissioner , the second also might be possible . The SG 's ' off the cuff ' rhetoric in his recent visit to Sri Lanka is one example . Even if terrorism is not directly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is so much of customary as well as codified law where it should be considered as an international crime . There were codified laws under the League of Nations . Therefore the UNHRC should be persuaded to recognise the problem and its role in the war and events in Sri Lanka . In my opinion , that is also the reality , however un-excusable some of the actions and behaviour of the military during the war and the last stages of the war . Those should be investigated impartially including the alleged incidents of the killing of the surrendered political wing leaders and some LTTE cadres . <p> Even overseas judges could have been involved if not for the present appalling imbalance in the UN approach to the human rights violations and possible war crimes in Sri Lanka not recognising ' terrorism ' as a crime . <p> The danger of this imbalance or the soft corner for ' terrorism ' is the possibility of its resurrection in the country in the same or in a different form . <p> A Discussion <p> When I made my brief comments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person named Ajith , who used to previously engage in many conversations , raised the following questions , which might linger among many people in the country . He was particularly referring to my reservations on the UNHR Commissioner 's statement . <p> " If you do n't agree with the statement , can you deny with substantial evidence that it is not deliberate , it is not massive and it is not systematic war crimes for many decades . <p> You can start with colonisation to change demography , Sinhala only Act , language based standardisation , and 1958 , 1962 , 1977 , 1981 , 1983 and 1983-2015 . How do you want to rephrase the sentence ? " <p> I did n't rephrase the sentence , as it is not up to me , but gave the following answer ( now slightly edited ) which might be useful for any frank and open discussion on the subject . <p> " I suggested placing a reservation because ( 1 ) it is not a finding of the mission which came to Sri Lanka and ( 2 ) the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which many of the sweeping accusations were not substantiated . <p> In addition , I must say that if the UN produces reports of the Darusman type , whether on Sri Lanka or elsewhere , then the credibility of the UN and the accusations would be highly suspect . I have been the chief representative of the World University Service ( Geneva ) to the Human Rights Commission during 1985-1991 , and I have never seen that type of an unprofessional report . <p> Now you have given some events of discrimination and violence against the Tamils from colonisation to 2015 . I can agree that when taken together , the discriminations , violations and violence are massive . <p> But I doubt whether all those were systematic . If it is systematic then who was behind ? Of course , one can accuse the State or the Sinhalese . First , I do n't think a ' collective guilt ' could be placed on a whole community , whether the Sinhalese or the Tamils for any violation . Second , when we refer to the State , it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only or standardisation , those were policies however discriminatory . The correction of those have to be done through the democratic process , while I agree that majoritarianism is an obstacle . <p> But the most important question is whether they are war crimes ? Let us forget about layman 's understanding of the International Criminal Law . <p> But how can the UN appointed professionals indulge in such interpretations ? In respect of 1958 , 1977 , 1981 or 1983 , I agree that there were organised elements behind the violations and all perpetrators should have been punished . But what the hell the UN was doing all these days ? What about 1971 and 1987-91 ? We have to agree that Sri Lanka has been and still a violent society . <p> Many of the human rights violations in Sri Lanka or other countries occur because of conflicts . In these conflicts there are of course perpetrators and victims , but not in a black and white manner . <p> What about Terrorism ? <p> It is my concerned view that those who accuse Sri Lanka of ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confront two challenges , if they are sincere and genuine . First is the democratic character of the state system , however lopsided and defective . Second is the non-recognition of ' Terrorism ' as a war crime in the present international criminal law . <p> I really do n't know your view on ' terrorism . ' Can you kindly explain ? <p> Of course there are all indications that there were human rights violations which would tantamount to war crimes particularly between 1983 and 2009 on both sides . ( You can not consider the previous events war crimes , because there was no War ! ( I think people like you should refrain from mere rhetoric . ) The events between 1983 and 2009 should be investigated . <p> I have written about some of the clear cases . I think because of the accusers ' political rhetoric , some of the perpetrators can easily escape in the political melee . On my part , I consider terrorism as a war crime . It was considered when the Rome Statutes were drafted , but dropped for convenience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how the UN works ! Do n't trust too much .

For them and others in the country , it 's an occasion to recall what exactly had gone wrong with the Sri Lanka resolution , when , why and how . <p> To be fair to Sri Lanka , especially the war-time Government of President Mahinda Rajapaksa , it was a rude shock that the European Union ( EU ) should move a resolution at UNHRC , only days after LTTE terrorism had been conclusively neutralised in military terms . The rulers seemed to have been very much aware as to what was likely to come , and also later on , but they handled it less diplomatically and more rigidly . <p> India was among the three Asian neighbours -- the other being Pakistan and China -- that had rallied round Sri Lanka at the time . Given its geo-strategic location and importance , Sri Lanka could also claim credit for bringing mutually irreconcilable neighbours in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ post-Cold War geo-political divide was taking shape . <p> With support and sympathy from many other voting-members , these three not only could get the EU resolution defeated at Geneva but also have a counter-resolution , praising the nation for defeating terrorism , passed at UNHRC . The effects of the resolution did not seem to have lost on Sri Lanka , especially the government of the day . The ' affected ' Tamil Diaspora did not want memories of the immediate past , including UNHRC 's May 2009 resolution , be lost , either . <p> It was thus that a future resolution against Sri Lanka was already on cards when the 2009 resolution got passed in UNHRC , defying the West . Sri Lanka was not unaware of it then . Instead , it did little or nothing to address core issues , and core constituencies that had mattered at the time -- and since . The results are there for everyone to see , since . <p> Post-war ' triumphalism ' <p> If post-war ' triumphalism ' showed up , it was not in honest attempts at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , despite what the world and the world Tamils would want to believe , it did take certain initiatives .

If it did not make headway , that was because the TNA suddenly got pushed into ' accountability issues ' and ' war crimes ' charges against the government . If the government had not initiated any move on this score , it had not possibly provided for the likelihood of ' war-time accountability issues ' erupting out of nowhere , especially when it had concluded that the TNA was on the same page on larger issues . <p> Possibly , the government had also concluded , without evidence that the TNA would play along if and when ' accountability issues ' made their mark again in the international arena , post-May 2009 resolution .

Shorn of their diplomatic packaging , then UNHRC Chief Navi Pillay 's repeated observations , including those on Sri Lankan soil , were as provocative as those from the Tamil Diaspora that was licking its political wounds , post-war . <p> To this , UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon added his own methods and methodologies . It was as if Ki-moon was doing a ' My moon , my every body 's moon ' act as far as international diplomacy on the score went . Couched in diplomatic terms that the government of the day was in no mood to hear , leave alone listen , he would make ' positive ' observations nearer home and in meetings with Sri Lankan leadership.From UN headquarters , Ban would have the Darusman Report commissioned , and would explain it away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the subject . Yet , later he would forward the same to Geneva for Navi Pillay and the rest to quote from and initiate action . In between , the UN would also make no attempts to find out how the interim Report of the three-member panel , and later the final report got leaked . It 's doubtful if any other report of the kind had leaked in the UN , and had not been probed , either . <p> The Sri Lankan government mood on the subject was all set long before the war had concluded . It had commenced with the EU admonitions on ' white van disappearances ' in capital Colombo , which was fair criticism by all means . It was carried over to Geneva and afterward when the EU moved the May 2009 resolution , without giving time for the nation and the government to recover from the exit of the LTTE . The die seemed to have been cast . <p> Yet , Sri Lanka can not escape responsibility for not taking the international community into confidence for whatever it was worth . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shifting on HR front alone came to be noticed , recorded and acted upon -- and not of the international community .

L. Peiris to Washington , the Rajapaksa government would not even respond for weeks and months together . It was not something Sri Lanka should have treated lightly . Nor would have the US treated it lightly , either . <p> Movers &amp; shakers <p> With greater experience and exposure , expertise and institutional memory , India knew where Sri Lanka was going wrong . By not engaging the international community , and refusing to discuss details of the US resolution draft with the movers , and also the shakers , Sri Lanka was only compounding its own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is one thing , and seeing it through UNHRC was another . <p> The options before India were limited , if any . Either it had to go the whole hog with Sri Lanka , or acknowledge a ' negotiated resolution ' that would have taken care of long-term Sri Lankan and neighbourhood interests and concerns . India chose the pragmatic route , and did help stall an ' international probe ' against Sri Lanka , twice in as many years . <p> As subsequent events and developments have proved , Sri Lanka itself has since come to co-author and co-sponsor the 2015 UNHRC resolution . Sri Lanka , and not India , gave in to the western demands for ' international probe ' . In between , India , and possibly India alone , had stood steadfast in denying and declining every prospect and proposal for an ' independent , international probe ' on ' accountability issues ' in Sri Lanka . <p> Cats on the wall <p> If someone still thought that India could have stalled the US-sponsored UNHRC resolution , when it was first moved , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any , from the scratch .

Again , theirs is poor knowledge of the way UN and UNHRC diplomacy are handled by big , small and medium powers . <p> The former and the latter often do not have much to lose whereas the middle has much to lose . Hence they are circumspect and futuristic . Sri Lanka-2015 proved , both in terms of domestic elections and later , that the Indian hindsight was correct , after all . <p> What 's often forgotten is that at the time UNHRC was to discuss and vote on the US resolution , and Sri Lanka itself was busy fighting with its back to the wall , domestic players were fighting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ India and the rest could not have been blamed , also for the indiscretions of some , and indecisiveness of some others -- all of which were politically exploited by those that had always wanted to get one up on the other , or other nations , India included . <p> Again , India or Indians , diplomats and the rest , could not have been blamed then . Nor could they be blamed now , not after Sri Lanka had belatedly reacted to the Indian suggestion itself , and negotiated with the resolution-movers in 2015 . Yet , it was they , not India , who had agreed to an ' international probe ' , even then -- only to indulge in shadow-boxing at a higher-level than in the past , but still within . <p> The fact still remains that the West moved the UNHRC , especially after the defeat of the EU resolution in 2009 , only after finding that it could not pass muster in the main UN body , namely the Security Council . Russia and China -- not necessarily in that order -- would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look as if the UNHRC provided the ready alternate forum , where majority decides , and majority alone decides . With the result , questions remain if UNHRC and the like have been created only to bypass veto-powers in the UNSC . If it 's so , where from here is the question . If not , why not ? <p> Feel-good factor <p> The incumbent Sirisena-Ranil government has done well for the nation , in creating and sustaining a ' feel-good factor ' , nearer home and far . Yet , it 's just that and nothing more . <p> The Tamil nearer home do not seem to have given up on any of their political demands , to which the international community has consistently added ' accountability issues ' . The international community itself is persistent with its demands on this score . <p> The Rajapaksa leadership lost the global game by identifying itself too much with China , when there was not exactly and great need , justification , or even possible demand . Independent of internal differences over ' accountability mechanisms ' just now and possibly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the global community just fine . <p> The UNP 's inherent identification with the West , especially the US , has served this government well . Perceptions and possibilities that the party and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe are calling the shots on all major issues of common concern to the US , the rest of the West -- and to a greater or lesser degree , the Indian neighbour -- have ensured that the ' accountability issues ' have not blown upon Sri Lanka 's face once again , as it had done under Rajapaksa . <p> Yet , the present gvernment has also found the need , justification and at times compulsion , to keep China , too not-so-very uncomfortable as the West used to feel under Rajapaksa , after Sri Lanka 's own war on terror had been won .

With the issue of child molestation and murder there was a outcry from the society to impose the capital punishment . However the death penalty is not implemented and the convicts are automatically given a life imprisonment . <p> Therefore there is a common belief in the society that these convicts are pardoned and released All this is centered around the imbalances and inequalities of our legal system . <p> The following are some of the comments made by intellectuals and civil society activisits regarding the pros and cons of imposing the death penalty in Sri Lanka . <p> Brito Fernando - Chairman , Organisation of the Family Members of the Disappeared <p> Some aruge that the criminals have lost their fear to commit crimes as death penalty is imposed When considering the long time it takes for our judicial system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ society expects a quicker punishment . <p> Some people may thus claim that cutting the arm of a thief is an appropriate punishment . <p> The reason for this is the long delay in convicting the criminals But we must understand that many countries now think that it is pointless to kill the criminals . One may argue in both ways in this regard . <p> For an example when the crime rates are increasing the people want increased punishments to minimise crimes . In this regard until steps are taken to speed up the justice system the rule of law can not be upheld . <p> So until then the demand for the death penalty will not stop . So we must dispense justice faster then public will not demand a short term solution . <p> -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - <p> Saman Rathnapriya -Social Activist <p> Death Penalty is not imposed or implemented carried out in civilized countries . But when we look at the wave of murders rapes and other crimes that were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ penalty as a solution . it was even discussed in parliament.When the public trust on the law and its agencies are shattered people tend to demand more grusome solutions ' . People tend to think that killing the criminals is the best way to prevent them from being released back in to the society . But unfortunately there are no country in the world that has disciplined the people by imposing death panelty or inhumane punishemtns . <p> The main reason for this problem as I see is the inefficiency of the rulers of the the country so far . As informed citizens we can not agree with the idea of preventing crimes by killing off criminals . Just because a man kills another human we can not attain justice by killing the criminal So it is important to rehabilitate criminals . We must give them an opportunity to change themselves . So we must change the society in order to prevent crime . <p> -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - <p> Sagara Kariyawasam -- Attorney At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form of inhuman punishment . The concept of " an eye to an eye " is not suitable for a civilszed society . We have no right to end the life of another human being . So even our laws must evolve from such primitive states and move towards civilization . By killing a person the state could only send a threatening message to the public . Other than that it does not prevent any person from doing the <p> crime again . If we take the countries that impose the most gruesome punishments in the world for an example , in countries like Kuwait and Saudi Arabia there are weekly executions of criminals by beheading and stoning . But still those societies have not been devoid of crimes . <p> If anyone is in the view that the society can be disciplines by punishing those who commit crimes then it is not a practical solution . Crimes can only be prevented by developing the morals of the people . Education and spiritual upliftment is the key in this . If anyone believes that criminals can be discouraged by hanging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could reform our laws and remove the death penalty from our legal system then in my view that is the most appropriate thing to do . <p> We must remove those who commit crimes from the society and rehabilitate them . If there are those who can not be rehabilitated then there is no problem imposing life sentences on them . But still when it comes to the right of taking a life , I still belive that no one has a right to do so . <p> If by killing the criminal we intend to punish him , it is an unsuccessful attempt as the criminal is being freed from the bonds of his life . What is the punishment there ? Some try to justify this by saying that others learn a lesson by seeing the executions . But in reality the crime rates of the countries that do carry out the death penalty has not been reduced . Therefore in my opinion removing the gallows is the least we could do as a civilied society . <p> -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rev. Shantha Sagara - Editor , Gnanarathna Pradeepaya <p> In our legal system the parties are being tortured in a lengthy legal procedure . But when the life time imprisonment is imposed , we still can not see any strict application of justice . Therefore there is a common belief in our society that the law in Sri Lanka ia not strict and that it is not enforced . It has been confirmed by the way the trials are being conducted and the final outcomes of those trials . <p> The convict who receives a life time imprisonment goes out smiling . He shows his handcuffs to the public as he thinks that this is only for a short time . The death penalty has become a joke at present no wonder the people are laughing at the law . <p> In the past those court decisions were respected . But today it is not so . The convicts are either being freed under the frame work of human rights or on moral grounds based on the disgrace it creates in the international community . So we have to look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decision on this regard . If we do impose capital punishment then we must carry it out or we must not impose the capital punishment at all . <p> Here we must look into the religious point of view when imposing capital punishment . Even though Sri Lanka is a Buddhist country the law and dministration must not take that into consideration when enforcing the law . Giving fair punishment for a crime is not something that is gainst the culture . <p> Especially when it comes to the fight against narcotics we see a deterioration of entunsiasm among our leaders . No matter how much we talk about it still there are kilos of narcotics being confiscated often . We even see foreigners moving freely inside the country with narcotics . THe number of pardons available to criminals has removed all sense of repentance for the crime . <p> Even if we could not bring back the gallows we must do something to strengthen the seriousness of the law . The jail has now become a place that offers people free food and lodging . Some are even willing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as death penalty and gallows have lost there meaning . So we must find out a solution for this . Otherwise it 's the law that is being disgraced . <p> -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- <p> Dr. Tudor Weerasinghe -- Senior Lecturer , J'Pura University <p> It is normal for humans to make mistakes.But unlike those who are compelled to break the law due to poverty or physical and mental deformities , there are group of people who commit organised crimes in order to enhance their power or wealth in the society . This latter group of individuals must be punished for their actions . <p> Under existing laws if anyone is found guilty beyond reasonable doubt then there is no problem in imposing the maximum punishment that is available , be it the death penalty , for he has committed the offense intentionally . <p> That is something that should not have happened in a civilised society . But we must also keep in mind that the society can not be rectified by imposing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changed by making structural changes . <p> Even though there is a legal frame work in our country that permits the death penalty it is not being executed on moral grounds . <p> Instead the convicts are given a life imprisonment . But here the jail tem can vary on the government changes and other factors . So this has a serious effect on the society . This might allow people to think that they could evade justice by doing any kind of crime . This is only going to encourage criminals to do more crimes . <p> In a less developped society like ours the gap between social classes , wealth and power could have impact on law The capital punishment is the bench mark of the discipline of a country . So it has an effect on the society than we think . so we may argue that death penalty could do an injustice to those who have been wrongfully convicted . In our judicial system innocent people as well as criminals are being convicted and acquitted all the time . <p> That is is problem with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how it floats . So on practical grounds it is not easy to expect justice . It may vary on money , power , social status , political influence etc <p> So there are many things that affects the dispensing of justice . In this regard it may be questionable for the people how the death penalty is carried out . Therefore it has become an important part in driving the society to a disciplined status

The power station is located in Norochcholai , Puttalam , on the southern-end of the Kalpitiya Peninsula . The Norochcholai power plant , as a whole , adds 900 MW of electricity to the National Grid . <p> Environment Protection License is issued by Central Environmental Authority in Sri Lanka and once issued CEB bound to adhere to the conditions stipulated in it . To get EPL an environment impact assessment report should be submitted by the power plant . But such report has not been submitted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has long faded , five years after operations at Lakwijaya began . Today the environmental , social and cultural impacts of the power plant have exceeded all expectations and the long term consequences of this plant are already being felt by the people of Norochcholai and its surrounding villages . The residents of the area continue to lead their lives amidst these issues are the victims . <p> The plant is located 100m -- 200m away from the seashore and the ship which transport coal has to be berthed in the sea as the coast line has eroded . Barges are used to get the coal in to the land and some chunks of coal fall in to the sea when unloading from ship to the barges . This happens again when unloading the coal from barges to the jetty . The fishery harvest of the area has been reduced by 20 percent while the fish habitats have been affected due to this exercises , fisherman of the area complained . <p> Around 60,000 metric tons of coal is transported to the plant annually . The other issue that needed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the plant . <p> For six months of the year ( April -- August ) , with the onset of the South West monsoon , the wind brings coal dust and fly ash towards the landside , blackening agricultural fields , homes , coconut trees , etc .

Also there was another plan to sell the ash to cement industry , which again yet to see the light of implementation due to the higher percentage of carbon in fly ash . Ash is carried up to 2km away from the plant . <p> Sri Lanka 's government and the electricity regulator Public Utilities Commission is pushing hard for renewable energy and holds the approval of long term generation plan of CEB which again supports the coal power . <p> However authorities should ensure the Norochcholai power plant is operated under EPL , so that the damage to the environment would be somewhat controlled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Road For Coal Power Plants ? " <p> The EFL should be looking at stopping the land being completely covered by plastic bags , which is happening all over our countryside and will adversely effect our fauna and flora as time goes on . Coal power plants if properly managed are the cheapest form of energy used in India , Australia and many other countries . I think the almost stagnant traffic in Colombo causes much more environmental pollution than a coal power plant .

He warns that the trend could worsen . <p> " We are experiencing a similar situation when the project was commenced in January 2014 . If the right measures are not taken immediately , the situation will worsen , " he stressed . <p> When contacted , Uma Oya Project Director Dr. Sunil de Silva said that the project activists are aware of such problems and cautious in carrying out their task . He added that they were taking all possible measures to minimise the impact . <p> The director said that normally July and August hot weather dries up wells @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more wells turning dry in the Heel Oya area in Bandarawela . <p> The report submitted to the Supreme Court shows that original ingress of water ( 450 L/s ) was reduced to 60/70 L/s before sealing and after sealing it reduced to 47 L/s . However , when the drilling operation continued , it has increased to 110 to 125 L/s . This proves that they are tunnelling through the shallow water aquifer , says Hemantha Withanage , the Executive Director , the Centre for Environmental Justice and Director Friends of Earth ( FoE ) , Sri Lanka . <p> The Supreme Court <p> Meanwhile , the Supreme Court last week ordered the Director of Agriculture , Uva Province to estimate the loss caused to the farmers as a result of the Uma Oya Multi-Purpose project , and to pay compensation to them . The Court also ordered that water be provided before December 31 to the victims . <p> A three-member bench comprising Chief Justice K. Sripavan , justices Priyantha Jayawardene , and Eva Wanasundara issued the order after hearing a petition filed by four farmers from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of farmers were severely affected when the water source for farmlands of ten villages was lost as a result of the Uma Oya Multi Purpose Project.A leak occurred in December 2014 , when a tunnel being constructed as part of the Uma Oya Project cracked open an underground water cable . Even though the leak has now been sealed , and construction of the tunnel has recommenced , the environmental damage it caused has not yet been rectified . <p> Last year , the governments recommenced the temporarily halted controversial Uma Oya Multipurpose Project , despite agitation and campaigns by environmental groups . The Senior Engineer said : " It is cleared from our side . Now it is up to the Iranian Government " . <p> A ministry official said that the Ministry has taken all preventive measures to mitigate environmental impact . However , the government can not stop the progress of the scheme since it was categorised as one of the Ceylon Electricity Board 's ( CEB ) long term projects . <p> The official added that these projects could not be simply stopped since nongovernmental organisations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would involve the construction of two reservoirs on tributaries of the Uma Oya River and one tunnel on the river itself to divert water to a powerhouse further downstream , an engineer said.CEB engineers said that the project would generate 90MW of electricity and irrigate 5,000 hectares . <p> Some officials have pointed out that the project will end up with poor quality products . However , others said that local engineers would look into all the aspects . <p> Meanwhile , Sri Lanka Nature Forum Director Sajeewa Chamikara alleged that launching a project without a proper plan or a feasibility study or an Environmental Impact Assessment ( EIA ) or any sort of permission from any relevant government agencies would set a very bad precedent . <p> The Sri Lanka Nature Forum , a leading critic of the project conservation , will launch a formal campaign against it , he said . <p> However , the government went ahead with the project for its irrigation and power generation benefits ; others are more cautious and they warn that the Uma Oya Watershed can not sustain such a large water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diverted to irrigate agro areas near the Mahaweli River . With the construction of the Uma Oya project , more water would be diverted from the river . After the construction of the reservoirs and the tunnel , the people living upstream of the tunnel are likely to suffer water shortages , environmentalists warn . <p> Officials say even without the dam , the water level of the Uma Oya River had dropped drastically during the dry season , environmentalists said . After the construction of the dam , the diversion of water from the river during dry season months would drastically reduce the water available for drinking and irrigating the fields . The project would not be able to generate any electricity during the months of December-April , they said . <p> Siltation is another problem that the project is bound to face , experts say . The Rantembe reservoir in the Uma Oya Watershed has silted up within a very short time and lost much of its generation capacity.The Central Engineering Consultancy Bureau and the Government Valuation Department detailed to carry out a damage assessment to pay compensation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1,500 houses , and recommended to pay Rs. 200 million to the project developer . <p> Mahaweli Development and Environment Ministry Secretary , Engineer , Nihal Rupasinghe said that the initial estimation had come to more than Rs. 150 million and the resettlement process would be completed soon . <p> The multi-purpose project will involve the construction of two reservoirs on Uma Oya and one of its tributaries to divert water to a power station . <p> This project will include construction of two rolling compact concrete dams , an underground hydropower plant with 134 MW capacity and about 25 Km underground tunnel . <p> Under the Uma Oya Hydropower project , water will be diverted to Kirindi Oya basin which will carry water to Hambantota through a 25 km long underground tunnel across mountains in Bandarawela . A dam will be built at Puhulpola in Welimada and a reservoir at Diaraba . Once completed , the project will irrigate 5,000 hectares of agricultural land . <p> The project is estimated to cost USD 529 million . The government of Sri Lanka will meet 15 per cent of the cost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loan of USD 450 . Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad during his visit to Sri Lanka in 2008 signed an agreement to provide financial and technical assistance to Uma Oya Project . <p> " The project 's contractors have done a lot of damage by not adhering to the environment plan , " Rupasinghe said . However , he stressed that the project was feasible . <p> " There is nothing wrong with the project . Similar issues cropped up when other hydro projects like the Victoria dam construction was underway , " he said . <p> The responsibility mainly lies with the contractor FARAB Energy and Water Project Company , an Iranian company , which was awarded the contract to design and carry out the project . <p> Earlier , President Maithripala Sirisena has appointed a five-member Cabinet subcommittee to make recommendations on the Uma Oya Project and allocated Rs. 300 million to provide relief to the affected people . <p> Rupasinghe said that priority had been given to repair the tunnel leakage as it was causing significant damage to water resources . He said that there were no immediate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 25 million had been released to the AG to pay compensation for the damaged houses . <p> " If there is a need for relocation , we will consider it as a -term remedy , " he said , adding that the project authorities had been asked to rectify the conditions identified as major causes for the damages before they proceed with the project work . " We are waiting for the comprehensive report from the expert panel to submit it to the Cabinet Sub Committee soon , " he noted . <p> The report was prepared by the experts of the CEA , National Building Research Organisation and GSMB . A team from the University of Peradeniya will also contribute their expertise for the comprehensive report . <p> Sajeewa Chamikara of the Environment Conservation Trust has also urged the government to stop the project as it would cause a huge disaster if the present construction work being done without following the required conditions , continues . <p> He said that the construction of tunnels to carry water from Puhul Oya reservoir to Dyraaba reservoir is the the main cause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ completed some one third of the tunnel construction . When the 26 km-long tunnel is completed , the hilly areas of the Uva Province will be prone to severe landslide threats as the constructors carry out works in unstable rocky lands , " he warned . <p> " Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa and the CEA should be held responsible for putting people 's lives in danger by implementing this failed project , " Chamikara stressed . <p> Civil organisations , environmentalists and victims in Bandarawela who have staged several protest campaigns demanding a permanent closure of the project and urging the government to protect their lives , have decided to continue with their protest campaigns until the government takes a stern decision on the project . <p> " We held a vehicle procession carrying black flags to educate people in the Badulla District last week . Over 20,000 people took part in the campaign to urge the government to take speedy solutions to save their lives . We will continue with our struggle because our lives are in jeopardy now , " a resident said . <p> Cabinet has approved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oya Multi-Purpose Project , which had been suspended for more than six months due to a large water leak in the Karandagolla main tunnel in December 2014 .

Postgraduate Education in Sciences <h> Postgraduate Institute of Science ( PGIS ) completes two decades of service to the nation : <p> October 6 , 2016 , 9:17 pm <p> By Professor R. P. Gunawardane <p> By gazette notification dated 18 January 1996 , Mr. Richard Pathirana , Minister of Education and Higher Education at the time , issued an order under the Universities Act No. 16 of 1978 establishing the Postgraduate Institute of Science ( PGIS ) attached to the University of Peradeniya fulfilling a long-felt need in this country . <p> It was expected that this new postgraduate institute of the Sri Lankan university system will function as the nerve center for promoting , stimulating and organizing postgraduate education and training in sciences at the national level drawing resources from all the universities , R &amp; D institutions , industries and private sector organizations in the country . Among the programmes envisaged were MPhil/PhD by research , MSc/Diploma/Certificate courses , in-service training/short courses , extension services to the community and consultancy services to other institutions/ industries . <p> PG Institutes <p> In the 1990 's , there were five postgraduate institutes in existence under the Sri Lankan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Medicine , Management , Pali and Buddhist studies and Archeology . Discipline oriented PG institutes have been proven to be successful in the Sri Lankan context because they are highly effective in mobilizing expertise and resources in the same discipline to one forum for organization of PG courses , research and training in that particular discipline . In the Sri Lankan model , the PG institutes are attached to a national university for the purpose of granting degrees and maintaining high academic standards through its senate . These institutes have their own Boards of Study and Boards of Management consisting of professionals representing different areas of study . The degree of autonomy given to these institutes allows them to practice innovative approaches and implement novel programmes expeditiously depending on national needs . <p> Need for a PGIS <p> Until 1996 , there was no postgraduate institute to promote , organize and conduct postgraduate courses/research in scientific disciplines , although there has been some progress in expanding scientific research and graduate programmes during the previous two decades . Thus , there was a long-felt need for the establishment of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since there was an urgent thrust at the time to train scientific manpower for the 21st century , organized training in sciences at the postgraduate level became an urgent necessity for Sri Lanka . <p> During this period , there was a growing demand for training manpower needs of scientific , educational and industrial institutions locally , particularly because of extremely high cost of such training abroad . In the meantime , the Higher Education Sector Report ( 1995 ) of the Ministry of Education and Higher Education also recommended the establishment of a postgraduate institute for natural sciences in pursuance of establishing centers of excellence for PG training . <p> Peradeniya was considered as an ideal location for the proposed PGIS in view of its excellent research record in sciences , diversity of faculties , and its proximity to many other important institutions , such as Postgraduate Institute of Agriculture , ( PGIA ) , National Institute of Fundamental Studies ( NIFS ) , Veterinary Research Institute ( VRI ) , Tea Research Institute ( TRI ) , Royal Botanical Gardens , etc. in addition to its scenic location @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the establishment of the PGIS formulated by the Faculty of Science , Peradeniya , was approved by the University Senate , the Council and subsequently , by the UGC in late 1995 . Following the gazette notification establishing the PGIS , an Acting Director was appointed in March 1996 by the UGC facilitating the inauguration of the new institute . Immediately afterwards an office was established in the Physics building of the Faculty of Science at Peradeniya . The inaugural meeting of the Board of Management was held in April 1996 and the ten Boards of Study were constituted enabling them to formulate new PG courses and training programmes . <p> Since its establishment , the members of the Faculty of Science , University of Peradeniya , and the Boards of Study of the PGIS assisted by the administrative and support services of the university worked diligently with utmost dedication and commitment in the setting up and operation of the institute and the organization and conduct of the proposed programmes within a very short period of time . <p> The first set of PG courses was inaugurated in October 1996 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the University Grants Commission at the time . All the encouragement and assistance given by Professor S. Thilakaratne and Professor C.M. Maddumabandara , the Vice-Chancellor , University of Peradeniya at the time for the setting up of the PGIS and its speedy functioning are gratefully acknowledged . <p> Starting with a few short courses in 1996 , the PGIS conducted over 30 short courses in 2013 . These short courses were mostly geared for specific professions and groups . Typical examples are Medical Statistics for Physicians , GIS and its Applications , Scientific Data Analysis , Electronics for A/L Physics Teachers , Industrial Waste Management , Weather Forecasting , Earthquakes and Tsunami Risk Mitigation , Natural Disaster Management and Mitigation , Health and Anesthesia in Captive Elephants , etc . Number of participants trained through short-term training programmes in the year 2015 alone was over 1000 . <p> The progress and achievements of this national institution over the last two decades are remarkable and outstanding among the Sri Lankan higher educational institutions . Postgraduate student numbers were gradually increased from hundreds in early years to 2500 in 2015 . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 24 MPhils and 8 PhDs ) to PGIS students in 2014 . At the Peradeniya University Convocation -- 2015 , 14 PhD students of the PGIS were awarded degrees , which is considered to be an exceptional achievement . <p> The PGIS organized and conducted many national and international symposia during this period . Among them were International Conference on Science Education ( 1999 ) and International Conference on Visions of Futuristic Statistical Methodologies ( 2002 ) . The PGIS was responsible for the initiation of a series of International Symposia on Water Quality and Human Health in 2012 and continued this series afterwards . The PGIS Research Congress was inaugurated in 2014 and continued every year afterwards . There were 154 research papers presented at the PGIS Research Congress in 2015 covering a wide range of scientific disciplines . <p> During this period , the PGIS was able to attract many national and international research grants . In 2015 , PGIS administered 19 local research grants and 5 foreign grants amounting to Rs. 16 million . The PGIS was also able to establish links with number of foreign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sweden ) , University of Illinois and Harvard University ( USA ) , Saga University and Toyama Prefectural University ( Japan ) , University of Brunei Darussalam ( Brunei ) , Warwick University ( UK ) , University of Copenhagen ( Denmark ) and Asian Institute of Technology ( Thailand ) . <p> In line with achieving academic excellence , diversification and expansion of programmes , the infrastructural facilities at the PGIS have also improved considerably . The PGIS moved to its new building in 1999 . In order to cater to rapidly growing demands , a new wing to this building was completed in 2009 . The PGIS has a well-equipped Computer Science Laboratory and a Rock and Soil Mechanics Laboratory . The PGIS reached another milestone in research by establishing a new Instrumentation Laboratory in 2015 . Strength of the administrative , technical and support staff grew from 4 in 1997 to 24 in 2015 . Several visiting professorships are also included in the cadre . <p> Future Direction <p> The PGIS of the University of Peradeniya , since its inception in 1996 has organized and conducted a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ services , short courses , consultancies and community services to the nation maintaining the highest standards .

It will continuously improve the quality of the existing programmes and introduce new programmes of national importance . As guided by the UGC , it is also working towards minimizing state funding and reaching self-financing status . Although a considerable progress has been achieved in this regard , it is essential that partial financial support should come from the government , as currently being practiced , in order to maintain the highest standards of the postgraduate programs offered by the PGIS .

Peiris , ' Political Conflict in South Asia ' ( 2013 ) - a monograph published by the University of Peradeniya . ) <p> ' Kargil War ' <p> There have , of course , been the periodic fluctuations of this trend . In 1996 elections to the State legislature were conducted after the Indian army had established a measure of control over political violence . The ' National Conference ' led by Farooq Abdullah ( who had succeeded his father Sheikh Abdullah in 1982 ) formed the J&amp;K government in coalition with the Indian National Congress . This brought about a brief spell of near-normality in the ' Vale ' and the Jammu areas . The relative calm ended with the outbreak of the ' Kargil War ' in the summer of 1999 . <p> Several published accounts ( of which there are many ) of the circumstances that culminated in the Kargil War begin with a reference to the fact that the ' Simla Agreement ' of 1972 ( referred to above ) had left the ' Line of Control ' in the Karakorum-Saltro @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , often in the guise of " mountaineering expeditions " . These intrusions were followed by an Indian military campaign codenamed ' Operation Meghdoot ' launched in March 1984 which enabled India to gain effective control over a large part of the Siachen glacier , a geomorphic formation constituting a strategically important mountain pass located at the territorial convergence of India 's Jammu &amp; Kashmir , Pakistan 's Azad Kashmir and China 's ' Autonomous Region ' of Xinjiang . <p> In May 1999 Pakistan attempted to establish a series of military encampments in the rugged and desolate mountainous tracts overlooking the Siachen pass . This was seen in Delhi as a sinister military intrusion that disrupted the status quo , and as an attempt to sever the highway link between Sri Nagar and the township of Leh located in Indian Ladakh . This , was also interpreted by the Indian defence authorities as a step towards expanding Pakistani territory in Ladakh . Accordingly , India responded with a massive military retaliation that took the form of aerial bombardment and artillery strikes on Pakistani military encampments , and the induction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by its forces . Over the next three months there occurred fierce clashes between the two sides in the course of which India gradually gained the upper hand . By mid-July , Pakistani troops had been driven back well beyond the ill-defined frontier . The war , despite heavy losses on both sides ( caused by frostbite as much as bullet wounds , it is said ) resulted in India establishing firm military control over the entire Siachen area . Its greater impact was , of course , the further embitterment of Indo-Pakistan relations . <p> Soon after the Kargil War there was once more a barely perceptible lull in terrorist strikes within J&amp;K . This was a prelude to an unexpected unilateral ceasefire by some of the Islamic militants , followed by the usual ' kite-flying ' and preliminary communication in the course of which there emerged a spectrum of mutually irreconcilable negotiating stands . <p> Multiplicity of Conflicting Stances <p> At one end of the spectrum were certain terrorist groups such as the Lashkar-e-Taibyya ( LeT ) that were not associated with the ceasefire . They took the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ involving representatives of India , Pakistan and the " freedom fighters " . What the groups that had pioneered the ceasefire declaration ( mainly Hizbul Mujahideen and Harakat-ul Mujahideen ) demanded was an internationally monitored plebiscite conducted in Kashmir without the presence of the Indian army designed to ascertain what the Kashmiri people really desired . The negotiation stance of Farooq Abdullah , leader of the ' National Conference ' , was that Kashmir should be permitted to revert back to the 1948-1953 status in which Delhi 's authority would prevail only over J&amp;K 's foreign affairs , defence and inter-state communication . Islamabad did not endorse any position which deviated from the principle of Kashmir being a part of Pakistan . Delhi rejected all these demands , reiterating the non-negotiability of India 's sovereign rights over J&amp;K . Needless to say , serious negotiations never got off the ground . There was , once again , an upsurge of terrorist strikes and retaliatory law-enforcement violence that persisted well beyond the turn of the millennium . <p> It was at this stage that the LeT emerged in strength to become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Gruesome acts of violence for which the LeT ( sometimes in collaboration with other terrorist outfits like the JeM ) is believed to be responsible are : the massacres of civilians ( of the ' Pundit ' clan ) at Wandhana ( Kashmir ) and Soshur Samachar ( Jammu ) in 1998 , Chittisinghpur ( Kashmir ) in 2000 , Kuluchak in 2001 , Madimarg in 2003 , and Varanasi ( Bihar ) in 2005 , and Doda ( Kashmir ) in 2006 ; the attacks on the Red Fort ( 2000 ) and in the precincts of the Lok Sabha ( 2001 ) ; several bombings of commuter trains and " serial blasts " in Mumbai ; and , the most devastating of them all , the multi-pronged attack on downtown Mumbai on 26 November 2008 . <p> There is no doubt that throughout this period it was the massive deployment of military and paramilitary forces by the central government of India that kept the insurrectionary groups in J&amp;K at bay . According to estimates furnished in the ' Jane 's Sentinel ' ( a UK-based intelligence compendium @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indian military manpower permanently stationed in the state is likely to have been 300,000-400,000 , not counting the strong J&amp;K police forces operating under military command . Against the backdrop of frequent terrorist attacks , the large-scale presence of an army vested with ' emergency powers ' ( under the ASFPA , referred to above ) has all along had a profound impact on civilian life . It is not possible to ascertain the credibility of reports on Indian army atrocities frequently broadcast by the Pakistan media and about which certain ' human rights ' outfits maintain a cacophony of protest . An independent analyst of electoral politics in J&amp;K have asserted that recent elections to its state legislature which many Indian observers consider as representing a successful steps towards democracy have , in fact , been " polls conducted under the shadow of 700,000 Indian guns " . They refer in particular to " threats , intimidation , arbitrary arrests and widespread rigging " by military personnel , acting at the behest of the government of India , and its electoral ally , the ' National Conference ' of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Facets <p> More than one-hundred militant groups are believed to operate in Jammu and Kashmir ( J&amp;K ) . Quite often , their identity markers and their specific affiliations are indistinct . They are known to operate either individually or in tandem with other groups . Those that have often appeared in the limelight of international news for their terrorist attacks in the past two decades are : Hizbul Mujahideen ( HM -- " Freedom Fighters of God " ) , Harakat-ul-Mujahideen ( HuM -- " Holy War Movement " ) , Harakat-ul-Ansar ( HuA -- " Supporters of Holy War " ) , Lashkar-e-Taibyya ( LeT -- " Army of the Pure " ) , and Jaish-e-Mohammed ( JeM -- " Army of Mohammed " ) . <p> Most of these groups came into prominence after the outbreak of the Kashmiri secessionist insurrection in 1986 . For instance , the HuM made its presence felt in J&amp;K after the Soviet-Afghan War that ended in 1989 . It brought with it a large supply of arms and manpower from the Afghanistan conflict . The HuM merged with the HuA in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early years of the insurrection . It is believed to have been involved in some of the bomb attacks in Indian cities that followed the destruction of the Babri Mosque at Ayodhya in 1992 . Throughout that decade , and even thereafter , it conducted sporadic attacks on Hindu communities in the Kashmir Valley and the Jammu area , launched random guerrilla strikes on Indian security forces , disrupted essential services , carried out raids and abductions , and , in 1999 , hijacked the Air India Flight 814 in a successful blackmail operation against the government of India . <p> According to ' Jane 's Sentinel ' ( 2002:245 ) and other sources , the larger among these terrorist groups are ' multi-national ' in composition -- their cadres including fighters from Pakistan , Afghanistan , Bangladesh , Yeman , Sudan , Saudi Arabia etc . They receive funds and other forms of support from some of the oil-rich countries in West Asia , and , allegedly , clandestine sponsorship from the government of Pakistan . Some of these groups have links with extremist Islamic outfits in India like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and of West Asia such as the ' Al Qaeda ' and the ' Islamic State in Iraq and Syria ' ( ISIS ) . <p> Like many other terrorist groups of the region , they engage in clandestine transactions in narcotics and arms , and have fraternal contact with rebel outfits elsewhere -- especially in South- and Southeast Asia . For instance , as shown by an Indian analyst ( cited in Peiris , 2002 : 110 ) in 1994 , the HuA mobilized the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam ( LTTE ) in the delivery of a shipment of weapons from Pakistan to the Moro rebels in southern Philippines and , in return , supplied the LTTE a consignment of Surface-to-Air Missiles . <p> The latest upsurge of violent conflict in Kashmir was triggered off by the killing of the commander of the Hizbul Mujahideen in the course of security operations of the Indian army in July 2016 . From Indian perspectives the mass protests that ensued were so ominous that the retaliation directed by Delhi under the cover of a protracted curfew imposed throughout the Vale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the area . The attack last week on the Indian army base at Uri , evidently by ' Jaish-e-Mohammed ' infiltrators from across the LOC , causing heavy damage including the killing of 18 Jawans has been such an enormous loss that Prime Minister Modi has pledged to spearhead a diplomatic campaign to isolate Pakistan in the international community , branding it as an " exporter of terrorism " . I find this display of outrage somewhat tragicomic when I recollect the same commodity being exported from India across Palk Strait in far greater abundance in the early 1980s , followed by intimidatory diplomatic cum military interventions , thus setting in motion armed conflict sustained over almost three decades ; and , thereafter , the callous disregard of the maritime rights of Sri Lanka . <p> Dreary Propsects <p> There is no way out of the Kashmir imbroglio . Various ' conflict resolution ' proposals ( extracted from many writings , and outlined below ) are hardly ever accorded even serious thought . <p> The plebiscite proposal the UN ( implicitly reiterated by the most recent UN Secretary General , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be permitted to revert back to the status it had in 1948-1953 . <p> That the LOC should be formally recognised as a segment of the Indo-Pakistan boundary , patrolled either jointly by the two countries or by an external agency , with the areas adjacent to the LOC demilitarised by both countries . <p> Granting ' special autonomy ' ( whatever that means ) to a unit consisting of 6 Districts in the Vale of Kashmir which presumably constitute an " exclusive homeland " of Kashmiri Muslims within India . <p> The establishment of a small independent nation-state of Kashmir consisting of the entire Vale of Kashmir and a part of the Pakistan-controlled Kashmir ( i.e. 8 districts in Azad Kashmir ) . <p> As noted earlier , Pakistan 's claim to Kashmir ( or at least the Vale of Kashmir and the mountainous territory to its north ) on the basis of the basic guidelines of the ' Partition ' of British India in 1947 are irrefutable in a purely ' legalistic ' sense . Likewise , the rationalisations of the claim that Kashmir ( as , indeed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the departing British ) , was within the pre-modern empires that had their core areas in the Indo-Gangetic plains , and the control of Kashmir control is vitally necessary to India 's security do not lack substance . However , what the experiences of Indo-Pakistan dispute stretching over the past 70 years illustrate more clearly than all else is the futility of repetition of these discordant stances however well embellished they are with academic sophistry or strident rhetoric , from the viewpoint of making it possible for the people of Kashmir to live in peace . <p> There are certain obvious considerations that tend to be ignored in the heat of debate . One of these is that in ' Kashmir ' , excluding the ' Jammu Districts ' ( i.e. roughly , the areas south of the Pir Panjal range ) , 97% of the population in the India-controlled areas , and 99% of population in the Pakistan-controlled areas are Muslims . Another is the existence of a persuasive body of evidence indicating a preference of the majority of people in these areas for an autonomous political unit of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will not , in any conceivable way , be a loss to the people of either India or Pakistan from perspectives of prestige , security or economic benefits . <p> There is , in addition , the grim reality that those who hold the reins of government in Delhi or Islamabad can not afford to grant concessions towards meeting the demands and aspirations of the Kashmiri people , and yet survive in elected position of power . This is essentially why Kashmir will remain a potentially explosive trouble-spot in Asia from which terrorism can not be eradicated . In August 2013 , while tentative attempts at rapprochement were being made by the leaders of India and Pakistan , the head of the ' United Jihad Council ' an umbrella organisation fighting against Indian rule in the disputed territory , declared that thousands of militants would return ( to Kashmir ) from Afghanistan when the combined forces of NATO complete their withdrawal from that turbulent country by the end of 2014 , and that : " The coming months and years will see a tremendous surge in Mujahideen activities in Indian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , with nuclear weapons in the arsenals of both India as well as Pakistan , their deterrent effect would remain the strongest safeguard for an Indo-Pakistani d ? tente which could withstand the shocks of extremist violence .

@@15236240 Ceylon Today <p> Chairman of the Committee on Public Enterprises ( COPE ) Sunil Handunnetti says the UNP MPs on COPE belittled the Auditor General during the investigation . " I can not understand why the government is trying to save a couple of persons at the cost of sacrificing the Auditor General and COPE unity in the process . " Excerpts : <p> ? : Are you satisfied with the COPE report on the Central Bank Bond scam ? A : Yes . I am highly satisfied . It was a successful exercise getting all MPs on COPE to agree to the recommendations despite issues militating against it in the context of pros and cons in Parliament . That was the success of the report . Although there is a division of sorts , all have agreed to the recommendations . <p> ? : The statement you were to make on Friday tabling the COPE report was blocked . What were you planning on saying ? A : We have exposed a massive fraud in the COPE report . They tried to hide the tree in the jungle . It can not be done . The UNP MPs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not understand why the government is trying to save a couple of persons at the cost of sacrificing the Auditor General and the integrity of COPE . It has now been proved that they were instrumental in burdening the country with yet another massive financial loss and earned big money for themselves at the nation 's expense . <p> In a scenario within which the Auditor General is being denigrated , the COPE will not be able to investigate the workings of any of the public enterprises after this . They could always keep on saying that the AG and they too have opinions which differ from conclusions made by a COPE probe . By adopting this stance and bringing pressure to bear on the AG they are in effect challenging Parliament 's sovereignty in the sphere of fiscal control . It is the creation of a very wrong precedent . <p> ? : Can the Auditor General be challenged like this ? A : That is what I say . I despise the very thought of influencing him in any way or insulting him . All these facets are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The names of the persons who insulted him , and later apologized , are mentioned in it . The Auditor General 's task is to express an independent opinion on the performance of State enterprises when called upon to do so . We may not agree with his independent opinion . But we can not challenge it . He expresses an opinion based on a thorough study . That can be changed via a similar study . We can express our dissent in Parliament . <p> I am perplexed about the fact that there has not been any individual or organization that has come out in protest against this shabby treatment of the AG . <p> On the other hand , the Audit Commission has not been given powers . It is defunct . Can we guarantee that the replacement for Gamini Wijesinghe , if he is removed , will not be a puppet of the government ? <p> ? : What 's your opinion about the severe criticism of the media by some Ministers after the COPE report was published ? A : What they are in effect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If you do , we will punish you " . In the context of the fact that there is this deep national concern about corruption everywhere , certain media organizations did the nation a great service by giving priority to publicity about the Bond Scam probe process . The threat to media that we saw in Parliament was the expression of that fear of exposure " On the other hand , there was no need for MP Sujeewa Senasinghe to say that the media must be summoned by COPE . I have said this often . He sees the media as a threat . I in fact want the media invited to COPE proceedings . They must see the proceedings . <p> ? : Why was the COPE report on the Central Bank Bond issue so controversial ? <p> A : This is not an ordinary report . The previous reports were not so much controversial . I submitted reports on the Ceylon Electricity Board , Ceylon Petroleum Corporation , Sri Lanka Cricket etc . I even summoned the Speaker of Parliament to appear before COPE . They were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bank which must maintain credibility as the authority vested with the authority to exercise functions on fiscal control in the entire country . While we were reporting the losses caused by the scam , another group said that the bond issue process was in order . They argued that the former Governor of the Central Bank was right . I and many others were of the firm opinion that the Bond issue process as well as the former Governor 's conduct in the whole affair were wrong and the attempt to shield them was also wrong and would encourage other serious offences . People then began seeing the conflicting differences between these two stances and opinions . <p> ? : Why were you challenged so much ? <p> A : We studied the evidence , documents , data and notes for 18 months before we submitted the report on the Central Bank Bond issue . I can not compile a report without including the facts discovered in the process of our probe . I can not include my personal opinions in it . But the other group wanted the facts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the report and instead to include conclusions drawn only from chosen evidence . They tried to say that the bond market operated in that manner and no one could predict it . On that basis they said the opinion of the Attorney General was based on a flimsy rationale . <p> They tried to argue that auctioning was the ordinary method of purchasing bonds since 2006 . They tried to argue that the direct replacement system which was used since 2008 was the alternate method . The opposing group entered footnotes in the report stating that they would agree to the recommendations but insisted that their own conclusions be stated separately . <p> ? : Has former Governor Arjuna Mahendran said under questioning that Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe had instructed him to be present at the Bond auctions ? <p> A : Yes . But , when has the Monetary Board approved his instructions ? The existing procedure governing Bond issues is a hybrid of direct placement and auctioning . On 27 February 2015 , the primary dealers were not aware that a Rs 10 billion Bond Issue was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ existing procedure had been completely changed . However , one of the primary dealers knew that there would be an auction . He , Arjuna Aloysius , knew that one billion rupees would be called and Rs 20 billion would be taken . Therefore , only he bid for 75% and as a result the interest increased . <p> ? : How did this information leak ? <p> A : The Footnote Group who opposed our view tried to point out that the information was leaked . My question is how did the fact that the Central Bank would go for a 100% auction leak ? How does another person know something hitherto only known by the Central Bank Governor ? The COPE report describes the conduct of the Central Bank Governor on 27 February 2015 . In normal practice a Governor does not come to the front office . But Mahendran came there on that day and the Footnote Group argues that it was a coincidence . He visited the front office at 10.45 a.m. and 12.45 p.m . When he says to the officials of the tender committee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it influencing ? The Superintendent of the Credit Management Department notes that ' the Governor instructed us to go for a Rs 10 billion issue . ' This is the naked truth . <p> ? : Why do you call the UNP MPs in COPE the ' Footnote Group ' ? A : COPE has 26 members and 16 agreed to the report . That is the actual report . There are nine others who agreed to the report but with footnotes stipulating conditions . These UNP MPs try to dilute the essence of the report . Our problem is in trying to understand why they totally agree to the recommendations yet object to the content of the report ? <p> ? : Earlier reports said that your team and the ' Footnote Group ' will submit two reports ? A : You have to ask them . I must say that we have not made any compromise to persuade them to totally agree to the recommendations . We did not change our stance . <p> The recommendations in the report tabled in Parliament on Friday are the same submitted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because of MP Sumanthiran citing a point of law . Not a single recommendation came from the Footnote Group . However , only one report can be submitted by COPE according to Parliamentary tradition . Opposing views can be annexed to that report . We had a problem about the manner of annexation . In fact , there must be two reports because there are two clear opinions . One is for protecting thieves and the other is for exposing them . But finally the Footnote Group had to agree to all of our recommendations . <p> ? : Why did you walk out of the COPE meeting ? A : The basis of my report is the Auditor General 's report submitted in June on the issue of Bonds by the Central Bank . COPE agreed to conduct the investigation based on his report . We worked on that agreement . The Central Bank officials were called again and again on that basis . Therefore , eventually no one can blame us for basing our probe and on the Auditor General 's report because we had agreed to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of professional care due on the part of the Central Bank Governor to ensure that there is minimum cost and minimum risk . <p> If the Auditor General changes his opinion , will the COPE report lose its legitimacy ? That is why I can not agree to the stance of the Footnote Group that contends that the Auditor General 's opinion is politicized . The 10th article of the report explains the reasons for my walkout . It was a decision based on clear rationale . <p> ? : Did you walk out due to unbearable pressure from the Footnote Group ? <p> A : I am a politburo member of the JVP . We are used to absorbing pressure in all sorts of circumstances . We fought against the dictator Rajapaksa . I do n't take any notice of personal insults . One of my old friends said that he would shave his head if I tabled the COPE report on Friday . I am waiting for him with a pair of scissors . The Footnote Group accused me in a very serious manner of having drawn up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Footnote Group wanted to frame charges against Arjun Aloysius , I opposed it . They accused me of having taken money from Aloysius and walked out of the meeting to protect him . But the truth has emerged today . <p> ? : There was an allegation that you were not strong enough to hold the position of COPE Chairman ? A : I have proved my strength . There have been more popular COPE Chairmen who preceded me in office . I have been serving on COPE for a long time . I am the only one who has enjoyed COPE membership for 16 years . I have an English medium degree from the Sri Jayewardenepura University in Business Management . I am qualified but they think we in the JVP are not qualified . <p> ? : Why did you meet the UNP MPs of COPE separately ? <p> A : It was a full COPE meeting . We studied the draft of the COPE report on 20th . We met on 21st too . Eight MPs said they would agree to the report . UNP MPs said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that opportunity although I have a personal opinion . That is my duty and responsibility . They could do it in Sirikotha or in Arjuna Mahendran 's house . But I compiled the draft . They must get any clarification from me . I must make way for that . <p> ? : Why did the MPs of the UNP try to protect the former Governor of the Central Bank so much ? A : Because they did not want the truth described in this report to be made public . <p> They can not challenge it . There is only one truth and not several truths . <p> ? : Do you think the UNP group was influenced by someone ? A : I can not comment on this as Chairman of COPE . I do n't know . They have the right to their opinions . But we won the struggle after all and it is a valuable victory for Parliamentary authority in financial control and democracy . <p> ? : The Central Bank is under the Prime Minister 's Ministry of Economic Affairs and Policy Planning . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Monetary Board of the Central Bank must be represented by the Secretary to the Ministry of Finance . How do you see this contradiction ? A : Yes . Although the Central Bank comes under the Ministry of Economic and Policy Planning , the Secretary to the said Ministry is not on the Monetary Board of the Central Bank . We have mentioned this problem in the report . <p> ? : Will Parliament pave the way for the implementation of law ? <p> A : They must do so and they must monitor the implementation . They are the duties of COPE . You are raising the need of bringing the results of implementing law back to COPE . <p> ? : In a nutshell what do you think about the COPE process in the Central Bank Bond Scam ? <p> A : The responsibility lies with Parliament after this . We tried to deliver justice to the people through this exercise . As the JVP we have fought outside Parliament and now we have proved our calibre to act in the Parliament putting to good use our knowledge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Chairman of COPE or as a JVP MP ?

Or John Kasich , who agreed that global warming is taking place but added that " we are going to burn coal in Ohio and we are not going to apologize for it .

The market reacted quickly . Shares in energy corporations boomed , including the world 's largest coal miner , Peabody Energy , which had filed for bankruptcy , but after Trump 's victory registered a 50% gain . <p> The effects of Republican denialism had already been felt . There had been hopes that the COP21 Paris agreement would lead to a verifiable treaty , but any such thoughts were abandoned because the Republican Congress would not accept any binding commitments , so what emerged was a voluntary agreement , evidently much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apparent than they already are .

At least I am at a loss to find appropriate words . <p> Turning finally to the question raised , to be precise it appears that Clinton received a slight majority of the vote . The apparent decisive victory has to do with curious features of American politics : among other factors , the electoral college residue of the founding of the country as an alliance of separate states ; the winner-take-all system in each state ; arrangement of congressional districts ( sometimes by gerrymandering ) to provide greater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this one too , Democrats have had a comfortable margin of victory in popular vote for the House but hold a minority of seats ) ; the very high rate of abstention ( usually close to half in presidential elections , this one too ) . Of some significance for the future is the fact that in the 18-25 range , Clinton won handily , and Sanders had an even higher level of support . How much this matters depends on what kind of future humanity will face . <p> According to current information , Trump broke all records in the support he received from white voters , working class and lower middle class , particularly in the $50,000 to $90,000 income range , rural and suburban , primarily those without college education . These groups share the anger throughout the West at the centrist establishment , revealed as well in the unanticipated Brexit vote and the collapse of centrist parties in continental Europe . The angry and disaffected are victims of the neoliberal policies of the past generation , the policies described in congressional testimony by Fed chair Alan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the economics profession and other admirers until the miraculous economy he was supervising crashed in 2007-8 , threatening to bring the whole world economy down with it . As Greenspan explained during his glory days , his successes in economic management were based substantially on " growing worker insecurity . " Intimidated working people would not ask for higher wages , benefits , and security but would be satisfied with the stagnating wages and reduced benefits that signal a healthy economy by neoliberal standards . <p> Working people who have been the subjects of these experiments in economic theory are , oddly , not particularly happy about the outcome . They are not , for example , overjoyed at the fact that in 2007 , at the peak of the neoliberal miracle , real wages for non-supervisory workers were lower than they had been years earlier , or that real wages for male workers are about at 1960s levels while spectacular gains have gone to the pockets of a very few at the top , disproportionately a fraction of 1% . Not the result of market forces , achievement , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matters reviewed carefully by economist Dean Baker in recently published work . <p> The fate of the minimum wage illustrates what has been happening . Through the periods of high and egalitarian growth in the ' 50s and ' 60s , the minimum wage -- which sets a floor for other wages -- tracked productivity . That ended with the onset of neoliberal doctrine . Since then the minimum wage has stagnated ( in real value ) . Had it continued as before , it would probably be close to $20 per hour . Today it is considered a political revolution to raise it to $15 . <p> With all the talk of near-full employment today , labor force participation remains below the earlier norm . And for a working man , there is a great difference between a steady job in manufacturing with union wages and benefits , as in earlier years , and a temporary job with little security in some service profession .

She uses the image of a line in which these people are standing , expecting to move forward steadily as they work hard and keep to all the conventional values . But their position in the line has stalled . Ahead of them , they see people leaping forward , but that does not cause much distress , because it is " the American way " for ( alleged ) merit to be rewarded . What does cause real distress is what is happening behind them . Undeserving people who do not follow the rules are being moved in front of them by federal government programs designed to benefit African-Americans , immigrants , and others they often regard with contempt . All of this is exacerbated by Reagan 's racist fabrications about strapping young bucks and welfare queens ( by implication Black ) stealing your hard-earned money , and other fantasies -- which are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the case with ugly and dangerous concoctions designed to deflect attention from the real agents of distress to easy scapegoats . <p> Sometimes failure to explain , itself a form of contempt , plays a role . I once met a house painter in Boston who had turned bitterly against the evil government after a Washington bureaucrat who knew nothing about painting organized a meeting of painting contractors to inform them that they could no longer use lead paint , the only kind that works , as they all knew but the suit did n't understand . That destroyed his small business , compelling him to paint houses on his own with substandard stuff forced on him by government elites . Sometimes there are also some reasons . Hochschild describes a man whose family and friends are suffering bitterly from the lethal effects of chemical pollution but who despises the government , and the " liberal elites , " because for him , the EPA means some ignorant guy who tells him he ca n't fish but does nothing about the chemical plants . <p> These are just samples of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to believe that Trump will do something to remedy their plight , though the merest look at his fiscal and other proposals demonstrates the opposite -- posing a task for activists who hope to fend off the worst and to advance desperately needed changes . <p> Exit polls reveal that the passionate support for Trump was inspired primarily by the belief that he represented change , while Clinton was perceived as the candidate who would perpetuate their distress . The " change " that Trump is likely to bring will be harmful or worse , but it is understandable that the consequences are not clear to isolated people in an atomized society lacking the kinds of associations ( like unions ) that can educate and organize . That is a crucial difference between today 's despair and the generally hopeful attitudes of many working people under much greater duress during the great depression of the 1930s . <p> There are other factors in Trump 's success .

In a decade or two whites are projected to be a minority of the work force , and not too much later a minority of the population . The traditional conservative culture is also perceived as under attack by the successes of " identity politics , " regarded as the province of elites who have only contempt for hard-working patriotic church-going Americans with real family values whose country is disappearing before their eyes . <p> It is worth remembering that before World War II , though it had long been the richest country in the world , the US was not a major player in global affairs and was also something of a cultural backwater . Someone who wanted to study physics would go to Germany . An aspiring writer or artist would go to Paris .

It would be hard to find an analogue in other societies . <p> The Democratic party abandoned any real concern for working people by the 1970s , and they have therefore been drawn to the ranks of their bitter class enemies , who at least pretend to speak their language -- Reagan 's folksy style with little jokes while eating jelly beans , W. Bush 's carefully cultivated image of a regular guy you could meet in a bar who loved to cut brush on the ranch in 100 degree heat and his probably faked mispronunciations ( it 's unlikely that he talked like that at Yale ) , and now Trump , who gives voice to people with legitimate grievances who have lost not just jobs but also a sense of personal self-worth ; and who rails against the government that they perceive as having undermined their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the great achievements of the doctrinal system has been to divert anger from the corporate sector to the government that implements the programs it designs , such as the highly protectionist corporate/investor rights agreements that are uniformly mis-described as " free trade agreements " in the media and commentary . With all its flaws , the government is to some extent under popular influence and control , unlike the corporate sector . It is highly advantageous for the business world to foster hatred for pointy-headed government bureaucrats and to drive out of people 's minds the subversive idea that the government might become an instrument of popular will , a government of , by , and for the people . <p> Is Trump representing a new movement in American politics , or was the outcome of this election primarily a rejection of Hillary Clinton by voters who hate the Clintons and are fed-up with " politics as usual ? " <p> It 's by no means new . Both political parties have moved to the right during the neoliberal period . Today 's New Democrats are pretty much what used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political revolution " that Bernie Sanders called for , rightly , would not have greatly surprised Dwight Eisenhower . The Republicans have moved so far to dedication to the wealthy and the corporate sector that they can not hope to get votes on their actual programs , and have turned to mobilizing sectors of the population that have always been there but not as an organized political force : evangelicals , nativists , racists , and the victims of the forms of globalization designed to set working people around the world in competition with one another while protecting the privileged and undermining the legal and other measures that provided working people with some protection and with ways to influence decision-making in the closely linked public and private sectors , notably with effective labor unions . <p> The consequences have been evident in recent Republican primaries . Every candidate that has emerged from the base -- Bachmann , Cain , Santorum , ... -- has been so extreme that the Republican establishment had to use its ample resources to beat them down . The difference in 2016 is that the establishment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen . <p> Deservedly or not , Clinton represented the policies that were feared and hated while Trump was seen as the symbol of " change " -- change of what kind requires a careful look at his actual proposals , something largely missing in what reached the public . The campaign itself was remarkable in its avoidance of issues , and media commentary generally complied , keeping to the concept that true objectivity means reporting accurately what is " within the beltway " but not venturing beyond . <p> Trump said following the outcome of the election that he " will represent all Americans . " How is be going to do that when the nation is so divided and he has already expressed deep hatred for many groups in the United States , including women and minorities ? Do you see any resemblance between Brexit and Donald Trump 's victory ? <p> There are definite similarities to Brexit , and also to the rise of the ultranationalist far-right parties in Europe -- whose leaders were quick to congratulate Trump on his victory , perceiving him as one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and others like them . And these developments are quite frightening . A look at the polls in Austria and Germany -- Austria and Germany -- can not fail to evoke unpleasant memories for those familiar with the 1930s , even more so for those who watched directly , as I did as a child . I can still recall listening to Hitler 's speeches , not understanding the words though the tone and audience reaction were chilling enough . The first article that I remember writing was in February 1939 , after the fall of Barcelona , on the seemingly inexorable spread of the fascist plague . And by strange coincidence , it was in Barcelona that my wife and I watched Tuesday 's events . <p> As to how Trump will handle what he has brought forth -- not created , but brought forth -- we can not say . Perhaps his most striking characteristic is unpredictability . A lot will depend on the reactions of those appalled by his performance and the visions he has projected , such as they are . <p> Trump has no identifiable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and political issues , yet there are clear authoritarian tendencies in his behavior . Therefore , do you find any validity behind the claims that Trump may represent the emergence of " fascism with a friendly face ? " in the United States ? <p> For many years I have been writing and speaking about the danger of the rise of an honest and charismatic ideologue in the United States , someone who could exploit the fear and anger that has long been boiling in much of the society , and who could direct it away from the actual agents of malaise to vulnerable targets . That could indeed lead to what sociologist Bertram Gross called " friendly fascism " in a perceptive study 35 years ago . But that requires an honest ideologue , a Hitler type , not someone whose only detectable ideology is Me . The dangers however have been real for many years , perhaps even more so in the light of the forces that Trump has unleashed . <p> With the Republicans in the White House , but also controlling both houses and the future @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like for at least the next four years ? <p> A good deal depends on his appointments and circle of advisers . Early indications are unattractive , to put it mildly . <p> The Supreme Court will be in the hands of reactionaries for many years , with predictable consequences . If Trump follows through on his Paul Ryan-style fiscal programs , there will be huge benefits for the very rich -- estimated by the Tax Policy Center as a tax cut of over 14% for the top 0.1% and a substantial cut more generally at the upper end of the income scale , but with virtually no tax relief for others , who will also face major new burdens . The respected economics correspondent of the Financial Times , Martin Wolf , writes that " The tax proposals would shower huge benefits on already rich Americans such as Mr Trump , " while leaving others in the lurch , including of course his popular constituency . The immediate reaction of the business world reveals that big pharma , Wall Street , military industry , energy industries , and other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One positive development might be the infrastructure program that Trump has promised while ( along with much reporting and commentary ) concealing the fact that it is essentially the Obama stimulus program that would have been of great benefit to the economy and to the society generally , but was killed by the Republican Congress on the pretext that it would explode the deficit . While that charge was spurious at the time , given the very low interest rates , it holds in spades for Trump 's program , now accompanied by radical tax cuts for the rich and corporate sector and increased Pentagon spending . <p> There is , however , an escape , provided by Dick Cheney when he explained to Bush 's Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill that " Reagan proved that deficits do n't matter " -- meaning deficits that we Republicans create in order to gain popular support , leaving it to someone else , preferably Democrats , to somehow clean up the mess . The technique might work , for a while at least . <p> There are also many questions about foreign policy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between Trump and Putin . How likely is it therefore that we may see a new era in US-Russia relations ? <p> One hopeful prospect is that there might be reduction of the very dangerous and mounting tensions at the Russian border : note " the Russian border , " not the Mexican border . Thereby lies a tale that we can not go into here . It is also possible that Europe might distance itself from Trump 's America , as already suggested by Chancellor Merkel and other European leaders -- and from the British voice of American power , after Brexit . That might possibly lead to European efforts to defuse the tensions , and perhaps even efforts to move towards something like Mikhail Gorbachev 's vision of an integrated Eurasian security system without military alliances , rejected by the US in favor of NATO expansion , a vision revived recently by Putin , whether seriously or not we do not know since the gesture was dismissed . <p> Is US foreign policy under a Trump administration likely to be more or less militaristic than what we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? <p> I do n't think one can answer with any confidence . Trump is too unpredictable . There are too many open questions . What we can say is that popular mobilization and activism , properly organized and conducted , can make a large difference . <p> And we should bear in mind that the stakes are very large , as I remarked at the outset . <p> This article by No am Cholsey is full of conventional CRAP demonizing anything that does not fall into a conventional pattern . <p> It is a continuation of the fear mongering evoking visions of a new Hitler that attempts to maintain the status quo . <p> Donald Trump , flawed as he is in style and manner but not in open-mindedness and a sharp intellect , is very likely to prove to be the leader that drags American back to its traditional old-world values of hard work and great rewards . <p> With all 3 branches of the US government ( Executive , Legislature and Judicuary ) in the grasp of the Republicans , he has a great opportunity to remake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and militarily to provide another century of American leadership . <p> Will he seize that opportunity or squander it ..... only FATHER TIME can tell . <p> With all 3 branches of the US government ( Executive , Legislature and Judicuary ) in the grasp of the Republicans , he has a great opportunity to remake America and position it socially , economically , diplomatically , and militarily to provide another century of American leadership . -- Ananda -- USA <p> " With all 3 branches of the US government ( Executive , Legislature and Judicuary ) in the grasp of the Republicans , he has a great opportunity to remake America and position it socially , economically , diplomatically , and militarily to provide another century of American leadership .

To Swindle Baby Elephants <p> The elephants were initially taken into custody from the owners who were prosecuted for having the elephants with no proper permits <p> Whatever decision taken on the release of the animals should be determined by the court <p> The Sri Lankan elephant is one of three subspecies of Asian elephant and is found only on the teardrop-shaped Indian Ocean Island <p> Many have expressed concern over the government 's move to return the baby elephants to individuals who allegedly had illegal permits or none at all . Several environmental lawyers claimed the move to return the elephants to the suspects was at fault since the court is yet to arrive at a final decision on the matter and it still remains a pending case . <p> Environmentalists and environmental lawyers who had been involved in the issue for years raised eyebrows on the decision and said there was confusion as to how and on what grounds the decision was taken . There were claims that no provisions existed in the Fauna and Flora Act ( FFA ) of Sri Lanka to allow the elephants to be kept in the custody of individuals who had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Sustainable Development and Wildlife Conservation and related authorities have categorized the alleged owners into three groups where the third category claims to release the animals back to those who had no permits but obtained the elephants in good faith , which is against the law and can not be done . <p> The elephants were initially taken into custody from the owners who were prosecuted for having the elephants with no proper permits . The environmentalists are totally against the move of releasing the animals back to them . This raises question as to how the government can overwrite the court 's order and interfere with the independence of the judiciary in releasing the animals back to the owners while the cases remain pending . <p> " We do not know about the other two categories which are not necessarily important as far as we are only concerned about the move of releasing the elephants back to the alleged owners , " the environmentalist said . <p> They alleged that the elephants can not be given back to the owners till the case is over and a ruling is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea on what grounds the ministry decided to release the animals to them . <p> If the government wants to release the animals then there is a way of doing it .

However , the suspects who had elephants illegally can not be proven innocent and if that happens it means the system has not acted according to the laws , they added . <p> The environmentalists stressed that whatever decision taken on the release of the animals should be determined by the court . <p> " We have filed several cases and the court proceedings are still going on . Currently the ministry is trying to overwrite the court . There is no point in talking to the ministry anymore as we have had several meetings with the officials .

Taming a wild elephant is an extremely cruel experience for the animal whether it 's a temple or a private person . That 's how it is done , they lamented . <p> According to the Flora and Fauna Act No. 22 of 2009 , possession of an elephant that is not licensed and registered is a punishable offence . The Act provides , " No person shall own , have in his custody or make use of an elephant unless it is registered and unless a license in respect of the elephant has been obtained , " in accordance with the provisions of the Act . Among other requirements within the duties of a custodian of an elephant , which is being registered under the Act includes registering the elephant with the prescribed officer , paying a registration fee as prescribed and obtaining an annual licence in respect of the elephant . <p> The Act further reads , " where a person becomes the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ virtue of sale , gift , the death of the previous owner or in any other manner whatsoever , such person shall immediately inform the Director or prescribed officer and , if the elephant is registered or licensed , take such steps as may be prescribed to have the previous registration and licence cancelled and to have a fresh registration made and a fresh licence obtained . " <p> Nevertheless , unlawful possession of an elephant is a punishable offence under the Sri Lankan law . According to S. 23 ( 1 ) of the Act this includes upon conviction being liable to a fine not less than one Rs. 150,000 and not exceeding Rs. 250,000 rupees , or to imprisonment of either description for a term not less than ten years and not exceeding 20 years or to both such fine and imprisonment . <p> If an elephant is not registered under this section , then it shall be presumed to be taken or removed from the wild without lawful authority or approval .

In the 19th century there were believed to be up to 14,000 . That number fell to fewer than 3,000 before hunting and capture were banned . But according to the island 's first official elephant census in 2011 , the population has grown since then to nearly 6,000 , but are still considered endangered and under threat from habitat loss and degradation . They are with the boundaries limited by the Wildlife Conservation Department ( WCD ) and the Department of Forest Conservation ( DFC ) confined to small , isolated spaces of jungle and pasture in the north and the east . <p> However , responding to the questions , the Minister of Sustainable Development and Wildlife Conservation Gamini Jayawickrama Perera said , there is no such move by the government to hand over elephants to the alleged owners as the cases are still pending , adding that whatever the decision taken with regard to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legal procedure . <p> " A committee , comprising of Ministers Sagala Ratnayake , Malik Samarawickrama , Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe , myself and some others , is also formed to look into this issue , " said Minister Jayawickrama Perera , adding that the committee had spoken to the President about the animals and their protection . <p> " The ministry is capable of looking after the animals which were taken into custody and we are ready to take care of the animals even though not sure how long the cases will go on .

V. Wigneswaran looked to clear his name and that of the Tamil People 's Council ( TPC ) which he now leads . <p> At a media conference in Colombo Wigneswaran insisted that a wrong image had been given about a recent rally staged in the North by the TPC . <p> He said the rally was not for a separate state or against the Sinhalese community but merely to draw light on the concerns of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TPC to obtain solutions for the issues faced by the Tamils as the TPC was taking a more aggressive approach than the Tamil National Alliance . <p> Dr. P. Lakshman , Consultant Cardiologist and Co-Chairman of the Tamil People 's Council said that the TPC wants to construct an open dialogue between the people of the North and of the South . <p> " We believe that the answer to any problem lies in understanding the basis of the question , acknowledging the existence of the problem in question , and honestly and forthrightly discussing the question in hand . These , we believe , are basis to solving any problem . However , we would like to stress that obfuscating , through a superficial approach , the source and nature of the problem and the consequences arising out of it , and concealing the just solution to the problem at hand , is an approach that will most likely produce an undesired result . It is also morally wrong and strategically unwise , " he said . <p> Dr. Lakshman said that concealing the truths will only serve to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and hamper any hope of a permanent solution . <p> The TPC feels that the national question of the past seven decades has only become more acute with time . <p> In a post-war context , people centric discourse on the national question has been actively discouraged . <p> It ( the national question ) has merely served politicians in the North and in the South to be utilized for electoral exercises . Sadly , certain sections of the fourth estate too have contributed to this malaise . <p> The Tamil People 's Council is a manifestation of our firm belief that it is only through a mass people based movement with a long term vision , with no narrow and selfish electoral objective , that a just and lasting solution could be achieved . <p> The Tamil People 's Council is a result of approximately four years of discussions and discourse . The idea for the TPC was actually mooted several years ago . <p> " In 2009 , when the armed conflict came to an end , it was interpreted that our question -- the national question -- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manifestation of the national question and not basis for the ethnic conflict by itself , " the TPC said . <p> The TPC says following the final phases of the armed conflict , which wrought devastating destruction on the Tamil people , the Tamils were keenly aware that our existence as a people and our political aspirations were in question . <p> " Our political future appeared as a vacuum before us . We realized the dangers of such an uncertainty . At this very crucial juncture in our quest for justice and a just solution , electoral politicking would never fulfil this vacuum . It is through that realization , after a series of discussions between civil society activists , human rights defenders , professionals , religious leaders , and through our experiences of post- war Tamil politics , that the urgent need for a mass people-based movement such as the Tamil People 's Council crystalized . Thus , the Tamil People 's Council was born , " Dr. Lakshman said . <p> As a first step , the Tamil People 's Council was inaugurated by likeminded individuals with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basic demands and political aspirations of the Tamil people . <p> The TPC commenced its activities prioritising the aspirations of the people and people participation . The TPC commenced its journey with the objective of drawing a constitutional proposal , acceptable to everyone , with people participation , and based on other relevant international constitutional models . <p> " We are very clear that it is unjust to impose on a people a constitutional arrangement rejected by the people , but driven by pressure from political actors who cite man-made ' impracticalities ' and impediments . Hence , we drafted a constitutional proposal with input from local and international constitutional experts and submitted this draft at consultations held across the North and East . We then further fine-tuned these proposals from input gleaned from the consultation process , " Dr. Lakshman said . <p> He said that the TPC then submitted this proposal , which treats all communities equally , to the Public Representations Committee on Constitutional Reform appointed by the government and fulfilled the role in engaging constructively in the Constitution drafting process . <p> " This is arguably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ history of the national question that a constitutional proposal was drafted with the full participation of Tamil people from all across the North-East . We have also conducted and continue to conduct workshops on educating the people about this constitutional proposal and other relevant constitutional models elsewhere in the world , " Dr. Lakshman said . <p> He said the TPC noticed in recent years that the genuine political aspirations and demands , and the quest for justice of the Tamil people were being maliciously represented elsewhere due to , what we believe , is unduly constructed pressure and compulsion . We feared that our quest for justice could be obfuscated , yet again . <p> " There then arose a need and obligation upon us to make a positive intervention to question and critique this obfuscation . We sensed the urge to rally together our people and our allies to create awareness . Thus , a rally was held on September 24 in Jaffna , highlighting several pressing demands of the Tamil people : Reiterating the just political aspirations of the Tamil people ; end State-sponsored Sinhala-Buddhisization of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accountability mechanism for crimes committed against the Tamil people ; repealing of the PTA and release of all political prisoners ; end illegal and arbitrary poaching of marine resources , among others , in the North-Eastern seas . <p> " Our objective was to convey to our friends and allies , through a mass rally , that the concerns of the Tamil people are yet to be substantially addressed , and that justice continues to be denied to us , " he said .

The new center will " engage in studies intended to promote industrial development of the Arctic , " including development of ice-resistant platforms and frost-resistant concrete for use in polar regions , as well as studying the effects of ice loads on ships and reliability of various engineering structures on ice . <p> In the past several years , involvement in Arctic scientific research has become a distinct feature of Asian states ' foreign policy . One of the core reasons is that countries are eager to obtain scientific knowledge about the causes of climate change in the Arctic , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and economic activity . According to Chinese experts , for example , climate change in the Arctic has a negative impact on China 's food security , due to the increasing risk of flooding in coastal regions , where major agricultural areas are located . India is also concerned about the possible influence of climate change in the Arctic on the Indian monsoon , which is crucial to its agriculture . <p> The second reason that pushes Asian states to enhance their involvement in Arctic scientific projects is to justify their growing interests in Arctic issues and secure their presence in the region by highlighting the global impact of climate change in the high north . <p> International Arctic Fora <p> There are three main tracks that Asian countries follow in order to pursue their Arctic scientific diplomacy goals . The first includes participation in international Arctic cooperation mechanisms . In 2013 , China , India , Japan , the Republic of Korea , and Singapore obtained observer status in the Arctic Council ( AC ) , and some of these countries have also become members of prestigious organisations and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? lesund Science Managers Committee , and International Polar Year . In the long-term perspective , active involvement in the work of such fora could be used as a background to legitimate Asian states ' assertive participation in elaboration of future governance in the Arctic . Several Asian experts have already called for more active involvement in Arctic governance affairs . <p> Discussions are also being held concerning strengthening the observer status in the Arctic Council , particularly by providing Asian members with more rights in decision-making processes in the working groups of the AC . One of the latest examples of this trend was negotiations on a new Agreement on Enhancing Arctic Scientific Cooperation , which were held in Ottawa , Canada in July 2016 . Observers , along with the Arctic states , were given an opportunity to take part in preparing provisions for this intergovernmental document . <p> Joint scientific projects <p> The second track see Asian states ' active involvement in Arctic scientific research through the implementation of joint projects with the international science community . In particular , Asian states established themselves scientifically by opening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expeditions in the Arctic Ocean . Among them , China has become the most active player , having increased the number of scientific endeavours in the region in the past few years . Since the late 1990s , China has conducted seven research expeditions to the North Pole . The state 's annual spending on Antarctic and Arctic expeditions is $15 million . <p> Recently , China also opened a Chinese-Icelandic Aurora Observatory in K ? rh ? l in the north of Iceland to " research the northern lights in cooperation with Icelandic research institutions . " Beijing is also keen to enhance its scientific cooperation with other Arctic states and has spoken to the Canadian government about opening an Arctic research base in the Northwest Territories . <p> Developing domestic Arctic expertise <p> The Republic of Korea also takes part in Arctic research projects as a member of international research teams . For example , in 1999 two Korean scientists conducted research with the Geological Survey of Japan , and in August 2000 joint research was conducted with the Russian Arctic and Antarctic Research Institute . Korea was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ document , the 2013 Pan-Government Arctic Policy Master Plan . In the document , Korea announced itself to be a polar leading nation that opens a sustainable future for the Arctic . One of the mains goals is to build an Arctic partnership that contributes to the international community . <p> As for Japan , in 1998 it became a co-sponsor of the International Arctic Research Center ( IARC ) at the University of Alaska that enables researchers from various nations to carry out joint research programmes that build " an integrated understanding of the Arctic ... with clear and accurate conceptualization of the role of the Arctic in the broader global system . " <p> Finally , the third track aims to establish and promote internal expertise in various areas in order to contribute scientifically to the global understanding of ongoing changes in the Arctic , as well as to promote the scientific and political interests of Asian countries . In the past several years there has been an increase in the number of Arctic publications by Asian experts . Although natural science topics have prevailed , issues such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Arctic region were also widely discussed by Asian scholars . <p> Another vivid example is the founding in 2013 of the China-Nordic Arctic Research Center ( CNARC ) located in Shanghai , which provides a platform for academic cooperation to increase knowledge of the Arctic and to promote cooperation between Nordic and Chinese scientists for sustainable development of North . <p> In 2015 the Ministry of Education , Culture , Sports , Science , and Technology of Japan launched a new five-year project called Arctic Challenge for Sustainability ( ArCS ) . This project aims to explore the changes in the climate and environment , clarify their effects on human society , and provide accurate projections and environmental assessments . <p> To share knowledge , Asian countries are hosting Arctic conferences , including the Arctic Science Summit Week , organising Arctic summer schools , and launching educational programmes and courses . For instance , Singapore has established a postgraduate scholarship for Arctic indigenous peoples , and South Korea has launched the Korea Arctic Academy . <p> To sum up , involvement in Arctic scientific research addresses Asian states @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ region . First , the current discussion ( especially in mass media ) concerning the coming assertive role of Asian states in the Arctic region and thus the emerging possibility of a conflict erupting with the Arctic states , pushes Asian countries to get a foothold in the region through science , while assessing their security and economic interests . <p> Second , scientific research could be viewed as a starting point for the future development of relations with the Arctic states or as a tool to safeguard existing relations . For example , despite diplomatic tensions between Norway and China , the two countries have continued joint scientific research in the Arctic in particular . <p> Finally , scientific activities could also be seen as a vital contribution to the states ' international image by advancing global knowledge about the causes of the rapidly changing Arctic environmental system and its impact on the global community . <p> I am grateful to these six gentlemen .
