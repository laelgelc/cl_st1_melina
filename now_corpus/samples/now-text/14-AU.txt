Regardless , Hussey will play in front of the Perth support again on Friday , when he leads the Thunder in pursuit of their first win . <p> " We 're always happy to talk with Mike however we 're in the middle of a BBL campaign , so are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Langer said <p> " Mike has expressed some interest in making himself available for selected Sheffield Shield matches at the end of the season . We will look at this with Mike after the BBL and with a view to what is in the best interests of the Western Warriors at the time . " <p> Western Australia are currently third in the Shield table , with four games left to play . Speaking to the Sydney Morning Herald , the 38-year-old Hussey said that he could be available to play in WA 's next Shield fixture - against Tasmania beginning on February 12 - but that the final call would be Langer 's . <p> " Well , it 's something I have been sort of chucking around with JL , " Hussey said . " It 's a bit in his court really . I have shown a bit of interest to play some games at the end of the year , but yeah we 'll have to wait and see what happens . <p> " JL spoke to me early on in the summer and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cricket and I said it was going to be too busy and too hectic before Christmas and obviously while the Big Bash was on . But afterwards I am definitely happy to look at it and we basically left it that we 'll talk closer to the date and we 'll see what happens . " <p> Clearly , with a period of form he could waltz back into the Australian One day team taking Sean Marsh 's spot . He could eventually come back to the test team taking Bailey 's spot .

But tough penalties seldom affect people 's actions in the heat of the moment , especially when alcohol or other drugs are involved . <p> Public rallies , such as November 's protest in Sydney at the sentence for the attacker who killed Thomas Kelly , push for tougher penalties at the risk of neglecting other , more effective ways to prevent violence.AAP/Dan Himbrechts <h> Alcohol makes violence more likely <p> Violence begets violence ; alcohol makes it so much worse . <p> The research literature from around the world is clear : when you grow up in a setting where violence is common or acceptable , you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or both . Violence does n't comply with the labels we impose . When you are a victim or observer of violence as a child your world will be tainted , and for many this means perpetuating the cycle . <p> Yet we also know that some people do not repeat this cycle . Research is continuing to identify the protective factors at play . The life-course research field has been identifying many factors we can and should be acting upon . <p> This is important work , but it is also far , far more effective and preferable to prevent violence from occurring , rather than trying to fix victims . <p> Alcohol and other drug use has been found in every study to influence the likelihood of people experiencing violence . By definition , these drugs alter our state of mind .

Strict enforcement of existing licensing laws has also been found to be a key element in any successful management of alcohol-related violence . Education campaigns and vague references to personal responsibility have been found ineffective at best and , in some cases , have even been associated with an increase in harm . <p> The Global Campaign for Violence Prevention , co-ordinated by the World Health Organization ( WHO ) , has identified key goals towards which efforts can be directed .

The human costs are unfathomable and unacceptable . <p> The global action plan calls specifically for the development of national plans . Measures to reduce violence currently sit in many different silos and often fall under different jurisdictions . Many excellent strategies do exist to reduce specific types of violence , which would ideally work with the broader strategy . <p> There is no clear voice about the links between different types of violence and the risk and protective factors that contribute to different types of violence . Most importantly , there is a lack of clarity about which interventions can work for communities , specific populations , offenders and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ National Strategy to Prevent and Reduce Violence ( NPRV ) shows that we want to seriously and strategically tackle the problem .

The current wave of violence - whether it involves alcohol , is domestic in nature , sport-related , involves indigenous communities or any other form of violence - demands a national strategy to change our attitude to violence , its perpetrators and victims . <p> It will take leadership and perseverance to achieve this positive legacy for future generations . <p> This article was co-authored by former Queensland police superintendent Dan Keating .

@@2273236 @ @ @ @ @ @ new Clio is a good thing , and not just the gym-toned RenaultSport models , but the entire range . <p> Take this Dynamique model - it tops the non-sporting range , and adds a bigger engine and trick dual-clutch transmission over the Expression and Authentique models . <p> It 's also arresting to look at , with suggestive curves and rich high-gloss detailing . The fun themes extend to an outlandish but well-resolved interior . <p> Where Renault makes a real point of difference though is in its personalisation options . <p> Do n't like the lairy red wheels ? Do n't have ' em . Like a little more tang to the exterior ? How about a contrasting exterior package in place of the chrome you see here ? <p> There 's nothing new about individualising your car , but Renault is bringing it to the cheaper end of the market , meaning you no longer have to spring for a MINI or Audi A1 to stand out from the pack . <p> With a price of $23,290 the Clio Dynamique is no price leader , but it brings more equipment than a Polo ( for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exciting as a stack of manila folders . <p> Having already put the three-cylinder manual version through the wringer , we needed to test the mettle of the four-cylinder EDC auto ( or Efficient Dual Clutch ) . <p> This is n't your average budget-car interior , it 's a hell of a lot more colorful to start with . <p> You 'll also find an abundance of gloss black and chrome trims to go with your choice of bright primary coloured interior bits . <p> The seats are good : they 're generously shaped and there 's surprising shoulder room - the Clio is more ' small car ' than ' light car ' in dimensions . <p> But while the front is airy , rear seats can be tight for kneeroom with tall passengers up front . There is plenty of headroom though , so there should n't be too many quibbles . <p> Overall , except for the small rear windows and confined feel there , the interior works well . <p> There are however a couple of things that point to the Clio 's left-hand-drive origins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passenger than the driver and a tiny glovebox occupied mostly by a relay box . <p> The R-link touch screen dominates the centre stack , and it brings a host of features , including R-sound to make your Clio sound like anything from a dirt bike to a spaceship , piped through the car 's audio systyem . <p> The R-store for apps is n't up and running yet , and the system is laggy and not as user friendly as the more basic system found in lesser models . <p> We also could n't get the Bluetooth to pair with a Samsung phone , but had no problems on other mobile platforms . <h> ON THE ROAD <p> 1.2 litre petrol turbo inline four <p> 88kW @ 4900rpm 190Nm @ 2000rpm <p> Six-speed twin-clutch auto transmission <p> 0-100km/h - 9.4 seconds <p> Independent MacPherson strut front torsion beam rear <p> 258mm front discs 228x38mm rear drums <p> Electrically assisted variable power steering . <p> Fuel consumption listed : 5.2 l/100km <p> Let 's cross off the obvious question first : is this EDC transmission better or worse than VW @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Clio is a little more gentle off the line most of the time , and is every bit as seamless through the gears . <p> It 's a little slower on changes - forcing it to kick down around town requires a meaty shove of the accelerator . <p> Also , trying to squeeze into a park is tedious ; the clutch let-out is slow and there 's no ' creep ' . <p> Everywhere else though the engine and transmission work like a charm . The turbocharged 1.2 litre four develops 88kW at 4900rpm and a hefty 190Nm at a low 2000rpm . <p> Put together , this means there 's no struggle away from the lights , and , out of town , the Clio will happily munch the miles untroubled by hills and able to quickly summon a rapid turn of speed when needed . <p> We were troubled by aspects of the ride in our earlier test of the three-cylinder Clio .

" When that time comes around , I ca n't control my behaviour or my emotions . It 's odd because , when I 'm not in that bad place , I 'm actually a very logical person .

Although inconvenient and uncomfortable , for most sufferers it 's not debilitating . Yet 3 to 9 per cent of women experience symptoms so severe they can not get on with their daily lives . This is known as premenstrual dysphoric disorder ( PMDD ) , sometimes referred to as " PMS on steroids " . In a controversial move , last year the condition was formally recognised in the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders . <p> So , should this extreme version of PMS be classed as a mental disorder ? According to the manual 's guidelines , sufferers of PMDD experience symptoms including " marked mood swings , feeling suddenly sad or tearful or increased sensitivity to rejection , markedly depressed mood , feelings of hopelessness or self-deprecating thoughts , a subjective sense of being overwhelmed or out of control , and a marked change in appetite .

@@2273239 <h> The real wage cuts you have when you 're not cutting wages <p> Having lost the productivity debate , some in business are pushing for real wage cuts -- an approach the Coalition supports but does n't want to be seen endorsing . Bernard Keane and Glenn Dyer write . <p> A subtle shift -- or subtle as these things go -- has occurred over the last 12 months in the industrial relations debate , and it 's an important one . The business lobby , its media cheerleaders and the Coalition have shifted ground on IR , from productivity to wages . <p> That 's primarily because business lost the productivity " debate " , such as it was . We have a major problem with labour productivity , business insisted , via organs like the Financial Review , because the Fair Work Act is too inflexible . And every quarter from the end of 2011 , the national accounts would emerge to show growing labour productivity under the Fair Work Act . <p> Significantly , at last week 's SPC media conference , Prime Minister Tony Abbott was asked if he believed there was enough flexibility in the FWA to allow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he failed to deny it . <p> By the second half of 2013 , the productivity line was fading , even as a few holdouts manfully toiled to demonstrate the FWA had locked the economy into a straitjacket of laziness and trade union bastardry . It 's a crude measure , but somehow telling : the number of mentions of " labour productivity " in stories in the last six months in the AFR , which now essentially functions as a media release service for business , is half what it was in the same period in 2012 , and lower than the first half of 2013 , too . <p> But while " productivity " was being retired , a new IR argument was being prepared : the wages of Australian workers were too high . A couple of weeks ago , the AFR explained that " business leaders and economists " believed Australians would need to accept wage cuts in order to reduce inflation . The " business leaders and economists " turned out to be Coalition-aligned businessman Don McGauchie and JP Morgan 's Stephen Walters , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ growth should be lower and Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry 's Burchell Wilson said wage growth was already so low that real wages might fall ( so much for the " Fair Work Act drives wages up " argument ) . <p> Whether McGauchie is in a strong position to demand Australian workers take pay cuts is moot . This is the man who presided over a disastrous period in the life of Telstra as a private company , hiring the highly aggressive Sol Trujillo and his friends to pursue a strategy of all-out aggression against the government and regulators that failed disastrously . McGauchie is also chairman of agribusiness company Nufarm , which has been a serial disappointment to investors in recent years , at least until McGauchie gave them hope by declaring in July last year that the company had turned a corner and the worst was behind it . Alas for investors , McGauchie turned out to be wrong : in December , the company 's share price crashed yet again , and it is now back near its historic lows . <p> Walters , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in for a recession that year , followed up last week , saying that Australia could only restore its competitiveness by cutting wages . Then he confused things by saying that nominal wages " could n't " fall but that there should be " a demonstration of restraint " . Presumably not by investment bankers and chairmen of underperforming companies , but by workers . <p> " It 's a lazy call from ' business leaders and economists ' -- and from politicians , too ... " <p> Walters 's nuance about nominal hourly wages is noteworthy . Calling for wage cuts outright is a bad look , and one Abbott sought to avoid last week at the SPC announcement when he said : <p> " I think that the unions should do everything they possibly can to ensure that this is a viable business for the long term , a viable competitive business and that obviously means not cutting wages -- no way . " <p> The transcript does n't convey the strong emphasis that Abbott put into the final part of that statement , in a media conference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ future bad news from Goulburn Valley around the neck of Coca-Cola Amatil and David Gonski ( no mention of Terry Davis , the CEO of Coca-Cola Amatil , who paid $500 million for SPC Ardmona a decade ago and is now about to retire from the company with his black hole still not repaired ) . But while saying that , Abbott also lamented that the company 's enterprise agreement was generous and above-award levels in areas such as loadings and leave , and that it needed to be renegotiated . <p> If you had seen the Workplace Relations Minister Eric Abetz on Insiders yesterday morning , you would have got the feeling that neither Abbott nor Abetz had a good idea of what was in the industrial agreement at SPC Ardmona . Barrie Cassidy , quoting local MP Sharman Stone , who has gone hard at her own frontbench for last week 's decision , noted that contrary to Abbott 's claims , workers ca n't cash out sick leave and the company does n't pay overtime . In neither case did Abetz answer the questions . <p> This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overly generous -- it may well be , particularly given it 's in an industry in which any trade-exposed Australian firm will struggle to compete . But Abbott 's nuanced response on this point is important : nominal wage levels ca n't be touched , but other forms of remuneration like loadings and leave are fair game -- even if they 're every bit as important to a worker 's income as base pay . <p> And ACCI 's Wilson is correct : real wage growth is slowing -- during the final half of 2013 the CPI rose at an annual rate of 4% , but the wage price index for the September quarter ( when the CPI rose 1.2% ) rose 0.5% , seasonally adjusted for an annual rate of 2.7% . In trend terms , the quarterly rise was 0.6% , for an annual rate of 2.6% . As it turns out , a softer economy is already delivering very moderate wage growth , and the FWA is doing nothing to prevent it . <p> Cutting loading and leave still means a substantial cut in real wages , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And that will flow through to demand ( particularly in more fragile regional economies ) . Cutting wages across industries , indeed across the economy , as McGauchie appears to suggest , would help guarantee that an economy currently running a little below trend would slow still further , lifting unemployment and exacerbating job security fears , which already appear to be growing . It 's a lazy call from " business leaders and economists " -- and from politicians , too , even if they want to disguise under talk of leave and loadings . <p> It 's all so depressing , but why , oh why , are the principal players recycled , overpaid players from yesteryear , elderly gents like McGauchie and Abetz ? What do they know about labour productivity , in the first place ? <p> At the least , Crikey , please balance this story with one about comparative executive pay rates and workloads . <p> I 'd suggest starting with Australia Post 's CEO and a comparison on either a **27;28;TOOLONG basis or some other measure of output , as against the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Mr Farhour is very well paid indeed . But do n't stop there ... take a peek at executives from a few emerging nations as well - that would only be fair , because that is where our bottom rung jobs are going and the comparisons are being made . <p> What does an executive in India , Bangladesh , Vietnam or the Philippines get paid ? <p> Even , because that seems to be where our businesses including BHP and RIO are headed some comparisons of executive and professional pay scales with the Old Dart . Our cream are doing very well , IMHO , while they belittle others . <p> Sickeningly blatant money grab from the already wealthy . High wages and increasing the minimum wage do n't increase inflation , there is no new money added to the economy , existing money is merely siphoned from profits to workers wages . <p> Also , why are we aiming to decrease inflation ? The lack of government expenditure is ensuring that we are already shooting under the RBA 's target . <p> More rubbish from the people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dole and workchoices . They do n't care about the plight of those without millions , when will people realise that enough is never enough for these sociopaths , and they will do everything in their power to ensure that their slice of the pie is growing . <p> Interesting mention of sociopaths , Jimmy . One thing that I always find curious about the ' market is always right , government is the problem ' crowd , is that the financial centres of the world , tend to attract far more than their fair share of sociopaths . That is , researchers into sociopathy , often point out , that outside of the prison system , the largest aggregation of sociopaths in America is in the Wall St financial district . Likewise in the U.K. , where the hotspot for non-imprisoned sociopaths is ' the city ' finance centre of London . I suspect that there 's a number of things that make the finance industry attractive to the sociopath . There 's the chance to make huge legal and not so legal profits ; often without a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the morally neutral nature of the work . There 's the chance to work in an industry where honesty is often not the best policy . And finally , there 's only a small chance of being punished , for behaving like a sociopath . <p> If the CPI is going up by 4%pa and wages at 2.7%pa , then a salary of $75K will only buy approx $65K after a decade . Even after one term of this government , buying power would be down about $5000 . And what happens to the economy when people stop buying stuff ? . Detroit here we come ... <p> All good commentary above . The best indication of where wages are at , is the ABS figures for the wages/profit split of GDP . I have n't looked them up for awhile , but last year the wages component was around 40% , or perhaps a little above/below that figure . Which means ' profits ' were around 60% . Thirty/forty years ago that split was around 50%+ for wages , with the corresponding amount going to profits . That does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What it does say , is that business is doing very nicely , thank you very much . Greed is still good , it seems ! ! <p> I 'd like to second the suggestion of JohnB , a comparison of executive productivity and pay rates with equivalent people in the developing nations , as well as the developed nations would be interesting . <p> Further , a detailed breakdown of the " bang-for-buck " of executive payrates and workloads , as compared to the workers in the various industries they represent ( the supposed under productive class ) would be revealing too . <p> Should I get out the popcorn for ' stagflation ' , that pustule that tends to erupt when ' known-nowt ' neocons meet reality , WHEN in office . A more stable ( not suggest ' sclerotic ' ) society than Japan could hardly be theorised this side of amphetamine but , still inexplicably enthralled to Ivy League MBAs , it is now entering its THIRD ( fourth by some perspectives ) of the apotheosis of capitalism plus ultra , deflation , plunging demographics , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arthurianism ) . How should any of this drivel apply to OZ ? Obvious why it does but why , FFS ? <p> The retirement of the pre baby-boomer and the early baby boomer numbskulls at the top of the corporate tree in Australia is very likely to see an almighty rise in productivity all over the country , just by dint of their having left . <p> Their commentary on what ails us as a country is an object lesson in avoiding responsibility for your incompetence and making sure that someone else pays for it . <p> The damage that has been done to Australia 's balance sheet due to gross corporate stupidity over the last 20 years would come in at over $100b , easy . I 'm sure Stephen Mayne could tally up $100b without needing to read his notes . <p> Absolute tossers , with not the slightest idea that they are the problem .

How much money do you pour down their throat to keep things going ? <p> DAVID LEWIS : Brock Hindmarch is determined not to sell his cattle in a depressed market , but he ca n't continue down this path forever . He 's already cleared another property of nearly all its mulga reserves and had to relocate as a result . <p> So it 's totally deserted now , which must be strange . <p> BROCK HINDMARCH : Yeah , no , it is a little bit odd to - just to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DAVID LEWIS : Like so many others on the land , Brock Hindmarch is an optimist who looks to the skies and hopes for a change in fortune . <p> BROCK HINDMARCH : We 're just sort of praying that when it does all break , there 's going to enough money around for people to buy , buy our stock and hopefully reclaim a bit of that money we 've spent on ' em . <p> DAVID LEWIS : Surviving the drought is a team effort and the entire family is pitching in .

So we 've nearly had a doubling in price of supplements . <p> DAVID LEWIS : A critically low supply of water is making matters much worse . <p> DAVID JONES : All the dams @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are drying up , so people are frantically drilling bores to try and supply water to their stock , and financially , very difficult for ' em . <p> DAVID LEWIS : It 's a common story across the west . <p> So Denis , as hard as it is to believe , this is actually the Warrego River ? <p> DENIS COOK , MURWEH SHIRE MAYOR : It is .

Livestock is deteriorating and there 's a real risk the drought could become a human catastrophe too . <p> Lifeline has confirmed reports a grazier committed suicide after he ran out of feed for his 400 head of cattle .

@@2306231 <h> 2015 Subaru Liberty Aiming to take advantage of large car sales decline <p> Subaru hopes the new Liberty can take advantage of the continuing decline of large car sales in Australia . <p> Speaking to CarAdvice at the launch of the new Subaru WRX STI , Subaru Australia boss Nick Senior said the new Liberty could benefit from more fleets allowing buyers to pick a wider variety of cars , outside of the soon-to-be-extinct local manufacturers . <p> " Whenever you introduce a new car , there 's expectations to increase your share . " Senior said . " One of the opportunities moving forward for new Liberty is certainly to look at what is going to replace the locally manufactured sixes . " <p> The new Subaru Liberty will arrive in Australia in the first half of next year and take on the ever competitive set of medium cars . But it can also act as a replacement for those coming out of a Ford Falcon or Holden Commodore . <p> " I think the new Liberty is a worthy car to have on the list if I was a customer with an up-spec Commodore or Falcon .

" <p> Asked if the Liberty will have a bigger advantage than other medium-sized cars given it 's all-wheel drive , as opposed to front-wheel drive , Senior was hesitant to count it as an advantage . <p> " All-wheel-drive ( AWD ) will help -- but again , our unique selling point in the market place has been AWD and it continues to be AWD , it 's up to us as marketers to push AWD and the benefits of it , I do n't think people will automatically want to jump from a rear-wheel drive into an AWD , it may make the transmission a little easier and more palatable but overall I think we need to continue to stress the benefits of grip confidence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Liberty fill the hole left by the locally manufacturer large cars , such as the Ford Falcon , Holden Commodore and Toyota Aurion ? <h> SOCIAL SHARE <p> With the new and improved styling I think they are onto a winner .

@@2306237 <h> Australia : Super no-guarantee : The risks of the new default fund regime <h> Introduction <p> The superannuation industry has seen major regulatory change with the introduction of the Stronger Super reforms , which include MySuper and SuperStream . The next big change is the commencement of the new regime under the Fair Work Act 2009 that relates to default funds in modern awards . <h> What are modern awards ? <p> Modern awards are handed down by the Fair Work Commission ( FWC ) and set out minimum terms and conditions for employees across Australia who work in certain industries or occupations . <h> Super and modern awards <p> One of the terms contained in modern awards relates to superannuation . <p> Under that term , if an employee covered by a modern award has not exercised choice of fund , then their employer must contribute to one or more of the default funds listed in the award . <p> Default funds differ between awards . However , modern awards currently include a grandfathering clause that allows employers to continue contributing to a fund to which the employer was contributing before 12 September 2008 or its successor . <p> If an employee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to their chosen fund until such time as that choice is no longer valid . <h> New regime <p> During the last 12 months or so , certain amendments were made to the Fair Work Act 2009 to introduce a new default fund regime . This new regime involves a four yearly review of the default fund term of modern awards by the FWC . The first full review under the new regime is set to commence on 1 January 2014 . <p> This four yearly review involves two stages : <p> First stage : the Expert Panel of the FWC will make a list of superannuation funds that offer a standard MySuper product that may be included in modern awards , called the Default Superannuation List ; and <p> Second stage : the Full Bench of the FWC will vary the default fund term of each modern award to remove every superannuation fund that is currently specified in the default fund term and will specify between 2 ? 15 superannuation funds ( from the Default Superannuation List ) that satisfy the second stage test . <p> During the four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ list of employer MySuper products , called the Schedule of Approved Employer MySuper Products . An ' employer MySuper product ' can be either : <p> a tailored MySuper product offered by a public offer fund to a large employer ; or <p> a corporate MySuper product , which is a stand-alone non-public offer fund for the employees of an employer and its associated entities . <p> The new regime does not affect defined benefit members or exempt public sector superannuation schemes . <p> There is a 12 month transition period in which employers will be able to continue making superannuation guarantee contributions to their existing default funds until 1 January 2015 . <h> What is at stake ? <p> The ultimate outcome of the review process will be that an employer 's choice of default fund ( for employees who have not made an individual or collective choice ) will be reduced to only the funds named in the modern award . <p> The limited employer choice of default funds will mean that many superannuation funds may lose out on the opportunity to receive new contributions for award-covered members @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listed on modern awards will need to carefully consider whether they are in a position to retain the existing account balances of their members who are covered by modern awards . <p> The reason is that the election in section 29SAA of the Superannuation Industry ( Supervision ) Act 1993 , together with APRA Prudential Standard SPS 410 MySuper Transition , requires the trustee of a superannuation fund that offers a MySuper product to identify a " suitable " MySuper product to which accrued default amounts of affected members must be attributed before 1 July 2017 . <p> A MySuper product of a fund which is not listed in the relevant award for one of its members will be suitable if : <p> the member is eligible under the governing rules of the fund to make contributions to that product ; <p> the trustee is legally able to attribute the member 's existing account balance to the product ; and <p> most importantly , the trustee has formed the view that the attribution of the member 's existing account balance to that MySuper product promotes the financial interests of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the trustee of a superannuation fund not listed in a modern award will need to consider when determining whether the attribution of the existing account balances of its members who are covered by awards is in the financial interests of those members . <p> It is not a lay down misere conclusion as to whether trustees of funds that are not listed will be required to transfer accrued default amounts of its members to another fund to which contributions in respect of those members are paid . Trustees in those circumstances will need to give real and genuine consideration to this suitability question . <h> What has happened so far ? <p> The review of default superannuation fund terms in modern awards is now underway . <p> The FWC has reviewed the list of authorised MySuper products published by APRA , and all superannuation funds that did not offer a MySuper product were deleted from the default fund term of modern awards on 30 December 2013 . <p> The FWC has also inserted provisions in the default fund term of modern awards to the effect that defined benefit members @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the new regime . <p> In addition , the grandfathering provisions have been amended to allow an employer to continue making contributions for the benefit of an employee to a superannuation fund ( that is an eligible choice fund ) where it was doing so before 12 September 2008 , but only if the superannuation fund offers a MySuper product or is an exempt public sector superannuation scheme . Grandfathering provisions will continue only until 31 December 2014 . <h> What 's next ? <p> Keep a close eye on the FWC 's website as it will soon publish a timetable for the review process and any relevant application forms . <p> In the meantime , the FWC has indicated that the applications to be on the Default Superannuation List or Schedule of Approved Employer MySuper Products will need to include information about the superannuation fund and its MySuper product 's performance , such as : <p> the appropriateness of the product 's investment return target and risk profile ; <p> its expected ability to deliver on the product 's return target ; <p> fees and costs ; <p> net @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and quality of advice . <p> In deciding the application , the FWC is required to consider the best interests of default fund employees and take into account the information contained in the application , a set of performance criteria ( in line with the information the applicant needs to include in their application ) and any submissions made in relation to the application . <p> The determination varying the default fund modern award terms following this review process will take effect from 1 January 2015 at the earliest . <h> Your strategy ? <p> In this changing landscape , there are a range of strategies that super funds may wish to use to secure contributions going forward and to retain existing account balances . <p> In developing a strategy , super funds may wish to consider : <p> whether any of their members are covered by modern awards ; <p> if so , what modern awards ; <p> for those modern awards , who are their competitors ; <p> whether and how to garner employer and union support during the review process ; and <p> whether a choice strategy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The new Federal Government has released for public consultation a discussion paper " Better regulation and governance , enhanced transparency and improved competition in superannuation " . <p> In this discussion paper , the Federal Government has sought comment from industry as to its views and suggestions on changes that can be made to improve transparency and competition in superannuation . <p> In particular , the discussion paper asks stakeholders to comment on certain aspects of the new default fund review process for modern awards . <p> This will be an opportunity for super funds to consider and put forward their views and any suggestions on how they think the new regime can be improved .

@@2306240 <h> My 3 most embarrassing investing mistakes of 2013 <p> " I like people admitting they were complete stupid horses ' asses . I know I 'll perform better if I rub my nose in my mistakes . This is a wonderful trick to learn . " -- Charlie Munger , in an interview with Motley Fool analyst Morgan Housel . <p> I 've decided to push aside my embarrassment and have a go at learning this trick . Without further ado , here are my three worst investing mistakes of 2013 . <p> I bought Silver ChefLimited ( ASX : SIV ) at $5.26 , when the share price tumbled from $7.45 . Silver Chef is a company that leases equipment to various small businesses . Its most important segment is lending to hospitality businesses , but it has recently expanded , targeting tradespeople with a new offering trading under the brand GoGetta . <p> I bought shares somewhat instinctively because the price looked compelling on cashflow and earnings multiples ( and because I was anchoring to the previous higher prices ) . However , I subsequently sold my shares for a loss at $5.08 . I sold because I could n't get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's books , and I do n't think the value of the equipment on the balance sheet can be taken at book value . That 's because the equipment is leased out ( the company can not sell it ) , and even when the company receives the equipment back , it 's unlikely , to my mind , to realise book value on sales . <p> I was probably being overly paranoid , worrying about the liquidation value of Silver Chef 's equipment , especially as the company is depreciating its assets appropriately . As long as management is prudent , there is little chance that liquidation values will ever be relevant . Silver Chef shares currently trade at $5.42 , so arguably the mistake was to sell at $5.08 . The real mistake , to my mind , was buying without conviction in the first place . The lesson learned is that paranoia will likely get the best of me , unless the balance sheet is very strong . The decision to buy , then to sell , in such a short period of time , is nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , certainly the most expensive , was to sell my shares in Capitol Health Ltd ( ASX : CAJ ) . When the diagnostic imaging roll-up was trading at just 13.5 cents , I had a long conversation with a friend of mine who happens to be a young doctor . He explained to me that as the population ages , it is likely that there will be greater demand for MRI scans , as they are a useful diagnostic tool . He also commented that it was completely impractical for people to come to hospitals for scans , as the MRI machines at hospitals were in high demand for patients with acute health needs . <p> I heeded his advice , bought shares , and then subsequently sold them at 19.5 cents . Shares currently trade at 49 cents . That 's about a 150% gain since I sold my shares ; more if you include dividends . Ouch ! Once again , I was concerned about increasing debt , and I could n't understand why the company would take on debt and pay dividends and raise capital , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dividends can be justified as a mechanism to release franking credits . The worst part is that watching the share price grow , after I sold , became too painful and I missed the opportunity to buy shares when they came down to 35c , a decent price . The decision has been both costly and embarrassing . It is particularly frustrating that I did the research at the right time and understood the company well . I failed to stick to my convictions . <p> The worst mistake , on a philosophical level , was selling my shares in SEEK Limited ( ASX : SEK ) at $10.40 in April 2013 . I was influenced by a different style of investing : one that favours rock bottom prices over high quality businesses . Although it is essential to understand Graham-style investing , I am comfortable with Charlie Munger 's style of investing in growth at a reasonable price . Graham-style analysis was not the best way to analyse Seek : what was I thinking ? <p> I bought my Seek shares at about $6.80 , after my favourite investment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good profit from the investment , I believe that it was unnecessary to sell my shares , because there was nothing about the investment that was bothering me . I merely felt as if the shares were getting a tad expensive . Seek shares are now about 30% higher , trading at about $13.50 and I have learnt another expensive lesson . If a business is high quality and has plenty of room to grow over the long term , do n't sell all your shares just because the price has run ahead of itself ! <p> In the investing classic The Money Game , George J.W. Goodman wrote : " If you are not automatically applying a mechanical formula , then you are operating in this area of intuition , and if you are going to operate with intuition -- or judgment -- then it follows that the first thing you have to know is yourself . You are -- face it -- a bunch of emotions , prejudices , and twitches , and this is all very well as long as you know it . " <p> Foolish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as an investor . From the mistakes listed above , it would appear that my most common error is anchoring . My original decision to purchase Silver Chef was driven by the fact that the share price had just fallen , rather than high conviction in the opportunity . My decision to sell Seek seems almost entirely based on the fact that the share price had risen . The company continues to grow earnings and has excellent prospects to expand . There was no logical reason to sell shares , as the valuation was not that extreme . The most expensive decision , selling Capitol Health , was an impulsive overreaction to the fact that the company was raising capital , taking on debt and paying a dividend . While I maintain that is strange capital allocation practice , in the future I will not freak out and sell my shares on that basis alone . <p> Taking into account my successes as well as my failures , I did better than ever in 2013 .

At Sochi2014 , there have already been many examples of non-sponsors exploiting the worldwide interest in the Games , from Audi 's ( or an Audi fan 's ) use of the misfiring rings at the opening ceremony to Zippo 's claim to have " saved the Olympics " during the torch relay . <p> These spontaneous responses to real-time events have demonstrated how the commercial rights associated with the Games are being protected . The official sponsors are paying huge sums of money to be linked with the Olympics ; they do not want their association with the " greatest show on earth " to be " ambushed " or devalued , nor to see their own campaigns ridiculed or undermined . To that end , the specialist legislation introduced by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sections of the London Olympic Games and Paralympic Games Act 2006 ) is designed to protect the value of the Olympic brand -- and therefore , the value of being associated with the Olympic Games . <p> These associations are , after all , highly lucrative ; it was announced last week that Samsung is the first of the IOC 's Olympic Partner sponsors to renew their association with the organisation , at a cost of $200m for the eight years from 2016-2024 . <p> These arrangements are necessary because of the IOC 's requirement in Rule 50 of the Olympic Charter that all Olympic venues are " clean " and free from advertising , and that athletes do not endorse non-sponsors ' products during the games period of 30 January to 23 February 2014 , under Rule 40 . Rule 40 provides that : <p> Except as permitted by the IOC executive board , no competitor , coach , trainer or official who participates in the Olympic Games may allow his person , name , picture or sports performances to be used for advertising purposes during the Olympic Games @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , likened to the airbrushing of Soviet propaganda , where some websites of manufacturers of equipment for Olympic athletes have had to resort to " digitally blurring " pictures of athletes for fear of falling foul of these regulations . <p> What is less well-known is that the prohibition on non-official endorsements extends to preventing any of " demonstration or political , religious or racial propaganda ... in any Olympic sites , venues or other areas " , and that any athlete breaking Rule 50(3) is subject to disqualification . <p> Despite the widespread disquiet about Russia 's so-called " anti-gay law " , the threat of disqualification from the Games has ensured that there have been few overt protests and few uses of the pro-LGBT rainbow colours by athletes during competition . Rule 50 , however , goes far beyond preventing clearly political statements -- and it has had some surprising and bizarre results . <h> By the book <p> The request from the Ukrainian Olympic Committee that their athletes be allowed to wear black armbands as a mark of respect to those who have died during the current @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Such a demonstration was always likely to be perceived as overtly political , as it could be used by either side to claim support from the nation 's athletes for their cause . <p> Unless it could be stated unequivocally that this was a mark of respect for all of the dead from both sides during the Olympic Truce , it could be all too easily misinterpreted and misused for political ends back in Ukraine . <p> But it is not just those killed during political battles that can not be honoured at the Olympics . It would appear that even athletes who have died whilst trying to reach the Games can not be publicly mourned by their friends and teammates . Sarah Burke was killed just over two years ago whilst training for the ski half-pipe .

@@2317234 <h> The full story ... <h> Fishing line twisted into artificial muscle <p> MARK COLVIN : If you 're someone who regularly casts a fishing line , you would already know how strong the line can be , but also how easily twisted . <p> Now , an international team of researchers including some from the University of Wollongong has used both those properties to create a super-strong artificial muscle . <p> They 're not making replacements for muscles in the body , although the principle may be used one day in robots and prosthetics . <p> In the short term , the artificial muscles are likely to be used to make clothing that breathes , or massages the wearer ; or to open and close windows in line with a building 's temperature . <p> The lead researcher in Australia is Professor Geoffrey Spinks , of the ARC Centre of Excellence for Electromaterials Science at the University of Wollongong . <p> He spoke with Ashley Hall . <p> GEOFFREY SPINKS : I think it 's very significant and exciting because what we were able to do is produce really well-performing artificial muscles from ordinary materials that are very , very cheap and readily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into real applications without any worry about price barriers or availability that did hinder our previous work , where we were looking mainly with artificial muscles made from exotic materials . <p> ASHLEY HALL : Well indeed with all of those exotic materials ; high strength , artificial fibres that are available , how did you ending working with fishing line ? <p> GEOFFREY SPINKS : Well it was a long journey , it seems obvious at the end but it was actually quite a long journey . We started off looking at carbon nano-tube based fibres , which are not readily available , they 're certainly very interesting materials . And what we learnt from those particular studies was that the way the carbon nano-tube fibres were operating , we saw similarities with ordinary polymer fibres , so you know the temptation was to see whether ordinary polymer fibres like fishing line could function as artificial muscles and to our surprise they work really , really well . <p> ASHLEY HALL : How did you actually go about giving fishing line super strength developing them into artificial muscles ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high-strength fibres and that 's one of the reasons they work really well as fishing lines - they 're light weight but strong materials . And they 're produced by an extrusion process where the fibre is extruded into a filament and then it 's stretched . And the stretching process produces a really high-strength fibre . <p> Now what we were able to do was take those already oriented fibres and simply twist them and by twisting them , that produced a particular orientation to the molecular structure that upon heating produced a large contraction in their length and that 's a function of their particular geometry and that in fact produced a muscle-like contraction that is quite similar to our own natural muscle in fact . <p> GEOFFREY SPINKS : The similarity between our fishing line artificial muscles and natural muscles is really in the way that they function . So our natural muscle , like our biceps for example , when stimulated contract in length and that contraction acts on a tendon that 's attached to bones to cause our limb movements . <p> So we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same thing . They contract in length , and we can attach them to tendons or other systems and produce a useful movement , so that 's where the similarity is in the way that they function . <p> ASHLEY HALL : What are the key applications for this discovery ? <p> GEOFFREY SPINKS : Well the applications are many . The ones that we 're particularly interested in are the ones that involve the weaving of these artificial muscle fibres into fabrics and then the application of those fabrics into active textiles . <p> So for example we have an ongoing project to manufacture and test a sleeve that 's worn on the arm and that sleeve can be stimulated to produce a massing effect to the arm and that massing effect is thought to be a useful treatment for the swelling of the arm through conditions such as lymphedema . <p> ASHLEY HALL : I understand we could also be looking at windows that open and close themselves ? <p> GEOFFREY SPINKS : That 's right , actually that 's a particular interest to us here in Wollongong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ automatically when the temperature inside gets hot except that they use motors and electricity to function . So we figured that we could replace the motor with just a bit of fishing line and have our artificial muscles open the windows just when needed . <p> ASHLEY HALL : How do you control the movement then , is it the application of heat ? <p> GEOFFREY SPINKS : Yeah the most convenient way to get the movement is to apply heat and that can be heat from you know the ambient heat or it can be body heat if we 're wearing a garment or we can apply heat through electricity . <p> So in most of the demonstration devices that we 've produced so far , we actually use a fine electrical conductor that 's woven into the fabric and that provides a bit of electrical heating and that way we can conveniently control the amount of movement . <p> MARK COLVIN : The University of Wollongong 's Professor Geoffrey Spinks , speaking to Ashley Hall .

@@2317238 <h> Music videos at the Brits were very late to the party <h> Author <h> Disclosure statement <p> Robert Strachan does not work for , consult , own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article , and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond the academic appointment above . <p> One Direction got lucky this year , taking two awards away from the Brits . One of these was in the new Best British video category , judged by the British public via a live vote over Twitter . <p> And this was certainly one of the notable marketing points leading up to this week 's Brit Awards . But the new category can be regarded as a somewhat late arrival to the party if we consider the extensive history of popular music and visual media . <p> The popular adage that Queen 's Bohemian Rhapsody was the first " pop video " in 1975 does n't take into account the fact that something similar had existed throughout the 20th century . Indeed , it stretched back even before the invention of sound on sound technologies in the 1920s . The 1900 Paris world fair included @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soundies " , a kind of visual jukebox , became popular in the US in the 1940s , long before the advent of MTV in 1981 . <p> Perhaps fittingly , given this long history , Wednesday night 's supposed " innovation " came across as something of a stylistic conservation zone . Despite the rather laboured real-time voting by hashtag , the actual nominations used a series of well-worn tropes that have been part of the audiovisual language of pop music culture for decades . <p> Most of the nominations ( Ellie Goulding , One Direction and John Newman ) use the traditional mix of narrative and performance , and their use of visual clich ? s such as slow-motion and spotlight flares draw upon the stylistic mainstays of the 1980s heyday of pop videos . The large-scale choreography also taps into a tradition stretching from 1930s musicals though to pop exploitation films of the 1950s and beyond . <p> Best Song Ever . <p> There was also an explicit mining of pop music 's past , from One Direction 's jokey rejection of boy band clich ? in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1980s styling and choice of location , through to the deliberate referencing of Tony Palmer 's footage of Northern Soul dancers at the Wigan Casino ( originally broadcast in 1977 ) in Newman 's Love Me Again video . <p> This does n't mean that music video is simply irrelevant in 2014 . The increasing availability of everyday recording and video technologies across a range of devices has democratised the medium . There has been an exponential increase in the amount -- and variety -- of videos being made . Video sites are now abound with high-quality , highly inventive videos made by DIY producers , parodies and response videos , hybrid forms such as mashups , and intimate performances from an almost infinite number of performers . These often transcend traditional media channels to reach global audiences . <p> I Need Your Love . <p> It is the spontaneity and authenticity of such self-made media that is being invoked in Ellie Goulding 's second entry in the video category , Calvin Harris ' I Need Your Love . Full of apparently self-recorded , hand-held shots of intimate situations featuring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ video desperately tries to capture the spirit of the amateur video . At the same time , its clearly staged scenarios and high-production qualities create a distancing effect for the viewer . We do n't quite have faith in what we are seeing . <p> But examples such as this and indeed , the Brits ' attempt to engage with social media through the video award , illustrate the central importance of new technologies to the music industry . They are changing the aesthetics of audiovisual media and , more fundamentally , they are changing the way we listen to music at all . <p> Music videos have become increasingly embedded in everyday listening and so , unless they are to become completely irrelevant , the awards have to reflect this much more closely . The Brits have a long way to go . 
@@2317239 <p> The much-discussed purchase of WhatsApp by Facebook this week should give us pause for thought regarding the real agendas behind such monopolistic acquisitions in the tech world . <p> It 's clear that , with Facebook users getting older and older , the teen market is something it must buy into in order to capture the next generation . <p> It 's also clear that , in the manner of Microsoft or Blackberry Messengers , this is an attempt by Facebook to monopolise our " free " internet chatter in a single app . This obviously runs counter to the cross-platform appeal of email or SMS . Though even if Facebook does hold off placing advertising on this messaging platform ( for a year or two ) , it will still have access to all the meta-data of teen chatter , so valuable to them in targeting their advertising at us on Facebook itself . <p> But look a little deeper and there are disturbing traces of the activities of self-styled neoliberal elites , a class unto themselves continually trying to ensure that the world runs in their best interests . The meta-data about our relationships in social networks so valuable to Zuckerberg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all too clearly , also extremely valuable to the national security agencies in the US and UK .

Oh , and , of course , the possibility of snooping on nasty terrorists , as they keep reminding us . <p> We can gain even more insight into this latest acquisition by taking a look at Peter Thiel , the string-puller behind Zuckerberg . Paypal founder turned venture capitalist , Thiel was Facebook 's first big investor back in 2004 and he still sits on the company board . <p> As an undergraduate Thiel was taught by the French philosopher Rene Girard ( and he now funds the Imitatio organisation promoting Girard 's work ) .

But they turn out in fact to be rather sinister harvesting machines , where shadowy government agencies and billionaire elites hoover up the data about our " herd " behaviour in their attempts to maintain social control and competitive advantage . <p> Many marketing professionals I know who deal in this sort of thing do n't have Facebook profiles ; they know what is done with their data and want their lives to be more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advice -- or just keep moving with the herd ? 
@@2317240 <p> It is 20 years since the AIDS-related death of Derek Jarman , filmmaker , painter , author , gardener -- and a crucial voice in gay politics in Britain . And when you look at his work today , two decades can seem like a very long time ago indeed . <p> The topics Jarman explored in his films and journals , and which drove his activism , remain very much with us -- Britain 's imperial legacy , or AIDS and queer sexuality in relation to what he called the " hetero soc " , his idea of the normalising force of the heterosexually led society . But the contexts for these issues have changed enormously . Since the 1990s , the medical response to HIV has shifted completely and we now live in a world in which gay marriage is sanctioned by the state . <p> Meanwhile , the central London that Jarman was based in for most of his working life has been fully transformed by the gentrifying forces of property redevelopment . Art has become more of a global commodity than ever . Where some find socially liberal " progress " in these changes , I expect Jarman would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have seen in this the forces of normativity , the pressures of neo-liberalism , masking the persistence of forms of intolerance of all kinds . <p> Marking this anniversary year , a number of individuals and institutions across London and beyond have joined forces in creating Jarman 2014 , a loosely linked set of events , exhibitions and projects which explore Jarman 's work in various ways . My own contribution is an exhibition at the Cultural Institute at King 's College London , where I teach and where Jarman once studied . The exhibition explores his humanities education and his life in London . <p> Jarman was a student at King 's from 1960-63 before he went on to the Slade to study Fine Art . The common view is that he came to King 's to take a General Studies degree ( a bit of history , english literature and art history ) by way of bargaining with his middle-class RAF father , who wanted him to get a " real " degree before going off to art school . <p> This means that this period in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important to an artist like Jarman . It 's worth stating that unequivocally now , at a time when the humanities is under threat in various ways through funding cuts , ever more torturous metrics and general suspicions about relevance . More than many artists of his generation , Jarman engaged deeply with history , literature and art history . <p> Jarman did n't have a simplistic relationship to the history and the literature of the past . Sometimes readers and audiences detect nostalgia , a rose-tinted view of history , but this , I think , is to misunderstand him . While Jarman 's works are often informed by historical moments of a time before the industrialising , imperialising forces of modernity , he does n't look back longingly and uncritically . His view of the past may be something altogether queerer -- less interested in continuity or even coherence , more interested in disrupting historical certainties and conventional thinking . <p> The figure of John Dee provides a good example of Jarman 's irreverent historicism . An alchemist , astrologer and magician known as " The Queen 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dee was an important figure in Jarman 's work . He appears at the beginning of Jarman 's punk-aesthetic feature Jubilee , summoning angels and Shakespeare 's Ariel before the scene cuts to disaffected youth on the streets of contemporary London . <p> Jarman 's Jubilee . <p> In this angry , ironic state-of-the-nation film about Britain , in the wake of the Queen 's jubilee celebrations in 1977 , it is the magical figures of the past who disrupt and question our view of the present . <p> We look back at Jarman now as a particularly British kind of radical artist , a polymath across different forms and media . His radicalism can be seen not only in his development of a unique aesthetic and experimental practice , but also in the way he lived his life , as a queer artist-activist on the outside of movements , groups , and institutions . <p> What drives Jarman , which we see so clearly in his sketchbooks and notebooks , is curiosity and a continued hunger to learn , to read more and to rethink .

The Northern Territory , for instance , mandates that everybody must report child sexual abuse . However , we have n't seen a substantial increase or decrease directly as a result of that . <p> Mandatory reporting is very difficult to enforce because it relies on suspicion or reasonable belief that child abuse is taking place , and law enforcement officials often will struggle to find evidence that that 's the case . <p> EMILY BOURKE : And he argues there 's a need to bolster and harmonise the existing patchwork of laws . <p> SCOTT JACOBS : Child Wise is definitely advocating for greater legislative reform . We need to make sure that organisations are supported through having external standards and regulations that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making sure an open and aware culture is in place so that if something like this happens , it can be challenged ; to make sure that support and supervision of staff occurs ; that if they 're not sure of the policies , if they do n't know who to report , then they 're able to . <p> But also about complaints and grievances so there needs to be external redress mechanisms or almost a whistleblower policy so that people feel comfortable and confident in raising concerns that things have n't been dealt with internally , they can go to the police or to child protection . <p> And it 's about empowering children as well to make sure that they understand body safety and personal safety , and are able to speak up . <p> EMILY BOURKE : During this recent public hearing by the royal commission in Brisbane , one child protection officer at the school said that the children should have had the courage to speak out , while other witnesses said that they dismissed the early complaints as gossip . <p> Despite staff training @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ former bishop of Toowoomba , William Morris , said that he was stunned that some people " do n't get it " . <p> Scott Jacobs from Child Wise says many organisations are yet to prove their child protection credentials . <p> SCOTT JACOBS : Largely it comes down to training and understanding and awareness . There 's any number of policies and procedures that can be put in place , but the best ones will not be effective unless staff genuinely buy in to the idea of child safety and understand the importance of it , and that goes right from the top down , from the board level , executive level , management , middle management , frontline staff . In any organisation there must be an understanding and a commitment of what it takes to be child safe . <p> EMILY BOURKE : The royal commission has wrapped up the Toowoomba case-study . Any findings will sit alongside those from other similar investigations , such as the Forde Inquiry 15 years ago , which looked at child abuse in institutions in Queensland . <p> Scott Jacobs again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Protecting Children , looking at foster care in Queensland in 2004 ; there 's The Forgotten Australians in the Australian Senate . <p> So it 's something that we 've seen in the past , that organisations have been investigated , that recommendations have been made , and some often are implemented , but they seem to not go quite far enough , and Child Wise is very firmly of the opinion that the public awareness around an issue that 's been in the shadows for so long is starting to have a very big impact . <p> There will be a much stronger public will for change coming out of this commission than there have been previously . <p> EMILY BOURKE : Tomorrow the royal commission will open another public case study . This time it will examine the Parramatta Girls Training School and the Institution for Girls in Hay in New South Wales . 
@@2325231 <h> Jennifer Duke 25 February 2014 <h> How to : Use your equity to buy your next property <p> Investors looking to build a portfolio and hold their current property , or their home , are constantly looking for ways to jump into the next opportunity . While selling one property and pouring the funds into another can be a possibility , those wanting to build a portfolio may see themselves benefiting from holding on to their purchases - particularly when a significant amount of growth has been seen over a long period of time , or when the prospects for the property are favourable . <p> When property prices rise , as we have recently been seeing them do around the country , it 's only natural that investors will start wondering whether it 's enough to leverage them into investment number two . This is known as using your home 's equity ( or your property 's equity ) and pouring it into another purchase . You may also see this regularly referred to in investment circles as " tipping " equity into another property or " pulling " equity . <p> Pulling equity allows you to hold onto an asset that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ funds that may otherwise cause you to miss an opportunity . However , it does mean that you 're looking at holding on to a substantial amount of debt - a concept you will need to become comfortable with should you be looking at holding multiple properties . <p> But where do you start ? <p> To begin , you need to know how much equity you have available - a quick back of the envelope calculation will help you figure out if it 's even going to be viable enough to begin speaking to your lender . <p> This comes down to two different factors : <p> The property 's value -- You can work this out through a number of different options . Online valuations , calling local experts such as real estate agents , checking out online comparables or getting a valuation undertaken , can all give you a rough guide . Have a read of this Property Valuation 101 guide to give you a leg up when undertaking this part of the process . <p> How much you owe -- Check your statement for what the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have iis the balance left when you take away what you owe from the value of the property . Let 's assume the property value is now $400,000 , and your balance owing is $200,000 . This leaves you $200,000 worth of equity . <p> If you do n't have a substantial amount of equity remaining , you will want to try and push one of the two equations more favourably by either paying down your mortgage more quickly , or by increasing the value of the home . Hopefully , if you 've been selective about the area of purchase , you will have seen some capital growth that will have increased the equity without you needing to lift a finger . Those that have n't been so lucky will need to look towards these other value adding measures . <p> You can not just tip the entire $200,000 into another property , as this will leave your " owing " balance at 100% on the current property . You also want to ensure that you have enough equity as a buffer in case you see any downturns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with negative equity in any situation ( where you owe more than the property is worth ) . <p> " If you do n't have any spare funds aside from the equity in your home , then do not use all your usable equity to invest in property , just in case you need to draw on it in the event of an emergency . Even if it means you ca n't invest for a while , it is always important to keep yourself protected , " NAB warns in their guide to using equity . <p> With this in mind , you then need to look at how much to leave in the current property for when you refinance . Leaving 20% of the property 's current value ( or $80,000 ) , provides you with $120,000 of equity available to play with . <p> You may be able to use $80,000 of the equity to move into another $400,000 investment property .

Certainly , it is n't for everyone ; however there are some significant benefits to this type of loan . <p> Cross-collateralising , or where you use one property 's equity as security for another , rather than taking out a separate loan , has certain benefits .

@@2325236 <h> festival &gt; News <h> How Did This Perth Poet Get On The Soundwave Bill ? <h> In the wake of Hardcore Superstar 's withdrawal from this year 's Soundwave festival , Perth man Gareth Williams -- soon to be known widely as the Heavy Metal Poet -- fired off a spur-of-the-moment tweet to event organiser AJ Maddah . Within hours , he found himself in the middle of the musical equivalent of a Salvador Dali painting . <p> This story is about rock'n'roll , but let 's start with some business . <p> You see , one of the fundamental principles in business , which anyone misguided enough to ever do a degree in such a field knows better than their own mother 's birthday , is that risk equals return . That is , the lesser the risk , the lesser the return , and vice versa . <p> So , when self-described metalhead and father-of-two Gareth Williams saw that Swedish hard rock band Hardcore Superstar had pulled out of the Soundwave festival citing concerns over ( what they saw as ) their too-early slot , he did something that many of us have probably thought about doing in similar circumstances but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -- he straight-up offered to fill in , in 140 characters or less , directly to festival boss AJ Maddah himself . <p> " It was a snap decision ; I was running on pure instinct , if that 's the right word , " Williams tells theMusic.com.au from his home in Perth . " I have always liked to entertain people , so it was a matter of ' here goes nothing ' ! <p> " Actually , I saw AJ 's tweet and was n't familiar at all with Hardcore Superstar or what music they played , and after reading a lot of the tweets in response I realized that not many other people did , either . So I thought -- no , scratch that ; did n't think , just reacted -- and it paid off . " <p> " Paid off " is right , too . Maddah may be many things , but regardless of personal opinions of the man , you can inarguably count " super game " among his qualities -- especially considering Williams ' offer was to perform The Rime of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ song , although Williams professes to have been a diehard fan since first hearing The Number of the Beast as a 10-year-old , but a full-length dramatic reading of Samuel Taylor Coleridge 's 1797-98 poem of the same name . So it was a pretty ballsy move on Maddah 's part , especially considering the only interaction the pair have ever shared has been via Twitter . <p> " I have only ever conversed with AJ on Twitter , " Williams says . " He 's a prolific tweeter and almost always answers reasonable questions and comments . We 've tweeted back and forth over the last few years , sometimes about music and sometimes about random shit . I 've seen him give people tickets to sidewaves and organised to help them out , so he 's a genuinely nice guy and seems to use Twitter as it should be by connecting with people . " <p> Or , as it turns out , forcing people to step up and play that big game they love to talk . Certainly , Williams -- despite being a seasoned performer himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his offer . <p> " My head spun . I took a deep breath . Thought , ' This is just crazy enough to work ' , " he says of realising that Maddah was serious about having him perform the poem . <p> " I took a screenshot of the tweets and texted my girlfriend with the news that I 'd been booked . It was , and still is , so surreal . I feel like I 'm in the middle a rock'n'roll Salvador Dali painting . " <p> " It 's one of my favourite Iron Maiden songs , and it just happens to be based on a kick-arse poem , " he enthuses . " Like a lot of metal music , it 's dark and scary -- with a body count in the hundreds . <p> " My first tweet to AJ mashed lyrics from Number of The Beast and The Rime of the Ancient Mariner -- with tongue firmly in cheek -- and it got his attention . <p> " I knew the poem ran about 25-30 minutes when recited , so it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just made sense . <p> " That all raced through my head in the time it took to tap out the tweet and press ' send ' . " <p> What you ca n't explain in the space of a tweet , though , is the actual content of the poem . Aside from being famously responsible for the now-ingrained idea of having an " albatross around one 's neck " , it 's not exactly what you 'd call a " small " piece of prose . Rather , it is - if you 'll excuse the internet-sullied connotations of the originally extremely poetic word - an epic . <p> " Yeah , it 's long as balls , over seven parts ; it 's a mammoth poem ! " Williams declares . " The poem encapsulates a mariner 's return from a long and harrowing journey ; his narration to a wedding guest and the shift in tone from danger to serenity , the supernatural and romance makes it one of literature 's most compelling , and longest , pieces of prose . Historically , it also marked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important place in literature 's oeuvre . <p> " There 's a connection to Australia through the symbolic placement of an albatross , so that 's really nice . " <p> Naturally , with such a voluminous body of work in front of him , Williams says he is " working like a demon " to memorise as much of the poem as he can -- " But I 'll also have notes -- and by ' notes ' I mean ' the entire poem ' ! " he laughs . <p> Given the nature of the festival , and his own lifelong love of music with a metallic edge , Williams is planning on doing more than just committing poetry on an unsuspecting audience . <p> " I 'm working on some backing music , tossing up between looping the bass instrumental from the Iron Maiden track or using a piece by composer Phillip Glass , " he says . " Though whether Soundwave is quite ready for poetry and classical music , only time will tell . <p> " It 'll also depend on how much artistic freedom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ addition I 'll just do as I 'm told . Visually , I 'm thinking of going with a ragged , hooded black cloak and a big , red , leather-bound book . There may well be copious amounts of page-tearing and flourishes as they 're tossed aside . <p> " Being a ginger and knowing that we die when exposed to sunlight , the hoodie could well be a life-saver . " <p> All that said , with his moment awaiting him , Williams will be more than pleased with just a working microphone and an abuse-free stint on-stage . <p> " I 'm reciting 18th-century poetry at a punk and metal festival , so I expect it to ' sink down like lead into the sea ' ... or be a cult-like success , which , through word of mouth , leads to world domination , " he says . <p> " If people turn up expecting Hardcore Superstar , they 'll be in for a surprise . But I 'll just be happy if people think it 's a cool thing and I avoid someone throwing a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " But ... regardless on how it turns out if I get bitten by the bug again I may just end up back on stage wearing rags , wondering where the groupies are and demanding my backstage rider .

About the tools that they will use on-site : Moisture detectors are common , thermal imaging devices are less-so , while a laser level and sounding devices are in most building and pest inspectors ' kits .

Here is an example of one company 's report . If you 're looking to find areas with which to negotiate the property down in value , the more comprehensive these reports are , the more to your advantage . However , you may find yourself concerned when a number of issues are brought up . Here is Jo Chivers ' guide to " reading between the lines " of a building and pest report so that you do n't get too worried and lose a good opportunity . <p> Understand the limitations <p> Building inspectors are human , and for this reason standard building inspections are not a fail safe method . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( although more comprehensive inspections can be requested at a cost ) . For this reason , they will only be able to access areas that they can see -- providing an opportunity for error and for the vendor to occasionally hide issues their home may have . <p> Similarly , pest inspectors ' equipment are not foolproof -- even after an inspection , damage can be found upon renovating . You may not be able to claim this back from the inspector , who has n't necessarily been negligent . <p> Specific knowledge <p> Local building inspectors are likely to know about specific builders , types of building , the way the structure needs to be built to withstand local weather and ground conditions and the common problems . For instance , in some areas certain streets are more prone to termites than others .

You may be able to informally ask them how much certain repairs will cost , and whether certain damage is necessarily a deal breaker . If you are interested in this aspect , you will want to be looking for someone willing to take their time with you and to give you a personalized service . <p> Not all inspectors will be comfortable providing an estimate for repairs costs , and you can then take the report to a builder or other professional for some advice . <p> Extras worth considering <p> Some inspectors offer extra services , such as to provide a " video " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this can not only be a good educational tool in what to look for in a property yourself , but it will also clearly show the extent to any damage . <p> Quick note : Ensure you do n't get overcharged for your building and pest inspection . Usually , each report will cost around $400 to $600 , and as a bundle may cost up to $800 , although in some cases can be far less . Prices do vary , and can be more expensive for regional areas where an inspector is required to travel out . <p> Finally , remember that reports can take several days to put together . If you 're heading to auction , you will want to be getting this done as early in the process as possible before you even consider putting a bid on the home . 
@@2335237 <h> Office market drivers <p> There 's a lot of hand wringing at the vacancy rates being reported for office markets at the moment but in more than 20 years , the analysis has n't progressed much beyond basic questions of new supply and gross demand . Other factors are at work . <p> The latest Property Council office market survey reports Brisbane CBD vacancies as ' the highest level on record ' at 14.2% . That 's up from 12.8% the year before . The report attributes this to weak demand , specifically a " reflection of the impact of the Queensland Government 's continued withdrawal from leased space , coupled with the mining sector 's revaluation of its office space requirements . " <p> No , it 's not a pretty number and according to the PCA figures it 's at present the worst of major markets in the country : <p> Advertisement <p> But these are just headline figures . Sure the Queensland Government has reduced its requirement for space , but that followed a sustained period of bloated public sector growth under the previous government . And sure the mining sector is n't on fire any more , but no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's why mining related businesses were only taking space on 5 year leases : they knew themselves this would n't last . <p> So beyond the headlines , what are some of the other things that might be driving change in the market ? <p> First , remember that a 14.2% vacancy rate is the same as an 85.8% occupancy rate . Most industries with that sort of capacity utilisation would be over the moon . It 's a quirk of history that office markets have always reported on vacancies rather than focus on the occupancies . That 's unlikely to change but what it means to seasoned observers is that this is n't the calamitous disaster media headlines might have us believe . Plus , take into account that a fully occupied market is generally regarded to be around 95% occupied ; that 5% vacancy being required for normal movement . Any less and the market is under supplied . So really we 've got about 10% of surplus space sloshing around in the market now . <p> Much of that space is sloshing around in lower grade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from stock because they ca n't compete with contemporary space and the facilities it provides . Owners can refurbish older buildings , or convert them to alternate uses such as residential or short term accommodation . Expect a lot of both to happen in coming years . Those stock withdrawals will to an extent offset stock additions through some of the new projects under construction . <p> On the demand side , apart from blaming a downsizing by government and mining tenants , what other factors are in play ? <p> Advertisement <p> Rents are surely one . Talking about office space demand without mentioning rents is a bit like talking about demand for petrol without mentioning the price . High construction costs , site acquisition costs and development costs mean that delivering new CBD office buildings is not a cheap exercise . Our CBD rents are some of the highest in the world . This Cushman &amp; Wakefield report makes for interesting reading . According to the report , Brisbane is roughly 80% of Manhattan Grade A prices , is more than Melbourne , is 50% more than Houston @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are higher than New York . Go figure that one . Ask Holden , Ford or Qantas about the globalisation of markets and what happens to Australian product that is overpriced . Will that affect demand for office space if companies simply shift operations elsewhere , or are they faced with no choice but to pay globally high rents for what are not global scaled cities ? <p> The other effect of high CBD rents is also force some hard thinking about the relative benefits of CBD over fringe . A lot of companies have recently opted for the latter . This could also be affecting demand for space in key CBD markets . <p> Floorspace ratios are another factor at play . New tenancies for major business are often being designed around per person space ratios as low as 10 metres per person . Concepts like ' hoteling ' where staff do n't have their own desk and where personal effects are discouraged , have fad surfers enthralled and financial controllers impressed . Personally , I ca n't see this lasting . We 're human beings after all . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that explore the boundaries of these management fads and seek publicity for doing so . The silent majority of office tenants are as inefficient as ever , with spare desks and large common areas so the average in my opinion still works out at around 20 metres per person . Either way , it 's an important factor on the demand side which is n't discussed much . <p> Parking costs are another factor . This is more a problem for casual parkers than permanents but both are paying exorbitant prices . If you are CBD based and have clients visiting your office , you should feel some sympathy for the $50 they 'll shell out just for a two hour visit . These are some of the highest costs in Australia and equally some of the highest in the world . Those urban planners wanting to ' keep cars out the city ' may succeed if this pricing response to limited supply keeps following the same trajectory . But if you keep the cars out of the city , you 'll keep the people out too , and along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of parking , both for tenants and customers of those tenants , could be another factor weighing against demand for CBD space . <p> These are just some of the considerations that reach beyond the basic numbers . There are more but the point is that a 14% vacancy rate owes itself to a wider range of market forces than superficial reports deal with . <p> Is 14% a cause for concern ?

@@2335239 <p> News that government intelligence agency GCHQ has been intercepting and storing webcam images from 1.8 million users of Yahoo 's chat service under the codename Optic Nerve is a reminder of how close we are to living in a surveillance state . Webcams , embedded in laptops and sitting on top of monitors , have become a standard piece of computing equipment , but it has now become clear that these can be used against us . <p> Hackers have been stealing webcam images of unsuspecting users for some time . The Metasploit tool comes with packages that make it easy for even a novice hacker to gain access to the webcam of any computer that does n't have all of the available patches and updates installed . <p> Equally worrying are reports that hackers could use the webcam on your laptop without even triggering the embedded warning light that indicates to the owner that the camera is in use . <p> Once they 've gained access to your webcam , a hacker can then go on to trade or sell access to it on hidden websites and password protected chat rooms . <h> How GCHQ did it <p> But now it seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and chat . And what makes the actions of GCHQ unique is the scale on which it is capturing these images . <p> The Edward Snowden leaks revealed that GCHQ is tapping many of the large internet backbone cables that carry hundreds of gigabits of information from computers all over the world every second , including unencrypted Yahoo chat sessions . <p> GCHQ 's main technical achievement was to find a way of scanning this massive amount of data and extracting the webcam images . While easy to do for a single image , the scale on which GCHQ did this must have taken a great deal of both technical expertise and computing power . <p> The second issue GCHQ had was how to store so much data . Here compromises were made . Only one still image from every five minutes of video was stored . GCHQ 's aim was to view images from known targets ( or users with screen names that were similar to known targets ) . It also experimented with face recognition technology to try to detect images of known suspects . But the leaks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the images stored were from highly private , and in some cases sexually explicit , chats between individuals who were not intelligence targets . <h> Alternatives for Yahoo deserters <p> The best way to protect the privacy of your webcam chats is to make sure that they are encrypted . Yahoo 's web chat server was based on its Yahoo Messenger system , which dates back to the nineties . This legacy system has never supported encryption and it was this weakness that made it possible for GCHQ to harvest personal images on such a large scale . <p> Google 's offering , Google Talk , was developed much more recently and is possibly a better option in these post-Snowden times . The service encrypts data between the user and its servers , and then re-encrypts it when it is sent to another user .

According to the latest leaked documents , GCHQ staff have been viewing intimate images of webcam users who were not intelligence targets . <p> This would be illegal if a hacker had done it but it is likely that GCHQ 's actions are legal under the UK Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act . Even so , it seems doubtful that the mass collection of intimate images of innocent people was something that the authors of this law intended .

A week later , National Union of Mineworkers ( NUM ) president Arthur Scargill called a national strike . Thus began the UK 's final and most significant industrial dispute of the 20th century . <p> But one further aspect has become clear only over time : this was the first mass industrial dispute played out largely in the media . In a foretaste of the era of the spin doctor , the winning side had the best communications strategy , the clearest narrative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Vitally , the miner 's strike emphasised that industrial disputes could no longer be won on the picket lines . The battleground was the media , and Thatcher came prepared . Norman Tebbit , writing in his autobiography , stated : " I do not think that anyone has properly assessed the skill with which the dispute was foreseen and then managed by the government . " Indeed , such media management was rare at the time : the phrase " spin doctor " was n't first used in print until later that year . <p> The government conducted itself during the strike as if it were engaged in an election campaign . This was not just a direct battle with the pit workers but rather an attempt to persuade the public that trade unionism was an inherently pernicious entity . The whole weight of the Conservative Party 's political machine was thrown behind a cause which was regularly depicted as a simple battle between good and evil . It became a debate solely about the personality of the government and the personality of Scargill . <p> While Thatcher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strike , as far as the media was concerned Scargill himself was the NUM .

However , though he made perceptively timed appearances throughout the dispute , he continually accused the BBC and ITN of distorted coverage , particularly concerning picket line violence . Nell Myers , Scargill 's press officer during the strike , outlined the union 's attitude in an interview with The Guardian in 1985 : " The industrial correspondents , along with the broadcasting technicians , are basically our enemies .

To this day , in the internet age , the same strategy is still adhered to by those seeking to manage the news agenda : launch stories late on Saturday but early enough for other Sunday papers to recycle . <p> The story would then move onto television . In 1984 , the BBC and ITV 's breakfast news programmes dominated and Thatcher 's media strategists ensured that throughout the strike a minister or member of the NCB was available for media comment first thing on Monday mornings .

It ran a highly effective propaganda campaign orchestrated by party strategists who had already won two elections . And , of course , it benefited from a largely compliant media . <p> In complete contrast , Scargill found it impossible to delegate any of his responsibilities as official spokesman for the NUM . There was no overall communications strategy , his technique was too one-dimensional and his persistence and ingenuity did n't endear him to those outside the union .

Firstly , at NBN , and that includes me , there is no conversation about any path to privatisation . <p> But the possibly of a sale or public float of part or all of the NBN will not go away , with the Coalition poring over a $130 billion shopping list of public assets to be sold off and with Switkowski indicating that the NBN wo n't be able to borrow privately to fill an $11 billion funding gap for the $41 billion rollout . Switkowski told The Australian Financial Review : " I know that whether it 's organisations like Macquarie which is funding an all-fibre rollout in Utah or any other infrastructure fund , they will all stand ready to think about ways of playing with NBN at the right time . " <p> The National Broadband Network Companies Act 2011 blocks the sale of part of all of the NBN until the communications minister deems the network to be completed , an inquiry into ownership of the network is held by the Productivity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the finance minister has declared it is time to enter into a sale scheme . <p> Both the ALP and the Greens are standing by these provisions . Ludlam told Crikey the wholesale-only NBN would be a natural monopoly and , if the Greens had their way , would remain in public hands in perpetuity . Ludlam points to the lessons of of the privatisation of Telstra , which created a " deeply dysfunctional market " . <p> While competition should bloom among retailers , Ludlam says " the idea that you could have competition at the wholesale level is absurd " . <p> Ludlam says private investors would cherrypick , rolling out NBN to profitable markets in Sydney and Melbourne and ignoring the rest of the country , as occurred with the rollout of rival pay-TV networks using coaxial or hybrid fibre cable ( HFC ) . Just like electricity and water , the NBN should be publicly funded , with uniform pricing to cross-subsidise the rollout to regions like Port Hedland , for example , says Ludlam . " Otherwise we end up with something like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ competition should bloom among retailers , Ludlam says " the idea that you could have competition at the wholesale level is absurd " . <p> An early NBN sale could rest in the hands of Clive Palmer , likely to hold the balance of power in the new Senate from July . The Palmer United Party has no formal policy on the NBN yet . Palmer 's spokesman said that any NBN sale proposal would be considered on its merits but early last year , in a web forum hosted by The Sydney Morning Herald , Palmer indicated he was opposed to privatisation of the " things that we have government for " and continued : <p> " As far as the NBN goes , I do n't think you could privatise it , because of the amount of money that 's been spent on it does n't give a return to anybody , least of all the Australian taxpayer . " <p> It might be a tricky sale , but by the mood in the room at February 's NBN results , there 'll be no lack of fee-hungry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be a significant cost at the national level . Get over it . Obviously many of the armchair critics would have been critical of a Sydney Harbour Bridge designed for anything more than two lanes of traffic and a pedestrian walkway . <p> NBN problems are just reality trampling over Rabid Right ideology . We should use the well-tested government business enterprise model for NBN as a public monopoly : ... 1 ... Turnbull wishes to save Murdoch 's Foxtel monopoly by creating a dog's-breakfast of an NBN . As with Big Finance we see the perversion of public policy to benefit private interests . ... 2 ... the all-FTTP NBN could be built by mid-2024 -- just three years behind its original schedule and only four years after the completion of Turnbull 's hybrid model . Gross cost would be $29 billion more , but Turnbull 's costs and times were gross underestimates anyway . Had it been started in 2005 , it would now be more than half-completed. ... 3 ... NBN under Labor was until recently following much the same ideological approach as Turnbull - denying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was once standard for government business enterprises . Hence the failures . ... 4 ... Laberal determination to flog everything off naturally created endless problems of coordination , which will continue until the network is re-nationalised. ... 5 ... " Do it once and do it right " . If it is not a cross-subsidised universal-access public monopoly ultimately with the complete replacement ( not bypassing , replacement ) of copper , the whole system will become even more of a dog 's breakfast . ... 6 ... inequality of access and choice of second-best are why Turnbull 's fraudband is cheaper . It offloads the at least $3,000 cost of connection from NBN ( which can afford it ) to the user ( where businesses will enjoy tax deductibility , while consumers will find the cost very challenging ) -- creating exactly the inequality of access and opportunity that the Noalition is so anxious to create . ... 7 ... Do n't borrow from the usurers , borrow from the RBA ( as Hockey should have done with OUR $8.8 billion ) . Banksters are perfectly happy with printing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ financial asset values ( the values of their assets , including Sydney dwellings ) ; it is past time to do so for a useful public purpose , though - I agree -- the prospect of using public funds for public benefit will seem appalling . <p> But the promoters and financiers still get their massive cut for creating the mess , then another for a patch-up , then another for another patch-up . <p> Agree the NBN should stay completely in public hands . Let us all hope these lunatics in the current government do n't start flogging it off before the next election in 2016 . We will then have an opportunity to save the NBN by returning a Labor government . After all , it was their idea in the first place , and they should be allowed to complete it using the initial plan ! That way we will all be better off . <p> I think if Joe managed to sell the NBN for a large sum to give temporary respite to a budget problem , then Alanis Morissette would have to rewrite the lyrics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ budget windfall from a project you slagged <p> Obviously many of the armchair critics would have been critical of a Sydney Harbour Bridge designed for anything more than two lanes of traffic and a pedestrian walkway . <p> Fun Fact ? : As far as " do it once , do it right " goes , as a future expansion option the Sydney Harbour Bridge was designed to hold a second level of traffic . <p> However , the bridge can not be upgraded now as it 's so old , and it 's manufacturing process was so poor ( high standard for the day , but poor compared to today 's engineering ) that it ca n't actually hold the second level .

@@2340236 <p> The recent decisions by Ford , Holden and Toyota to cease manufacturing in Australia have raised serious concerns for the thousands of Australian businesses who work in the automotive supply chain .

In fact , diversification can take many forms -- diversifying into different supply chains and global markets , or even diversifying products , processes and business models . <h> Mitigating risks <p> Manufacturers that branch out into other industries mitigate the risks that come with limiting themselves to one supply chain . <p> One company that has continually done this well is Marand Precision Engineering . A key supplier to Australia 's auto sector , Marand is now branching out into aerospace , defence , rail and mining , with automotive business now representing less than 10% of its turnover . <p> The key question this firm asked itself was : do the components we manufacture always have to go into a car ? The simple answer was no . Marand 's specialisation is n't in automotive supply ; rather it is precision engineering -- skills that can be applied elsewhere to different markets . <p> Diversification does n't have to be mean moving into new industries .

But funnily enough , I am a Girl helps us understand the hoo-hah over Mouseketeer twerking . How ? By reminding audiences of the feminist media scholarship of the 1970s . It was on the money then , and it still is now . <p> I am a Girl 's premise is that technological and social advances have not produced gender @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exploited because of their gender .

If you want to think about girls , media and reality , think Malala Yousafzai , not Miley Cyrus . <p> Barry 's work reflects the influence of British 1970s feminist media research . <p> Back then , a collective called the Women 's Study Group at Birmingham University argued that any effort to understand the significance of how girls are depicted in the media had to start with an analysis of their social and physical experience . They argued that debates over the liberating or oppressing qualities of onscreen images had to connect with simple political facts : for example , that in the post-war period , social policy wanted women to stay at home and reproduce . <p> Australian girl Katie features in I am a Girl.ABC Publicity <p> In other words , ideological battles were n't just being fought on screen : they were being written on women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? <p> Cultural theorist Angela McRobbie is a key figure here .

Today 's screens are full of girls who can do anything . The real world is full of others who ca n't , because they shoulder the burden of economic and social exploitation . <p> According to McRobbie , thinking about real and media girls means remembering two things . <p> First , being smart and sassy does n't solve anything . Second , because this is true for most girls in most parts of the world , it 's vital to think about how gender inequality is powerful because it acclimatises to different circumstances . <p> Which is precisely I am a Girl 's point . <p> There is n't so much difference between Kimsey , the Cambodian sex worker and Katie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of impossible demands .

According to this logic , there 's no contradiction between the arguments that the incident that propelled " twerking " into the Oxford English Dictionary dramatised the inherent sexual exploitation of media industries , versus the counter that it was a feisty piss-take . <p> The world is full of feisty girls who know what time it is . It 's just that this changes less than we might imagine . <p> The genius of I am a Girl is that it does n't just teach us about a world that we do n't see .

Beard said that she " dreads " the idea of having quotas of women , and thinks that it could lead to women contributors being " vilified " . <p> She is right to think so . This is a thorny issue .

Hylda Baker , Joyce Grenfell , Beryl Reid , Margaret Rutherford , Penelope Keith , Victoria Wood , French and Saunders , Jo Brand , Gina Yashere , Meera Syal , Miranda Hart and Sarah Millican provide just the start of the obvious answer . <p> And yet when I teach a course on comedy and identity to students at a university that prides itself ( not always convincingly ) on its liberal credentials , many of them tell me , year after year , male and female alike , that men are just , well , funnier . <p> The reasons for this tenacious misconception go deeper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gender and joking in friendship groups and other social interactions is deeply rooted in understandings of masculinity . Any pub in any British town will contain noisy clusters of male mates , and the predominant noise is laughter , that strutting-rooster laughter poised somewhere between a boast , a cackle and a bray , elicited mostly by what has come to be labelled as banter . <p> The social history of that word cries out to be researched , but its current vibrancy seems tied to a wider renaissance in blokey boorishness . Banter is laddishness sung in the key of laughs , simultaneously offering a communicative glue to bind mates into webs of friendship , competitiveness and pecking order , and erecting a fence to keep outsiders in their excluded place . Women , needless to say , are the primary target of this exclusionary practice . <p> Television shows like Mock the Week , Have I Got News For You , QI and ( over on Channel 4 ) Eight Out of Ten Cats bring banter culture into the entertainment sphere .

Cohen 's determination to eradicate male-only casts has made that series a particular target , which has prompted its host Dara ? Briain to offer a defence . " It 's remarkable " he somewhat evasively told the Radio Times , " that this amount of time is spent debating women in comedy shows rather than , say , Question Time .

Most male comedians are engaged in the anxious business of proving what kind of men they are , and female performers would only get in the way . As usual , Mock the Week shows this dynamic at its starkest and least lovely , with sextets of show-offy blokes locked into ever-decreasing spirals of banter characterised by a desperation to impress . <p> As ever , other social factors complicate this picture and offer differing versions . British comedy is always obsessively concerned with class , ensuring the masculinity question is favoured differently according to the class palate of the text in question . QI , already less macho courtesy of host Stephen Fry 's tweedily pass-the-port inflection of English gayness , proffers a masculinity pivoted on arcane knowledge and can accommodate numerous female participants ( provided Fry remains in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the adjacent genre of the game show , have perfect their class-differentiated knight-and-squire act on BBC1 's Pointless , while in the outer reaches of ITV2 , surely the channel where pub banter is most at home , Celebrity Juice subjects leering machismo to arch deconstruction via the persona of the mocked yet indulged Keith Lemon . <p> All of which suggests Danny Cohen 's quest for more comedic gender equality has a hill to climb . More women on these shows might be a starting point , but comedy is too slippery and wily to respond well to a well-intentioned but ultimately clumsy quota mentality , and this particular kind of female-excluding comedy is too central in the building of masculine identities to become gender-neutral any time soon .

The thing is , I 'm not making much of an addition to those audience statistics .

The average budget per film must be less if it aspires to turn a profit . <p> As part of my ongoing interest in economically sustainable Australian filmmaking , I wrote a screenplay in 2010 for a feature film that could be produced on a budget of only half a million dollars . But I had great difficulty peddling it around town -- as the first assumption I encountered was that a film with that low a budget must be B-grade shit . <h> Which comes first : the money or the distribution deal ? <p> The largest hurdle for a low-budget filmmaker such as myself is n't raising the money -- it 's getting an upfront guarantee of distribution so that raising the money is easier . It 's still going to be difficult but not as difficult . <p> Distributors who read my script were pleasantly surprised -- but unfortunately they were nervous about taking on a low-budget project that was n't a sure thing -- or , as I read the situation , a project that did n't remind them of the Red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distributors are too nervous about taking on Australian films because they perform poorly at the box office and present a financial risk . And rightly so . <p> I believe that if the average Australian film was being produced for under a million dollars and theatrical distribution was guaranteed , the money would be much easier to raise . Why ? Because I could tell an investor that audiences will get a chance to see the film . Without that , the investor would be foolish to invest . <p> I do n't necessarily want Screen Australia 's money to make my film ( although , it would be nice ) as I do n't have a problem with the notion of having to raise half a million dollars to make a film . If I ca n't interest a room full of potential investors in my project then maybe it 's not worth the paper the script is printed on . <h> Cutting through at your local cinema <p> Where I do need substantial help is in putting a distribution deal together beforehand . I would much rather draw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distribution of my film . After all , does a film exist if nobody is there to see it ? A pertinent Zen koan for the Australian film industry , methinks . <p> Each time I go to the multiplex , I see posters , cardboard cutouts , fibreglass displays and trailers up to 12 months before a Hollywood film 's release . Australian filmmakers need help cutting through to audiences . <p> Rather than funding for my film , I would prefer Screen Australia to four-wall the theatrical distribution -- renting out the theatre the film will be showing at , and taking the profit from the ticket sales -- put up some posters and guarantee the screening of my film . <p> This in turn would help facilitate raising money for the film . We are talking about raising relatively low sums here .

Find a way . We simply do n't have millions to spend on each film unless we sucker an investor to pay for them -- and currently the sucker is us . <p> By turning off the tap to over-inflated budgets we may even encourage some innovative filmmaking and lure audiences back , the same audiences whose trust we lost by spending millions on films that they do n't want to see . Remember the innovative low-budget film Kenny , in 2006 ? <h> A modest proposal <p> If Screen Australia stopped funding the production of films and instead funded theatrical distribution a number of things could happen . <p> First , Australian films would cost much less per ticket . If theatrical distribution were to be four-walled then Screen Australia can set whatever ticket price they want . They can price them to sell . If audiences knew that Australian movies cost less to see then it may just be in their tight-arsed nature to start supporting them again . <p> Second , theatrical exhibition could be tailored around films that Australians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a film receives in terms of screenings can be assessed on the genuine merits of the completed film , avoiding the fundamentally flawed script-based assessment process . <p> In my mind , the abysmal hit-and-miss ratio by government funding bodies has proven beyond reasonable doubt the ineffectiveness of this process , that arming bureaucrats with Hero 's Journey speak is n't enough . <p> Funding theatrical distribution would be fairer for the filmmaking community because the usual gatekeepers would n't get to say what does and does n't get made . Instead , they 'd get a fair go at assessing the finished product , they 'd get to try it out in front of real audiences and decide how long to run it for . <p> With a model like this , over time , distributors and investors may become less fearful of local content . They would gain confidence from the fact that a certain number of screens across the country are quarantined from Hollywood films , that screens in multiplexes have been bought out to guarantee the screening of an Australian film . <p> A little help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world of difference to the Australian film industry . <p> Are you an academic or researcher working on film finance or production ?

We could have heard the stale , aging partygoer incarnation of the band . Thankfully , we 're far from that . <p> It remains a certainty that the band is , essentially , the same one we fell in love with , though there are moments in Underneath The Rainbow that make you long for their days of fearlessly vomiting and playing with fireworks nude on stage . For example , on the country-tinged track Justice After All , there 's no real hook aside from vocalist Alexander Cole 's cute cowboy accent on the final line of the chorus that sticks . <p> The impact of this would be relatively insignificant if it did n't follow Dorner Party , a hyper-intense track sung by drummer Joe Bradley that apes 2011 's Go Out And Get It by offering rhythm-section muscle as a trade-off for the latter 's gripping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little bored or -- dare I say it ? -- lazy . <p> In all three of the above tracks , the intensity of the back-up vocals merely simmer , as if their only function was to shadow the lead , instead of bringing a new life or injecting more energy into the tune , as we 've heard in previous Black Lips tunes . <p> The batting rate for alright-to-excellent tunes on Underneath The Rainbow is impressive , though . Smiling 's hooks are concise , the juvenile swampiness of I Do n't Wan na Go Home is refreshing , while Do The Vibrate is dirty in all aspects of the word . <p> There 's still some touches of Black Lips magic too . First single Boys In The Hood feels like a natural progression for the band . It 's a slower track that keeps its energy intact with Cole 's ratty , whisky-soaked vocals smelling like a night of cigarettes and wildness . Here , the backing vocals create enough kinetic energy to start a riot . <p> Funny sees the bands add a bouncing synth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Black Lips head-to-head with the UV Race in sonic chaos , though the screamed line " come suck some milk from my titties " may inch the Lips a nose ahead . On album closer Dog Years , the play between the shining guitars and the distinct woos brings a poppy , Dandy Warhols vibe . The lyrics here are infectious , and halfway through the song Cole lapses into a stoned talkiness , narrating a scene that plays out like a desert mirage . <p> Simply put , Underneath The Rainbow contains a few lacklustre , tired-sounding tunes , some middling songs that are a bit more than just filler , and a handful of truly amazing tracks that are inspired .

' <p> " And the message came back , ' Yes , he can see the blue jerseys ' . <p> " I said , ' I do n't need him to see anything else , because all I want him to do is tackle . I do n't need him to see the ball , so tell him not to bother calling it . He is not coming off . He is staying out there ' . " <p> Bennett , and the NRL , will be very lucky if some day soon , that statement , or myriad ones like it from other league identities , is not presented as evidence in a legal suit from a posse of brain-damaged players . <p> NRL clubs need a bigger slice of the pie <p> It 's been a tough week for league generally , with Balmain , of Wests Tigers fame , apparently teetering on the edge of financial collapse , as are , apparently , the Newcastle Knights as the whole Nathan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Cronulla Sharks have been , to adapt from P.G Wodehouse , " so long at death 's door , they might very well be mistaken for its knocker .

Do you spot the problem ? If the mother body is rolling in riches while the clubs themselves are getting the father of all financial hidings , surely it means the clubs can say to the NRL we need a bigger slice of the pie , as we remain the raw material that you are making all the money from !

The bill was then referred to the Australian parliament 's Senate Economics Legislation Committee , which has until 16 June to report back . The legislation was initially tabled to be passed this winter . <p> This will come as a disappointment to the industry , which has thrown its weight behind the changes , which seeks to reverse the work of the previous Labor Government . <p> One of the key changes the Liberal Government is to implement is removing the amendments to the Best Interest Duty provisions , which had required brokers to only move clients to a new policy or insurer if there is a proven benefit . <p> Former Assistant Treasurer Arthur Sinodinos , who resigned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Corruption 's inquiry , launched a public consultation on the changes in January . A number of industry bodies took part in the consultation including NIBA and the ICA . <p> In its submission to Government , NIBA said it generally supported the changes , but said it was unfortunate that authorities failed to distinguish the difference between a broker and other financial services advisers , pointing to the FOFA reforms as an example of brokers getting " indirectly caught up in the review of issues arising from financial planners " . <p> NIBA conceded it would have preferred the status quo to continue but backed the changes the Liberal Government has put forward . It highlighted concerns with the current best interest duty requirement . <p> It stated : " Providers are required to undertake a fulsome investigation into the client 's objectives , financial situation and needs before any scaled advice can be provided ; and there is uncertainty on whether clients and advisers can agree on the scope of the advice to be provided . " NIBA said that the bill specifies that clients and advisers are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any scaled advice provided but the definition of scaled advice is not defined in the bill . <p> It added that changes to legislation would help reduce the potential exposure of advisers , " care will need to be taken to ensure appropriate investigations and the general law obligations on advisers must not be ignored " . <p> The ICA also praised the deletion of the Best Interests Duty and the legal uncertainly it creates . <p> The Insurance Industry has scored an own goal with the pushback on FoFA . The most objectionable provisions are the scaled advice nonsense . This allows direct sellers to flog their products to an unsuspecting public pretending to have clients best interest at heart .

@@2384240 <h> 2015 Subaru WRX Specifications Technical guide <p> The launch of the 2015 Subaru WRX marks the fourth generation of the iconic model that now brings more power and torque , higher levels of standard equipment and at the lowest entry price in its 20-year history . <p> Starting from $38,990 , the new Rex has seen substantial technical changes from the previous model , including a smaller engine , new transmissions options and upgrades to the chassis , transmission , brakes and other areas . <p> The engine sees the WRX go back to a 2.0-litre four-cylinder engine with direct injection from the previous generation 's 2.5-litre unit . The new Boxer engine , which was first unveiled in the Forester turbo , has 197kW of power ( at 5600rpm ) and 350Nm of torque ( at 2400-5200rpm ) in its WRX configuration , which slightly outperforms the previous model 's 195kW and 343Nm . <p> In manual form the new 2015 Suabru WRX accelerates from 0-100km/h in 6.0 seconds . Despite the downsizing and additional performance , fuel economy has improved by 11.5 percent <p> The previous model 's five-speed manual has been swapped for a six-speed manual ( but not the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ STI ) , while a continuously variable transmission ( CVT ) with eight artificial gears brings back an automatic option to widen the WRX 's market appeal . <p> Technically , there has been substantial changes to the new Subaru WRX . The fourth-generation model offers sharper steering , now using a smaller diameter D-shaped steering wheel . <p> The electric power steering sees its steering ratio at 14.5:1 , while Subaru has increased the gearbox mount bushing stiffness by 230 per cent . <p> The front and rear suspension has been changed as well , with the front gaining stiffened cross-members , more rigid control arm bushings , thickened strut cylinders , larger stabiliser bar ( diameter up from 21 to 24 mm ) , higher spring rates ( up 39 per cent ) , lower transverse link rear bushings ( 10 mm lower ) , addition of stiffening plates , a thicker front control arm plate and increased lateral stiffness by up 14 per cent are just some of the changes . <p> The rear suspension uses a stiffened subframe and trailing link bushings while have its rear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the front , the stabiliser bar diameter has increased ( from 19 to 20mm ) , while the spring stiffness has increased by 62 per cent . <p> An additional 3mm of initial toe-in has been added alongside rear subframe supports while the shock mounts on rear lateral arms have moved 10mm outward . The changes result in a 35 per cent increase in lateral stiffness for the rear . <p> Much like the new STi , the WRX has seen body rigidity improved significantly . The new car features a nine per cent increase in use of 590 MPa steel while adding 980 MPa steel for the first time ( four per cent of the body ) . In total , torsional rigidity has been increased by around 40 per cent while bending rigidity is up approximately 30 per cent . <p> The engine , though closely related to the Forester XT powertrain , has stronger valve springs than its bigger brother . It also allows for a 25 per cent improvement in the manual transmission version 's redline to 6700rpm ( 6500 for Sport CVT ) , has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rockers for valve actuation and a plastic intake manifold to reduce weight . <p> The turbo is also now mounted immediately under the boxer engine ( 86.0 mm x 86.0 mm bore x stroke ) , which sees its crank pins increase from 48 to 50mm . <p> The exhaust system brings the same boxer sound , now better tuned with the removal of abolishing a cylinder chamber and shortening the inside pipe . <p> Brakes have been upgraded to 12.4 inches ( up from 11.6 ) , while the thickness has increased by 6mm to 30mm , which Subaru says helps reduce brake fade by up to 40 percent . <p> All WRX models ride on 17-inch wheels , which though weigh the same as the previous model , have a five per cent increase in rigidity . <p> A 25mm increase in the WRX 's wheelbase allows for more room inside , which has been widened by 15mm . The boot space is up 40 litres ( to 460L ) , while the thinner A-pillars have come forward by 200mm , allowing for small quarter windows . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to 60mm ( from 20mm ) , while the backrest is 60mm taller . <p> Subaru Australia will offer two variants , a base model and a WRX premium which gets additional equipement ( more on that here ) . It will go on sale today and is available in seven colours : crystal black silica , crystal white pearl , dark grey metallic , galaxy blue silica , ice silver metallic , red and the traditional WR Blue Pearl . <h> SOCIAL SHARE <p> and you did check the guy that washes your face in the morning ... when your mama tells you are hands some it might be just acceptable by your neighbor ... well dare I said it <p> Tin <p> charming . <p> yes its sarcastic <p> not to mention really clever <p> Tin <p> Actually very poor grammar , and what 's " hands some " -- I do n't know about " some hands " , but I do have two , and Smart US has at least one , because it 's on it . <p> LC <p> I .... umm ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ info , still no weight ? I imagine with weight saving measures plus the additional weight of all the chassis stiffening improvements it will be similar to previous model .

" additional performance " ? ? ? ? ? The current model is estimated at 5.4 to 100 ? ? Typo CA or subaru 's numbers ? <p> Paradox <p> Not a typo . It has to do with the gearing of the new generation . <p> matt <p> Brilliant . So talk of 0-100 times of just over 5 seconds was garbage . Brilliant . <p> Paradox <p> Personally , I 've read on other review sites 5.5 for WRX and 5.1 for STI ( from 4.9 ) <p> matt <p> yeah i remember seeing something like that too , seems odd that they would say 6.0 to the public making it not much faster then the original @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may have been a direct translation from American figure that uses 0-60mph , which is slightly less than 100kph . <p> Felipe Kezam <p> I do nt think so <p> AUSDAVIDZ <p> Does 0 -- 100kmh REALLY concern you all that much ? So when you jump in a car thats what you do ? Its fast enough and will be a fun car to own in the real world <p> matt <p> yes you 're grace it DOES concern me , its MEANT to be a PERFORMANCE car , bettering itself with EACH passing generation . <p> Sumpguard <p> So now DAVIDZ is defending its slower time despite banging on about history and pedigree in the KIA thread . Make up your mind David . The first WRX was the best . All down hill from there . <p> guest <p> first gen gearboxes were terrible . Mechanically all up hill from there . Current gen handling went down hill . Now looks improved as well as handling , engine , chassis rigidity . Also looks went down hill with Bugeye then improved for next 2 generations . and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's not 100% considering the improvements stated above . IMO the area the WRX needed improvement in most are the areas addressed . Most importantly if the gear change is around 95kmh then whist being slower to 100kmh its possibly quicker to 120kmh. that 's a quicker car . <p> nugsdad <p> Yea yea let me know when they get close to my Gen-F GTS <p> Tom <p> Not really a fair comparison considering the GTS is the best part of $100k ... <p> guest <p> lol , I I love burning you guys ( in a 2.0ltr sr20det ) . so easy to your third is to tall for straight line . actually never lost to one yet . you think you can buy your way into a fast car . When I race guys who have built there 8 's there is usually more respect after you chop them . btw my car makes more power than yours and weighs 500kg less . did the work myself and owes me less than a 5th of what you paid . I get 100km per 9-10ltr on highway with aircon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fun your just too slow . <p> phil <p> How much is a new Silvia ? And where can I buy one ? <p> Tin <p> matt , please call her ma'am , that 's the correct title . <p> Dave W <p> Better performance is more than just faster 0-100 . How does it handle compared to the previous one ? Better brakes ? Can it pull more lateral G in the corner ? More kW per litre ? <p> This is n't an American drag strip . <p> matt <p> i love you n all dave W , but no it should have been faster in the 0-100 stakes , its a performance car , would it be okay for the next GTR to be slower than the current one ? <p> Dave <p> Just because the 0-100 is slower , does n't mean the car is slower ! It might be quicker 0-200 if gearing has been changed to suit this . It might be quicker 80-120 . Have you thought of this or do you not have any actual idea other that one single pointless statistic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! and its gone backwards , it might be quicker 80-120 , but i fail to see how if its lost over half a second to 100 as it is . How does it make up that half second with only 20km/h to spare with 80-120 ? Further subaru engineers promised just over 5 seconds when pre orders were being taken , how do you defend they 're own words ? <p> Vincent Gu ? rard <p> Here in Canada it 's 5.4 and I agree the car has been overall well upgrade so It performed better . And the 2.0l FA DIT is a better and more efficient engine . Sorry for my english i 'm from Qu ? bec after all ! <p> matt <p> PS , just shutup and go away . <p> http : //www.caradvice.com.au/ Alborz Fallah <p> 6.0 for manual 6.3 for CVT <p> matt <p> cheers . <p> macca <p> the reason that the 0-100 times are slightly increased is that Subaru are using shorter gearing for 1st and 2nd compared to previous generations ; this is specifically for improved drivability in 2nd and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if they wanted the fastest 0-100kph time , they could easily do this by changing the gearing -- but it would sacrifice optimal 2nd3rd ratios which are used every single time you accelerate normally from standstill or when cornering ( rather than a full-bore launch just to 100kph that you really only do a small number of times on normal roads ) . <p> Wrong on both counts . Toyota &amp; Subaru use CVTs with steel belts and torque converters . <p> matt <p> *confused : -S did i not say steel bands ? , also seems Jatco has put steel bands in minus a torque converter , its also whats in the lancer ? i thought mitsubishi made they ; re own CVT , apparently not , its jatco 's , go figure , thats why its terrible . <p> Tin <p> i did n't say rubber , i said elastic , rubber is a material , elasticity is a physical property -- was a tongue in cheek comment anyway . <p> matt <p> gotcha im actually about to pick up a corolla hatch for 2 days as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really good go of this " 7 speed CVT " journo 's reckon isnt to bad . <p> Andy <p> Tin -- albeit a dumb tongue in cheek comment ! <p> Rod <p> On the subaru website , the car clearly looks lowered and the wheels possibly enlargened . Is n't that false advertsing or something along those lines ? It does look great when lowered though . <p> George Gallan <p> It does does n't it . Definitely they gave it a suspension drop via Photoshop , not sure if they bumped up the size of the wheels though but it seems like rear axle is not even aligned with the mudguards . <p> guest <p> Are you talking about the wheel offset ? ? there is no saving a comment like yours . you really have no clue do you George . <p> guest <p> So is it the rear track width or wheel offset your concerned with ? " it seems like the rear axle is not aligned with the mud guards " mmm . very technical . <p> George Gallan <p> Do you even know what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comments make no sense except to insult ... and no , I 'm not referring to the " track width " nor to the " wheel offset " . Go to a Subaru website and you will see the image user " Rod " was referring too -- it appears as though Subaru PS the image of the WRX , the side shot , they used PS to lower the car , and if you want to be technically spot on , that amateur PS job actually ended up reducing the " wheelbase " of the car , by approximately 1 ? I would say , so the centreline of the rear axle and the mudguard centreline are not in alignment any more . Rear axle has been moved forward . Happy now . <p> Phil <p> Just showing how most of them will end up looking , going by all the previous model WRX I see ruined by people who value looks above all else . <p> JooberJCW <p> All to sucker in the preorders , what little of it . <p> F1orce <p> 0-100kmh in 6 seconds ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ davie <p> Aussie Forester XT owners have been experiencing issues with this engine . the issue appears to be an el cheapo 5 cent clamps on the intercooler pipes that loosen up and leak . Several have taken to replacing the clamps themselves . <p> I doubt WRX owners will be as patient or as quietly proactive , so I hope Subaru has fixed this issue in advance or expect a social media storm . <p> mmmm <p> you do n't think a wrx owner would buy a hose clamp ? that sounds pretty strange as most people replace these claps anyway especially if running more boost . <p> mmmm <p> also a hose clamp is n't really an issue with the engine , it 's an issue with a clamp . <p> davie <p> From what I understand , the clamps are not strong enough for normal boost levels . a majority of people who buy one wont get a tune and would not expect to have to do under-bonnet repairs whilst the car is still in warranty . <p> mmmm <p> fair enough , I see your point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too . I mean its going to stop making boost and sound terrible . due to no boost you will check all your vacuum and pressure lines but before you get that far as soon as you open the bonnet you will see a pipe hanging off the intercooler . Even finger tightening will get you home . <p> Johnny Dough <p> It goes a bit beyond that , loss of acceleration and black smoke from the exhaust , downright dangerous in the wrong situation , and they 're having to replace 4 clams afaik . So far Subaru have not replaced clamps , and not issued a recall , but have started with spark plugs and a new rom flash <p> Johnny Dough <p> Clamps not clams , and not bearded ones either <p> mmmm <p> That 's weird as spark plugs and rom flash have nothing to do with it . <p> Johnny Dough <p> Precisely , and why the Forester owners are not happy , they fix it themselves <p> Yep some milk waiting to smash some thong slapper near you . What they do best . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 6 sec as well <p> qikturbo <p> The Veloster would have no chance in keeping up with the WRX and the Veloster has a toyish look that will become dated very quickly . <p> cheap wine <p> like 90% of the population you are prob . to young to know but back in the seventies V8 owners used to call 2.0ltr cars milk or juice .

But instead of transparently setting out how much it costs to deliver broadband to the bush , government gets everyone in on the gig so it can hide the inevitable cross-subsidisation . Never mind the effect on industry , but it sure makes for good politics . <p> But while the traditional political game continues , the future of our communications industries will remain the subject of more reports , not action @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political terms for far too long . The only way to unshackle NBN from politics is to get government out of the marketplace where it exists . Of course , the legacy of sunk costs will make this difficult .

Every gig I 've ever been to , even well into my 30s , I 've been asked for ID . But now , suddenly it 's clear . I 'm beyond IDable . The fact that I 'm in my late 30s is showing on my face . <p> It 's not so much that I 've got wrinkles , I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's more a combination of pigmentation from my pregnancies and my skin 's texture . Everything is starting to drop . <p> Is there anything that can be done about this ? Something that will even out the surface so my face feels less like train tracks , more like a smooth pond . With the odd ripple of course . <p> I do n't have time for a regular facial , which might be relaxing but does about as much for me as a long sleep ( and to be honest , I 'd rather sleep ) . I need something more hardcore , but nothing " invasive " , just the word makes me shudder , and I want the results to last longer than a movie marathon . <p> Beauty industry , are you listening ? <p> Apparently , they are . Here 's what I tried . <p> THIS WEEK : I walk into Zecca Cosmedical , which promises " the most technologically advanced and innovative non-surgical cosmetic treatments currently available " . That sounds exactly like what I 'm after . After a thorough consultation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treatment . <p> WHAT IS IT : Essentially , it 's a pen with tiny , superfine needles on the end of it . The needles roll over your skin , pinning holes in it as they go . They can penetrate the skin up to 2 millimetres , but I 'll be getting it to 1 millimetre . This definitely sounds more hardcore than a facial . <p> WHAT THE HECK FOR ? Apparently , causing controlled damage to your skin will prompt it to produce a bunch of collagen , which is the building block of skin . The more collagen you have , the more elastic , less wrinkled and better textured your skin will be . ( There is a much more complicated explanation here ) . <p> WHY I 'M GETTING IT : To improve the texture of my skin and try and get its bounce back . I have n't got many fine lines , but my skin is definitely starting to slacken . <p> WHAT THEY DID : Firstly , I had a numbing cream placed all over my face . This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which made my entire face numb , feeling extremely weird . This will stop me feeling the needles which is good because I 've never been fond of a needle . <p> The cream stays on for an hour , after which , I 'm ready . Ann explains there will be some bleeding as she is basically pinning holes in my face . She moves the pen all over , working on it section by section , checking in every now and then to see if it 's painful . <p> HOW DOES IT FEEL ? Surprisingly , fine . Perhaps it 's testament to how tired I am with a six-month-old baby at home , but it 's actually quite relaxing . Like a massage , only instead of padded fingers , it 's a rough little boulder going over every inch of your face . The numbing cream has done its job well , clearly , because Ann says I 'm bleeding quite a bit . <p> AFTERWARDS : I 'm very hot . Very , very hot , and a bit stingy . My skin is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the car directly onto my face . The hot feeling does n't subside until six hours later . The next morning I 'm quite tight and dry and still very red , like I 've sat with my face in the sun for a whole day . I slather on sunscreen because one thing I 've learnt after visiting anti-aging salons to research this piece , is that it 's really our only defence against aging . I can put make-up on to cover the redness , but it 's subsided by the second day and by the third , I 'm back to normal . <p> DID IT WORK ? My skin is clearer after a week . The pigmentation I have around my lips from my pregnancies has already almost disappeared . I 'm feeling more confident without make-up . They tell me the real results will be seen a few months from now . <p> CAN I GET THIS RESULT AT HOME ? There 's no equivalent product at home to a Dermapen as it 's essentially damaging your skin to encourage it to produce collagen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> TIME TAKEN : Together with the numbing cream , an hour and twenty minutes . <p> IS IT WORTH IT ? I can imagine that after the suggested four treatments my skin would look pretty amazing . The experts at Zecca however , have assured me I do n't need more than one Dermapen treatment ( though I try and insist otherwise ) and would instead like me to do their " rejuvenation package " . I 'll keep you updated . <p> Only you can decide whether you want to go beyond a regular facial . At $550 it 's not cheap , but there is no downtime and it 's less invasive than a laser , plus the results will last longer . I 'm looking at it like an expensive coat , which is an investment in looking good . And I 've decided my face is more important than a coat .

@@2392237 <p> Given the efforts around the world to discredit climate change science as a " socialist plot " , it is worth looking not at the relationship of socialist states to climate change , but to foundational socialist thinker Karl Marx . <p> Whether Marx would have been happy with the term " socialist " is debatable , but certainly by the 1960s more than 60% of the world 's governments described themselves as socialist , and almost all claimed a lineage back to Marx . So , given the influence of his thought , what would Marx say about climate change and its implications for historical development ? <p> To begin with , Marx was very interested in the natural sciences and believed that Charles Darwin was doing for natural history what he was doing for human history . <p> Coincidentally , in 1859 , Marx was writing Das Kapital -- his analysis of capitalism -- in London , when and where physicist John Tyndall was also conducting his experiment into the radiative properties of C02 ( an experiment which was never linked to human-made gases until the 1960s ) . There were no measurements of global greenhouse gas until the year 1960 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around 265ppm in 1818 . <p> But even if the significance of greenhouse gases had been brought to Marx 's attention , he would not have thought them significant in terms of the impact that humans can have on nature . This is because as a child of the enlightenment , Marx did not think of capitalism in terms of the anthropocene . Nature was postulated as an inert constant , based on the Holocene . <p> In Marx 's materialism , history was looked at as a succession of " modes of production " in which the interplay of human-made historical circumstance and human action determined the development of human society . As Marx once said : <p> ( Humans ) make their own history , but they do not make it just as they please ; they do not make it under circumstances chosen by themselves , but under circumstances directly encountered , given and transmitted from the past . The tradition of all the dead generations weighs like a nightmare on the brain of the living . <p> Marx did not believe in human nature as essence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather that the appearance of a universal nature is itself historically produced . Therefore , if humans are to change their nature today , it is in recognition of the fact that human history and geological history are on a collision course at 10,000 times the natural rate . <p> But for Marx , who lived without the insights of the earth sciences , the natural world was simply an eternal and immutable container in which a human-made dialectic would unravel . In fact , nature -- " mother nature " -- would even wait for social organisation to harvest its abundance , a " realm of freedom " against the oppression of being dependant on both a " primitive " relationship with nature and the brutality of class systems , where only necessity seemed to reign . <p> Of course , the most significant " mode of production " that would bring about this " freedom from necessity " is capitalism , the economic and social form of organisation that Marx spent 30 years analysing ( Das Kapital ) in the reading room at the British Museum . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " , Marx profoundly believed that capitalism to be at once the best and the worst thing ever to happen to the human race . <p> It is the best , in that no " mode of production " can compete with capitalism for its efficiency and sheer recklessness . No other mode of production ( for example feudalism and slavery ) ever has and no other mode of production ever will . <p> If you try and compete with the capitalist system of production -- at least before capitalism has completely encircled the globe -- good luck . You wo n't get very far before capital brings you back into its orbit . The Chinese understand this and have adopted capitalist techniques of production , while even advancing new technologies under-developed in the west such as solar power . <p> For Marx , the great thing about capitalism is the way it forms competition between capital and labour and raises the productive capacity of society . Because it must constantly expand , it is forced to adopt techniques of mass production and apply technology in ways that produces abundance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about capitalism is that on its way to producing abundance , it produces greater alienation and exploitation than any social system . Today , it is a class system that is polarised in global terms such that the classes are largely separated in time and space . Third world workers produce the wealth that rules over them . <p> AAP/Paul Miller <p> Of course , Marx wrote a polemic with Engels , The Communist Manifesto ( one of the very few places he actually used the word " communism " ) . This is very different from his " scientific " writings . It appealed to the working class to become aware of their collective situation in order to facilitate a situation Marx saw as inevitable : that capitalism would bring about an overthrow of the capitalist class , ending in a system where the species would inherit the productive capacity but without the suffering and exploitation . <p> But this is where , today , Marx 's analysis runs into trouble . It is not looking at all like this is the way the movie is going to end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abyss . Rather , one of the essential drivers of capitalism -- the use of energy to drive machines , the transition from manu to machino-facture -- is responsible for the vast majority of emissions we now know are providing an alternative movie ending . <p> Without being able to foresee the climate forcings that humans are capable of , Marx 's productivism -- an ethos he shares with capitalists themselves -- saw nothing intrinsically wrong with continued growth . <p> Capitalism has also proven to be far more resilient than Marx ever imagined . The growth of a welfare state in first world countries , the spectacular rise of mass media as an agent of the transmission of capitalist ideology and the success of capitalism at delivering goods to consumers , have underwritten the heralding of capitalism itself as the " last viable social form " or ' the end of history ' . <p> Marx 's work clearly predated any empirical understanding of the relationship of capitalism to climate , and his analysis clearly could not anticipate its impact on the environment . He would not have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't be through internal contradictions , but by encountering the limits to growth that it has imposed on the natural world through climate change . <p> But this is where at least one aspect of Marx 's analysis can be salvaged : the relationship between what he calls the " forces " and " relations " of production . The forces of production include technology , techniques and how labour is used in the production process . The relations of production are the social , legal , political and ideological structures that regulate the forces of production . <p> For Marx , the forces of production will inevitably " outrun " the relations of production . The relations of production become a " fetter " on the forces , or they hold back the development of the forces of production . It is like saying that even though 21st century technology exists to produce abundance with minimal impact on the environment , we continue to live with 18th century relations of production where an antiquated class system founded on old money has a stranglehold over its own " rate of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a coal company can keep digging up coal to produce " black power " and see a guaranteed rate of return , it will do whatever it takes to lobby government , to influence power elites , to donate to political parties , and try and stop alternatives developing . For many years , oil companies owned patents to solar technology -- not to develop alternatives to oil , but to stymie development of alternatives to fossil fuel . <p> In a really odd way , the policies of the Abbott government represent something straight out of a Marxist case study . Overseas , the contradiction between the forces and relations of production are resolving themselves with by embracing the idea that technology needs to be " sustainable " , which Abbott labels the " green ideology " . <p> But here in Australia , we are seeing a mentality that powerfully brings Marx 's otherwise outdated analysis back to centre stage . The Abbott government , a strong supporter of fossil-fuel subsidies , last week made a second attempt to abolish the Clean Energy Finance Corporation , which was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a A$20 million loan to a Wave Energy company , but also finances solar , wind , and waste-to-energy projects . <p> You could n't script a better example of establishment power moving against the rise of sustainable technology . It is so radically out of step with the rest of the world . Overseas , these kinds of technologies are heralded with the capacity to produce base-load power or at least support a mixed-energy economy which will severely draw down dependence on fossil fuels . Holding them back is so clearly an act of protecting antiquated vested interests who are trading in the lives of future generations . <p> The situation becomes even clearer when we look at who Abbott has appointed to head the Renewable Energy Target review : climate sceptic Dick Warburton . <p> Interestingly , it is new money start-up companies who have had great success in an area of cutting edge innovation . Google is one such big investor in renewable energy , and recenty paid an astonishingly large sum for a home energy management company . <p> But much more than this is needed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so good at satisfying consumer demand , and it is also quick and flexible at retooling to satisfy new demands . In his " Do the Maths " tour last year , Bill McKibben argued that during World War Two , industrial capitalism was agile in being able to convert car factories into factories to produce planes and weapons to counter the threat of Nazism . <p> Capitalism can also do this for climate change . This time , thankfully , it does n't have to be armaments . But the problem we face is that the warming we have committed ourselves to can not be responded to later . It must be dealt with now if humans are to take control of their own destiny , as well as that of our fellow species . 
@@2392238 <p> " Collectors of cinema memorabilia have a name for anonymous actors who were photographed for publicity stills , but never actually made a film , " says John Stezaker . " They call them ' virgins ' . When I go to collectors ' fairs , it 's the virgins I 'm after . There is a certain melancholy attached to the faces of actors that did not make it and to images that were destined to disappear . I 'm very drawn to that . " <p> A large desk in the back room of Stezaker 's house in north London is cluttered with photographs of " virgins " , some of which have been sliced in half diagonally or carefully cut around so that only a silhouette of the face remains . These black and white portraits of anonymous failed actors , found at fairs , flea markets and online , are one of the key sources of raw material for Stezaker 's art . He collects photographs in order to deface them and , in the process , create something new and arresting . <p> " I 'm using an archive to create another archive of my own , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little to the images , maybe just one cut : the smallest change or the most minimal mutilation . What I do is destructive , but also an act of deliberate passivity . " <p> Stezaker has been quietly making his photographic collages for 40 years , but recently the art world , led by Charles Saatchi , who began collecting his work in the mid-noughties , has " discovered " him . As a result , he has only recently given up his day job teaching critical and historical studies at the Royal College of Art in London . " I am finally being embraced by an art world that , for a long time , I consciously kept at arm 's length , " he says , smiling , " And , at an age when most people are thinking of retirement , I suddenly find myself able for the first time to make a living exclusively from my art . " <p> " I have always thought the world would catch up with me one day , but perhaps not in my lifetime , " he says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I actually fell ill last year with pneumonia and I do think it was to so with the stress of sudden success . I was saying yes to every show , every opening , ever invitation to lecture . I 've stopped doing that now now , though I will be going to Sydney for the Biennial as it 's quite a big deal to represent Britain there . " <p> Soft-spoken and thoughtful , Stezaker graduated from the Slade school of art in 1973 , having gave up painting for film in his first year . " I had a big TV in my bedroom and a camera set up to shoot old B-movies that were shown late at night on BBC2 , " he elaborates . One film that resulted featured a series of found images of people approaching windows , all taken from old Hollywood films . He showed it on a carousel slide projector with no sound . He has recently returned to film , having bought a huge photo archive from a music agency that was closing down . " It 's mainly press @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'm making a film in which they are pictured singing , but you do not hear anything . I 'm fascinated by the application of silence and how it creates a spectral world . For me , it 's a way of showing the sovereignty of image over sound . " <p> For now , though , it is his photographic collages that have belatedly made John Stezaker 's name in a global art market that , in these more restrained times , is in retreat from the recent excesses of conceptualism . " I 've always made a distinction between collage and photomontage , " he says . " Montage is about producing something seamless and legible , whereas collage is about interrupting the seam and making something illegible . " <p> Over the years , he has become a master of slicing and splicing , often , as in the Marriage series , juxtaposing two vertically or diagonally cut faces -- one male , the other female - to create a single often-surreal portrait that both exaggerates , and subverts , our received notions of glamour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something very odd , even unnerving about cutting through a photograph , " he says . " It sometimes feels like I am cutting though flesh . " <p> Sometimes , too , by simply placing an old hand-coloured postcard of a landscape across a face he creates a strange new world where the romantic pictorial tradition meets surrealist iconoclasm . The end results are always both deceptively simple in their execution and oddly disturbing in their suggestion . " When we look at a face , we assume that we are looking behind the face for a personality , " he says , " By making literal that behindness , I often create something that twists into an image of horror . It often takes me by surprise , because it is not what I have set out to do . " To this end , his work often evokes literary as well as visual precursors and he namechecks Kafka , Mallarm ? and Bataille alongside Jasper Johns and " the stranger side of the English romantic tradition " . <p> For a long time he worked long into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early hours , through tiredness , the unconscious takes over and that is when the real creativity happens . " Since his illness , though , he has had to adjust to normal working hours .

Can we change our production and consumption patterns to generate wealth from what we currently designate as waste ? <h> The potential exists <p> Consider e-waste , which is the old TVs , DVDs , computers , household appliances and other electrical goods that we throw away . This type of waste has emerged as one of our fastest growing waste streams but only about 10% is recovered or recycled . <p> Obsolete computers and accessories should n't end up in landfill when they can be recycled for metals and materials.AAP Image/Alan Porritt <p> But e-waste @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , gold , palladium and other rare materials which means they are also ending up in landfill . <p> By 2008 we had already sent some 17 million televisions and 37 million computers to landfill , according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics ( ABS ) . <p> But if 75% of the 1.5 million televisions discarded annually could be recycled we could save 23,000 tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions , 520 mega litres of water , 400,000 gigajoules of energy and 160,000 cubic metres of landfill space . <p> Another way of looking at this is to compare gold yielded from an open pit mine with that from discarded electrical goods . Mining yields 1 to 5 grams of gold for every one tonne of ore . From the same quantity of discarded mobile phones and computer circuit boards , you can extract 350 grams and 250 grams respectively . <h> The new urban mines <p> In a world increasingly addressing issues of sustainability , it 's no wonder that such end-of-life products are now being seen as urban mines -- valuable sources of above-ground metals which can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recycling activity in Australia , helped by schemes such as the national Product Stewardship framework which encourages people to reduce waste . <p> But we still lose significant amounts of valuable and recyclable materials into landfill and park valuable metals in tailings and spoil heaps . <p> Given Australia is already a global leader in primary resource production from the ground , it is timely to think about how we might also adapt and grow our expertise to mine and process above ground stocks and remain at the cutting edge . <h> Can we lead the urban mining revolution ? <p> Globally , there is already growing capacity and innovation in recycling . <p> Some recycling of rubbish is being done , such as at the Visy recycling plant in Brisbane , but we can do more.AAP Image/Dan Peled <p> New forms of manufacturing and business models are being developed that integrate secondary manufacturing of recycled materials . <p> So the potential is there to diversify and adapt Australia 's skills and technologies to support the new forms of processing and manufacturing in this circular economy . <h> Why do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the ability to persuade people and industry to see waste products as a resource rather than a liability . We need to create more responsive manufacturing , processing innovation and new business models around recycling . <p> This will challenge the way we currently operate as a nation and ask us to rethink how we relate to consumer markets around the world . <p> This scarcity is driving a move towards a circular economy -- one in which the value created by inputs ( materials , energy and labour ) is extended by enabling a material life that goes beyond product life . So we go from mineral to metal , to product , back to metal and so on . <p> By understanding such economies and value of how this chain operates in Australia , we can begin to understand , at scale , the barriers and opportunities to more sustainable consumption and production in a resource limited future . <h> Looking for a new solution <p> Too much rubbish - Australia leads the way in waste per capita.Waste Atlas <p> Although the technological challenges of complex materials @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hold the key to unlocking the wealth in our waste . <p> We also need to understand more about the cultural norms to see what needs changing . <p> Clean Up Australia found that around 14 million phones sit unused in drawers or cupboards , that 's equivalent to almost one unused phone for every two people in the country . <p> Although 90% of the materials within a mobile phone can be re-used , globally less than 10% of mobile phones are actually recycled . So why when we already have a solution do we not act to recycle our waste ? <p> The research programme will be about finding new ways of doing things that accommodate our relatively small domestic materials market and challengs the mindset that size matters when it comes to complex materials processing . <p> If we wish to add urban mining to our global mining reputation then we need to couple research , industry and policy transitions for success in a future where recycling is an integral component of resource productivity , not a niche specialism. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @

@@2395232 <p> Just before Tony Blair became prime minister -- what seems a lifetime ago now -- several colleagues and I published a research paper looking at the possible scale of rebellion that might face him in government . <p> In a play on John Major 's off-camera remarks during the struggle to get the Maastricht Bill passed , the paper was entitled Blair 's Bastards . Dismissed by Labour at the time as " academic nonsense " , it turned out to be a remarkably good predictor of who did indeed cause trouble for the whips after 1997 . One of the things about backbench rebellion is that it is habitual ; those who do it one year then do it the next , with remarkable predictability . <p> Given that a Labour government next year is at least a serious possibility , some attention is now turning to what we might call Miliband 's Militants -- the scale of the problem that would face Ed Miliband 's whips should he enter Number 10 in 2015 . Minds were especially focused on the Commons rebellion over the welfare cap . George Eaton , in the New Statesman , said : " The size of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of MPs who could be expected to oppose future austerity measures introduced under a Labour government . " <p> In the event , just 13 Labour MPs voted against their party whip . That sounds like nothing to worry about . Well , not quite . For one thing , there were a lot of Labour MPs who found convenient reasons to be absent . Even more importantly , this is opposition . In government the pressure on them to stick to the party line will increase , but so does the responsibility of knowing that it is your votes , and your party , that is implementing any legislation . <h> Labour : toil and trouble <p> The fact is that ever since Labour first came into office in 1924 , the issue of social security has been a running sore between the front and back benches of the party . For example , the largest backbench revolt against the very first Labour government in 1924 was over benefits when almost four out of every ten members of the Parliamentary Labour Party voted against MacDonald 's government over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ percentage of the PLP , this remains the largest-ever rebellion by Labour backbenchers against their government , larger ( in percentage terms ) even than the revolts over Iraq . <p> MacDonald 's second government , between 1929 and 1931 also struggled with the issue of unemployment benefit . The Unemployment Insurance ( No 2 ) Bill , for example , saw repeated rebellions -- the largest seeing 32 Labour MPs support an attempt by Jennie Lee to increase the level of benefit paid to the children of the unemployed from two shillings to five shillings a week . There were also significant rebellions over benefits in 1946 and in 1977 . <p> Of the three issues to see the largest rebellions during the 1997 Parliament , two of them were benefits issues . The issue of lone parent benefit contained in the Social Security Bill triggered the first major Government rebellion of the 1997 Parliament . On that occasion 47 MPs voted against their whips , plus abstentions , and four MPs resigned from the Government . <p> The later Welfare Reform and Pensions Bill triggered a total of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The largest rebellion involved 67 MPs , plus a large number of abstentions . That was the largest revolt against the whip during the 1997 Parliament . The Brown government then saw a rebellion consisting of 30 MPs over the Welfare Reform Bill in 2009 ( along with two other smaller rebellions of 26 and 29 ) . <p> In other words , it is better to see this week 's rebellion not as indicating the scale of any backbench protests against austerity measures introduced under a Labour government , but rather as representing the very minimum number who would do so . Even in opposition , we 've seen Labour backbench rebellions since 2010 consisting of 30-plus and occasionally 40-plus MPs . They go largely unnoticed because the party is in opposition , but that does n't mean they are n't happening . <p> Should Labour return to government after the next election , there will be trouble ahead .

@@2395238 <h> Australia : The test for declaration of Australian infrastructure under third party access legislation is dead - long live the new test ! <p> The Federal Government released the Productivity Commission 's ( PC ) final report ( Report ) on the National Access Regime on 11 February 2014 . The Report proposes yet another test for the controversial ' criterion ( b ) ' . However it is not clear that the new test would have the effect that the PC envisages in circumstances such as those in the Fortescue cases . The Federal Government has said that it will respond to the Report following the upcoming ' root and branch ' review of competition policy . <p> So , you may ask : where is the National Access Regime headed ? How will State based access regimes be affected in the meantime ? <p> Our views in short are : <p> The private test for whether a facility is uneconomical to duplicate ( laid down by the High Court in Fortescue ) will remain law for the foreseeable future . <p> Amending criterion ( b ) in the manner proposed by the PC would : <p> Reintroduce a variant of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Reopen export infrastructure to the possibility of declaration . <p> Many State based access regimes which were imposed pre-Fortescue , under a natural monopoly test , will remain in legal limbo . This may result in : <p> Infrastructure owners seeking review of State based regimes ; <p> States imposing access by fiat rather than under rule of reason declaration criteria . <h> THE NATIONAL ACCESS REGIME <p> The National Access Regime is contained in Part IIIA of the Competition and Consumer Act 2010 ( CCA ) ( previously the Trade Practices Act 1974 ) . <p> The National Access Regime provides a number of mechanisms by which third parties can gain access to certain nationally significant infrastructure facilities . The most notorious of these mechanisms is declaration : <p> If the infrastructure and associated markets meet a number of criteria then the service provided by the infrastructure is ' declared ' ; and <p> If the infrastructure is ' declared ' then an access seeker can force the infrastructure owner into negotiation with recourse to binding arbitration by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission ( ACCC ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the National Access Regime in 2012 in Fortescue ( The Pilbara Infrastructure Pty Ltd v Australian Competition Tribunal 2012 HCA 36 ( 14 September 2012 ) ) . <p> Variants of the declaration mechanism , using very similar criteria , are used in a number of State based access regimes ( and the National Gas Law ) . State based access regimes may be ( and most are ) certified as effective under the National Access Regime . That certification precludes the operation of the declaration mechanism contained in Part IIIA , although a variant of the declaration mechanism in State legislation may still apply . For example , the State based access regime applying to the Queensland coal rail network is certified as effective under the National Access Regime ( and hence can not be declared under Part IIIA ) but is subject to the declaration provisions in the Queensland Competition Authority Act 1997 . <p> Another mechanism in the National Access Regime is for infrastructure owners to give an access undertaking to the ACCC under Div 6 , Part IIIA of the CCA . These are sometimes called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been a Part IIIA undertaking given voluntarily . Rather , these have generally been required under separate legislation ( this is the case for the wheat export undertakings which are required under section 7 of the Wheat Export Marketing Act 2008 ) . <h> A CONTROVERSY - UNECONOMICAL TO DUPLICATE <p> The most controversial aspect of declaration under the National Access Regime is criterion ( b ) . Criterion ( b ) makes access conditional on ( in part ) whether it would be ' uneconomical for anyone to develop another facility to provide the service . ' Competing interpretations of criterion ( b ) go to the heart of one ( often claimed ) intention of the National Access Regime in relation to productive efficiency : is the National Access Regime intended to : <p> If policy option 1 is the intended purpose of the National Access Regime then criterion ( b ) should be a test comparing the costs of meeting demand by sharing the existing facility to the cost of meeting demand by duplicating the facility . <p> If policy option 2 is the intended purpose of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a test of whether it would be profitable for another person to provide duplicate infrastructure . If it is profitable to duplicate then parties , realising that , would make a commercial deal to share if that was profitable ; if it was not profitable to share then duplicate infrastructure would be developed . The underlying intention of policy option 2 is that access should only be given if no potential third party user could profitably develop a duplicate facility . <h> THE REPORT <p> The Federal Government started the PC 's inquiry into the National Access Regime in October 2012 . Following initial public consultation the PC released its draft report in May 2013 . The PC undertook further public consultation before providing its final report to the Federal Government in October 2013 . The Federal Government released the final report on 11 February 2014 . <p> The PC 's key points in its final report are : <p> The National Access Regime should be retained , although some amendments are proposed . <p> Governments considering whether to regulate access should demonstrate that there is a lack of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The ACCC should have the power to direct infrastructure expansions and extensions but this power should be exercised subject to safeguards and ACCC guidelines . <p> The PC proposes two significant changes to the declaration criteria . The first significant change is to criterion ( b ) which the PC proposes should be a variant of a natural monopoly test ( Report , p160 ) . The differences between the PC 's proposed test for criterion ( b ) and the natural monopoly test used by the Competition Tribunal in Fortescue are : that potential demand should be measured by reference to the market demand for infrastructure services rather than demand for the particular facility ; and that coordination costs should be included . <p> The second significant change proposed by the PC is that criterion ( f ) become a full blown net public benefit test . Under the PC 's proposal the public benefit would have to be positively established . This is in contrast to the , negatively framed , criterion ( f ) which requires that access ' would not be contrary to the public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a logical disconnect ? <p> So far so good . However there appears to be a logical disconnect between the PC 's recommendation for amending criterion ( b ) and the PC 's view that the purpose of access regulation is not ' to improve productive efficiency through avoiding wasteful duplication ' of infrastructure ( Report , p86 ) . <p> The PC is at pains to state that the purpose of the National Access Regime is to address a lack of competition ( allocative efficiency ) , rather than productive efficiency that might arise from duplicating infrastructure . In fact the PC approach proposes that access regulation should address competition issues in two distinct notional areas : <p> Markets for infrastructure services where there is an enduring lack of competition due to natural monopoly ; and <p> Markets where competition is dependent on third parties gaining access to the above mentioned infrastructure services . <p> The problem with this approach is that the PC 's proposed change to criterion ( b ) is a test for productive efficiency in the market for infrastructure services . The PC 's proposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of competition for the infrastructure services . <p> The educated reader might respond to this by saying that a test for natural monopoly infrastructure implies that there will be no competition for infrastructure services because it is generally not profitable for anyone to develop a second natural monopoly facility . <p> The problem with that response is that the facts in Fortescue had natural monopoly rail infrastructure that was profitable to duplicate . It was profitable to duplicate because world prices for iron ore were well above the costs of production in the Pilbara ( prices were set by the costs of marginal producers - Pilbara producers are ' inframarginal ' producers ) . This arguably allowed Pilbara producers the luxury of some inefficiency in the form of duplicated natural monopoly infrastructure . <p> The PC is of the firm view that , on facts such as those in Fortescue , access should not be granted . The Report 's ' stylised example ' ( Report at Box 2 , repeated at Box 3.8 ) describes a vertically integrated miner who owns a rail line and produces iron ore where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that access regulation is not warranted in that circumstance . The problem is that it is not clear that the PC 's proposed criterion ( b ) test , a variant of the natural monopoly test , would have stopped access being granted in that case ( see Heydon 's dissenting judgment in Fortescue which would have declared the Hamersley and Robe lines on the basis of a natural monopoly test ) . It is clear however that the private test stopped Fortescue getting access ( see the Fortescue decisions in the Full Court and Tribunal ) . <p> The private test may have its problems as the PC notes ( Report pp157-158 ) . But the PC wants an access regime that picks up natural monopolies but carves out export facilities such as those in the Pilbara and other circumstances where natural monopoly characteristics only mean that duplication would be productively inefficient ( but otherwise profitable ) . The private test neatly achieves that carve out in practice . <p> Perhaps what troubled the PC is that the private test worked in practice but not in theory or that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggest that a better way to achieve that may be to leave criterion ( b ) unchanged ( and carrying the High Court 's private interpretation ) but add its proposed natural monopoly variant as an additional criterion . <h> Criterion ( f ) proposal : a do-all criterion ? <p> We consider that the PC 's proposed full public benefit test for criterion ( f ) has problems . <p> The current criteria apart from criterion ( f ) require benefits of certain kinds ( for example , promotion of a material increase in competition in at least one market ) . Current criterion ( f ) allows a decision maker to check that , in spite of benefits accruing from the other criteria being satisfied , there is not some other matter that will weigh against the public interest . <p> Under the PC 's proposal , criterion ( f ) would become the main game before decision makers . Anyone who has been involved in the full public benefit test elsewhere in the CCA can attest that it is a significant burden for an applicant to bear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ benefits and counter claims . <h> GOVERNMENT RESPONSE <p> The Federal Government 's response to the Report has been to put the National Access Regime on the list of matters to be considered in the upcoming ' root and branch ' review of Australian competition policy . The root and branch review is due to be completed in December 2014 . The Government is , in effect , getting a second opinion and giving itself some further thinking time . <p> This and the Government 's favourable stance toward the big miners suggests that the current private test ( which the big miners favour ) will remain law for the foreseeable future . <h> IMPLICATIONS <p> Given the issues with the Report that we have outlined above we consider that the Government is well advised to take the time and opportunity afforded by the root and branch review to give the National Access Regime some further thought . <p> However in the meantime there are State based access regimes in legal limbo . This is because the High Court 's 2012 ruling that criterion ( b ) is a private @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under State law were declared earlier when criterion ( b ) was interpreted as a natural monopoly test . We consider that some of those facilities would not satisfy the current private test and the owners could seek to have declaration revoked . Putting off a decision on the National Access Regime makes it more likely that some owners will seek revocation of declaration . <p> In addition , the States are likely to want a say in what happens to third party access law in Australia . The National Access Regime was enacted in 1995 following agreement between Federal and State governments ( see clause 6 , Competition Principles Agreement , 1995 ) . The States , particularly Western Australia and Queensland , have taken a close interest in third party access law as it applies in their respective States . Western Australia and Queensland have both sought to impose State based access regimes by executive decision and not subject to prolonged review by the judiciary ( as happened under the National Access Regime in Fortescue ) . Rather than follow the PC 's advice , which would weaken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the States might in future simply impose third party access by fiat rather than the rule of reason , criteria based approach in the National Access Regime ( and currently in State based regimes ) . <p> This publication is intended as a general overview and discussion of the subjects dealt with .

@@2419235 <h> Related coverage <p> Cronulla Sharks winger Beau Ryan has established himself as a popular media figure through his varying comical skits and stunts on the Channel Nine program , The Footy Show . <p> These skits range from awkward interactions with the public in a segment he likes to call ' Beau Knows ' , to the direct parodying of on-field personalities and players in a separate segment known as SBW TV ( the acronym changes depending on the player featured ) . <p> In the latter , Ryan mockingly dresses to the appearance of his target , for the most part a high profile player , and satirises a particular feature of the player . For example , the accent of English front-rower and regular Footy Show panelist Sam Burgess , or the Lebanese mannerisms of his former Wests Tigers teammate Robbie Farah . <p> The skits are largely seen as harmless jibes . There is a mutual feeling of contentedness between these players as they are , in most cases , former teammates or work colleagues . <p> However the complexion of this segment took an easily-identifiable turn for the worse this season when Ryan introduced his new character , Panthers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ premiership winning five-eighth 's reputation as a whinger and sook . <p> The much-maligned Soward is a polarising figure in rugby league . His talent on the field is undeniable , yet there has always been a contingent of fans that have despised what comes along with it . Whether it be his pre-goal kick prancing or his post-match defiant , me-against-the-world mentality in interviews , Soward just has n't clicked with the general viewing audience . <p> Ryan quite shamelessly takes advantage of this and uses Soward 's unwanted tag to further enforce the image of a stereotypical tattle-tail school kid , who loves nothing more than to complain . The cringe-worthy viewing is accompanied by Ryan 's exaggerated lisping and immaturely scrunched up face . <p> It is easy to see why his target is not a fan of the schtick . Ryan is no longer taking harmless jibes . Ryan is attacking character . <p> Is the weekly segment , watched by children and acted out by a popular figure , a mirage that disguises comedy for bullying ? Soward is clearly not a willing participant to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his ill-feelings towards the man who continues to berate him from a tall media platform . He is frustrated with being a common target , not just by fans but by players too . <p> As one of the physically smaller players in the game , when the tensions boil over on the field you would expect Soward to be closer to the sidelines than in the middle of the volcano , but the reality is Soward is a genuine target . He seems to have little choice . <p> In 2008 , when a brawl erupted between Dragon and Storm players in Melbourne , Soward had to fend off the physically imposing Adam Blair , who widely grinned as he pushed around his much smaller adversary . <p> Fast forward to 2013 and Soward is again in the middle of a fracas , this time responding to the taunts of Tigers players and mistakenly retaliates at the wrong player , Tigers ' captain Robbie Farah . An irate Farah measuredly says in the post-match conference he will " leave it on the field " . <p> That was until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pass up . Almost 12 months to the day and it looks as if Farah has gone back onto the SCG surface , picked up the remains of that altercation , and dragged it into his social media life by leaping to the unnecessary defence of his good friend Beau Ryan . <p> This is the same Robbie Farah who lost control of his temper in a studio interview with Fox presenter and former player Matty Johns , swearing on-air and accusing the host of " ambushing " him . The same Robbie Farah who called on the federal government to prevent internet trolling , yet suggested on the very same platform that former Prime Minister Julia Gillard get a noose for her birthday . <p> If the pot has a twitter account , it just called the kettle a sook . <p> This twitter feud is not a good look for the game of rugby league and it could have all been avoided had Ryan stuck to his usual spiel , laughing at his friends , not publicly diminishing the character of a man he and his friends dislike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or intimidate . And for once , it looks like Beau knows exactly what he is doing . <p> How do you know he and his friends dislike Jamie Soward ? I think you are the one not giving Soward the credit to be able to deal with some one taking the piss . I think he has more character than that and has the balls to speak up when he believes some one crosses the line . Finally I think Jamie Soward is more popular and has more public support than the media portray . <p> The way the media portray him is bound to be how he is eventually perceived by the public . There is little more to gage his personality than what we see in the media . You accuse the author of not knowing the facts ( when they seem fairly self-evident by Ryan 's portrayal of the man , and Farah 's reaction to Soward 's interview ) but how do you know that Soward is more popular than the media portrays ? <p> Soward clearly did n't like the segment , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went further than someone just taking the piss . In all honestly , Beau Ryan is about as funny as an arrow throughout the neck , but he does get some awkward laughs at times through his generally harmless parodies . However , the author 's right in saying this goes beyond that with Soward , and it is an attack on character . It 's fine if he feels that way , and he can tell him to Soward 's face all he likes , but channel nine should not let his feelings be broadcast . <p> Honestly , anyone that finds Ryan funny , is virtualy insane or has parts of their brain missing . That Beau TV thing is absolute cringeworthy rubbish . Good call Dragons Forever . All Soward has to do is point to the scoreboard of achievement . He certainly does have an enviable record . <p> To be honest I think beau skits are mainly for the kids . I know a bunch that absoutly eat it up and think they 're hilarious . If anything from those kids I think the skits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the under12s age group cause of beau <p> You are right , it is not a good look and it does border on bullying when you attack somebody 's character . There are so many things he could lampoon without getting a bit personal , I do n't understand why he would pick on Soward . Calling somebody a sook is not nice unless you know the person well and they will laugh with you . Unfortunately , Soward can not take retribution like SBW did with an imposing tackle . It is always good to see a gobshite get their comeuppence . <p> My biggest gripe in all of this is the fact that Farah has decided to get involved . As you stated he is being hypocritical because the way he carries on is nothing short of embarrasing . As for Beay Ryan , he is a media darling that could only dream of accomplishing half the things of the players that he mocks . <p> It was always going to happen , soward has the personality that people love to cut down abit due to things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other week , the chest pumping , the talking in third person .

Australia is made up of over 270 different cultures , speaking more than 260 languages and practising over 100 different faiths . <p> Yet despite this rich cultural diversity , our community sadly has been defined for much of the 20th century by the racist White Australia Policy -- a policy that aimed to bring racially homogenous people here and keep others out . <p> It has taken a long time to shed the ideas from that policy , but unfortunately the changes to the RDA proposed by the federal government risk dragging us back to an ugly time when racism was tolerated in our institutions , practices , in workplaces and on the streets .

The practical impact of this will mean that the green light is given to those who believe their right to free speech will always outweigh the right of someone to exist free of insult and humiliation . The concerns regarding this have been well articulated by many -- namely , that it may create a more hostile culture where bigoted behaviour can lead to social and workplace disharmony . <p> The government 's amendments also propose to introduce protection against vilification on the basis of race , colour , descent or national or ethnic origin . Vilification is an uncertain term , and any proposed protection against vilification arguably does not protect against offence , insult and humiliation on the basis of race .

A person 's national and ethnic origins fall within that same category of characteristics one can not choose . <p> Allowing humiliation of someone on the basis of race is no different to humiliating someone because they were born with a congenital birth condition .

That is , should humiliating someone because of their weight or gender be proscribed by law ? More importantly , should humiliating someone because of their political views be prohibited by legislation ?

Yet , underlying their concern is a fallacial conflation racism and free speech . Racism is quite distinct from free speech . It occurs whether or not free speech exists . It seems to me that racism is more deeply entrenched in societies where free speech is not allowed . Theocracies and dictatorships come readily to mind . In free societies it occurs too , but not because citizens of free societies , who , by definition , enjoy the right to say what they want .

@@2427236 <p> For more than a billion years , plants have had an internal dialogue , and we are just beginning to learn the words . The unusual dialogue occurs between two compartments within plant cells -- the nucleus and the chloroplast . It is a dialogue that continues today , and , according to research just published in Science , it shapes the productivity of plants . <p> All living organisms are made of cells . These cells contain many compartments , a bit like organs in an animal body . Each plant cell contains many chloroplasts , which are responsible for producing energy . <p> A billion years ago , the ancestors of chloroplasts existed as free-living individual cells , able to convert energy from light into sugar . But in a spectacular evolutionary event , these early chloroplasts were consumed by larger cells , where they eventually took up residence , supplying them with sugar . The legacy of that merger is evident around us every day in the green tissues of plants . <p> The fate of every plant cell is inextricably tied to the interaction between chloroplasts and other compartments of the plant cell . The most important of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the home of the genetic material for the plant -- its genome . The genome contains all of the plant 's genes , written in DNA code . Like human beings , plants have tens of thousands of genes in the nucleus . <p> Each gene encodes a specific set of instructions -- a recipe of sorts -- for a particular cell component . The nucleus is like a non-circulating library for all of the plant 's genetic recipes . All the information is there , but it ca n't leave the nucleus to be used elsewhere in the cell . In order to use the information in the recipe library , it has to be transcribed into a different kind of information molecule -- an RNA transcript . The transcript is then transported out of the nucleus , where it is used as instructions to create a particular piece of cellular machinery . <p> Some of the genes in the nucleus are recipes for cellular machinery needed for the chloroplast to do its job -- to undertake photosynthesis . It is important that the nucleus transcribes these genes in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effects the transcription of one in every five plant genes . Intriguingly , some genes are transcribed based on a signal that comes from the chloroplast . The chloroplast informs the nucleus that certain genes need to be transcribed . Signalling from the chloroplast to the nucleus is called retrograde signalling . It has fascinated scientists for decades because the nature of the signal from the chloroplast is unknown . <p> Now this story has become even more intriguing . According to the Science paper , authored by Ezequiel Petrillo at the University of Buenos Aires and colleagues , it seems that this form of signalling from chloroplasts can do more than direct the transcription of genes -- it can also direct modifications of the RNA transcribed from the genes . These transcripts are modified by splicing the RNA , which removes bits of superfluous information from them . Without splicing , most RNAs would n't be able to encode proteins . <p> Petrillo and colleagues found a transcript that is spliced in different ways depending on whether light is present or not , and showed that the switch depended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ encodes part of the cell 's splicing machinery , so the splicing process itself is regulated by a retrograde signal . That means that the effects can be broader than simply this one protein . <p> Whatever signal the chloroplast is producing , it must be able to move not just within the cell but also throughout the plant . If they shone light on the leaves , cells in the roots contained the spliced transcript . If they shone light on roots that do not contain active chloroplasts , the root cells did not contain the spliced transcript . This implies that the signal must travel from other tissues to the roots -- so that the entire plant body is informed that the leaves have perceived light . <p> Finding out what this signal is would help researchers understand more about the process and perhaps exploit it for applications such as engineering plants that work in low light . One hypothesis was that the signal could be the sugars produced by chloroplasts , but that idea was shot down . Sugar-starved plants growing in the dark failed to produce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with sugars did n't restore the splicing . <p> The signal has to be something new . Some have suggested candidate retrograde signals involved in other aspects of chloroplast communication with the nucleus , but we will have to wait for further studies to see if those are involved in the regulation of transcript splicing too . <p> Chloroplasts have resided in cells with a nucleus for about a billion years now . That the chloroplasts have discovered ways of communicating to the nucleus is not entirely surprising . That they communicate using a mechanism that remains a mystery is fascinating . Learning the " words " of their language , such as the retrograde signal for splicing , will provide illuminating discoveries for the coming years .

This is the displacement of ' victor mentality ' into ' aggrieved victimhood ' , dwelling on historical injustice . Hypernationalism has replaced ideology . It goes beyond patriotism and exceptionalism ; it is hatred of ' the Other ' , something regrettably all too common in Asia . <p> Chinese strategic philosophy values offensive realism as much as , or even more than , the US and USSR .

Rather than bait China , we should embrace it and help it celebrate its revival by acknowledging it as a winner ( a ' responsible stakeholder ' ) with legitimate interests and painful memories . <p> This is the liberal argument for engagement : allowing greater Chinese emigration and investment , and reducing barriers ( while protecting mutually sensitive sectors , obviously ) , so that Chinese people view the world as open and welcoming . For example , would n't China act differently if there were 50 million ethnic Chinese living and prospering in the West ? <p> But as Mearsheimer would immediately recognise , this effort will be complicated by the rise of other Asian nationalist leaders , with their own agendas quite separate from the US interest . It would be a disaster if Japan , long a champion of the liberal international project , chose this very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ India headed ? <p> Another possibility is that Chinese hypernationalism ' is n't about us , it 's about them ' . In other words , although it is manifested as anger at foreigners , it may be essentially a domestic debate aimed at establishing nationalist credibility within a complex factional political system . <p> There are two sides to this argument . The first is that it 's essentially benign , and the second that it 's , well , not . The benign view is that hypernationalism is just harmless antics , a tirade for domestic audiences , and will burn itself out . The less friendly view is that no matter what foreigners do , there 's no pleasing China . And there is nothing that , say , a balancing coalition of ' reasonable ' states could do to assuage a bellicose dragon state . More than a few American realists thus think the ball is basically in Beijing 's imperial court now ; the burden for China 's peaceful rise rests largely on its own shoulders . <p> Mearsheimer also addresses the issue of economic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mutual vulnerability ' is well known to historians . For example , in the late 19th century , the British political-industrial establishment understood very well that Germany was overtaking it in both power and prowess , yet chose to continue to trade with Germany because it needed Germany 's specialised manufactured goods . More importantly , London recognised that Germany would compete hard to find alternative customers for its wares overseas , so a British-led boycott-embargo was essentially futile ; in hurting Germany , it might actually inflict more economic pain on Britain 's own commerce . <p> It does not require great imagination to see the parallels today in the US and China . Economic ' containment ' would be devastatingly costly for both sides , yet as Mearsheimer points out , it is unfortunately quite feasible because states ( or governments ) ' will always value security over prosperity , because without security there can be no prosperity ' . <p> There is , however , one additional variation of the economic coercion theme that Australians should ponder : one-way or asymmetric vulnerability . If one state needs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ potential for outright coercion . Coercion in the realist sense need not mean military threats ; political suasion might suffice . <p> Consider for example New Zealand 's extreme dependence on China for dairy product exports . It is said in Hong Kong that 80% of Chinese infant formula imports come from New Zealand , and 80% of those are from Fonterra . Prima facie , it might seem that Fonterra has great sway over the People 's Republic of China ! <p> In fact , the very opposite is the case . When there is a milk safety scare , not only the CEO of Fonterra but the prime minister of New Zealand must get on the next jet to Beijing to attend to the matter . Mearsheimer would surely delight in such delicate exhibitions of power politics . To be sure , assuring important customers about product quality is simply good business . So too is diversification . But try as Fonterra might , there is no substituting the giant Chinese market for infant milk formula . The potential for coercion clearly exists , and anyone who doubts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fine spring . We should not be surprised if some New Zealand interests vocalise against joining any future ' balancing coalition ' directed at China . <p> Mearsheimer would recognise New Zealand 's dilemma : China is a hegemon in the sense that , perhaps short of all-out war , Beijing will become sufficiently influential to compel its neighbours and partners to its will . <p> Finally , a word on worst-case scenarios . Mearsheimer is a professor of international relations , not a Marines Corps commander . But he understands well the nature of violent military conflict . The original The Tragedy of Great Power Politics is a sober history of long , agonising wars , gangrene , disease and starvation . The remarkable Prussian blitzkrieg-style advance on Paris in 1870-71 was about the nearest thing we got to a ' short , sharp war ' between great powers . I use that term in speech marks because there is a general worry , recently expressed , that China 's strategic culture values first-strike advantage ( also known in military terms as ' initiative ' ) as a means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mearsheimer and others have noted , this is a risky gamble , especially when facing down great powers with vast strategic depth and resources . China , Russia and the US are three examples of countries that you would n't bet on backing down with a whimper . <p> Mearsheimer and other realists have asked whether nuclear weapons have somehow changed the essential nature of great-state relations . The general conclusion is that they have not . <p> What nuclear weapons do , however , is raise the risk and consequences of rapid escalation . No sane leader would wish to be in a nuclear-on-nuclear stare-down with minutes running down on the clock . Therefore , given the great annoyance that China must feel at the prospect of being surrounded on several sides , and the emotions which can whip up the Chinese public , it behooves the US and its allies to construct a defence arrangement that is the least provocative it can be . This is more easily said than done ; security is a relative concept and one man 's defence may look to his adversary like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ design a doctrine of deliberate , slow , defensive and non-military escalation using diplomacy , time and strategic depth to avoid making hasty choices they 'll later regret . <p> That is my lesson from Mearsheimer 's book . <p> Air Sea Battle ( ASB ) is confidential and I do n't know what it contains ( it may all be bluff ) but it hints at ' suppression ' , which is mil-speak for taking out enemy stuff proactively . That is not a recipe for strategic reassurance . <p> There were a couple of telling exchanges during US Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel 's recent visit to China . The Chinese defence chief Chang Wanquan told him that ' China can never be contained ' , a statement that is true to a large degree . Containment , a word Mearsheimer uses repeatedly , is a red flag to Beijing . I recommend in future we use the word ' constraint ' . Every great power must be constrained , and all can surely agree that is a good thing . To this day , many Europeans ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not more effectively constrained and dissuaded Washington from its mad Iraq misadventure in the last decade . <p> Last week , China 's Washington ambassador Cui Tiankai warned against forming an ' Asian NATO ' . Alas , Mearsheimer ( and Luttwak too ) insists that balancing coalitions are inevitable in response to unbalanced multi-polarity , as will likely arise in Asia . Mearsheimer 's specific concern is not that an Asian NATO would irritate China ( it most certainly would ) , but that it would be much less effective than the European variety because of Asia 's much greater cultural and geographic distances and diffusion . He does not name names , but he recognises that certain Asian states are likely to bandwagon with an assertive China , while other more independent and pricklier ones will be keener to join the balancing coalition . Given their very prickliness , he doubts they will remain cohesive enough to face a China-centric bloc . <p> Mearsheimer has written a stark and provocative essay which is deeply pessimistic .

Party oracles all seem to conclude that giving the ordinary citizen more power to select candidates should act as an important incentive for becoming a party member . <p> For the Victorian branch of the Liberal Party , the very American party notion of having caucuses and conventions has become a model for the pre-selection process .

Their choice is the one that actually decides which of the major parties governs the country . <p> Swinging voters are pragmatic in that they see politics not as a battle of philosophies or ideology , but as a question of which party is most likely to deliver services without raising taxes , and which is unified enough to at least give the semblance of order and stability .

The religious feast of Easter draws on the natural cycle of death and rebirth but elevates it into a cosmological story with profound implications for each of us .

It institutionalises the planning , procedures and training that keep safety always in mind . <h> Who audits the auditor 's auditor ? <p> Much has happened , indeed .

Its predecessor agency was starved of funds for years while operators pushed the offshore frontier into deep water , and the new bureau too lacks the experienced , professional and technical staff it needs to oversee offshore operations . Its own website acknowledges that the agency must undergo a total human capital transformation before it can perform its tasks adequately . <p> This means that in many ways , the leading role in new safety measures in the Gulf has been taken by the Center for Offshore Safety ( COS ) , a body created by the large operators in the Gulf in early 2011 . Its stated mission is to " promote the highest level of safety " for offshore operations through " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of the API petroleum industry trade association , which also , of course , lobbies for lower taxes and less regulation . <p> The Center for Offshore Safety aims to improve the industry 's safety record by helping members develop those new safety programs and by building a process for auditors to rigorously assess them .

It is worth noting that the data and analysis are the property of the industry association and may not be released to the public without its approval . <p> James Watson , the first director of the government regulatory bureau , characterised this new offshore safety regime as " an operator-driven safety program with BSEE oversight " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use in the US today is almost wholly a construct of the offshore industry itself .

The system can be simultaneously criticised for allowing too much industry self-regulation and for allowing operators to outsource their safety audits to third-party consultants rather than developing their own capability to do it alongside an embedded safety culture . <h> Steep learning curve <p> The toddler-aged government regulator does not pay for the audits and does not have to hire or retrain personnel to conduct them .

Suppose an offshore deepwater operator receives a prized safety certificate from the industry-run Center for Offshore Safety as a sort of " Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval " . Suppose , then , that this operator suffers an incident like the Deepwater Horizon blowout . Will the COS be in the hot seat at Congressional hearings as the dominant player in the offshore safety regime ? Or will the government bureau be faulted as having allowed regulation to be outsourced to the industry 's own body and to third-party companies ?

@@2446232 <p> A major review of homeopathy in Australia could lead to stricter industry regulation and changes to private health insurance coverage of homeopathic treatments . <p> The investigation by Australia 's top health research body , the National Health and Medical Research Council , has found no reliable scientific evidence to support claims that homeopathic remedies are effective in treating medical conditions . <p> Kristina Kukolja reports . <p> The philosophy of homeopathy can be traced back to the late 18th Century and a German physician , Christian Hahnemann . <p> He advanced the principle of ' like cures like ' , with diluted solutions used to treat symptoms that in an undiluted form they would cause . <p> Remedies can be sourced from mineral , herbal , animal and synthetic origins . <p> In Australia , homeopathy is classified as a form of complementary and alternative medicine , as are the chiropractic profession , Chinese medicine , yoga and pilates . <p> The first systematic review of homeopathy in Australia by the National Health and Research Council concludes there 's no reliable scientific evidence of the efficacy of homeopathy in the treatment of clinical conditions . <p> The Australian Homeopathic Association disagreed with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't considered . <p> Spokeswoman Anna Lamaro says some of the Association 's other submissions were also overlooked . <p> " The veterinary studies with homeopathic medicine , 56 of which were strongly supportive of the efficacy of homeopathy . Neither did they look at the laboratory studies . Both the veterinary studies and the lab studies are great because they are placebo-free zones , really . And the evidence is strongly there that there is an effect gained on a physiological level from homeopathic dilutions . They also chose not to look at observational studies . Now , that is the lowest level of evidence . However , there are very large observational studies from homeopathic outpatient hospitals in Europe and the United Kingdom . " <p> For a majority of them , the results of controlled clinical trials were examined . <p> It says many of the available primary studies it encountered were poorly designed , conducted and reported . <p> President of the Australian Medical Association , Steve Hambleton , says not all research is admissible . <p> " Observational studies might be a reason to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is cause and effect . What you really want to do is actually look , in particular , at the double-blind randomised control trials where you truly get rid of bias and you can truly test something against the placebo to see whether there is any difference to placebo treatment . That 's where the NHMRC has gone . We hear lots of testimonials which peoples say , I tried it and it works for me . Sometimes there 's a string of testimonials none of which are credible scientific evidence . When we look at animal studies , just because it works in a rat or another non-human animal does n't necessarily mean it 'll work in a human . " <p> The World Health Organization has recognised homeopathy as one of the fastest-growing complementary and alternative medicines around the world . <p> But it cautions that some materials used in homeopathic formulations could constitute potential safety hazards . <p> It also warns that homeopathic solutions should not be used to treat serious diseases , including H-I-V and malaria . <p> In 2010 , the British House of Commons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more effective than a placebo , and urged the National Health Service to stop funding homeopathy . <p> Bond University 's Professor Paul Glasziou is the Chair of the federal government 's Homeopathy Working Committee , which conducted the Australian investigation . <p> He says there 's concern some people may be replacing proven medical treatments with homeopathic ones , meaning that they 're not getting the appropriate health care they need and are also wasting their money . <p> " Speaking to general practitioner colleagues , I know of their concern about patients who are on the poverty borderline , but who are spending money for -- for example -- disabled children on homeopathic remedies . So , they 're spending parts of the little amounts of cash that they have to purchase these remedies which appear to be ineffective . " <p> The Australian Homeopathic Association says there are up to 600 practitioners in Australia registered with the Australian Register of Homeopaths , an industry self-regulation body . <p> It says more are practising , and around one-million Australians are estimated to be consumers of homeopathic treatments . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the industry in Australia is not actually known . <p> " This is what triggered this particular report as part of a wider concern that the NHMRC had about the increase in alternative and complementary medicine . I think it 's now up to around $3.5 billion a year across the whole industry being spent . There are some effective complementary medicines , but in general a lot of things both in orthodox medicine and in complementary medicine do n't work . In orthodox medicine there are routine research approaches and regulations that sift out these ineffective approaches , whereas that has n't happened to anywhere near the same extent in complementary and alternative medicines . " <p> Dr Jing Jing Yu is a Chinese medicine practitioner based in Melbourne , who has also practised in China . <p> Dr Jing has a Bachelor of Applied Science in Chinese Medicine and Human Biology . <p> Like medical and dental practitioners , pharmacists , nurses and psychologists , she is regulated by the federal government 's Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency . <p> In order to retain her accreditation as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ association -- in her case the Federation of Chinese Medicine Associations -- and undergo continued professional development . <p> These statutory standards are not required for practising homeopathy in Australia . <p> Dr Jing argues that Chinese medicine is more credible than homeopathy . <p> " Chinese medicine , from what I believe , there 's a lot more credibility . If you go to China , for example , it is part of mainstream healthcare . There are a lot of herbs that can benefit a lot of conditions ; but having said that it is always about the patients ' health status . Everything is prescribed according to what the patient needs at that certain time . From what I understand , especially in the field of acupuncture , there 's been a lot of scientific evidence that proves a lot of effectiveness in treating pain and a lot of other chronic illnesses . " <p> Professor Paul Glasziou agrees that some Chinese medicine has been shown to be effective , but he says alternative medicines do n't undergo rigorous testing . <p> " Taking the Chinese herbs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ malaria treatment and has been shown in controlled trials to be effective , and is on the World Health Organization 's list of things to use . There are things we 've got out of herbs in the past . Digoxin came out of foxglove , for example , and quinine is another example of something that 's grown out of herbal medicine . But I would say , by and large , most things do n't work and we need to screen out and evaluate all of these things to find out the small proportion that do and keep them in our therapeutic armamentarium . " <p> Chinese medicinal products are regulated by the Therapeutic Goods Administration . <p> That 's not necessarily the case for all homeopathic preparations . <p> The AMA 's Steve Hambleton says the homeopathy industry in Australia is inadequately regulated . <p> " Unconventional therapies are very poorly regulated in reality . We have health practitioners now fully registered . Chinese medicine practitioners are now fully registered . There are minimum standards to be reached . There is a board whose job it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't do what the wider body of the profession believes is reasonable . The unregulated industries are very broad . We 've got multiple forms of unconventional therapy for which there is very little credible evidence . Unless they 're making outrageous claims those industries are clearly very successful . " <p> Professor Paul Glasziou agrees that stricter regulation of the homeopathy industry is needed , both for practitioners and the labelling of products they promote . <p> He also says private health insurance companies should make changes to their policies that offer reimbursement for homeopathic treatments . <p> " Let 's start with the private health insurers . I think , either removing them or making it easier for people to have options that do n't include ineffective treatments would be a good thing for both them and the consumers of that private health insurance . I would like to see the evaluation that the NHMRC has done for homeopathy extended to other areas of complementary and alternative medicine . I 'd like consumers , in particular , to be a little more wary and sceptical of claims about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ review , the impact of traditional homeopathy .

Although it seemed an act of political posturing by vilifying academics , the now-Coalition government was merely tapping into an existing view of the university sector within Australian society . <p> This view is that academia is out of touch with the taxpayers it services . <p> Which it is . Not because scholarship can sometimes appear to be esoteric or arcane , but because scholars often fail to make the effort to argue why it is otherwise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regard the public as a research partner worthy of our attention and our respect . <p> In defence of academics , the barriers that prevent scholars from adding value to where it really matters are not of our making ... not quite . <p> Australia has national research priorities and associated goals set by the government . These range from investigating social well-being to improving cyber security , from lifting manufacturing productivity to understanding cultural and economic change in our region . But how this research is disseminated and " counted " is at odds with public expectations of access and engagement . <h> Talking to ourselves <p> The university sector is about to enter the 2015 round of the Excellence in Research Australia ( ERA ) initiative . Under ERA , the dissemination of research via monographs , book chapters , peer-reviewed journal articles and peer-reviewed conference papers is tightly linked to a points system in which these traditional modes of publication " count " . Called " outputs " , monographs are worth 5 points each and everything else 1 point . <p> These are the metrics by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ academy are weighed . Academic careers grow or wither under this points system . As a result , the printed book and peer-reviewed journal article remain the exemplars of published research and the currency of scholarly accreditation and promotion . This system is bluntly characterised as the " publish or perish " dimension of academic workloads . <p> This fixation on forms of publication that pre-date the internet helps maintain the widespread perception of scholarship as dry and aloof . The target audience of these outputs is usually other scholars ( who increasingly have little or no time to absorb colleagues ' work ) , not the public . <p> Awareness is growing of the need to move into new modes of engagement that are more available to modern society . But how do academics engage with new and emergent forms of interaction when the goalposts set by evaluation systems like the ERA value monographs and journal articles most highly ? <p> Granted , the " publish or perish " imperative is giving way to " be visible or vanish " . But even this is perhaps too self-interested , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fashion that will restore academia . For sure , this has led to the consideration of alternative ways to evaluate scholarship in the public domain . These range from counting actual downloads of a journal article ( if it 's open access ) to " hits " or " page views " of an online exhibition . <p> Yet in some ways this only modifies the units for measuring impact without really questioning the underlying premise of impact . Be it citations or eyeballs , these are more suited to grant applications and keeping your job than truly opening up a dialogue with the public . <p> Under this model , traditional forms of publication " count " . Tweeting , blogging , teaching , media appearances , public lectures , community forums and the convening of other non-print-based outcomes -- all of which require a lot of commitment to develop , curate and present -- rarely do , or require supporting evidence to count towards a research component . <p> As with live performances , exhibitions and reports to government bodies , most things digital are also considered " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ justify why they should be " counted " . <h> Catching up with the community <p> In an age where searching for tutorials on YouTube and information in Wikipedia is second-nature to young inquiring minds , casting digital outputs as " non-traditional " is out of sync with society . <p> The division of research into traditional and non-traditional is also at odds with community engagement . While most education institutions see their role as servicing and advancing Australian society , the forms of evaluation used to rank Australian university subjects can work against fulfilling this goal . <p> New forms of recognised outputs and outcomes are required to change the relationship and to renew scholarship as an important part of public discussion . Moreover , scholars need to be able to present research in ways that are meaningful to society and at the same time also count for their institutions . Engaging public audiences alongside academic audiences need to be core competencies with equal footing . <p> To date , these goals have been mutually exclusive . By not using and valuing the forms of communication and knowledge-sharing that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actively contributed to the growing sense of irrelevance that stalks academia . <p> As long as our goalposts value talking to each other over and above talking with the community , we remain the primary agents of our own marginalisation . 
@@2446234 <h> How Your Superannuation is at the Mercy of the Government <p> The Reserve Bank of Australia is worried about getting caught financing a house price bubble . It 's shifted the policy stance on interest rates to ' neutral ' . That supposedly reduces the chances of further rate cuts in the foreseeable future . <p> The future is n't foreseeable of course . So the central bankers just mistake the past for the future . Inflation and other economic indicators rose recently , reducing the need for future interest rate cuts . ( Most people consider inflation to be a bad thing , but if you 're a central banker , it 's your job to create it . ) <p> Foreseeing a different future from the same past , Joe Hockey did n't appreciate the RBA 's policy change : ' The central bank has been informed directly of Treasurer Joe Hockey 's displeasure ' , reports the Australian Financial Review . <p> The Treasury is worried about the Australian dollar , which is surging lately . That squeezes exporter 's profits , which kills jobs , which kills votes . ( The fact that importers make more money and hire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to both a high Aussie dollar and absurd house prices is of course a recession . But you 'd be burned at the stake for saying it . By the way , we 've discovered an early warning signal for when a housing bubble-triggered recession will hit Australia in The Money for Life Letter . More on that next week . <p> Any recession would sink the Aussie dollar . But we doubt it was what Treasurer Joe Hockey had in mind . It 's funny how a strong currency used to be seen as a good thing . Everyone complained about how high the Deutschmark was and envied the Germans for it . Now economics says a high currency is a bad thing . <p> So what 's changed ? Perhaps it has something to do with the relative importance of jobs and consumption . In the end , human action as far as economics is concerned is about consumption . You wake up and go to work to put food on the table . You save and invest so that you can consume in the future . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was literally a matter of putting food on the table . A strong currency meant more consumption for the same dollar . Going by the good old economics books , it meant more wine from Portugal , cheese from France and silk from China . <p> Today , consumption is all about signing up for the pre-approved credit card in your mailbox . There is no immediate constraint to consumption in a world of fiat money and unlimited credit . What 's important is finding the job that allows you to pay it off . Jobs , not currency strength , have become the key to consumption . Politicians understand this , so they listen to the economists who promise job creation . One of their crackpot theories says that a devalued currency will spur exports and create jobs . <p> So now a lower currency is better , which is why politicians and central bankers turn to inflation , the corollary of currency devaluation . <p> As we love to mention , all this manipulation has side effects . Only a few understand them . And one man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your investments eventually . <p> Then there 's the fact that the currency reacts to the economy , not just the other way around . Perhaps the high Australian dollar reflects our prosperity instead of interfering with it . <p> At least the two arms of government -- the monetary and the fiscal -- are at odds with each other . It keeps them from conspiring against you . <p> We spoke too soon . The Australian Institute has put out some research comparing the fiscal drag of the pension versus Superannuation tax concessions . In other words , how much the pension costs the government in terms of outflows versus how much Super 's 15% tax rate costs it in terms of lost tax revenue . <p> The conclusion is that Super tax concessions will soon cost the government more in lost revenue than the pension will in spending . <p> The great thing about this research is how everyone can see their favourite topic of discussion woven into it . Everyone can argue and debate all day long without any sort of prospect for resolution or compromise , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For the fiscal conservative , the debate is all about the budget surplus . Debt is bad , as Europe is demonstrating . Some fiscal conservatives say increased taxes or reduced tax concessions will solve the problem by generating more revenue and less outflows . Others say reduced taxes and increased concessions will increase prosperity and tax revenue in the long run . It 's the same contradictory views on the government spending side . Sometimes spending money costs money . Sometimes it creates more prosperity than it costs . Not to mention the inherent contradiction in the words ' fiscal conservative ' . <p> For the Marxist , the super and pension debate is all about inequality . Super tax concessions overwhelmingly favour the rich . Richard Denniss in The Australian Financial Review sums up the data : ' Treasury also estimates that about 30 per cent of the benefit of Super tax concessions goes to the top 5 per cent of income earners . Indeed , the top 1 per cent of income earners gets three times as much benefit in the form of their superannuation tax concessions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' <p> Yes , paying a high rate of tax on your income means you get a bigger break when you pay an equal rate of tax as everyone else . In other words , equal tax rates are ' inequitable ' . Hmm . <p> We also have to wonder how many peoples ' pensions those top 1% of income earners support with their income tax . <p> For us the pension and Superannuation crisis is all about demographics and ageing . It does n't really matter terribly much what government policy will be . Whether the baby boomers crash financial markets by selling all their assets without enough people to buy them , or bankrupt the government by relying on pensions without enough taxpayers , or both , we 're in trouble either way . <p> Here 's the interesting bit from Denniss ' article : ' Every $1 billion extra we spend on tax concessions for super saves less than $200 million off the age pension budget . ' We 're not sure about tax concessions being ' spendable ' . And it 's impossible to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' counterfactual ' -- what would 've happened without the super system . But it is obvious you wo n't recoup savings in the age pension by letting people save in super . After all , it 's part of a financial advisor 's training to ensure their client somehow receives pension funds . <p> What seems to get lost is that it 's all the meddling which created the problem in the first place . First the problem was a lack of retirement savings pushing the pension costs too high . The solution was to create the Superannuation system . Now the problem is the loss of tax revenue in Super . So the politicians will have to solve the new problem their last solution created . And then they 'll need a new solution for that problem . This is why the politicians and their bureaucrats are the only ones who consistently win in the end . <p> But at some point , all the government 's solutions and problems begin to dominate the rest of the economy . With a shrinking pie , it 's no surprise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want money from the rich . The rich want to make more money but have to turn to crony methods . The politicians are the intermediary , taxing and creating crony businesses like the Super industry . <p> The only real solution is to stop the government from solving problems . Or come up with your own solutions . <p> For now , we 're stuck with the Super system and the pension . And at the mercy of those governing them . As the Retirement Panel Discussion at World War D showed nicely , this leaves us all with tough decisions . <p> But the predictions and questions which came up at the panel have become relevant faster than any of us expected . The politicians are about to stage a raid on your Super . The journalists are testing the water with Marxist and fiscal conservative arguments .

@@2446239 <h> The O'Farrell legacy : a new model of government in NSW <p> David Clune , NSW Parliament 's historian and an honorary associate in Sydney University 's Department of Government and International Relations , assesses a premiership cut short for Inside Story . <p> Not long after Barry O'Farrell ( pictured ) won government , his predecessor as Liberal premier of New South Wales , Nick Greiner , made what now seems like an ironic comment . " Barry 's Barry , he 's not Nick , he 's not Jeff , " he said , referring to himself and former Victorian premier Jeff Kennett . " He has a more measured approach which is likely to lead to him being premier for a lot longer than Jeff Kennett or myself . " In fact , while Greiner was premier for four years and three months , O'Farrell lasted barely three years . <p> The irony does n't end there . Greiner was often compared unfavourably to O'Farrell in terms of political nous . He was much criticised for his performance before the Independent Commission Against Corruption during the Metherell affair , when he responded to questions with " I do n't recall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I do n't recall " at ICAC last week he would still be premier . <p> Yet O'Farrell is likely to leave behind a greater legacy than Greiner . Greiner 's big victory in the 1988 election melted like early snow . Within three years he was in minority government , and his successor John Fahey lost the 1995 election . A whole generation of talented Coalition ministers faded out of politics and Labor governed for the next sixteen years . Greiner certainly changed the nature of NSW politics with his introduction of the economic policies of what was then called the New Right and a new style of public management . His great failing , however , was that he did not take the voters along with him . The political costs of the Greiner era left many people reform-shy . <p> The O'Farrell model emphasised careful planning and avoidance of hasty , politically motivated decisions . Inquiries and consultation processes were set up in areas where major reforms were intended . O'Farrell said that he aimed to deliver " stable , mainstream , competent government " . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ list . Of his first nine months in office , he said : <p> " I think we 've made a reasonable start to what is clearly supposed to be a long innings . This is not a job that goes for one year or two years ... We 're determined not to make short-term decisions because we know that 's been the problem of the last 16 years . " <p> A NSW business group accurately summed up the O'Farrell attitude to reform as a " boa constrictor approach ... A small amount of change , people get used to it , then more change and more change ... The Kennett approach ... was everything at once and people not coping . " O'Farrell 's caution was not a sign of indecision or weakness . As Imre Salusinszky wrote in The Australian : " Nobody should ever take Barry O'Farrell 's genial manner as indicating a lack of political cunning or ruthlessness . " <p> Caution did not mean the O'Farrell government was an achievement-free zone . O'Farrell 's strategy was to seek re-election on the basis of achievements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ program to free up funds for infrastructure became a model for the Abbott government . The privatisation of Ports Botany and Kembla demonstrated that there was a big demand for long-life , low-risk assets . Legislation was passed to sell the state 's electricity generators . The O'Farrell budgets reduced the deficit and finally brought recurrent expenditure under control -- something that Labor had always promised but never achieved . The government delivered a light rail extension in Sydney , actually started construction on the long-promised northwest rail link and committed to the WestConnex Motorway , a $13 billion toll road and urban renewal project linking Sydney 's west with the airport and Port Botany . <p> The government also released a State Infrastructure Strategy and a Long Term Transport Master Plan . O'Farrell described them as comprehensive , long-term plans that took " the politics out of government spending " . A Public Service Commission was established to depoliticise the public sector and new legislation passed to update and rationalise the framework for public sector employment .

Election funding laws were reformed to ban political donations from associations or corporations , though the legislation was struck down by the High Court in December on the grounds that it restricted freedom of political communication . <p> At the end of his premiership , O'Farrell was completely dominant in the government and Liberal Party . A pragmatic centrist , he had gained broad cross-factional support and established an excellent working relationship with the Nationals . Dissidents in the Liberal party room , centred on former minister Chris Hartcher , were firmly under control . <p> Perhaps he was too honest for his won good although some will say he was too good too good to be honest . Alas it is those like Obeid and the labor party or liberal party members who have the support and dirty politics to bring down their enemies . I guess that is politics .

@@2479231 <p> The Subaru Forester has morphed from a lifted , high-clearance wagon to something of a serious off roader in recent years -- especially in base specification as tested here . The steel wheels and no frills exterior trim on this 2014 Subaru Forester indicate a level of capability that is more go than show . Pricing for this base model automatic starts at an impressive $32,990 . <p> The boxer engine remains ( 2.5-litres if you desire an auto , or 2.0-litres with a manual transmission ) and Subaru 's legendary all wheel drive formula remains key to the Forester 's appeal . If the manual is more to your taste , you can net the entry-level model for $29,990 . Strangely though , you ca n't mix and match those two engines and transmissions , which is not the end of the world , but strange regardless . <p> Fuel efficiency is n't especially impressive for the class -- the ADR claim is 8.1-litres/100km . On test over a 200km largely city loop it returned 10.1-litres/100km -- impressively close to the ADR claim in real world terms , it has to be said . <p> Despite the relatively cheap entry price , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equipped . Standard equipment includes Bluetooth phone and audio connectivity , automatic dual-zone air-conditioning , reverse-view camera , DataDot theft detection and , crucially for anyone travelling longer distances into remote areas , a full size spare , something that should be mandatory for any vehicle claiming to be an SUV in Australia . <p> As we 've come to expect from the brand , the 2014 Subaru Forester 2.5i auto gets the full five-star ANCAP safety rating thanks to Subaru 's commitment to safety and the inclusion of seven airbags as standard equipment across the range . Extensive use of aluminium has dropped overall weight down but also assisted in creating a more rigid body structure that adds to the safety equation . <p> The Bluetooth connection was easy to set up , and reliable . The audio streaming was clear and did n't lose connection , and the major phone controls were easy to decipher . Likewise the high-mounted reverse-view camera , which was crystal clear and extremely handy negotiating tight , city parking spaces , not to mention safe . <p> Our test model came equipped with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only managed to hitch up a lightweight box trailer for a short run , but the camera made lining the trailer up an absolute cinch . <p> As you 'd expect of a base model car , the interior is rather plain and a little austere , but it 's comfortable even over longer distances . The front seats especially are well contoured and comfortable for drivers of all shapes and sizes and the cabin is nicely insulated up to freeway speeds . The curved plastics can feel a little harsh , but the general interior design is attractive . Base specification Forester gets a fairly rudimentary audio system , but retains the steering wheel mounted control functionality . <p> Visibility is excellent from the driver 's seat . Entry and egress is also just about perfect thanks to the combination of ride and seat height . Looking forward through the windscreen , the A-pillars do n't get in the way around town as you negotiate tight streets , and the view aft is obviously assisted by the rear vision camera . Auto repeat blinkers are something we 've almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this shortcoming given the price . <p> The new Subaru Forester is slightly larger than the outgoing model , with a 35mm gain in overall length , and a wheelbase that has stretched by 25mm . The Forester 's cabin has always felt capacious , but its even more the case now with plenty of legroom in the second row regardless of how long legged the front seat drivers are . The low load height and flat floor in the luggage space was especially appreciated , plenty of luggage could fit into the space , while the retractable cover keeps your gear hidden from prying eyes . The rear seats fold forward easily too , with levers on each side well within reach . <p> Under the bonnet , the 2.5-litre engine powering our test car is nowhere near as high tech as the higher specification , turbocharged XT model with direct injection . Conventional multi-point injection might hurt the fuel consumption a little , but 126kW at 5800rpm and 235Nm at 4100rpm is more than enough to get the Forester up to speed and keep it there without the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many nasty noises . Speaking of which , the CVT backing the Forester 's petrol engine is one of the smoothest and least intrusive we 've experienced over the past few years . <p> Stop-start technology is standard on all automatic models . Often an annoying and laggy addition to an otherwise smooth driving experience , Subaru 's stop/start works well in the Forester and it certainly helps keep the fuel usage lower than it otherwise would be . <p> Buyers considering this entry-level end of the medium SUV segment wo n't be looking for a sports-car feel . With that in mind , the 2014 Subaru Forester 2.5i Auto handles daily driving duties around town with ease . <p> The combination of 17-inch steel wheels and high profile rubber work together absorb ugly road surfaces with comfort and composure . Hit the freeway and get up to speed and there 's no intrusive road noise , tyre roar or tramlining to worry about either . You will notice some noise over really rough roads -- such as corrugated dirt for example -- but that wo n't be an issue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ function dubbed X-Mode can also be engaged via a console-mounted switch and helps the driver stay in control on loose , scrabbly surfaces up to 40km/h . It 's not a ' proper ' 4WD system by any means , but it does make more difficult off road driving a little easier for the less experienced driver . Take into account the full sized spare on board , and the base specification Forester is perfectly suited to family weekends traversing national parks and heading off road onto fire trails and non-threatening dirt roads . <p> Australia has had a long running love affair with the Subaru Forester that does n't really look to be set to change anytime soon . This fourth generation model does n't shift the goalposts as such , certainly not within the class . What it does is improve on a tried and tested formula by offering a spacious and comfortable cabin , a solid driving experience both on road and off , and sharp pricing . <p> For the family buyer looking for a robust soft roader on a budget , the new Forester definitely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gets the 2.5 with manual but not here . We just get a 2.0 manual . Very odd . <p> I own one of these and it certainly grows on you . Initial concerns about the CVT gearbox have been unfounded . Its always in the right gear and ready to supply power , it just gets on with the job in a way that makes you forget its there . The next model up gets flappy paddles on the steering wheel and 6 pre-set ratios . <p> My only negative observation would be the suspensions low speed ( 25-50km ) sensitivity to bumps . You do feel the car bounce and move around over bumps a fair bit . This effect seems to go away at speeds over 60km an hour . <p> The trade off is great handling at any speed for a car this big . <p> Roxas <p> We also own one of these .

The site 's pledge to plant a tree for every 100 " Big Dick " videos viewed was covered by everyone from AdWeek to Time , The Independent to Mashable . <p> Much more importantly however , Pornhub 's campaign spread across blogs and sites such as Reddit . A quick search brings up a further 100,000 different results . And then you have instant messaging , WhatsApp , SnapChat and so on . Clearly , the tree campaign has reached a lot of Pornhub 's core client base . <p> This is corporate social responsibility for a jaded digital age . It is also unashamedly a marketing campaign . <p> Pornhub is a big deal . The site is ranked 83rd most popular in the world , just behind HuffingtonPost.com ( which of course also covered the tree campaign ) , and its business model is largely based upon onsite advertising . Many of the articles reporting the campaign have presented the concept as an " easy " way of giving or being charitable . After all , viewing a video costs nothing more than a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visitors will stick around , clicking through to its advertisers and , as a result , generate new income . <p> In any case a tree planting campaign is a very light form of corporate social responsibility . For an airline feeling guilty about its air pollution then tree planting makes sense . But for a porn site ? This campaign ignores the claimed social and personal consequences of pornography , and the various support groups and organisations who would presumably welcome support from a corporate donor . <p> Of course , such recognition from Pornhub would mean a degree of corporate reflection and introspection , and these are qualities that are still relatively rare in any sector of the business world . Yet it is exactly this self-recognition that is pivotal to a robust corporate social responsibility programme . Organisations must look at the downside to their business -- their social irresponsibility , as it were -- and design a programme accordingly . Instead , Pornhub has favoured a campaign founded around the combination of a specific holiday -- America 's Arbor Day -- and a simple double entendre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1.5m videos viewed according to the site 's own " trees planted " counter -- is how easy it is for an organisation to create an imitation of corporate social responsibility that appeals to its customers . What has been created is a cargo cult of giving . If it looks like corporate social responsibility then we -- as consumers -- are inclined to think of it in that way . The alternative is less media-friendly , as an apparent act of corporate social responsibility that has been achieved by merely copying the actions of other -- possibly more mainstream -- organisations . <p> For Pornhub , the tree planting commitment neatly flips into a significant marketing campaign for a specific niche of pornography : " Big Dick " . Pornhub lists fewer videos in this category than in many others , and a Google Trends comparison also suggests it is one of the less popular categories of pornography . And yet the " wood for wood " campaign has generated 300 unique views for each video in this one category over the past week . <p> All of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which tree-planting organisation is used . The world is a better place with 15,000 more trees , and Pornhub 's corporate social responsibility department is no doubt very pleased .

And it was happening with the complicity of Cambodia 's leaders . I asked the then Australian ambassador , Margaret Adamson , whether she was concerned about this violent and illegal eviction happening right outside Australia 's Embassy . <p> MARGARET ADAMSON , AUSTRALIAN AMBASSADOR : Of course we have concerns about how the Cambodian Government manages the issue of land tenure . It 's a long-standing issue in the country and we have concerns which we have expressed to the Cambodian Government on a regular basis .

Fast forward five years and Australia wants to send an as yet undisclosed number of refugees into this turbulent country . <p> SISTER DENISE COGHLAN : We 're looking at stateless people , we 're looking at trafficked people , labour migration and the land evictions , all of which are key issues for Cambodia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refugees . <p> The Jesuit Refugee Service in Phnom Penh deals with the country 's complicated problems . <p> WOMAN : Good morning .

OK . <p> In this tiny room , I find more Rohingya . They too depend on the Jesuit Refugee Service or JRS , for food and basic accommodation .

For the right price the Cambodian government will probably do just about anything.Information about the proposed deal may be lacking but it seems no amount of detail will temper the criticism directed at Australia . <p> OU VIRAK : As long as the sufferings of people are beyond your sight , therefore it does n't exist .

But there are many holes in how the study authors reached that conclusion . <p> Researchers randomly assigned 164 students to either an above or below average sleep quality condition or a control condition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleep quality . <p> All students were given a brief lesson on sleep and told that , on average , adults spend between a fifth and a quarter of their total sleep in REM sleep , and that people with less than 20% REM sleep perform worse on tests of learning and memory while those who get 25% or more perform better . <p> All were then briefly attached to equipment measuring their waking brainwave activity and told it would determine the amount of REM sleep they had the night before . <p> Although students were asked to report how they 'd slept the night before , the actual amount was n't recorded . So , there 's no way of knowing if the results of the performance measures were because of the experiment and not simply due to the amount of sleep the students got the night before . <p> The group assigned to above average sleep quality were told they spent 28.7% of their total sleep time in REM sleep , while the below average group was told they spent 16.2% . When cognitive performance was assessed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those who thought they had less REM sleep . <p> Although the results indicated performance was correlated to how participants perceived their sleep quality , the differences between the two groups were only small . It 's unlikely such small differences would have a significant effect on performance in the real world . <h> The prosaic truth <p> Still , the authors interpreted this to indicate that mindset about sleep quality influences cognitive performance . <p> If you agree with that conclusion , it seems the way you think about how you slept can change the way we feel when awake . In other words , if you think you had a restless sleep the night before , you might feel worse during the day , and vice versa . <p> But while changing what you think about the sleep you 've had may make you feel better , and maybe even perform better in tests and the like in the short term , biology and the drive for sleep will ultimately determine how well or poorly people perform during the day . <p> There 's no substitute for sleep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There 's no fancy fix ; the best thing you can do for this is have a regular routine that gives you seven hours of sleep every night . <p> Going to bed and getting up at the same time each day , natural light in the morning and exercise can all help improve sleep quality over the long term , and maximise cognitive performance at school and work . Perhaps the best lesson from this study is that you should n't think too much about sleep , it 'll just make matters worse . 
@@2482230 NBN 's satellite magic pudding <p> Yesterday 's announcement about changes to the National Broadband Network are mixed news for those waiting to get high-speed internet , writes technology writer and consultant Paul Wallbank . <p> There 's good news and bad news for Australians waiting for the National Broadband Network in yesterday 's announcement about the project 's satellite services . For those on the outskirts of major cities , the good news is more areas will get faster fibre and wireless connections , but rural users get the bad news : they may find their satellite connections further limited . <p> Rolling fibre out to the entire nation under the NBN was never going to be feasible , and the broadband solution for most of the country 's land mass -- although only 3% of the population -- was going to be satellite internet . <p> Unfortunately for the NBN , the wireless and satellite services proved to be way more popular than expected , with projections of 600,000 regional homes , businesses and farms wanting a connection , compared to the original estimates of 230,000 . <p> For the government the choice was to send up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the planned fibre and wireless networks . The latter option was chosen , which means around 300,000 more premises than originally planned will get wireless rather than satellite connections , and an additional 25,000 will get fibre access . <p> For those in outer-suburban areas , an improved service is great news , but for people in more remote areas NBN Co intends to manage demand by putting download caps on the satellite service . A stingy 20Gb per month will stunt the growth of businesses outside the wireless and fibre footprints . In its 2013 survey of the nation 's digital economy , the Australian Communications Media Authority found that fixed-line internet users are downloading over 30Gb each month and that number grew 57% over the previous year . <p> Clearly businesses in the satellite footprints are going to be disadvantaged compared to their city cousins and overseas competitors . Limited speeds and data caps of satellite services is going to make it harder for businesses in rural locations to grow . The cost of extending the fibre and wireless footprint to regional areas is estimated to be $1.5 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within the envelope " of the $41 billion budget of the project . <p> A magic pudding mentality was one of the hallmarks of NBN Co 's earlier management , when Mike Quigley and his team always maintained that everything was under control . The assurance that an additional $1.5 billion cost is allowed for in the current numbers is not encouraging ; whether the current leadership is better at controlling costs , reducing delays and meeting expectations remains to be seen . <p> The challenge facing the CEO Bill Morrow 's team in meeting existing timeframes should n't be underestimated , with the project stalled in many parts of the country , contractors at war with their subcontractors and customers complaining about problems in being connected in the areas where NBN Co has completed work . <p> Adding to Morrow 's task is the uncertainty of the Coalition 's multi-technology model , where no one is quite sure exactly how many premises will be connected to fibre , copper or the pay-TV cables . Until the scope of the project is defined , it 's going to be difficult @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be . <p> The bastardization of the NBN roll-out by the Abbott Govt. will haunt Australian Business , Parliament and People for generations to come . Who now , will dare dream , declare the big vision , that can change a Nation ? Naysayers all but destroyed completion of the Opera House which now arguably , is a ' face ' of the Nation . NBN fibre to home came within grasp ... of revitalizing , channelling our national energy , creativity and economy into the future . Again , naysayers covered our eyes , stripped our courage to believe . Bugger , we are fools ! ! <p> One thing to remember , we are no longer talking about the original Labor NBN . That one is dead . Mal Turnbull 's Telstra/Foxtel Fraudband system no longer can be regarded as " National " or " Broadband " . It certainly is n't a Network anymore . Their intention to please their LNP backers ( NewsCorp for instance ) , who parachuted them into power , was no secret and to be expected . Unfortunately the mediocre mainstream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

Ever since man set out sea , barnacles have been clinging like , well , barnacles to ships , growing into bumpy masses that slows down vessels and wastes fuel . Could the solution to this age-old dilemma be a new coat of special paint ? It 's not as simple as it sounds . <p> A recent report touting the benefits of anti-barnacle paint got me wondering just how big a problem barnacles could possibly be . Turns out these tiny creatures can make a ship burn up to 40 per cent more fuel . Their collective mass is small compared to the overall ship , but their little bodies have an outsized effect creating drag around the ship 's otherwise smooth hull . <p> Biofouling is the technical name for the crusting of barnacles , mussels , and bacteria on ships . Barnacles , with their superstrong non-soluble glue , are the worst culprits . It 's all an especially big problem for the Navy , whose vessels are docked and stationary for much of the year . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year in fuel and maintenance costs thanks to biofouling . Now there are ready solutions to biofouling , but as you might expect , chemicals that kill barnacles are n't so great for the ocean , either . <p> In the 18th century , the British navy began sheathing their ships in copper , which made the hulls immune to both barnacles and a particular hazard to wooden ships of the era , shipworms . Underwater , a toxic film forms on the copper , keeping away any marine life . " That was a radical technical advance , " biochemist Ben Van Mooy told Oceanus Magazine . " It was probably one of the things that contributed to the emergence of England as a naval superpower in the 18th century . " Perhaps you 've heard the phrase " copper-bottomed " to describe an especially reliable thing . <p> Copper-sheathing came to an end though , because of steel . Navies shifted from wood to stronger steel ships , but the presence of copper causes steel to corrode faster .

Central to a good CTA is how it reduces visitor anxiety -- people want to know what happens when they click before they do . A small thing , but exclamations ! are rarely ! a good move ! They elevate anxiety rather than the excitement you are trying to manufacture . <p> Reward &gt; Effort has been achieved through a combination of the elements above as well as colour scheme , typeface colour and size , images and copy .

That 's the environment I entered in September 1966 , when I went to Moscow as a British Council Exchange student . <p> It 's hard to convey how exotic and potentially perilous Moscow seemed to Westerners then . This was the height of the Cold War , when scarcely any foreigners could live for a year in Moscow alongside Soviet citizens , and we British students ( I was actually an Australian , but it was a British exchange ) were specially briefed by someone from MI6 about the dangers of making Soviet friends , since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us . <p> Sheila at Kuznetskii bridge over Moscow river , 1969 .

I myself was not a spy , even though the place I was doing my Soviet history doctorate , St Antony 's in Oxford , was notorious in both the British and Soviet press as a " spy college " , having been founded after the war by ex-intelligence people . <p> But sometimes I felt like one , just because , from the Soviet standpoint , anyone who tried to find out things the Soviet Union did n't want known about itself and its history qualified as a spy . <p> I spent three lonely months falling in love with Moscow but knowing almost nobody . Then I made Russian friends , as most of the British group did , who turned out to be friends for life . <p> The KGB was interested in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but what they really disapproved of was marriage between a Soviet citizen and a foreigner . <p> Although it was no longer against the law , it was hard to do , and harder still to export your spouse once you had married them .

Those passports were our most precious possession : they meant that , unlike Soviet citizens , we could leave the country . <p> Soviet citizens in Moscow , 1969 . Rob Ketcherside <p> The only thing as exciting as my new friendships were the archives . Foreigners were generally not allowed into archives of the Soviet period in case they found out " state secrets " , a Soviet obsession , but I had a relatively innocuous topic ( Soviet education in the 1920s ) and managed to gain limited access . <p> The State Archives -- unchanged -- in 2012 .

That process felt so surreptitious that if they had arrested and interrogated me , I might have broken down and confessed to being a spy . But it was n't the Stalin period any more , so they were n't going to arrest me as long as I was on the official British exchange . The worst thing they could do was to declare me persona non grata and throw me out of the country . <p> That happened to a handful of foreign students each year ; and I might have been one of them , since at the end of my first year I was denounced in the newspaper Sovetskaia Rossiia as " next thing to a spy " for writing an allegedly defamatory article @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ article was published under my maiden name and nobody made the connection . <p> A 1968 article in newspaper Sovetskaia Rossiia denouncing the author as the " next thing to a spy " .

No one expected it , least of all the Russian population , who watched in bewilderment as erstwhile Soviet officials pocketed whatever state asset they had their hands on when the music stopped , from real estate to whole republics . <p> For Russians , the great thing about the collapse was that the borders opened and they were able to travel abroad ; the worst thing was that they lost all the " fraternal " republics and found out that at least some of their brothers thought they were imperialists .

I 'd forgotten that when I wrote my Soviet memoir and called it A Spy in the Archives ; or perhaps I thought it was no longer relevant , since the Soviet Union was dead .

That 's why it works . <h> Competitive federalism <p> But this is not to say that there is n't room for improvement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collaboration ; others for a much more competitive model . The recent Commission of Audit report advocated for a focus on " competitive federalism " . <p> As I have outlined , a level of healthy competition between states is certainly one of the many benefits of our federation . However , when it comes to competitive federalism we should be careful that we do n't end up with destructive competition between states , displayed as chest-beating and parochialism , combined with a disdain for collaboration in the national interest . <p> We should also be careful that we do not get into a situation where we are " competing " with each other in a " race to the bottom " of lower taxes , but also lower services . <p> And we should be careful that we do n't end up with a fragmented patchwork of different rules and regulations that stifle domestic and international trade , where it might once again be easier , for example , to sell gas across the borders of Europe than across the state borders of Australia . <p> Treasury secretary Ken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reform in a Federal System roundtable , questioned whether the excess of inconsistent state-based regulatory requirements in areas such as occupational licensing , occupational health and safety , road transport and water trading -- could be attributed to federalism . <p> One of the examples Henry provided was an operator of an interstate train having to : <p> ... deal with six access regulators , seven rail safety regulators with nine different pieces of legislation , three transport accident investigators , 15 pieces of legislation covering occupational health and safety of rail operations , and 75 pieces of legislation with powers over environmental management . <p> Henry also noted that Australia had seven rail safety regulators for a population of around 20 million people whereas the United States , with a population of 285 million , has only one . This example demonstrates the inefficiencies and duplication that can arise between governments without appropriate central coordination . <p> Thankfully , a great many of those problems were fixed as part of the COAG Seamless National Economy reforms introduced in 2008 . However , others have remained and there is danger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the passing of time . <p> The truth is we need a sophisticated combination of both co-operation and competition . This is because we need to remember that we are not just competing between states -- we 're also competing with the world . And our region has some of the best competitors around . <p> In China , we are neighbours to a country that has taken over even the US in terms of manufactured output , energy use and car sales . According to the IMF , China will overtake America as the world 's largest economy , at purchasing-power parity , in 2017 . <p> According to the OECD 's latest assessments , four of the five highest performing school systems in the world are Hong Kong , Korea , Shanghai and Singapore . The Grattan Institute recently pointed to the fact that the average 15-year old in Shanghai is two to three years ahead of his or her counterpart in Australia . <p> But in contrast to these impressive gains , Australian educational performance has been more mixed in the past ten years . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to harness the key strengths of our federation in order to compete in a world , and a region , that is in profound and lasting transition . <p> And it is also vital that we think , discuss , and debate how best to improve our current federation . I 'm thinking more specifically about how to solve the vexed issue in our federation of " roles and responsibilities " . <h> Roles and responsibilities <p> As a fellow ex-Premier , Nick Greiner , said in an op-ed earlier this month : <p> The question of who does what to whom and why in Australian governments is not theoretical or artificial : it is fundamental to the quality of life of Australian citizens . <p> I could n't agree more . Our federal system was based on the idea that the greater body of power would remain with the state governments . Indeed , it was intended by most of the framers that , in the new nation , the states would be the dominant partner . <p> This is reflected in how power is divided by the Constitution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that made logical sense for a national government to provide and all other powers outside of the list remained with the states . <p> The topics granted to the Commonwealth by the Constitution range from areas like marriage to defence and the regulation of corporations . The states retained control over major areas like health and education . <p> And yet , in 2014 , we have vast federal departments of health and education . The reasons for this are complex , but mainly relate to the bane of many federations -- Vertical Fiscal Imbalance . <p> Vertical Fiscal Imbalance refers to the mismatch between what the various levels of government in Australia are required to do , and the amount of revenue they are able to raise in order to do it . <p> The Commonwealth took over the states ' main source of revenue -- income tax -- around the time of World War Two . However , the states retained responsibility for two of the largest costs in our country -- health and education -- and nowhere near the ability to pay for it from their own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government pays the states grants to cover their responsibilities . For every dollar the Victorian government spends on police , public transport , education or health , around 50 cents comes directly from the federal government . <p> But this can leave the public unsure of who is really accountable for their services . It can encourage blame shifting and buck passing between the state and federal governments . The federal government also has a natural tendency to micromanage exactly how the money it gives the states is spent , and this kills the ability of state governments to innovate in their delivery of services , or make services more appropriate for specific local needs . <p> Finally , the federal government is often tempted to just take over areas of state responsibility -- for whatever reason they wish -- so that they can effect a particular policy outcome . They are able to do this due to broad readings by the High Court of Commonwealth power under the Constitution , as well as the Commonwealth 's ability to raise so much revenue . <p> Thus we have the often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ areas that they were never intended to have . What all this means is that our federation has become increasingly out of balance . To remedy its faults , and get it back into balance , we need to better align roles , responsibilities and revenues . <h> Dealing with ' roles and responsibilities ' -- the GST <p> Clearly the roles and responsibilities in our federation have changed from what was intended by the framers of our Constitution . But does that mean that we should go back to how everything was back in 1901 ? <p> I do n't necessarily think so . I think that we should assess the nature of the issue and then determine the level of government best suited to dealing with it in 2014 , and the future . <p> We need to work to clarify the roles and responsibilities of the states and federal government . When deciding who should do what , the principle of subsidiarity should be central . <p> That is , specific roles and responsibilities should go to the level of government closest to the people affected , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense for the states to have responsibility for things like health and education , just like it makes sense for the Commonwealth to be in charge of Defence and Foreign Affairs . <p> We then need to compare these agreed responsibilities with the current revenue-raising capacity of each state and the states generally . If they do n't have the revenue raising capacity , then we need to examine ways to fund their service responsibilities . In essence , this can be done in one of four ways : <p> give the states a share of income tax ; <p> increase the GST and give the proceeds to the states ; <p> increase transfers from the Commonwealth to the states , or <p> leave the states to increase their own taxes . <p> The recent Commission of Audit report advocated providing states with an ability to raise their own income tax . This would allow the federal government to lower the amount that they collect by the same proportion . <p> A number of current state premiers were very interested in this idea , and it has a certain elegance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ post-COAG meeting press conference on Friday , May 2 , that he was against the idea of " double taxation " . <p> Of course , what he did n't mention at the time was that the Commonwealth was about to withdraw A$80 billion in Commonwealth funding to the states for education and health over the next decade . Abbott said that as the states have responsibility for education and health under the Constitution , then they should be as far as possible " sovereign in their own sphere . " <p> I agree with his view about the role of the states . But it follows that if the states have these responsibilities , they also require the revenue to properly discharge them . <p> As I mentioned earlier , at the beginning of World War Two , the states were reasonably financially self-sufficient due to their sharing with the Commonwealth of the income tax base . <p> However , since then , there has been an increasing " monopolisation " of the most lucrative taxes by the Commonwealth , particularly with the Commonwealth 's take over of income @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taxation of goods and services . <p> At the same time as the states ' own sources of revenue have decreased , the costs of their liabilities -- the essential services required for their populations -- have increased . And they will continue to do so . A key driver of increasing costs is our rapidly ageing population . <p> As opposition leader Bill Shorten pointed out in his budget response last week , when he was at school there were 7.5 taxpayers to support each Australian aged 65 or over , but " by 2050 , it will be only 2.7 to one " . <p> Population growth and ageing will affect labour supply , economic output , infrastructure requirements and governments ' budgets . Collectively , it is projected that Australian governments will face additional pressures on their budgets equivalent to around 6% of national GDP by 2060 , principally reflecting the growth of expenditure on health , aged care and the age pension . <p> And the current GST is certainly not going to fill the hole in state finances . <p> Many commentators seem to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1999 , the states were required to abolish up to ten existing state taxes in order to get access to GST revenues . <p> This was the right move at the time . Many of these taxes were inefficient , and impacted specific areas of the economy such as stamp duty on mortgages , duty on quoted marketable securities , duty on leases and Financial Institution Duty . Getting rid of those taxes was a good idea and the result was a better tax system and a more efficient economy . <p> However , revenues have fallen well short of the " rivers of golds " that were promised . GST collections are barely above the minimum level that the Commonwealth agreed to underwrite back in the 1999 IGA . <p> In fact , from a purely selfish point of view , some of the states would probably be in a better fiscal position today if they just retained the state taxes they gave up as part of GST . Much of the reason for this is that there are large and growing structural weaknesses in the GST revenue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exempt , and banking services are comparatively lightly taxed . <p> GST revenue has been growing more slowly than the economy as a whole , because the untaxed components make up a larger share of consumption . The truth of the matter is that even before the budget announcement of the withdrawal of $80 billion of Commonwealth funding , the issue of how to fund education and health care -- and how to get the federation back into better balance -- was a conversation we were going to have to have anyway . <p> And it 's not just about Commonwealth-state responsibilities and who does what . The reality is that post-GFC , Australian governments -- state and federal -- have a major revenue problem . Our existing taxes and charges are simply not adequate to provide the responsible and reasonable services in health and education the community expects us to provide . <p> As a young backbencher who in 1985 publicly supported Paul Keating 's option C -- that famously included a consumption tax -- I 've been around long enough to know how difficult it is to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the possible other outcomes of either crushing deficits , or failing to care for our most vulnerable people , GST reform looks more and more like the best option we 've got . <p> In my view , the real debate about the GST is not about whether it needs to increase . I think that 's inevitable . The real debate is about the nature of the increase ( base versus rate , or both ) , the compensation provided to low-income earners and pensioners , and the distribution of the proceeds ( the states versus the rest ) . <p> And by the way , we should immediately move to reduce the erosion of GST collections from overseas internet purchases . Not only does the current situation place Australian suppliers at a competitive disadvantage , it is costing the states hundreds of millions of dollars in lost revenue . <p> COAG was the vehicle of reform for the original GST conversation in the late 1990s , and it should be again . The original GST could have been introduced with or without the co-operation of the states @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the states , the GST would still have been a useful tax reform -- but of no major note . <p> By involving the states and linking the proceeds of the GST to the abolition of inefficient state taxes , the introduction of the GST was both a major taxation and economic reform for all Australians . <p> This time around , the circumstances are quite different . We have a federation that over time has become increasingly out of balance , exacerbated by the recent federal budget which shifts $80 billion of spending to the states and which makes their medium and long term budget position completely untenable and unsustainable . <h> Conclusions <p> In these circumstances , I believe we have a unique opportunity to rebalance the federation and provide an enduring and better match between roles , responsibilities and revenue . <p> Throughout this process , it 's vital that the public and opinion leaders are able to participate in this debate . I therefore strongly support a Federation Convention to be held later this year or early 2015 . I also believe it 's vital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ progress of reforms . <p> Shifting federal-state relations to reflect greater subsidiarity and reduce duplication is a significant reform ambition . As with any major reform , it requires a plan with identified steps and activities with associated milestones , targets and timelines . It also requires a way to hold governments to account for the outcomes sought by the federation . <p> I therefore support the early establishment of a Federation Reform Council to independently monitor the timetable , milestones , and progress of any new arrangements . <p> As I said earlier , Australia is doing very well in comparison to the rest of the world -- and this is due partly to our structure of government -- to our federation . <p> But we should realise that there are many important junctures coming up for our nation that we must deal with . It will be up to the media , interest groups , business and our political leaders to ensure this opportunity to improve our federation is not wasted -- because we can not run away from the discussion . <p> I 'd like to leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Can Responsible Government Survive in Australia ? In it , he describes the ancient Goth 's approach to deciding matters of importance , in the context of our own Senate : <p> The ancient Goths of Germany had all of them a wise custom of debating everything of importance to their state , twice ; this is , once drunk -- that their councils might not want vigour ; and once sober -- that they might not want discretion . <p> Discretion meaning , of course , sober consideration of the facts . <p> I hope the upcoming debate on our federation is certainly vigorous , but will be grounded in sober consideration of the facts . And if we get it right , this debate will lead to a federation built on co-operation , focused on driving clear outcomes to advance our national interest , and with a better balance between roles , responsibilities and revenue . 
@@2508232 <p> Bachelet 's reforms -- aimed at dismantling a series of neoliberal policies put in place in the early 1980s -- will be paid for by an overhaul of the tax system . They include three key measures : to end public funding to private , for-profit schools , to make all primary and secondary education free of charge , and to prohibit contested selective practices used in school admission processes . Bachelet sent the proposals to the Chilean parliament on May 19 , and a long controversial legislative debate is now expected . <p> The changes imply a significant departure from the previous three decades of educational policies in Chile , which have gone precisely in the opposite direction by promoting a market-oriented educational system . <p> A key reason behind the policy shift is the strong and persistent student movement , which started in 2006 ( at the start of Bachelet 's first presidential term ) and has been continuously active in Chile since 2011 . The student movement has consistently demanded the kind of policy reform Bachelet has now announced . <p> But students took to the streets in May to keep the pressure on . In this context , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ based on evidence , as opposed to a mere political response to social protests . <h> End to for-profit education <p> First , the announced reform prohibits for-profit private providers of education , when their profits are obtained directly or indirectly from public funds . This is aimed at ensuring public expenditure on education will go directly to improve quality . <p> Since the creation of the Chilean school voucher system in 1980 the fastest growing sector has been that of for-profit institutions . The voucher system -- where the state gives parents a voucher to use in either private or public schools -- was created as part of a market-oriented reform that also included decentralisation of the public education and privatisation . <p> As a result , for-profit institutions currently account for a third of the total national primary and secondary enrolment , and receive state subsidies on equal terms with not-for-profit private and public institutions . <p> At the post-secondary level , universities are meant to be non-profit entitites . But there is evidence that some new private universities use subterfuges to permit the return of profits for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buildings through related companies . <p> Some international companies including Laureate International and Apollo have purchased large private universities in Chile . Students marched in May worried Bachelet 's reforms are not going far enough.Sebastian Silva/EPA <p> In 2011 , a special commission of the House of Representatives identified systematic and extensive practices through which the owners of some private universities avoided the law to make profits . <p> The courts have also begun to investigate allegations of undercover profit and use of illegal tactics by new private institutions to obtain the quality accreditation required to access public resources . <p> Profit-making motives have also been related to undesirable practices in education , including discrimination against students from low-income families and students with low academic abilities , low quality education services , and the uncontrolled growth of low-cost undergraduate programs with low employability outcomes . There is also evidence that for-profit schools are less effective than non-profit schools in terms of educational attainment . <h> Free education for all <p> In another section of the reforms , Bachelet has embraced free education , proposing the end of the co-payment system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mechanism called " shared funding " that allows and encourages private voucher schools to charge a tuition fee without losing access to the state subsidy . It is used in around 80% of private voucher schools . <p> The fact that Chile 's government-funded private schools are allowed to charge tuition fees to families has been a highly controversial issue for two decades , because compulsory education is formally " free " in Chile . <p> The co-payment system introduces a price discrimination mechanism among schools , which is directly linked to the socio-economic status of the student population . This co-payment system has been linked to the high and increasing level of socioeconomic school segregation in Chile , which is the highest among OECD countries . <p> The fact that Chilean students are so highly segregated may be related to the finding that consistently indicates that -- in comparative terms -- students ' academic achievement is strongly related to students ' socio-economic status in Chile . By eliminating the co-payment system , Bachelet is attempting to reduce school social segregation and reinforce parents ' school choice . <h> End @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discriminatory practices by schools . Chilean schools apply arbitrary mechanisms for selecting students , both in the admission process and throughout students ' academic trajectories . <p> Primary and secondary schools select students based on past performance , prediction of future performance , student 's behaviour , family income , and other family characteristics . These selective mechanisms are especially prevalent in private institutions , including schools that receive state funding . <p> Many of these practices have long been denounced by international organisations and human rights advocates as detrimental to students ' right to education . Nevertheless , Chilean political and judicial institutions have previously defended the notion of " free enterprise " in the education market , giving educational providers freedom to set their own rules to admit and expel students . The school selection processes were partially regulated by Bachelet 's General Education Law in 2009 , but these regulations seem to have had little impact on school admission policies . <p> These selection methods provide a competitive advantage to private schools compared to public schools . The state actively promotes parents ' school choice by publishing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ test-based accountability policies , including strong sanctions to underperforming schools . Research has shown that when controlling for selection bias , the performance advantage observed in private schools compared to public school disappears . <h> Opposition likely <p> Overall , Bachelet 's announced reforms are attempting to reverse the extreme marketisation of Chilean education . But the technical complexities and political challenges of these policies make them a highly risky decision , and much debate is likely to ensue . <p> Representatives of private education ( including the Catholic Church which is a key educational stakeholder in Chile ) and opposition political leaders have already criticised different aspects of the reforms , arguing that they jeopardise the diversity of educational providers and the freedom of education . <p> Nevertheless , if successful , Bachelet will create a more appropriate institutional framework to recover , strengthen and expand Chilean public education .

But on balance chemicals have done far more good than harm . A good example is brominated flame retardants which are no longer used in furniture due to allegations of unpleasant side-effects .

But the nation 's new-found hydrocarbon wealth has met with far from universal approval . The first company to be granted a licence to drill for shale , Cuadrilla , found itself in the Battle of Balcolme last summer as environmental activists and Sussex villagers clashed with police over the drilling site . <p> There are now only 12 months to go before a general election . With the coalition government keen to make the most of Britain 's reserves , public opinion of fracking could be important to the outcome of the next election . <h> Energy politics <p> Advocates describe shale gas as " game-changing " , able to radically reduce Britain 's reliance on imported fuel and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of fracking -- blasting water underground at high pressure to shatter rocks and release gas -- is risky and environmentally damaging with little-understood health risks . <p> Many Conservatives appear to be highly supportive of the " dash for shale " , while others worry about the voting implications of drilling in Tory shire county strongholds . Although Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg offered cautious support last year , prominent Liberal Democrats have distanced themselves . Labour 's position is more difficult to decipher , with elements of support and staunch opposition . <p> Former Conservative energy minister Lord Howell this week repeated his comments of last year that fracking should go ahead in the " desolate " north , avoiding at all costs the Tory strongholds of the southern counties . Evidently , the lack of consensus between and within the parties on fracking means that any dash for shale gas is some way off yet . <h> Framing fracking <p> As part of our project examing climate change as a complex social issue , my colleagues and I examined how the issue is framed socially and politically by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ press and in British public opinion polls . <p> Our analysis of the UK media 's reporting of fracking revealed occasions when it was heavily split between those against ( The Guardian and Independent ) and those for ( The Times and Telegraph ) . <p> Reported in April 2011 , the Gasland documentary film followed the experiences of residents affected by fracking in the US including memorable scenes of setting fire to gas-infused tap water . In April 2011 , Cuadrilla 's fracking in Lancashire caused a seismic event . In both cases , a clear divide was seen , with pro-fracking outlets refering to " seismic activity " or " tremors " , and anti-fracking outlets referring to " earthquakes " , or rubbishing the facts or motives of the Gasland film . <h> The British public <p> We should not lose sight of public opinion among the rhetoric in the newspapers .

Human beings generally resist change , try to maintain a sense of continuity and control . Fracking , with its promise of cheap , secure energy , may be viewed as a means to this end , with the risks downplayed . Of course , this is very much dependent on the sorts of messages found in the media and the mouths of politicians . <h> The future of fracking in Britain <p> What our work shows is that the way fracking is framed , socially , linguistically , ideologically , is pivotal in shaping the debate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how we should act , and can persuade us towards one position or another despite the potential risks or benefits . <p> Support for fracking by political affiliation , 2012-2014 . O'Hara et al . <p> Essentially , both the pro- and anti-fracking camps are engaged in a struggle of representation . While one camp constructs the practice of fracking as excessively risky , the other camp minimises , normalises and justifies the risks . <p> There is much political ambivalence about fracking , with no single major political party having taken a firm party-wide stance on the technology . However , with growing public endorsement , it may be the case that the major political parties will view fracking as something that the British public wants and , ultimately , will vote for .

And neither is it possible for me to take an objective view of their artworks -- as , to be fair , is the case with most art criticism . <p> All three Warlpiri women artists were born " out bush " in the Tanami Desert of Central Australia , delivered by Aboriginal midwives .

They 'd hunt , cook and eat small game including lungkarda ( bluetongue lizards ) , wardapi ( goannas ) and other reptiles , and drink from rockholes and other water sources . <p> At night the children would sleep in rows beside close family members , more often than not the stars in the night-sky their only canopy . <p> This way of life made for people who were physically and psychologically tough - and very able . <p> In those early years the girls began learning their Jukurrpa ( " The Dreaming " , in inadequate English translation ) , their sacred religion , their Law , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ process of knowledge acquisition included mastery of Warlpiri ceremonies , Warlpiri iconography and the lengthy oral narratives accompanying their Jukurrpa . <p> The women 's profound knowledge of such matters is encrypted in the artworks currently on display in the exhibition . <h> That was then , this is now <p> Despite the usual aches and pains that go with aging , all three women still walk practically everywhere . They 've never learnt to drive . The women 's legendary self-sufficiency and continuing care for others means that they 're regarded as role models for others in the small community of Lajamanu -- for both Yapa ( Warlpiri people ) and those Kardiya ( non-Aboriginal people ) who take the trouble to attempt to understand Warlpiri people and their culture . <p> These three women , along with the other old Warlpiri people living at Lajamanu , represent the heartbeat of that small community . <p> At the same time these women are strongly individual , a fact that 's evident in the artworks on display in Melbourne . <p> The brief cameo portraits that follow provide a glimpse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women artists and the artworks they continue to create in their old age . The following account is also , on my part , unavoidably autobiographical , to some extent at least . <h> Yirdingali ( Lily ) Nungarrayi <p> I first came to know Yirdingali Nungarrayi ( Lily ) in early 1982 . At the time she was known far and wide by her nickname ' Council Woman ' because , after the Welfare Days ended in the late 1970s , she 'd taken on a cleaning position at the Lajamanu Community Council . <p> Later , beginning in early 1982 , Lily started work as one of a team of three Warlpiri women who , beginning at dawn , cleaned the school every morning before the kids arrived . The Warlpiri cleaning team , including Lily , were under the direction of a young white woman who had been appointed " head " cleaner by the then school principal . <p> The young white woman did n't disguise her disdain for Warlpiri people and their cultural practices . One day , fed-up with such talk , Lily simply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fly off the handle , Lily has never accepted shabby treatment , let alone from those considerably less experienced than her in life and work . <p> Lily 's " resignation " was damaging to the school because like everything else that she has done in life , she cleaned the ever-dusty school with great gusto , energy and commitment . <p> Today , as an increasingly frail nonagenarian , Lily Nungarrayi devotes her remaining days to the maintenance and intergenerational transmission of Warlpiri culture and language . She 's particularly dedicated to her visual art practice . Each morning she turns up early outside the Warnayaka Art Centre , waiting with her beloved maliki ( dogs ) until she can begin painting . <p> Nungarrayi 's educative zeal extends from teaching younger Warlpiri , to interacting with the succession of the sometimes recalcitrant Kardiya ( non-Warlpiri people ) who have lived or are now living at Lajamanu , whom she accurately perceives as being badly in need of education in Warlpiri life-ways and mores . <p> Lily 's quintessentially Warlpiri selfhood is evident in her visual artworks . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a true original . Lily and her artworks are ultimately indivisible . Bold . Bright . Raw . Uncompromising . And charismatic . <p> She completes her artworks quickly , impatiently , although in this rapid execution Lily 's mark making is never slapdash . She is an action painter who works at an instinctual level , placing increasingly gestural , minimalist , assured strokes on her canvases . The Jukurrpa inhabits each one ; the making of each artwork constitutes a grand gesture on her part . <p> These Jukurrpa include the Wardilyka Jukurrpa ( " Bush Turkey Dreaming " ) , Ngapa Jukurrpa ( " Water Dreaming " ) , Karnta-kurlangu Jukurrpa ( " Women 's Dreaming ' " ) and more . This continuing hunger to evoke , to paint her Jukurrpa , repetitively and on a daily basis , even into advanced old age , comes from Lily 's passion to retain the best of the past in order to influence the present somewhat difficult circumstances of settlement life . <p> Each artwork that Lily creates manifests itself as a pulse of energy that will never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> Jinjilngali ( Molly ) Napurrurla <p> My first meeting with Molly was in 1983 when she , along with Japanangka , her second husband , and extended family , moved onto the vacant patch of dusty red earth immediately next door to my home . Japanangka , Molly 's husband , was a small , thin , wiry , gentle and gracious man who had a patrician bearing . <p> Molly Tasman Napurrurla.Lajamanu , 2002 <p> Within a matter of hours after moving in , Molly 's family group had worked quietly , quickly and efficiently to construct a smallish hut-like dwelling . An immaculate housekeeper , Molly would sweep the path leading into their little home several times daily with a broom that she 'd fashioned from spinifex grass and the leaves of a gum tree . <p> Adorning their family home , hanging neatly from its exterior walls , were numerous billycans and tin mugs . Stacks of tin plates were artfully balanced on top of the humpy-home . At any given time there were 10-15 people living there , but never once was a raised voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with works on display , Molly epitomises the Warlpiri core values of pre-contact days . Family , the Jukurrpa and the Warlpiri Law mean everything to Molly . To re-frame W.H.

Molly Napurrurla is also a wonderfully gifted storyteller with highly developed dramaturgical skills and she 's an infinitely patient teacher . In her own unassuming way , she 's a profoundly committed political and cultural activist who has been in it for the long haul . <p> The Jukurrpa that Molly paints ( and she commands an extensive repertoire ) are indicative of the brilliant intellect she brings to bear on everything she does , whether recounting lengthy Jukurrpa narratives , teaching her grandchildren or interacting with a lively group of Warlpiri pre-schoolers . <p> In terms of her artistic practice , Molly brings to her artworks her deep Jukurrpa knowledge , her organisational skills and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Rosie ) Napurrurla <p> Unlike my earliest encounters with Lily Nungarrayi and Molly Napurrurla , I have no clear recollection of my first meeting with Molly 's older sister , Rosie Napurrurla . It seems that Rosie was simply always there , in the background . In daily life Rosie is n't one who seeks to stand out . <p> But ultimately it 's Rosie Napurrurla 's extraordinary ability to dramatise her Jukurrpa that attracts attention in the ceremonial context of yawulyu ( " Warlpiri women 's ceremonies , dancing , and the accompanying ritual designs " ) . The same quality may also be glimpsed in her visual art . <p> While she shares a broad repertoire of Jukurrpa with her younger sister Molly , for some years now Rosie has had as her principal focus the Ngurlu ( " Seed " ) Dreaming , although not to the exclusion of her other Jukurrpa . <p> Rosie Tasman Napurrurla.Photo by Edith Folley <p> Rosie has made the role of the greedy little bird in the Ngurlu Jukurrpa completely her own , through dancing and re-enacting it countless times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a small , slight woman by Warlpiri standards , transforms herself into the little bird , actually becoming the greedy little pigeon at the centre of this Jukurrpa . <p> The Ngurlu Jukurrpa is " owned " by the Warlpiri " skin " groups of Napurrurla and Nakamarra women and Jupurrurla and Jakamarra men . This narrative reflects the strongly competitive elements in a particular food chain : a group of women who follow the tracks of the Diamond Dove ( Kurlukuku -- a pigeon ) in order to locate and gather grass seeds ( " lukarrara " ) , which the birds like to eat and feed to their babies , and which are also scavenged by ants ( " nama " ) . <p> After collecting the lukarrara , the women winnow , grind , and add water , transforming the seeds into a dough , which they then bake in the embers of an open fire , eventually producing delicious small seedcakes . <p> To her artworks Rosie Napurrurla brings vibrant colour , imbuing her canvases with a sense of three-dimensionality and movement .

The semantic scope of that nomenclature is considerably wider than it is in everyday English .

Economic growth failed to keep up with population increase and by 1965 the economy was bankrupt . <p> In one of those unexpected disjunctures that history sometimes throws up , Soeharto -- who might have been expected to favour command-and-control -- delegated economic policy-making to a group of academic economists ( the ' Berkley Mafia ' or , more accurately , the ' technocrats ' ) . Under the strong leadership of Professor Widjojo Nitisastro , they implemented sensible mainstream macro-economic policies ( balanced budget , low inflation , small external imbalance ) and encouraged a market-oriented environment . In the economic watershed of 1967 , the economy was opened up to international commerce , with nationalised foreign companies returned to their former owners and new foreign investment welcomed . <p> Thus began three decades of 7% annual growth which transformed the Indonesian economy and demonstrated that even basket cases could prosper , given competent macro-economic policies .

@@2524234 <p> Why do some children succeed while others fail ? The story we usually tell about childhood and success is the one about intelligence : success comes to those who score highest on tests , from preschool admissions to SATs . But in his book , Tough argues that the qualities that matter more have to do with character : skills like perseverance , curiosity , optimism and self-control . In other words : emotional intelligence competencies . <p> Drake takes this one step further and argues that the only major personality trait that consistently leads to success is conscientiousness . People who test high in conscientiousness get better grades in school and college , commit fewer crimes and stay married longer . They live longer and not just because they smoke less and drink less . They have fewer strokes , lower blood pressure and a lower incidence of Alzheimer 's disease . <p> There 's a staggering amount of research linking conscientiousness with success . Conscientious people earn higher salaries and have greater job satisfaction ; conscientiousness is also the most important factor for finding and retaining employment . Research shows that showing up on time , doing thorough work and being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ function or workplace situation . <p> Conscientious people tend to be super-organised , great planners and responsible . They work hard in the face of challenges and can control their impulses . They are better at setting goals and working towards them , as well as persisting amid setbacks . If an ambitious goal ca n't be realised , they will switch to a more attainable one rather than getting discouraged and giving up . As a result , they tend to achieve goals that are consistent with what employers want . They organise their lives well and are sticklers for punctuality . They make great employees . <p> Psychologists classify conscientiousness as one of the ' big five ' personality traits , with the others being agreeableness , extroversion , neuroticism and openness to experience . <p> In the Humm-Wadsworth temperament model , conscientiousness is equivalent to the engineer . People with this component make great employees , however it can be a hindrance in a manager . Conscientiousness can make people monomaniacs ; they find it difficult to multi-task . In addition they tend to focus on tasks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skills that differentiate the successful manager . Finally there is major issue of decision making . Conscientiousness people tend to get bogged down in the detail and , therefore , often the cost of making a decision outweighs future benefits . <p> The factor that determines whether someone becomes a successful leader and manager is not conscientiousness . It helps , but the two necessary Humm components are not part of the big five . <p> Managers need two key qualities , shrewd people skills based on empathy and the ability to take and make decisions . Conscientious people need to have these two components as part of their personality ; otherwise they may well find themselves continually missing out on promotion . <h> Chris Golis <p> Chris Golis has had a successful career in IT and venture capital , where he was director of some 30 private and public companies .

@@2524235 <h> The role of the faith based organisation <p> Frank Brennan 's presentation at the Jesuit Social Services Symposium on ' The role of faith based community organisations in contributing to a civil society ' , 26 May 2014 <p> On this National Sorry Day , I took a walk around St Ignatius Church here in Richmond just to clear my head over morning tea before speaking . I recalled another walk I made around this Church 17 years ago . It was late afternoon . That evening Patrick Dodson and I were to speak in the Church on national reconciliation . The legendary Nugget Coombs had just died . Some months before I had been the rapporteur at the National Reconciliation Convention which Pat chaired and facilitated , as the nation 's father of reconciliation . After the Convention , I had written to Prime Minister John Howard suggesting that the time was ripe for a national apology from our Parliament to the stolen generations of indigenous Australians . His minister John Herron had just written back to me telling me that there would be no apology and the reasons for such a decision . I said to Pat over a cup of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eh ? ' He said that was not right . He and some of the key indigenous leaders had recently been in Canberra meeting with government ministers who intimated that the door might still be open . As Pat and I walked around the church , he contemplated whether he should resign that night as the Chair of the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation , and whether he should use the church meeting as the opportunity to explain his reasons . He decided not to resign , but to hang in , against the odds . He thought it important to stay inside the government tent working for the long-term objective which was to take a change of government and another decade to achieve . Those of us in the welfare sector working in faith based organisations ( FBOs ) in difficult times need to decide how we are going to hang in , and what clear goals we are going to set for ourselves . <p> Years ago when my father was Chief Justice , he was attending a national Catholic education conference in Parliament House in Canberra . Over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Sir Gerard , we trust that you will be delighted that we are about to set up the first Catholic law school in Australia . ' Dad looked at her and said , ' Must you ? ' This morning we have heard outlined the history of involvement by religious orders and other church bodies in Australia setting up a vast range of health , education and welfare organisations . With stretched resources , we are often asking how we might maintain our existing institutions . Might we not more profitably at times ask what we might contemplate setting up in twenty first century Australia if we were starting with a tabula rasa . <p> When Bob Hawke was Prime Minister , the Labor Member for Leichardt in North Queensland was a colourful and amiable lawyer John Gayler who used to organise the prime minister 's annual marlin fishing trip off the Barrier Reef . I remember being in Parliament House one night after a long dinner when John Gayler had enjoyed some fine wines . He told me , ' Its all very well for you . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like me have no influence at all . ' I felt like saying exactly the same thing to him . Often when we church welfare people gather , it is easy for us to demonise , stereotype , morally neutralise , or politically neuter the politicians or the bureaucrats . I am sure they do the same to us behind closed doors . But often it may be that they feel just as powerless , just as trapped , and just as helpless as we do . In charity and justice , it is essential that we accord dignity to all , to politicians and bureaucrats , as well as those we profess to serve through our agencies and those who are our staff and overseers . <p> We gather from a vast array of Christian traditions -- Baptist , Uniting Church , Anglicans , the Salvation Army and Catholics . If we reflect on what works we take pride in and why , I daresay there would be a sense in the room of identity and symmetry -- a sense that we all wish to be involved in similar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And yet each of us has our own distinctive tradition , teaching and modus operandi . In our Catholic tradition , we have been ably assisted in recent years with the 2005 encyclical of Pope Benedict XVI Deus Caritas Est and this year 's apostolic exhortation of Pope Francis Evangelli Gaudium . <p> Though socially much more conservative than his successor , Benedict writes : ' Love of neighbour , grounded in the love of God , is first and foremost a responsibility for each individual member of the faithful , but it is also a responsibility for the entire ecclesial community at every level : from the local community to the particular Church and to the Church universal in its entirety . ' He insists that ' within the community of believers there can never be room for a poverty that denies anyone what is needed for a dignified life ' . <p> He insists on the need for both justice and charity noting , ' Since the 19th century , an objection has been raised to the Church 's charitable activity , subsequently developed with particular insistence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not need charity but justice . Works of charity -- almsgiving -- are in effect a way for the rich to shirk their obligation to work for justice and a means of soothing their consciences , while preserving their own status and robbing the poor of their rights . ' Benedict concedes , ' There is admittedly some truth to this argument , but also much that is mistaken . ' We must hold together our commitment to charity and our passion for justice . <p> Benedict says this is the place of the Church 's social doctrine : ' it has no intention of giving the Church power over the State . Even less is it an attempt to impose on those who do not share the faith ways of thinking and modes of conduct proper to faith . Its aim is simply to help purify reason and to contribute , here and now , to the acknowledgment and attainment of what is just . ' He says , ' the Church is duty-bound to offer , through the purification of reason and through ethical formation , her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ achieving them politically . ' <p> Some of us would question Benedict 's bold assertion : ' The Church can not and must not take upon herself the political battle to bring about the most just society possible . She can not and must not replace the State . ' But we would all agree that the Church ' can not and must not remain on the sidelines in the fight for justice . She has to play her part through rational argument and she has to reawaken the spiritual energy without which justice , which always demands sacrifice , can not prevail and prosper . ' This is best done by eyeballing both the decision makers and those affected adversely by those decisions . Eyeballing both , we at least avoid the temptation to sound sanctimonious . Eyeballing both , truth can speak to power and truth can be heard by power . <p> These are great pointers for faith-based organisations : <p> Practising charity AND justice in all we do and with all with whom we deal <p> Purifying reason in the debate about justice , especially in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spiritual energy and moral forces in ourselves and in our society , fostering and encouraging the desire to go the extra mile <p> Ordering a just society with a commitment to fostering the common good or the public interest , while maintaining a preferential option for the poor <p> Providing a privileged place for the poor in the life of our organisations . <p> There are those in FBOs in the health and education sectors who have been much more adept than us in the past , adapting to the demands and expectations of clients and the State , being less suspicious of business and espousing the right of economic initiative , holding together the charism and good business practice , being accountable for outcomes while allowing staff to live their vocation in freedom . <p> Some FBOs can rightly decide to provide services only for those of their faith communities ; others will be committed to providing services for all people in the community regardless of their religious faith . Some FBOs can rightly decide that their services will be provided only or chiefly by members of their faith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by staff of all faiths and none . Some will decide that they be informed by their religious traditions , and others simply by the prevailing community values . Some will decide that they be shaped and inspired by their religious tradition even if few staff are educated or committed in that tradition ; others will be satisfied with staff being shaped and inspired by community values . Some will see their organisation simply being described , labeled or marketed by their religious tradition . However it is to be done , we must always have an eye not just to our actions and statements , but also to our structures and mode of accountability . <p> The present royal commission into institutional responses to child sexual abuse provides all FBOs with a useful mirror at this time . No doubt there is some secularist hostility and media bias out there , but that does not account for what we are encountering . We need to admit that we have been found wanting in our training and supervision of staff , in our non-transparency and unaccountability in the exercise of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which fall well short of contemporary community values in relation to the most vulnerable , children in our care . We have needed help from the State . Usually we pride ourselves on advocating and living values more exacting than those of the community at large . Here we are shown to suffer cultural and institutional shortcomings which undermine our ethical coherence . <p> Pope Benedict reminds us , ' The Church can never be exempted from practising charity as an organized activity of believers , and on the other hand , there will never be a situation where the charity of each individual Christian is unnecessary , because in addition to justice man needs , and will always need , love . ' <p> In his fourth chapter of Evangelii Gaudium on the social dimension of evangelisation , Francis has a section entitled ' The special place of the poor in God 's people ' . He writes : ' For the Church , the option for the poor is primarily a theological category rather than a cultural , sociological , political or philosophical one . God shows the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the option for the poor ' is implicit in our Christian faith in a God who became poor for us , so as to enrich us with his poverty . This is why I want a Church which is poor and for the poor . ' <p> In the section entitled ' The economy and distribution of income ' , Francis is more insistent than Benedict that we have a hands-on political involvement . With a South American flourish , he asserts , ' As long as the problems of the poor are not radically resolved by rejecting the absolute autonomy of markets and financial speculation and by attacking the structural causes of inequality , no solution will be found for the world 's problems or , for that matter , to any prob ? lems . Inequality is the root of social ills . ' He thinks there are times when we need to be perceived as ' irksome ' by decision makers and opinion formers . He writes : <p> The dignity of each human person and the pursuit of the common good are concerns which ought to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they seem to be a mere adden ? dum imported from without in order to fill out a political discourse lacking in perspectives or plans for true and integral development . How many words prove irksome to this system ! It is irksome when the question of ethics is raised , when global solidarity is invoked , when the dis ? tribution of goods is mentioned , when reference in made to protecting labour and defending the dignity of the powerless , when allusion is made to a God who demands a commitment to jus ? tice . At other times these issues are exploited by a rhetoric which cheapens them . Casual indiffer ? ence in the face of such questions empties our lives and our words of all meaning . <p> Francis insists on the need for ' more politicians who are genuinely disturbed by the state of society , the people , the lives of the poor ! It is vital that government leaders and financial leaders take heed and broaden their ho ? rizons , working to ensure that all citizens have dignified work , education @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kevin Andrews preparing to publish the welfare review by the religiously committed Patrick McClure , I wonder whether it might be possible for a broad coalition of FBOs in the welfare sector to provide an analysis of the review 's conditionalities for welfare payments and services -- not for their political achievability or their economic responsibility , but for their moral coherence upholding the dignity of all with the requisite display of mercy , justice and charity . We are committed to quality care being delivered on the ground and at the edges , the delivery of humane service where it is toughest , and the enhancement of dignity , spiritual energy and critical reason for all participants in policy making and service delivery . We are here to make a difference inspired and motivated by our incarnational vision .

It is now commonplace for doctors to be told to leave their consciences at the door , as their patients are consumers and they are suppliers and of course the market decides . Debates about law and policy are often resolved with simplistic assertions about individual rights and autonomy , with little consideration for the public interest , the common good , and the doctor-patient relationship .

Presidential candidates were stressing the need for unity and dialogue . Ukraine 's richest man , Rinat Akhmetov , a powerful tycoon based in eastern Ukraine , took a strong public stance against separatists there . An international election observer mission was in place . And Russian president , Vladimir Putin , had promised to recognise the results and ( yet again ) withdraw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Russian foreign minister , Sergey Lavrov confirmed his country 's recognition of the results and indicated a readiness to enter into talks with Poroshenko , but warned against a continuation of Kiev 's " anti-terrorist operation " . In one sense , expectations of a new beginning for Ukraine may thus appear quite justified . <p> At the same time , however , Russia retains control of Crimea , annexed at the end of March . In the course of the crisis , Moscow also massed some 40,000 troops on Ukraine 's eastern border , while well-armed separatists gained control in parts of the eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk and held a referendum in the hope of following in Crimea 's wake . <p> Unrest has spread further across Ukraine , including to Odessa where dozens of people were killed following violent clashes between pro-Ukrainian and pro-Russian demonstrators . Even the week immediately before the elections saw high levels of violence , with numerous casualties as a result of clashes between Ukrainian security forces and separatists . <h> Uphill task <p> Yet , the question is what difference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Poroshenko , known widely as " chocolate king " for his business success , has political and government experience as well , having been a member of both Yanukovich 's Party of the Regions and Yushchenko 's Our Ukraine bloc and having served as foreign minister during Yulia Tymoshenko 's premiership . <p> Though he may be popular at the moment because of the general disillusionment that voters feel with the current political elite in Kiev , he does not have his own political party . Neither has he so far articulated a clear vision for the future , a plan for reform or a set of policies to bring Ukraine out of its current crisis . It will be difficult for him to manage the deeply fractious political process in light of a severe economic crisis and the continuing spectre of intensifying civil war . <p> The difficulties he faces in trying to deliver on Ukrainians ' expectations for real and sustainable change are further compounded by the current constitution , under which most power is vested in the parliament where Poroshenko has yet to build a reliable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the year , but only if he manages to build a strong network of local political support across Ukraine ahead of new parliamentary elections and if he can sustain his current popularity . <h> East still riven by violence <p> The other big challenge for the new president will be the situation in eastern Ukraine . One immediate issue will be legitimacy . Regardless of the endorsement of elections by the OSCE , EU , US , and even Russia , the winning candidate is unlikely to have received any votes in Ukraine 's eastern flashpoints . The central government did not manage to distribute ballot papers in Donetsk , Lukhansk and many other cities of eastern Ukraine . <p> The day after Poroshenko 's electoral victory , separatists in Donetsk tried to take over the city 's international airport . And while Poroshenko called for talks including with Russia he also ruled out negotiations with " bandits " . <p> Even though it is unclear whether local elites in the east have any clear plan for their next moves , they remain a force to be reckoned with and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ require Moscow 's support . While the Kremlin , at present , appears reluctant to incorporate the Donetsk and Luhansk regions , this is not the same as active encouragement from Russia for the separatists to stop their campaign of creating instability across the two regions of Donetsk and Luhansk . <p> In fact , continuing instability in the east may serve several constituencies well . For the separatists it could work as a short-term strategy to position themselves for an eventual bargaining process among Ukrainian oligarchs over the redistribution of the really big and attractive " cake " left behind by ousted president , Victor Yanukovych . For Russia , too , instability could be a significant bargaining chip in any negotiations , not least because this cake remains attractive to powerful players there as well . <p> At the same time , we must not forget that the EU and US , too , have their share of responsibility for the crisis in Ukraine . At some level , Ukraine is , after all , the battleground of a geopolitical competition between Russia and the West . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side , and compromises will be necessary within Ukraine and beyond . <p> Poroshenko may be the president that Ukraine needs at this critical time -- he has worked with both the pro-European and the pro-Russian political camps in the past and may be able to bridge the deep divide within Ukraine and be a credible partner to both Russia and the West . Yet , in order to deliver on the promise that his presidency at this moment still holds , he will need support to resolve the country 's political and security crisis and to stabilise its economy . Unless he can demonstrate visible progress on either front soon , voters will soon be as disappointed with him as they remain with most of the country 's current political elite . <p> In Egypt , the Great Pyramid was illuminated with the French , Russian and Lebanese flags in solidarity with victims of terrorist attacks , but most of the focus in the West has been on the victims in Paris .

Photo : Penny Stephens <p> The Abbott government has committed to hand over $1 billion to Victoria for the construction of the western stage of East West Link , even though it does not have a full business case nor even a finalised route . <p> This means the federal government has committed a total of $3 billion to the East West link road project without a full cost benefit analysis despite Tony Abbott promising before the election all projects worth more than $100 million would receive this scrutiny . <p> Officials from the government body Infrastructure Australia admitted at a Senate estimates grilling on Monday they have not seen a full business case for stage one or stage two of the project -- each of which will receive $1.5 billion from the federal government . <p> Infrastructure Australia has assessed East West link stage one as having reached the " real potential " stage , with officials conceding it was two steps behind the body 's final " ready to proceed " stage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the second western stage of the project by the end of the financial year , even though it is not even listed on Infrastructure Australia 's December 2013 priorities list , with the remaining $500 million held back until 2018-19 . <p> Under questioning from Labor senator Stephen Conroy on Monday , Infrastructure Australia officials revealed that an early assessment of the overall project estimated a benefit cost ratio of just 0.5 , that is that just 50 ? would be recouped for every $1 spent . <p> That figure has since been revised up to 0.8 , or 80c , and the Victorian government insists that if the " wider economic benefits " are included the project will produce a return of $1.40 for every $1 spent . <p> Senator Conroy asked the acting Infrastructure Coordinator John Fitzgerald what problems the road project would solve . <p> Mr Fitzgerald said " that discussion is still happening with the Victoria government " . <p> Mr Fitzgerald said Infrastructure Australia had received some " very early , very high level information " about East West stage 2 , but that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it to be a full business case " . <p> But Infrastructure Department secretary Mike Mrdak defended the allocation of $1 billion for stage 2 of the project to flow by the end of June because " I think the Australian government is keen to see the acceleration of this project " . <p> Paul Roe of Infrastructure Australia said the body had received some material about the project from the Victorian government but had not undertaken an independent cost-benefit analysis and had not received the full business case for the project . <p> " We have undertaken an assessment of the material provided to us by Victorian government , " Mr Roe said . <p> " The project East West stage one is not at ' ready to proceed ' in our categorisation .

Should they chase a programmatic strategy , or should they double down on the width of their offering ? I wonder if fans of independent publishing will look back upon the last decade as the final golden age of independent media . After two days hearing from some of the biggest players in B2B , I now think that 's at least a possibility . <h> While journalists were the victim of the Watch Dogs stunt it is PRs who will suffer <p> Following last week 's PR stunt which saw the bomb squad called to Ninemsn 's offices Lee Hall looks at whether it was a disaster for the company , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' go to ' whenever a client is looking to launch a new product or service and comes to an agency saying they want to create a ' buzz ' about what it is they are offering . And let 's face it ; stunts are one of the most fun things a PR can be involved in . <p> In the game you play Aiden Pearce , a brilliant hacker and former thug , whose criminal past led to the death of his niece and his journey to get revenge . He goes about trying to attain his vengeance by manipulating the system . <p> With Ubisoft hoping to manipulate the media , they naturally , in an unprecedented age of security consciousness and fear of terrorism , decided to send an unmarked safe to a Ninemsn journalist with a cryptic note that alluded to a voicemail that the journalist had not received . Having tried a couple of times to enter a code into the safe ( why would you even try ) the device started ticking and intrigue rapidly turned to fear . <p> The management rightly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bomb squad , which resulted in the Ninemsn team , and numerous other companies in the building , being sent home just after 3pm . When the box was finally ' diffused ' by the bomb squad it revealed a copy of the game and some promotional material . <p> So where did this stunt go wrong ? <p> The first rule of planning a stunt is to ensure that you have planned for every conceivable possibility . You try to run through every permutation and how the stunt can run smoothly , whilst being extreme enough to have the desired impact on the target audience . Secondly , execution is key to a successful stunt . <p> The journalist in question was supposed to receive a voice message the evening before , which referred to the delivery and most likely gave clues as to its nature and the code to open the box . The only problem is the journo did not receive a message , just a call from an unknown number and a hang up message . <p> The company were probably conscious not to annoy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( about the only consciousness showed throughout the entire campaign ) , and , it would appear , the PR simply gave up and thought that all would become clear with the delivery of the game . Did n't exactly go to plan did it ? <p> The failure to execute a key part of the strategy created most of the drama and could potentially have avoided the situation escalating the way it did . <p> And thirdly , the journalist in question does not do game reviews . This shows a staggering lack of strategic media targeting and planning . Like Santa Claus , any PR worth their salt makes a list and checks it twice as there is nothing worse than sending something to a journalist that does not even cover the subject at hand -- apparently Ubisoft missed this day at the PR school for Elves . <p> Understandably , the Nine MSN workers were left shaken by the stunt , as relayed through Twitter , and it wo n't do relations between Ubisoft and media company any favours either . <p> The calamitous affair has even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all time with many quick to lump it into the ' fail ' category . <p> But was it a fail ? <p> The safe contained a copy of the game , a baseball cap and a beanie . <p> Considering we live in a world where the threat of terrorism has never been higher , to embark on a campaign such as this was exceptionally risky . Add to this the company 's catastrophic failure to fulfil key elements of the strategy , that likely could have prevented it going from stunt to terror threat , and one would be forgiven for seeing it as a failure . <p> However , the aim of any stunt is to generate awareness and get coverage for whatever you 're promoting -- and this campaign did just that . No one can argue that it did n't gain coverage ( whether the right kind is a separate argument altogether ) , as it has been covered by pretty much every major website in Australia ( since being broken on this one ) and has been featured internationally . <p> The game @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the company 's history -- and who 's to know what part of that success is due to the awareness the stunt generated ? <p> However , the situation does little to dissuade people from the opinion of PR 's as opportunistic and without ethics ( which is certainly not the case ) . Whilst Ubisoft has apologised unreservedly to the journalist(s) that were left shaken by the whole affair and the ill thought out nature of the stunt in general , they will most likely be secretly be elated by the response to the game and the coverage generated . <p> The situation has undoubtedly bruised the reputation of the company in the media and also that of the company with key stakeholders , the repercussions of which are yet to be seen . <p> Somewhere along the line the company seems to have forgotten that PR is more than just about trying to attain results ; it 's about managing brand reputations and creating engaging content that does not harm anyone or anything . Somewhere in Ubisoft 's plans this ideology got left behind . <p> Ultimately , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oscar Wilde : ' the only thing worse than being talked about is not being talked about ' . In the fast paced games world where it 's necessary to strike hard and fast before the next big thing is out , this certainly seems true . I fear the damage this will do in the long run is not to the company itself , and certainly not to sales of the game , but to the targeted journalist and to perceptions of the PR industry which , let 's face it , were already fairly bleak . <h> Comments <p> Ubisoft ... between the ears , if you thought this was a good idea at any stage . <p> Bec 2 Jun 14 3:41 pm <p> " Considering we live in a world where the threat of terrorism has never been higher ... " <p> History would suggest an entirely different picture , as in there has n't been any terrorism conducted in Australia for 28 years , but do n't let that get in the way of a good rant . <p> Gum trees are statistically much more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jun 14 4:34 pm <p> Part of this capitalised on the same sort of sensationalism as Wicked Campers . Pushing the legal limits so to speak . I do n't think it was deliberate , however . I think it was a mediocre , but dumb , idea gone wrong . <p> Or right , as the outcome might demonstrate . Wicked Campers can sustain this sort of attitude , because they are not so entwined with the media companies as Ubisoft would be . Using a reviewer as media bait is not a good look . <p> Nice one JG -- I see what you have done there . Although I do n't argue it was a good idea , in fact quite the opposite I think it was poorly conceived and executed and did n't really fit with the premise of the game . What I do argue is it achieved coverage which , ultimately , was the end goal . Whether you consider any coverage ' good coverage ' is another issue . <p> Thanks Bec -- I 'll be sure to add gum trees to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , unlabelled safes . <p> Perhaps because Australia has not been the subject of a terror attack in so many years we fear it more ? Either way , you ca n't really argue that the global fear of terrorism has n't , in some small way , impregnated Australian society -- if it had n't then perhaps Nine Msn and the police would n't have called in the bomb squad . <p> @Lee -- IGN also received one of these packages and worth noting the device was never at any point ' ticking ' . It was a heavy steel safe that beeped when a code was entered into the keypad . <p> With regards to fitting the premise of the game , Watch Dogs revolves around hacking devices and gaining access to secret information , so a cloak-and-dagger theme with computerised access codes does make sense . <p> Dave 3 Jun 14 1:59 pm <p> Overhead in JB Hifi on the weekend : <p> " This was the game that did that bomb scare sh ! t .

The turnaround manager 's role is to assess the company 's financial circumstances , address short-term cash flow issues , manage stakeholders ( including creditors , suppliers and employees ) , scrutinise and test the existing business model , identify opportunities for growth and then to implement positive change . <p> More often than not , turnaround managers come from an accounting or finance background with a particular focus on distressed businesses , as their role typically requires them to undertake a detailed examination of the company 's financial information to assess the company 's solvency and the relative strengths and weaknesses of the likely underperforming business . <p> It is critical to the success of the turnaround however , that the turnaround manager is well supported by a competent and capable team @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , legal , corporate , finance , change and people management and with industry specific market and asset experience . <h> Legal issues for turnaround managers <p> To successfully implement a turnaround , it is critical that the turnaround manager understands the legal framework within which a turnaround is implemented , including : <p> how to identify insolvency ; <p> how to manage the risks and consequences of insolvency ; <p> the advantages and disadvantages of operating in an informal and/or formal insolvency environment ; <p> the nature , extent and risks of the company 's contractual rights and obligations ( eg. financier/ trade creditor/supplier/ employee ) ; and <p> the options for and implications of a financial restructuring , <p> so that they may minimise the risk to the turnaround and also their own personal liability . <p> We look at some of the more common legal issues a turnaround manager may encounter below . <p> Specific issues before a turnaround manager is appointed <p> Terms of retainer and indemnity : the turnaround manager 's powers , responsibilities and scope of appointment should be agreed and recorded upfront . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of duties and responsibilities , which can expose the turnaround manager to personal liability for negligence and also jeopardise the turnaround project . <p> Turnaround managers will also typically seek an upfront indemnity from the company or a key stakeholder . A key consideration will be the scope of the indemnity and the extent to which it will be permitted by law . <p> Solvency assessment : the starting point of any turnaround is for the turnaround manager to undertake a detailed assessment of the company 's financial position to assess its solvency . The assessment of a company 's solvency ( the ability to pay its debts as and when they fall due ) is both a legal and accounting exercise , involving the application of legal tests and considerations to actual and forecast financials and having regard to existing facts and circumstances . <p> To minimise his or her own personal risk ( including for insolvent trading as an officer or shadow director ) , the turnaround manager should obtain appropriate legal advice on the question of the company 's solvency and also on the risks of implementing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Specific issues once a turnaround manager is appointed <p> Financial instruments : the future of a distressed company is often dictated by the interests of its secured creditor(s) or large creditor groups ( eg. bond/note holder groups ) . The turnaround manager must consider and understand the nature and extent of the company 's financial and security rights and obligations , so that he or she can manage the repayment timetable and any existing or looming defaults , including the risk of cross-default across the company 's corporate instruments . <p> To facilitate a turnaround , the turnaround manager will typically negotiate and document a formal forbearance or standstill arrangement with the main creditors , whereby those creditors will forbear from exercising their enforcement rights for a defined period of time on certain conditions such as an upfront goodwill payment or an early repayment plan . The terms of such arrangements need to be carefully drafted to ensure that the company is not trading while insolvent , the company 's rights , interests and entitlements are protected and that the position of those creditors is not unreasonably advanced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suppliers : a turnaround manager will need to ensure that the company 's business continues during the turnaround , so the continued terms of supply and trade are critical . A review should be undertaken of the company 's key supply and trading contracts to understand its rights and obligations with suppliers and creditors . This will allow the turnaround manager to determine what arrangements to continue , revise , compromise or terminate . <p> A review should also involve an assessment of the company 's compliance with the Personal Property Securities Act 2009 ( Cth ) , to assess whether the company 's rights and interests in its property and goods are adequately protected . For example , a review may find that the company has not registered its security interests , holds property it considers its own but is secured to third parties , or its trading terms are insufficient to create registrable security interests , all of which would leave the company exposed to forfeiture of property . <p> Employment issues : employees can be difficult to manage during periods of corporate financial distress because job security @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the company 's employment contracts , so that the turnaround manager understands staffing requirements , ongoing liabilities and termination rights and consequences . The turnaround manager should also consider the adequacy of the existing contracts with key employees , possibly with a view to re-negotiating new terms to ensure continued service during the turnaround . <p> Financial restructuring : to put the company in the best possible position to grow and avoid any relapse in the deterioration of its financial position , a successful turnaround will typically involve a complete financial restructuring , the objective being to better structure and manage the company 's cash flow and debt levels going forward . A financial restructuring will typically involve a careful consideration of legal , regulatory and tax issues and may include recapitalisation , asset sales , debt for equity swaps and even pre-packaged transactions through a formal insolvency administration . <p> Key lesson for turnaround managers <p> With any distressed situation , early intervention is critical . <p> In our view , the key to planning , devising and implementing a successful turnaround is having the right team in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ risks , so that the turnaround manager can make informed decisions at the earliest possible time and with the least amount of personal and project risk . <p> Clayton Utz communications are intended to provide commentary and general information .

@@2538237 <p> Where are Australia 's strengths and how do we make the most of them ? Innovation and productivity guru Professor Roy Green tells Brent Balinski about the kinds of companies that thrive here and what needs to be done to encourage more of them to emerge . <p> As anyone involved in the industry can probably tell you , there are many successful Australian companies about , though they usually are n't names the average person would recognise . <p> They are generally research and knowledge-intensive , have an international mindset , and compete on value rather than price . <p> " These companies are not household names , " Professor Roy Green , Dean of the Business School at UTS since 2008 , told Manufacturers ' Monthly . <p> " They tend to operate below the radar , because many of them do n't have consumer relationships in consumer markets , they are part of value chains which have an ultimate consumer of a different overall product . " <p> These high-achievers , Green and others argue , are the future . They are suited to Australia 's high-cost environment . The problem is that we do n't have enough of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is through knowledge-based manufacturing , " said Green . <p> " We ca n't find new sources of growth simply by selling each other piccolo lattes . " <p> As revenues from resources decline , there is a need for Australia to find growth elsewhere . Manufacturing has an important role in this , Green believes . What 's needed is an environment and policy setting that help can produce innovative companies like Textor Technologies , Hoffman Engineering and ANCA . <p> The country has the requisite skills and knowledge , and , to some degree , the necessary entrepreneurial streak . <p> But there 's work to be done . And there 's a role for many to play , including government . <p> " This is something that does need to be led by government in collaboration with all the relevant stakeholders , which include the manufacturers themselves , universities , research institutions like CSIRO , " said Green . <p> " At present , compared with some other countries , we lack that ecosystem of collaboration and commitment . " <p> " The thing that 's been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which other countries do : Sweden , Denmark , Germany , UK , the United States recently , they all do some variation of a technology foresight , " he said . <p> " In other words : identifying for their countries what are the areas of existing and potential strategic and competitive advantage that they have and which they can foster , and to the extent that they have the resources to do so , to mobilise them to encourage those areas to the fullest extent . " <p> The previous government 's Prime Minister 's Taskforce on Manufacturing report - delivered in 2012 and to which Green contributed - was an example of what might be done , but lacked the comprehensiveness seen in reviews conducted by other nations . <p> " It 's scarcely believable that at the very time that all economists recognise the need to encourage and identify new sources of growth for the economy , we are cutting off the prospect of doing so at the very source , which is knowledge and innovation . " <p> Though not in the same league as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Group last month - which Green was a part of , along with other researchers , union leaders and business representatives from Boeing , Textor and Thales - was also misguided , according to the Professor . <p> Green believes it was , " Disappointing and emblematic of the government 's approach " to axe a group with " no political axe to grind and their only interest is in promoting the future of manufacturing in Australia . " <p> As in other countries , there is a role for government to play in assisting businesses adapt to the future . <p> There is also a need for services promoting not just business improvement but transformation . <p> " And this applies not just to technologies , but also to non-technological innovation , which means for example the development of new business models for companies , the development of better systems integration , improved , high-performance work and management practises , " said Green . <p> " All of these can be assisted and accelerated by good , cost-effective public policy . And we seem to be running away from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of entitlement ' . Well the issue is not about ending entitlement , it 's about identifying where our competitive future lies as a country . <p> " Until we do that , our discussions of entitlement are irrelevant . " <p> In comments that might not go down well with die-hard neo-liberalists , the Professor blames a lack of attention to industry policy over the years to a worship of market forces and a complacency driven by the country 's success in exporting raw materials . <p> He believes Australia 's long-term laziness with industry policy and subservience to free market ideology is unique . <p> Every technological hub in the world - including Silicon Valley - needed a kick along from government , he pointed out . Doing nothing and believing the market will always pick winners is not the way to exploit potential growth . <p> " In the Silicon Valley case , the role of DARPA , the Defense department , of national government , of competitive research programs have been very important . As has been national procurement policy , the SBIR -- the small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So this idea is intellectually bankrupt .

" Blood on the leaves and blood at the root ... Here is a strange and bitter crop . " <p> Rather than black lynching in the American south , the " strange fruit " hanging from trees in India are raped and abused women and girls , and 2014 looks to be a bumper year for this horrific harvest . Reading the reports , certain place names -- Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh -- struck a particular chord with me . These are places where , in researching my book on the literary and cultural history of the vagina , I had encountered some of the earliest and most violent tales of the brutalisation of women . I 'd treated those stories as scraps , merely remnants of an oral tradition which had few echoes in modern culture and which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But I was wrong -- the same stories reverberate in India today , albeit in different words . In one of the first news stories widely reported outside India , a woman was raped and murdered by a group of men on a bus in Delhi in 2012 . Since then , images of murdered Indian women have become more and more common -- and more noticed -- and it 's perhaps little surprise given the views of some of the country 's politicians . <p> Ramsewak Paikra is minister for law and order in Chhattisgarh , an Indian state whose population tops 25 million , and a member of BJP , India 's ruling party . Paikra 's statement this month that rapes " do not happen deliberately " was widely reported . " These kinds of incidents happen accidentally , " he said . <p> Chhattisgarh 's geographical neighbour is Madhya Pradesh , a massive state with three times the number of inhabitants . Its home minister is Babulal Gaur , also a BJP member , also an apologist for rape . In January he declared that fewer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modestly , and act more piously , than women in other Indian states . <p> It was n't that much of a surprise , then , when Gaur felt compelled to respond to the murder and apparent rape of two young girls found last month hanging from a mango tree in the Badaun district of Uttar Pradesh ( the children had gone into the field where their bodies were eventually found because they did not have a lavatory at home ) . " Sometimes rape 's right , " he said , " sometimes it 's wrong . " <h> Myths made real <p> When men fear women , they silence them . They rape and murder them , enacting on their victims ' bodies a furious revenge . Stories of this revenge go back generations in Madhya Pradesh where a Baiga myth tells of a woman whose vagina punishes men by amputating their penises . In the story , this mythical castration by the equally mythical " toothed vagina " , or vagina dentata , leads to a wealthy landlord commanding four men of other castes to rape and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held the girl down , and the Baiga thrust his flint into her vagina and knocked out one of the teeth . The Agaria inserted his tongs and pulled out the other two . The girl wept with the pain , but she was consoled when the landlord came in and said that he would now marry her immediately " . The idea of the marriage of consolation is almost as shocking as the idea that a woman 's sexuality and identity must be somehow forcibly tamed . In yet another story from Madhya Pradesh , a young man has his penis reinstated by the woman whose vagina amputated it ; in return he extracts her " teeth " . <p> In a ground-breaking anthropological article of the early 1940s , the **32;1392;TOOLONG Verrier Elwin cited many examples of the retelling of the vagina dentata myth arising from his extensive travels in the Indian subcontinent . <p> Most of the tales originate with the Baiga people and , each time , despite a little local colour , the vagina is a dark and vicious place . Again in Madhya Pradesh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ group of young men ; a snake emerges from her mouth and is killed ; penises magically regrow when sprinkled with ground-up vaginal tooth powder ; and a woman is cooked in a broth , the aroma of which kills the men . <p> Elwin 's accounts often featured phallic objects which were used to neutralise the vagina dentata . In a town called Dantinpur ( the ominously-named " Tooth City " ) , a custom-made iron penis dislodges offending fangs ; and an angry tigress-woman is transmuted into a Chamgedri ( a being with one orifice for all bodily functions ) . <p> In Chhattisgarh , a snake enters a woman via her vagina , and bites off the penis of a young man who attempts to rape her . Three of his brothers meet the same fate ; it is up to the youngest one to extract the snake with a stick , on condition that it magically reinstate his brothers ' penises . <p> Repeatedly , the stories focus on the necessity of subduing women ; of violently forcing them into death or marriage , having first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their vaginas . <p> Misogyny in India , then , has a long genealogy . Economic privation and a punitive , divisive caste system mean that the lives of many millions of women there are short and brutish . Violence against women and girls is deeply inscribed in languages and culture . A rape is reported in India almost once every 20 minutes -- in a population of well over one billion people , it 's beyond doubt that an unimaginably high number of attacks are going unreported . In New Delhi alone , 600 rapes were reported in 2012 . In a vastly populated country where ancient myths still reverberate in the public utterances of elected representatives , it is perhaps of little surprise that , of those 600 rapes , only one conviction has -- so far -- resulted . <h> You might also like <p> The bouquet held by Bolshy Divas member Jackie Softly represents the people with disability whose accounts of violence and abuse the Senate inquiry heard in Perth , but these are just the tip of the iceberg .

@@2564234 What it means <p> This morning Prime Minister Tony Abbott and US President Barack Obama announced the conclusion of a series of agreements between the US and Australia . Chief among these is the US -- Australia Force Posture Agreement . It details arrangements for the enhanced military cooperation measures first announced when Obama visited Australia in November 2011 . <p> The agreement has taken longer than anticipated , largely because neither side has wanted to pick up the bill for the new defence facilities required in northern Australia . That issue appears to have been resolved , and the US President made a point of acknowledging the Prime Minister 's recent commitment to rectifying shortfalls in Australian defence funding . The force posture agreement formalises existing plans to increase the rotation of US Marine Corps troops through Darwin , and to embark on trilateral military exercises in Southeast Asia . But it also the lays the foundation for new alliance defence initiatives , not least of which is a deepening Australian involvement in ballistic missile defence . <p> Though it was n't seized on by media traveling with the Prime Minister , this US statement says that ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on ballistic missile defense , including working together to identify potential Australian contributions to ballistic missile defense in the Asia-Pacific region . ' <p> Though BMD cooperation was mentioned in the last government 's Defence White Paper , it 's likely to accelerate under the Coalition government . This might mean the Australian Defence Force ( ADF ) could end up mounting advanced missiles on its Aegis-equipped air warfare destroyers , forming part of a US network in Asia equipped to shoot down hostile missiles . This cooperation is largely designed to guard against an increasingly belligerent North Korea , but will be watched keenly by China . <p> US Marine Corps rotations through Darwin will continue on their current trajectory , building to a full contingent of 2500 in 2-3 years . It is likely that the US Army will preposition military equipment and stores in Darwin too so it can respond more quickly to a crisis in South East Asia .

These initiatives will deepen the US military 's ability to mount operations from Australia , referred to by the White House as an ' anchor of peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region and beyond ' . <p> The announcements this morning also discuss strengthened space cooperation between the US and Australia .

Space-based operations are becoming a critical area of cooperation between the US and Australia -- Australia 's geography offers unique advantages , underpinned by the skills of scientists in CSIRO and DSTO . <p> A detailed public conversation is now needed on what access the US military might have to naval facilities in Western Australia . Options ranging from increased US Navy ship visits to the hosting of US submarines , aircraft carriers , and amphibious groups have been mooted .

This year 's Defence White Paper process allows an opportunity to bring the public along with what officials have been privately discussing for years . Better to lay an informed case now , rather than abruptly announce basing options at AUSMIN later this year or when the 2015 Defence White Paper is released . <p> * Disclosure : Lockheed Martin is a corporate member of the Lowy Institute .

It 's time to review how we measure students ' learning - that does n't mean abandoning grading altogether , but rather recognising that age-based grading systems do n't give us all the answers . <h> What 's wrong with letter grades ? <p> Surely a teacher 's job is to teach the curriculum appropriate to the year level , the task for students is to learn that curriculum , and the role of assessment is to judge how well students have learnt what they have been taught -- and to grade them accordingly . What could be simpler ? We grade the outputs of other production processes for their quality , why should learning be any different ? <p> The reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does not begin with a level playing field . At the beginning of each school year , students are already spread over a wide range of achievement levels . In subjects such as reading and mathematics , the least advanced 10% of students start each school year about five to six years behind the most advanced 10% of students . <p> What this means in practice is that many students begin the school year already on track to receive a low grade . The relative positions of students within an age cohort are relatively stable over time . The best predictor of success in later years of schooling is success in the earlier years . <p> It was possible to turn a blind eye to this situation when we believed that there were good learners and poor learners , and we used tests to distinguish " bright " children from those " destined " for low-skilled jobs . Today , of course , Australia 's labour market requires highly skilled workers .

In fact , research evidence show less advanced students often make greater year-on-year progress than students who begin the school year well ahead . <p> Rather than recognising the progress that individuals make , A to E grades judge all students against the same age-based expectations . A student who receives a D year after year is usually unable to see the progress they are making and , worse , may conclude that their ability to learn does n't change -- they are just a " D-student " . Little wonder that many become disengaged and eventually drop out . <p> The problem applies equally to our most advanced students . Although some students work hard for high grades , many are not challenged and extended by age-based expectations .

Rather , it is a call for better information about the progress that individuals make . High-performing countries understand this and expect every student to make excellent learning progress . <p> Second , we need better ways of establishing , understanding and reporting the points that individuals have reached in their learning so that appropriate goals can be set for each student 's further learning .

T6 AWD in a V40 ..... <p> Peter <p> The existing V40T5 5 pot turbo is much more economical than the previous version ( used in the s40T5 ) , and gives more power . After the first 300 kms or so of mainly city driving , and driven fairly enthusiastically but not stupidly , ours is getting 10.2l/100km as opposed to about 11.5 to 12 in the s40T5 . And usually fuel economy is worse when the cars are new , in my experience ( or is that just because you drive them harder when they are a new toy ? ) .

@@2607238 <h> Workers slow to take advantage of anti-bullying measures <p> When the Fair Work Commission announced its new bullying measures , there were predictions of 67 bullying complaints per week . <p> Six months on , those fears have proved unwarranted . A report from the commission showed that only about 150 applications were made in the first quarter of the year . <p> HopgoodGanim partner Andrew Tobin , associate Abigail Vipond and trainee solicitor Adele Garnett said that while the jurisdiction may be a " slow burner " to start with , they predicted that it would gather momentum as more employees became aware of their rights under the legislation . <p> In a piece they wrote for Lexology , they highlighted the key considerations for employers based on some of the bullying cases that have come before the commission and the courts . <p> The nature of bullying behaviour Tobin , Vipond and Garnett wrote that although the Fair Work Act 2009 defines bullying as behaviour by a person in a workplace that is repeated , it does not necessarily have to be long-standing behaviour . In a recent decision from the Queensland Supreme Court , an employee was awarded more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bullied by her new manager for just 11 days . The worker made a complaint to her business manager , but it was not taken seriously or investigated and she was told to , " put some lippy on and go home to your bub " . <p> Who can apply for a stop-bullying order ? The anti-bullying jurisdiction only applies to those employer by a " constitutionally covered business " which rules out the employees of some charities , businesses that are not incorporated and state government employees . In one instance , an application was dismissed because the employee worked for a government-funded , not-for-profit provider of free services to vulnerable people , which was deemed not to be a constitutionally covered business . <p> Can past bullying behaviour be taken into account ? The commission 's full bench has emphasised that while anti-bullying orders are to " operate prospectively " , behaviour that took place before the anti-bullying measures were implemented can be taken into account because the legislation is " basing future action on past events " . <p> Can a stop-bullying order be issued to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrote that it would be difficult to foresee a situation in which it would occur , but in one case , an application for an order was dismissed as the applicant had had their employment terminated . His dismissal meant that the stop-bullying order would have had no reasonable chance of success , as one of the requirements for making an order is that that commission must be satisfied that there is a risk of the bullying behaviour at work continuing . <p> Key takeaways for employers from HopgoodGanim <p> Deal with bullying complaints as soon as you are made aware of them -- this is when you are put on notice that there is a reasonably foreseeable risk of psychiatric injury to the employee . If a breach of the duty to provide a safe working environment subsequently occurs and is proven , in addition to a possible complaint arising under the FWA 's bullying provisions , you may be liable for significant damages due to negligence . <p> Bullying does not need to be long-term to significantly affect the health and wellbeing of employees . <p> Having a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is followed . The way complaints are dealt with can be a significant stressor , and an inappropriate response to a complaint can heighten an employee 's sense of isolation and vulnerability and increase the probability of a psychiatric injury . <p> Train your employees on your bullying and harassment policy and arrange for them to complete a test at the end which they must sign and date to ensure they acknowledge and understand the policy . Retain the test on the employee 's personnel file so that you can produce evidence of the training , if required . <p> The jurisdictions that an employee can use to address a problem if they feel bullied are varied , and can include a workers ' compensation and/or negligence claim , a workplace health and safety complaint , a Fair Work stop bullying complaint or an adverse action complaint , and even a discrimination complaint in some circumstances . The complaint avenues and extent of liability , as well as the potential impact on valued employees , makes it essential that you have appropriate policies and procedures in place that treat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 7:47:30 AM <p> Some individuals who have been targeted in the past may have been of the belief that they would be able to access this new process , only to find that because of the ' limitations ' placed i.e. who is covered , that they had no access . <p> It might also be the case that some have been waiting to see whether or not this new process works in favour of the target , the alleged bully or the organisation . <p> In some situations , the target may be building a ' dossier ' recording all incidents that will actually support the need to show a pattern of behaviour or conduct . This might be difficult when the behaviours used to target them vary and to the outsider or casual observer , the behaviours might appear as isolated or random incidents , when in fact , they form a pattern . <p> It might also be the case that despite a well documented policy and procedure , and the provision of training , some targets may not feel safe in reporting incidents .

Minor negative conflict can escalate to bullying allegations . <p> Those who have responsibility and accountability for dealing with or investigating negative workplace conflict need to be trained so that their actions do not contribute to the escalation or further litigation . <p> by Delia9/07/2014 12:43:30 PM <p> Very thought provoking Bernie .

Photo : James Davies <p> The Australian Securities and Investments Commission has sensationally intervened in South African retailer Woolworths ' $2.2 billion takeover of David Jones and $213 million mop-up offer for Country Road . <p> Showing its hand for the first time since ragtrader Solomon Lew threatened the David Jones deal by emerging with a 9.9 per cent blocking stake , ASIC is attempting to force David Jones and Woolworths to provide more information to shareholders before they meet on July 14 to consider the offer . <p> As flagged by The Australian Financial Review , ASIC is concerned that Mr Lew will receive a multimillion-dollar " collateral benefit " by selling his 11.8 per cent stake in Country Road to Woolworths . The commission believes the collateral benefit to Mr Lew should be valued by an independent expert and included in a supplementary report to David Jones shareholders before the scheme meeting . <p> ASIC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ owning 100 per cent of Country Road and 100 per cent of David Jones could affect the value of its $4 a share offer for David Jones and should be taken into account by shareholders . <p> However , David Jones is arguing against the need for an independent valuation and is proposing instead a " letter of comfort " from independent expert Grant Samuel which says the offer for Country Road does not change the value of the David Jones offer . <p> ASIC failed in its attempt to stop David Jones from despatching the letter from Grant Samuel , which continues to believe the Woolworths offer is fair and reasonable and in the best interests of shareholders . <p> In the Federal Court in Sydney on Wednesday , Justice Kathleen Farrell ruled that David Jones was not required to obtain an independent valuation of the collateral benefits and that the letter of comfort should suffice . <h> Related Quotes <h> Company Profile <p> But she noted the limited time frame , the " practical difficulties " when dealing with listed companies that were also competitors and the difficulties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Woolworths owns 88.1 per cent , Mr Lew 11.7 per cent and the free float is only 0.2 per cent . <h> Lew 's only chance to dispose of Country Road <p> Justice Farrell noted that Country Road shares had traded between $3.30 and $16.40 over the last 12 months and said the value of the collateral benefit " could be $4 to $14 a share , picking numbers out of the air " . <p> " It 's either some benefit or a really big benefit , " she said . <p> She said Woolworths made its offer for David Jones well before the developments at Country Road and said if shareholders were unhappy they could vote against the scheme . <p> However , she questioned whether shareholders would be willing to vote against the deal on the basis of a benefit to Mr Lew , or " cut off my nose to spite my face " . <p> The David Jones shareholder meeting , which has already been delayed two weeks , will go ahead as planned on July 14 . Country Road has appointed Lonergan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Woolworths offer . <p> This report is expected to be completed by July 10 or 11 , just days before the David Jones shareholder meeting . <p> ASIC , meanwhile , will continue to watch developments closely and has not ruled out taking further action . <p> In its submission to the court , ASIC said it " is concerned that the consideration to be received by Mr Lew under the Country Road takeover offer , offends the equality of opportunity principle enshrined in section 602 ( c ) of the Corporations Act . ASIC suspects that the price of $17 per share offer for Country Road is in substance the offer of a benefit to a substantial shareholder . The Country Road takeover offer enables Mr Lew to dispose of his otherwise highly illiquid holding in Country Road to the only likely buyer of the shares , " the submission said . <p> " The purchase of Mr Lew 's stake under the terms of the CRL takeover offer depends on the David Jones scheme being approved by shareholders and the court .

" <p> If ASIC decides to raise objections at a second court hearing in July , or ? withholds a letter of approval , the entire $2.4 billion deal could come unstuck . <h> Lew keeps his cards close <p> Justice Farrell noted ASIC 's concerns and said the second court hearing would be " abnormally interesting " . <p> It was also revealed in court that David Jones has asked Mr Lew not to vote his 9.9 per cent stake in the department store chain at the scheme meeting and wants him to disclose his voting intentions before the meeting . <p> However , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at war with Woolworths and Country Road for 17 years , is keeping his plans close to his chest . <p> If Mr Lew refuses David Jones 's request and votes his shares , David Jones plans to " tag " his shares so the impact on voting on the shareholder vote can be assessed . <p> Woolworths needs support from 50 per cent of shareholders and 75 per cent of the shares voted for the scheme to proceed . With 9.9 per cent , Mr Lew would struggle to block the vote , but it is unclear whether he holds voting rights to other shares that are undisclosed .

Reviewing , Dale states , is not financially rewarding . But that depends on how good you are , where you publish , and what you consider a reasonable supplementary income . Even " insightful reviews " , Dale asserts , earn A$120 . Where has he been , and what does he read ? Many newspapers and magazines pay more than that . <p> At Australian Book Review ( ABR ) , which I edit , our minimum payment is A$300 , and often we pay far more than that . <p> Scholars , Dale claims , wo n't work for low pay . In my experience , scholars are much more generous than that . ( The Conversation -- which , as a non-profit , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to such generosity . ) I have been consistently impressed by the readiness of busy academics to take on serious , lengthy reviews . <p> Nor , I believe , are they in the habit of limiting the task to a single day .

" We all know what a good review is , " Dale goes on tantalisingly , suggesting that " for the writer a good review is anything positive written by someone who understands the intentions of your work " ( my emphasis ) . <p> Are authors really so needful , so undiscriminating ? Shrewd authors , in my experience , look for original and illuminating engagements with their books : not approbation . <p> Worryingly , Dale claims that because many reviews are " contradictory " a large number of our writers are manic depressives .

@@2629232 <h> Christian army officer Bernie Gaynor pays the price for marching out of step with top generals <h> Paul Sheehan <p> The Australian Army will terminate Major Bernie Gaynor 's commission tomorrow . It is not difficult to see why . Gaynor has accused the army 's higher leadership of cowardice . <p> He has made the claim publicly , repeatedly , and in various forms . He has predicted the moral cowardice of the army 's leadership would inevitably lead to a complete waste of the service and sacrifices made by thousands of Australian military personnel in Afghanistan and Iraq . <p> This has not gone down well . On June 30 , the chief of the Defence Force , General David Hurley , AC , DSC , on his last day in the job , wrote to Gaynor detailing why he was no longer fit to serve in the Army Reserve . <p> Gaynor served three tours of duty in Iraq while serving in Army intelligence . In a column published on March 17 , I quoted a speech he had given to a conference in Melbourne : " It is my unpleasant duty to inform you that the Australian Defence Force @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shaped partly by the triumph of bureaucratic administration over battlefield considerations but mostly by political correctness ... <p> Advertisement <p> " The ADF has a fundamentally flawed understanding of Islam . Just look at Iraq . I was one of the last Australians to serve there . All the politicians and military hierarchy were saying the withdrawal of Western military force was based on success . And yet al-Qaeda today controls more of Iraq than it ever did while Western forces were in the country ... " <p> That was four months ago . It is much worse now . What Gaynor has predicted has spread , deepened and metastasised into Afghanistan . <p> " While everyone is watching the spread of the Islamic state in Iraq and Syria , we 're not noticing that areas where British and American troops fought and died in Afghanistan are being taken by the Taliban even before NATO forces have left the country ... Helmand Province is being overrun by the Taliban . It is next to Oruzgan Province , where the Australian military was deployed and 40 Australians died . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agencies have reported dozens have been killed in fighting in Helmand Province as the Taliban committed hundreds of fighters to attacking Afghan army posts . <p> " You have a responsibility not to leave complete chaos but that is what we have done by leaving things half-baked , " Gaynor said , describing the bloody schisms that have opened in Iraq , Syria and Afghanistan in the wake of the departure of US and NATO forces from the region . <p> " The mission in Afghanistan was based on an absurd plan . Even the NATO mission statement said it was to set up a state under Sharia law . This is absurd if the object is to set up a democracy . " <p> As an example of the army 's wishful thinking he pointed to an interview given by General Hurley to the ABC on March 26 last year : " But in the end , on January 1 , 2015 , we remain confident that , with the continuing support of the international community , the Afghan institutions of state , including the army and the police @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ newly elected Afghan president and government to start to do the things that they want to do for their people . " <p> In retrospect , this sounds worse than naive . It sounds like a basic misreading of a nation shaped for centuries by tribalism , Islam and the rule by force . <p> None of this is why Gaynor is being drummed out of the army . Rather , Gaynor sees this military failure as a symptom of a cultural issue over which he was willing to sacrifice his army career : his Christian faith . On this issue , by his own admission , he has been a provocateur and a serial litigator . <p> He formally protested the decision by the army to allow service personnel to march , in uniform , in the Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras . He argued that army personnel are barred from participating in political activities while in uniform and that the Mardi Gras is a political event as defined by its own articles of association . <p> He also pointed out that Mardi Gras had a long history of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over its opposition to same-sex marriage . Gaynor , who is Catholic , argued this was offensive to many Catholics , who make up about 40 per cent of military personnel . <p> The army 's " quick assessment " response to his complaint even conceded his core points while dismissing his complaint : <p> " The ADF traditionally avoids overt support of specific political viewpoints . By allowing official participation in the 2013 Mardi Gras by uniformed personnel the ADF could be seen as now being comfortable in supporting politically polarising issues . <p> " If a uniformed member were to support a gathering that insulted strongly held beliefs of a religion other than Christianity ( to use Gaynor 's example ) , vilifying Islam with ' Mohammad is Gay ' signs ... that member would be severely dealt with . In the case of the Mardi Gras , the opposite occurred . " <p> Gaynor half-won that argument but he over-stepped the army 's mark by using his private blog to wage a cultural war against what he calls politically correct policies . Eventually , Major-General A.J. Campbell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , army does not share your views , which are both offensive and divisive and not in the interests of army or our people . ' ' <p> This view was ultimately confirmed by the Chief of the Defence Force . Gaynor will thus be gone tomorrow . <p> Gone , too , regrettably , is the credibility of Australia 's military missions in Iraq and Afghanistan . The army will need to confront the reasons for this abject waste of blood and money , given that jihad against the West and western liberalism , being waged by militant Islamists , has a long , long way to run . <h> 194 comments <p> As best as I can figure it , after a dozen years of bloodshed and catastrophe , is that the Bush-Blair-Howard troika got it all completely wrong from day one .

The genomic and inherent differences between rodent and human physiology are increasingly acknowledged , and even non-human primates have many differences in the epigenome that fundamentally affect the functionality of the genome and may account for their lack of success in predicting clinical response .

It should also have said that Woolworths had committed to having 90 stores in 2016 , not 150 . <p> Woolworths boss Grant O'Brien is desperate for the market not to declare his home improvement operation , Masters , a man-made disaster but with only three months left before its US joint venture partner , Lowes , gets the opportunity to sell its share to Woolworths it 's clear that time is not O'Brien 's friend . <p> Woolworths still maintains it can get the home improvement business to break even by 2016 as does the British hardware expert , Matt Tyson , it imported to fix it up . By then it will have notched up five years and should have rolled out 150 stores . <p> But there remains a credibility gap -- not the least of which is because according to figures periodically released by Lowes , Masters ' financial performance appears to be going backwards . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course of the 2014 and 2015 financial years Masters will lose $300 million but is more concerned about the possibility Woolworths may need to pay Lowes up to $800 million to buy its 33 per cent . <p> Originally this put option was to expire last year but it was extended until October this year and one has to wonder whether Lowes would be willing to further extend it given that the Masters losses continue to mount . <p> Clearly the creation of Masters has not gone to its original plan -- a point made abundantly clear a year ago when management admitted it had made a series of mistakes in its Masters network and Danks hardware wholesaling operations -- overestimating sales and gross margins , underestimating labour costs and the impact of seasonality , and getting wrong parts of its product range . Back then Masters director and the mastermind of the strategy , Melinda Smith , told investors Woolworths did n't know much about the seasonal curves of the home improvement industry and it did n't have the right stock in some instances . <p> The investor briefing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Labour costs are different in Australia to the US , " she said . " Christmas in the US is in the middle of winter , which is different to Australia .

However if the losses do n't begin to lighten in 2015 , their patience may run out . <p> But like Fitch other analysts have also noted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attractive as Bunnings with many rolled out into less densely populated areas rather than more central metro locations . Troubled though it may be -- it 's not big enough to make a meaningful dent in Woolworths ' earnings profile . <p> On key credit drivers Fitch remains relaxed about Woolworths , noting that the combination of being number one in market share in supermarkets and its high proportion of defensive revenues delivers strong investment grade characteristics .

It would be quite na ? ve to envisage that the World Cup should have the capacity to bring world peace , fix global inequality , stamp out racism and overcome other issues espoused by various academic , media and public commentators in recent weeks . <p> On balance , however , the World Cup as an institution is a force for global good -- for a number of reasons . First , the tournament brings the world together . FIFA has 209 national football associations affiliated to it that compete in the various competitions it organises . These members also aim to qualify for the World Cup finals every four years . <p> Bosnia and Herzegovina became the 77th nation to participate in the World Cup finals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compete in the World Cup finals , over the years many countries have qualified . In 2014 , Bosnia and Herzegovina became the 77th country to take part in the World Cup . This high level of global participation is unprecedented among sporting events and provides many opportunities for international contact and soft diplomacy . <p> Second , football is played in all countries around the world , by both sexes , all classes , all shapes and sizes , in diverse venues and by groups who are marginalised in certain societies . There are men 's and women 's world cups , youth world cups , the Homeless World Cup and various disability football competitions . It truly is the " world game " . <p> Football 's growth , while owing much to the game 's intrinsic nature , is also indebted to the World Cup , which is now approaching its centenary .

Global participation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , plays a major role in creating cohesion . <p> The US , a country of more than 300 million people , was eliminated by Belgium.EPA/Erik S.

China , the new world superpower , topped the 2008 and ran second in the 2012 Olympic medal table but failed to qualify for the 2014 World Cup . In Brazil , the US made it to second round where it was eliminated by Belgium , a country with 1/30th of its population . <p> Costa Rica , most famous for its bananas , made it to the last eight , while an Islamic country , Algeria , was unlucky not to get into the final eight . The former colonial powers of England , Spain , Portugal and Italy were knocked out in the group stages .

When anything negative happens , such as the Luis Suarez biting incident , it is condemned by all and action is taken . <p> While many of the athletes are multi-millionaires their participation in the World Cup transcends money . The Greek team was motivated to do well to bring joy to their nation , which has been reeling from economic hardships . Despite their domestic difficulties , Iraq fought valiantly to qualify . No matter what the national circumstances , the World Cup motivates youth around the world to play football and be better human beings . In this way , it plays an important role in transgenerational development . <p> Fifth , the standard of play at the World Cup has surpassed all expectations and continues to draw in new fans . There have been plenty of goals and most teams in most games played positive football . In the round of 16 , five of the eight games went to extra time . <p> The beauty of football is not the blow-out scores ( see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closeness of games .

@@2674235 <h> Explainer : why do snakes flick their tongues ? <h> Author <h> Disclosure statement <p> Andrew Durso does not work for , consult , own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article , and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond the academic appointment above . <p> Many people think a snake 's forked tongue is creepy . Every so often , the snake waves it around rapidly , then retracts it . Theories explaining the forked tongues of snakes have been around for thousands of years . Aristotle reasoned that it provided snakes with " a twofold pleasure from savours , their gustatory sensation being as it were doubled " . <p> Italian astronomer Giovanni Hodierna thought snake tongues were for cleaning dirt out of their noses . Some 17th century writers claimed to have watched snakes catch flies or other animals between the forks of their tongues , using them like forceps . It is a common myth even today that snakes can sting you with their tongues . But none of those hypotheses is likely . <p> Most animals with tongues use them for tasting , to clean themselves or others , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , including humans , also use them to make sounds . Snakes do not use their tongues for any of these things . Over the past 20 years , Kurt Schwenk , an evolutionary biologist at the University of Connecticut , has been working on understanding the function of snake tongues , and " smelling " is the closest description of what snakes do with their tongues . <h> Tongues that smell <p> Snakes use their tongues for collecting chemicals from the air or ground . The tongue does not have receptors to taste or smell . Instead , these receptors are in the vomeronasal , or Jacobson 's Organ , which is in the roof of the mouth . Once inside the Jacobson 's Organ , different chemicals evoke different electrical signals which are relayed to the brain . <p> It was once thought that the tongue delivered chemicals directly to the Jacobson 's Organ , because both the organ and the pathways that lead to it are paired just like the tips of the tongue . But X-ray movies have revealed that the tongue does not move inside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has collected onto pads on the floor of the mouth as the mouth is closing . <p> It is most likely that these pads deliver the sampled molecules to the entrance of the Jacobson 's Organ when the floor of the mouth is elevated to come into contact with the roof following a tongue flick . The case for this is strengthened because geckos , skinks , and other lizards lack deeply-forked tongues but still deliver chemicals to their vomeronasal organs . <h> Smelling in 3-D <p> Because it is forked , the tongue of a snake can collect chemical information from two different places at once , albeit places that are fairly close together by human standards . When snakes spread the tips of their tongues apart , the distance can be twice as wide as their head . This is important because it allows them to detect chemical gradients in the environment , which gives them a sense of direction -- in other words , snakes use their forked tongues to help them smell in three dimensions . Owls use their asymmetrical ears in this way to detect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ similar neural circuitry to compare the signal strength delivered from each side of the body and determine the direction that a smell or a sound is coming from . Humans do this with their hearing too , but not as effectively . <p> This makes it possible for snakes to follow trails left by their prey or potential mates . In the 1930s , before guidelines on the ethical use of animals in research were as strict , German biologist Herman Kahmann experimentally removed the forked part of snakes ' tongues and found that they could still respond to smells , but that they had lost their ability to follow scent trails . These results were refined and confirmed during the 1970s . <h> Sniffing out sex <p> In the 1980s , snake biologist Neil Ford at the University of Texas at Tyler watched how male garter snakes used their tongues when they were following pheromone trails left behind by females . He found that if both tips of the male snake 's tongue fell within the width of the trail , the snake continued slithering straight ahead . However @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ edge of the trail , the snake turned his head away from that tip and back towards the pheromone trail , and his body followed . <p> Following this simple rule allowed the snakes to perform trail-following behaviour that was both accurate and directed . If both tongue tips ever touched the ground outside of the trail , the male would stop and swing his head back and forth , tongue-flicking , until he relocated the trail . <p> Scent-trailing is probably also quite helpful to snakes tracking down prey , including for sit-and-wait predators like vipers , which have evolved smelly but non-toxic venom components to help them relocate their bitten and envenomated prey . <p> Snakes often wave their tongues in the air without putting them in contact with anything . The tongue creates air vortices , such as those formed in the water behind a boat . These vortices drift away from the boat as they form . Bill Ryerson , a student in the Schwenk lab , found that vortices created in the air by snake tongues have a special property -- they do not drift @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where they can be sampled repeatedly as the tongue skirts the part of each vortex where the air velocity is the highest . <p> Oscillating tongue-flicks are unique to snakes . They allow snakes to sample 100 times as much air as the simple downward extension of the tongue . The tongue then transfers these molecules to the Jacobson 's Organ via the mouth floor . Evidence suggests that male Copperheads can also find and follow females using oscillating tongue-flicks to detect airborne pheromones , although the details of how they determine direction using such dispersed and transient odours are still poorly understood .

Around $300 million was spent on the DES-DMS program in the 2013-14 financial year . <p> But the increase in work being given to non-government providers has angered unions . CPSU Deputy President Lisa Newman slammed the " brutal market reallocation " of CRS Australia 's contract , which is due to expire in June 2015 . <p> " The CRS often handles the most difficult cases that the private sector is not equipped to deal with , " Ms Newman said . <p> " They employ more allied health professionals than are generally found in private sector competitors and that means the quality of the service they provide is far in excess of the private sector .

This 20,979 figure comes from labs confirming the presence of the virus in samples sent to them by doctors working in hospitals or in the community . <p> This is known as notification data and placing too much reliance on these data can lead to an exaggeration of seasonal severity because testing has become more widespread and frequent . <p> Testing increased after the 2009 swine flu pandemic , with increased flu awareness among doctors and more labs performing tests . Increased testing has meant increased notifications , but not necessarily increased disease or severity . <p> This graph of nationally notified cases puts 2014 in perspective : <p> National Notifiable Diseases Database <p> While influenza can be a serious and even life-threatening illness , most infections are mild and self-limiting , and the 2014 season is unlikely to be any different . <p> There 's certainly been a rise in cases this year but we do n't yet know how high it will go . As the table above shows , it 's now a bit higher than 2013 , but we do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or has already peaked . <p> The 2013 season was late and mild , so it 's not really surprising that there are more cases this year than at the corresponding time last year . <h> The 2014 flu season so far <p> This is what we know about this year 's flu season : outbreaks have been reported in aged-care residential facilities , even where staff and resident vaccination coverage have been high . And in the community , younger people are seeing doctors with influenza-like illnesses . <p> Sounds pretty bad , right ? It is but it 's also a little more complex than is usually acknowledged . And that 's often because acknowledging complexity can make public health messaging and vaccine marketing more difficult . So this is what you need to know . <p> First , influenza is a common infection that has a very wide clinical spectrum ; infection can occur without any symptoms , without fever , or with a few mild respiratory symptoms . A recent five-year study from England , for instance , found less than half of all laboratory confirmed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may also be associated with serious respiratory and other symptoms requiring intensive care admission . <p> So , most infections are mild and resolve on their own but we obviously want to prevent serious infections . Vaccination is the best prevention measure but it is by no means perfect . <h> The flu vaccine <p> The important thing here is that vaccines are n't all created equal . Rubella and measles vaccines are about 90% effective at preventing disease but the type of flu vaccines we have in Australia ( inactivated vaccines ) are only about 50% to 70% effective . <p> What this means is that people should not expect to be protected from influenza just because they have been vaccinated . What they should expect is a decrease in their risk of infection . Most years that overall risk should be halved . <p> Another thing to keep in mind is that when we estimate the effectiveness of the influenza vaccine , we 're only estimating protection against disease we can identify . <p> We do n't know , for instance , whether the vaccine has a beneficial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the vaccine usually change every year , the effectiveness of the vaccine varies by year . <h> It gets more complicated <p> Although we can all get flu from any type of the influenza virus , people of different ages are likely to suffer adverse outcomes from different types . <p> The virus known as swine flu , which is the influenza subtype H1N1 , for instance , is more likely to infect younger people , but the consequences of infection are still worse for older people if they 're infected . <p> But the aged-care facility outbreaks reported this season have mostly been caused by a different subtype of influenza virus , H3N2 . This is the subtype generally associated with more severe influenza seasons . Although H1N1 dominated the season early , we 're now seeing the emergence of H3N2 viruses . <p> The influenza vaccines available in Australia are made of the components of three flu viruses -- H1N1 , H3N2 and B.

It presents with a wide clinical spectrum , from infection without any symptoms to infection leading to death .

Over the next few weeks , many of us will be infected without even knowing it . And a small number of us will become seriously ill .

@@2701233 <p> In the early days of the crisis several weeks ago Abbott wanted to put 1000 Australian troops onto the crash site in conjunction with 1000 Dutch troops . Nothing better testifies to his outrage at the event and his keenness to deploy Australian assets in a cause that affected Australians . This option remained on the table for a few days . <p> It was never going to be viable . Yet debate around this idea continued before the Prime Minister was talked around and decided it was too dangerous and inappropriate an option . Putting Australian troops into that highly charged situation would have been far too risky . <p> Yet it offers insights into Abbott 's approach to military issues : he is impatient with limitations relating to logistics and deployment . When Australians are involved Abbott wants to make a difference as soon as possible . <p> Kelly 's claim is not sourced but assuming it is true , the idea presumably foundered on the fact that such a deployment could only have happened with Russian acquiescence , which was never likely . Still , the instinct to consider such a large deployment is telling , as is Kelly 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who want to put the brakes on such initiatives . I have heard a similar account of Abbott 's disposition from another source . <p> ' Abbott 's every instinct is to deploy Australian military and police assets and he needs to be persuaded by his advisers from such options ' , says Kelly . He might have added that , on MH370 and Operation Sovereign Borders as well , Abbott also chose to get the military involved . <p> But against this we need to weigh the fact that Abbott was wary of America 's proposed military intervention in Syria in 2013 , which President Obama abandoned at the last moment ( Abbott : ' We have to be very careful because if we break something , we own it . ' ) . And although Abbott was a supporter of the 2003 invasion of Iraq , he has since defended it in only the most qualified and diffident ways . <p> Furthermore , Kelly makes much of Abbott 's ' profound moral code ' and how it affects his approach to foreign policy . But Kelly 's examples @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have argued elsewhere , Australia has no major foreign policy interests in play . It 's easier to show moral rectitude when very little is at stake . <p> At the core of this debate is the question of Abbott 's political identity . Yes , he is a conservative , but this masks the fact that Abbott 's worldview draws from two distinct sources which can not comfortably co-exist : British conservatism ( cautious , realist , wary of military adventurism ) and American neo-conservatism ( Manichean , confrontational , willing to impose democracy by force ) . <p> Depending on the quotes you choose , Abbott could belong to either tradition . It is not yet clear that he has made a choice between them .

@@2709240 <p> Whenever I tell people I work with solar cells I am asked the same two questions : are they ever going to be really cheap ? And can you get me some ? While the answer to the second question is no , the answer to the first is a lot more positive . Year on year , solar panels have been plunging in price and improving in the efficiency with which they can convert light into energy . <p> At the same time fossil fuel costs continue to rise , and in the next few years we will reach the point where the costs overlap -- some figures suggest this may have already happened . The question is not whether solar energy can supplant fossil fuels as the cheapest means to produce energy , but rather when . <p> While this has provided an enormous boost to the solar industry , the main excitement in the solar sector today is due to a new type of material called perovskite . Combining some of the best qualities of more mainstream materials , it has proved incredibly flexible -- to the point that University of Sheffield researchers have manufactured perovskite solar cells as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's the buzz around it ? <p> Solar cells , the component of solar panels that reacts to light , are built from what are known as photovoltaic materials . When light hits these materials electrons are freed to move through the material . With careful design of the structure of these solar cells , these electrons can be collected into a flow of electrical current . This is the process that provides the somewhat magical property of solar panels -- sunlight in and electricity out . <h> Inside a solar panel <p> Broadly speaking , solar cells can be divided into two distinct groups -- those based on inorganic photovoltaic materials , such as silicon or cadmium telluride , and those based on specific organic compounds , such as PCDTBT . Both have their own respective advantages and disadvantages . <p> The inorganic materials are already industrially well-established , capable of converting light to electricity at greater than 20% efficiency and create solar panels with more than 25-year lifespans . The downside is that the raw materials required , particularly with silicon , can be expensive . <p> Organic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even be manufactured from a liquid solution , which makes them very fast and cheap to produce . However , even on a laboratory-scale , organic solar cells struggle to achieve efficiencies of more than 10% . Even more crucially , the organic compounds gradually decompose under light , often reducing panel lifetime to the order of months or weeks rather than years . Consequently these organic materials have rarely been used to produce solar panels , as no one likes the idea of having to climb on their roof to replace them every six months . Ideally we want a solar cell with the performance and long term stability of inorganic materials with the ultra-low cost of organic materials . <h> Enter perovskite <p> In the past few years solar energy research has witnessed the emergence of a remarkable new class of materials known as perovskites . This is a hybrid organic-inorganic material , essentially an organic compound with an inorganic element attached . Perovskite refers to the specific type of crystal structure , which occurs naturally in certain minerals . These hybrid compounds have this crystal structure but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ groups with inorganic lead iodide or lead chloride molecules attached . <p> The reason for the excitement surrounding these materials is the frankly staggering rate at which they have developed . Previously whenever a new material was discovered it had taken some 10-20 years of research to reach an efficiency rate of even 10% . Perovskite solar cells only emerged in 2012 , but have already clocked up conversions of more than 19% efficiency . This blistering rate of development is unprecedented in solar research . <p> As a hybrid material , as well as boasting good efficiencies as with inorganic materials , perovskites can also take advantage of organic solar materials ' capacity to be applied as a liquid solution . This is what Professor David Lidzey 's group at the University of Sheffield has taken advantage of , spraying the perovskite as a liquid coating onto a substrate material . This allows solar cells to be manufactured at high volumes and low cost . <h> The future <p> Does this mean that all future solar cells will be based on perovskites ? It 's far too early to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a number of key challenges to be overcome . <p> There are some questions regarding the potential environmental impact of the lead content of the material ( although work is ongoing to remove the requirement for lead ) and how easily production can be up-scaled to a useful commercial size . As with organic solar cells , their long term stability is also highly questionable and they are particularly sensitive to moisture -- a few drops of water can completely destroy the material . <p> So building a perovskite solar panel module capable of surviving for decades outdoors is most likely still some way off -- in fact there 's no guarantee it 's even possible . But what is for certain is that the potential of perovskite solar cells is staggering , and if the material 's promise can be realised it could completely revolutionise the capabilities of solar energy . 
@@2712231 <p> The head of Australia 's competition watchdog has hit back at claims that a proposal to stop big businesses from excluding smaller players from the marketplace , is ' economically dangerous ' . <p> The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission wants the Federal Government to amend the ' misuse of market power law ' by introducing an ' effects test ' , which would allow for more scrutiny of businesses trying to purposefully damage their competitors . <p> Chairman of the ACCC , Rod Sims , says an effects test could benefit farmers competing with supermarkets that sell home-brand products . <p> " Large businesses , they are the ones who are concerned about this , " he said . <p> " They are concerned because their actions would be put under scrutiny because obviously it only affects the firm with a lot of market power . <p> " If you do n't have a lot of market power , it does n't affect you , so that 's where a lot of the opposition 's coming from . " <p> " We 're trying to get the focus of misuse of market power on its effect on the process of competition , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's got a narrow purpose effect , which requires that you find that , in doing the action that caused the problem , you in some way took advantage of your market power . Did you do something a firm without market power could n't have done ? <p> " So the combination of the narrowness of the way purpose is interpreted means it does n't affect the competitive process as we would like , and the way ' taking advantage ' is interpreted means that it only applies in a very limited range of circumstance . <p> " So this would broaden the focus on basically exclusionary behaviour . " <p> Some economists say an effects test would encourage anti-competitive behaviour , and the former head of the ACCC , Graeme Samuel , has said it 's a bad move economically . <p> " This is saying that only big businesses are prohibited from engaging in any conduct at all that might have a substantially anti-competitive effect , " he said . <p> " We think that that is economically very dangerous indeed , because what it does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in normal , commercial behaviour . " <p> But Mr Sims says that argument is ridiculous . <p> " I think those comments are extremely exaggerated , " he said . <p> " If you 're good at what you do and you out-compete everybody , of course it wo n't get caught . That is a nonsense argument . " <p> The ACCC is currently suing supermarket chain Coles for behaving unconscionably towards 200 of its suppliers , by pressuring them to make payments , in essence to improve the supermarket 's profit margin . <p> Rod Sims says section 46 - or misuse of market power - could n't be used in that case , because it 's a law that exists only between competitors . <p> But he says it could be used to stop big businesses from buying up an unnecessary amount of land . <p> " So if I 'm a big company and I buy up all the land , so that nobody else can build a competing facility , at the moment , you face the problem of firstly you 'd have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preclude competition and , of course , you wo n't find anything written down to that effect . <p> " And secondly , you have to show that a company without substantial market power could n't have done that . Well , of course , all companies buy land . <p> " So the test is just very hard to use . If the law was changed the way we 're advocating , and somebody bought up all the land to exclude their competitor , you 'd have a much more appropriate way for assessing that behaviour . " <p> The National Farmers Federation has called for a ' hybrid ' effects test in a push to build a fairer , more transparent marketplace for farmers . <p> Mr Sims says he 's yet to speak with the NFF about its proposed model , but he says an effects test could help farmers in some cases . <p> " Where the farmers are supplying a product and competing with the supermarkets who have a home brand in that product , that may be helpful , " he said . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then it ca n't help them with an effects test .

@@2717236 <h> Unhealthy haste ? What are the implications of outsourcing Medicare , PBS claims and services ? <p> Less than two weeks ago the Federal Government called for Expressions of Interest ( EOI ) from the private sector to provide claims and payment services for Medicare ( MBS ) and the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme ( PBS ) , a $29 billion operation currently managed by the Department of Human Services . The EOI closes this Friday , 22 August . <p> Such a privatisation not only poses major implications for public sector jobs but looks like a major step towards dismantling Medicare as a public system . It has yet to be subject to public discussion . <p> Health Minister Peter Dutton issued a statement , justifying the move ( raised originally by the Commission of Audit ) on the grounds of cutting red tape and the need for a substantial upgrade of DHS IT systems . <p> He noted the EOI does not include the face-to-face services provided by Medicare but said the process will inform the Government " whether the commercial sector can deliver greater efficiency , flexibility and agility to the MBS and PBS processes " . <p> In the post @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question of whether the commercial sector can deliver the service more efficiently that 's up for debate . There are also major concerns about transparency and accountability , privacy , the future of Medicare , and the lack of community consultation around this EOI process . <p> A measure of the latter is the effort involved in accessing the Expression of Interest briefing pack , which is not available online . The Health Department advised that advertisements were published on 8-9 August in the Australian Financial Review , The Australian , Sydney Morning Herald , Canberra Times , The Age , Herald Sun , Hobart Mercury , West Australian , Northern Territory News , Courier Mail , and Adelaide Advertiser . All good if you buy those print editions as the ads are n't easy to find online . Croakey finally got a copy of the 17 page document via **25;385;TOOLONG . <p> The briefing notes that while the specific focus of " this market test " is on the assessment and calculation of correct entitlements and their payment , it is possible that some service providers will have " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complex system involved .

Firstly I think the government should have conducted an inclusive community engagement process around the concept of outsourcing these front-line services before seeking commercial tenders . <p> Without educating and engaging the community on the topic , what the implications may be for their care and access , the consequences for waiting times and service levels and understanding the community 's concerns , a commercial tender process is likely to focus on the economic drives at the expense of the social ones . <p> Transparency and accountability need to be carefully considered within this outsourcing move as well . While many flaws remain in how transparent and accountable government is in the provision of these services , any outsourcing arrangements need to be designed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and accountability rather than hide the workings of service provision behind commercial-in-confidence arrangements . <p> Citizens have a right to understand not only whether a government 's service delivery is meeting its KPIs , but also how it is meeting them -- at what cost , resourcing and whether the processes are effective and inclusive . <p> Outsourcing runs the risk of placing service delivery within a ' black box ' with far lower transparency and accountability , leading to the potential for unfair and inappropriate biases and exclusion to creep in where services are ' uncommercial ' . <p> Government has the role of serving everyone , which comes at an efficiency and economic cost , but significant social benefit . A commercial provider would not be acculturalised or , necessarily , contractually bound , to meet the same goal . <p> For starters I would like to see the outsource consideration process be fully transparent -- with all commercial proposals exposed in their entirety to the public and able to be discussed and debated publicly . <p> Certainly corporations may feel this violates their commercial confidence -- but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delivery it is not contracting on its behalf , but on the behalf of citizens , and citizens need to be able to review and understand what companies are offering for oversight and decision-making purposes.What are the implications for patient care ? <p> It is too early to be clear on the implications for patient care , however the prevailing assumption in the community is likely to be that care will be more efficient but also more impersonal , exclusionary and economics driven . <p> This is part of the reason to engage with the community first and build a common understanding of what the community does and should value and shape outsourcing to support the expected service delivery standards , or modify community beliefs using facts and evidence.What might this mean for the wider health system and its future ? <p> It is another step on the road towards much greater privatisation of the wider health system , and as such a poor decision by the government . <p> Until the government can make a clear case to the community that privatised health care can deliver the same or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lower cost position , there 's going to be significant resistance to any moves to privatise significant parts of health . <p> I 've not seen clear evidence from jurisdictions such as the US that privatised health care offers better outcomes for population health -- and most reports indicate far worse outcomes and a resulting significant cost burden on other areas of the public purse ( law and order , education , welfare ) . We need to consider health within the broader framework of society and look at the transfer costs of privatising services , such as the PBS and MBS . <p> Any other general observations ? <p> This decision aligns with the Coalition Government 's stated goals and is consistent with their ideology . Unlike prior Liberal governments , this government seems to place ideology far in front of evidence and practicality and is suffering from an inability to effectively engage the community , explain its values and goals and bring them along on the journey . <p> I believe the Coalition will find itself even more unpopular for making the decision simply to test the commercial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( beyond core Liberal supporters ) . This process may even establish that the DHS is the lowest-cost provider of processing , resulting in the status quo being retained ( although it is hard to see this Cabinet accept that government may be more efficient than the private sector , regardless of the evidence ) . <p> This makes this step unnecessarily detrimental to the Coalition 's other policy concerns and is likely to further damage the government 's ability to exert authority , gain clear air and promote other policies which might be accepted as beneficial by the community at large . <p> In effect : the government is again stabbing itself in the foot as it has done over 18C ( of the Racial Discrimination Act ) , Medicare copayments , university fees , maternity leave and in several other areas . <p> The political capital remaining to this government is very limited and should be husbanded for causes that have broad community support . <p> Where the government seeks to act beyond this , such as in the outsourcing of front-line health services and their management , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , dealing with all of the concerns and bringing the community with them on the journey -- otherwise they will fail to achieve their agenda and risk losing government sooner rather than later . <p> However given the ' groupthink ' that we see pervading Cabinet Ministers , the people they surround themselves with , and the interests that can afford access to them , I doubt they will recognise the cause of their concerns early enough to act on them and save this government . <p> *** <p> Vern Hughes , The National Campaign for Consumer-Centred Health Care <p> The Rudd Government 's Health Reform Commission identified the right option for future reform of the health system back in 2009 .

Amanda Smith met a dancer and a footballer who have redefined their relationships with their bodies . <p> It can be difficult when you 've grown up expecting to do and be one thing , but through illness or accident the path is n't so straightforward anymore . <p> From the age of four , Michelle Ryan went to ballet and tap classes in Townsville , and by 19 she was a professional dancer with Meryl Tankard 's Australian Dance Theatre . <p> Cameron Carr grew up playing rugby league . Also at 19 , the Queenslander was signed to the Sydney Roosters . His professional playing career was just about to begin . <p> Ryan , though , was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis at the age of 30 and stopped dancing and Carr was in a car accident the weekend before moving to Sydney ; he could n't look at rugby league for the next five years . <p> I was quite a show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my twenties and it was all about " look at me , look what I can do " . I think now I 'm prepared to go to the darker places that have been informed by my experience acquiring a disability . <p> Michelle Ryan , dancer <p> Ryan is now performing again , in a dance-theatre show that 's about to play at the Southbank Centre in London . Carr has recently returned to Australia after winning the World Wheelchair Rugby Championship with the Australian team , the Steelers . He 's also a gold medallist from the London 2012 Paralympic Games . Both have redefined how they do the thing they excelled at in their childhood and youth . <p> Ryan first noticed that something was amiss with her body when she was in Berlin , preparing to audition for European dance companies . <p> ' I was doing ballet class and finding that I could n't feel my calf muscles when I was standing in first position , ' she says . ' I thought , " Oh , that 's not quite right , " thinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was a really subtle change that I noticed , but it was n't such a subtle diagnosis , I suppose . ' <p> She was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis in Berlin after consulting first a physiotherapist then being referred to doctors and specialists and ending up in hospital . Being told you have MS is not easy for anyone to come to terms with , but for a person whose life has centred around physical excellence , it was particularly cruel . <p> ' I had danced professionally since I was 19 so my whole identity was wrapped around my profession , ' says Ryan . ' It was a very scary moment and a moment that lasted quite a few years actually , to regain that sense of who I was and where I fitted and what I was going to do next . So there was a lot of uncertainty and it was a very difficult time . ' <p> ' I was about to head to Sydney and the morning that I was due to drive down I got a phone call from the Roosters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accommodation had fallen through . So while I was waiting , the weekend I had at home I went to a 21st birthday party . After the party I jumped into a car with some friends for a short drive home , but never made it . The driver fell asleep probably 100 metres from the driveway and veered off and rolled the car into a gully . I woke up a couple of days later with a spinal injury and have n't been able to walk since . ' <p> It was n't the ways things were supposed to go for the teenager whose father , Norm Carr , had played State of Origin for Queensland . <p> ' Rugby league is in my blood , I grew up in rugby league , ' he says .

' I was lucky that I did n't have another episode for years . I had a walking stick but I could still walk and I could still function . ' <p> In that time , Ryan had come back to Australia and was working as the artistic manager for Dance North in Townsville . It was Belgian choreographer Alain Platel who encouraged her to dance again . He was in Australia with his company Ballets C de la B to perform at the Brisbane and Sydney Festivals . <p> The show always included a local guest artist performing a three minute solo . On the recommendation of Meryl Tankard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the solo with his company . <p> ' I wrote back to say thank you very much , I just need to check whether you know that I actually walk with a walking stick , thinking that he would say , " oh well , thank you but no thank you .

' <p> ' I remember before I went on he said to me , " What are you scared of ? " and I said , " I 'm scared that I will fall over . " To which he said , " Well , would n't you just get up and keep going ? " Following the performance he really challenged me as to why I 'd stopped dancing . He said to me , " But you are a dancer , I do n't understand . " I had n't thought of myself like that for 10 years . ' <p> Having been an intensely physical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ football career , Carr also needed to redefine who he was and his goals and aspirations . <p> ' I found it pretty tough , I struggled for the first five or six years , just because I had in my mind what I wanted to do and it was n't turning out the way that I had planned , and being headstrong , I was n't willing to concede to my injury . So it took a lot of soul searching and time to come to terms with it . ' <p> Part of his difficulty was reconciling what had happened . ' I had my accident as a teenager , and that 's the high risk years , but I would n't call myself a risk taker . I 'd call it a momentary lapse , a misjudgement , getting into the car . I look at people now and go , " how come you have n't broken your neck doing those sorts of things ? " It 's luck of the draw , is n't it ?

Wheelchair rugby followed a couple of years later , as a reason to get fit . <p> Carr has played with the world champion representative team , the Steelers , since 2005 . Has playing wheelchair rugby and becoming a member of the national team satisfied his sporting ambitions ? Carr is circumspect . <p> ' I suppose it has , you know , I have no alternative . I had to go with it and had to try and make it work if I wanted to realise the dream of playing a sport at an elite level . Things might alter physically but you still have that mental drive and will to win .

In fact it moves quite differently to traditional dancers , which gives it a really unique quality . So it 's a way of moving that no-one else can do , because they do n't have my condition . ' <p> Ryan uses a wheelchair in day-to-day life but when she 's performing she uses the support of props and other dancers . In the production that 's about to go to London called Intimacy , she performs a solo and a duet with Vincent Crowley . The two were members of the same contemporary dance company in their twenties . Crowley is tall and muscular , Ryan is small and slight . Crowley says they 've worked hard to find a new way to dance together . <p> ' It challenges your own sense that dance always has to be big and high and fast . You 're not going to run and jump and dive and whack your leg up in the air , but be in a world where it 's much more sensitive and fine . You can still dance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ryan agrees : ' I was quite a show pony as a child and we did spectacular things in my twenties and it was all about " look at me , look what I can do " .

' <p> ' I 'm prepared to actually acknowledge the weaknesses , whereas in my twenties , you were only showing off the strongest parts of your body and of yourself .

The study found that when spiders lived in urban areas they increased in size and had larger ovaries , indicating increased reproductive capacity . <p> There were strong associations in particular between spider size and the presence of hard surfaces ( such as roads and buildings ) and lack of vegetation . These hard surfaces contribute to the urban " heat island " effect , which makes it warmer in cities than surrounding areas . <p> It is also likely that there is more food for the spiders in the city as a result of night lighting and increased resources .

Humans have modified the natural world so extensively that most animals ca n't survive in urban landscapes and become extinct in human-inhabited areas . <p> But some species are urban exploiters , such as pigeons and crows , which thrive in urban areas and are adapting to take advantage of novel environments .

@@2723234 <p> When James Cameron accepted a best director academy award in 1998 for Titanic , clutching his golden statuette and quoting Leonardo DiCaprio 's character -- " I 'm the king of the world ! " -- to a live audience of millions , it was more than a moment of self-congratulation from a characteristically unsubtle filmmaker . <p> It seemed to represent the pinnacle of Cameron 's career : a journey all the way to the top for Hollywood 's most populist visionary . By that time , he had already produced a catalogue of blockbusters in Terminators one and two , Aliens , The Abyss , True Lies . <p> In 1998 Cameron steered Titanic into the record books as the first motion picture in history to collect more than $US1bn at the international box office . But the king was n't done . His next movie , Avatar , not only ushered in a new ( or at least revised ) technology -- the contemporary 3D movie -- but also beat his own record . In worldwide gross terms , Cameron 's environmental sci-fi about a blue-skinned alien race collected more than $US2.7bn ; Titanic sits second place with $US2.1bn . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cameron 's net worth was recently pegged at around $US900m . In 2010 alone he earned an estimated $US257m . Where does the man who rocketed to the top of Hollywood go ? Strangely enough , to the bottom of the ocean . <p> Cameron 's new film Deepsea Challenge 3D , which puts him in front rather than behind the camera , focuses on his other great passion : deepsea diving . Specifically , it captures an expedition led by Cameron in 2012 that saw the veteran filmmaker and tech enthusiast become the first person to reach the deepest known place on Earth since 1960 -- and the first to do so as a solo pilot . <p> " I 'm very curious . I love science and I love exploration , " he tells Guardian Australia . " I know when I go on a sub I 'm going to see something I 've never seen before , and the deeper you go the higher the likelihood I might see something nobody 's seen before . You ca n't get that in a movie theatre . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ film 's three co-directors ( Ray Quint , John Bruno and Andrew Wright ) , you can watch a fluffy feel-good documentary all about it . Deepsea Challenge 3D mixes Cameron 's real-life endeavours with cheesy re-enacted footage of him as a young boy peeking out of a hole in a cardboard box , pretending to be in a submarine . <p> The message , wielded like a giant metronome swinging backwards and forwards in case you missed it , has the kind of fairytale logic that would n't feel out of place in , well , a James Cameron movie : anything is possible if you follow your dreams . Cameron describes Deepsea Challenge 3D as " about the idea of inspiration . Childhood dreams . Dreams acted upon . " <p> There is something undeniably inspiring about the film , but reality is a harsh mistress . Not everybody can afford to pursue their dreams by spending tens of millions of dollars to build a submersible to shoot them to the bottom of the ocean . Does Cameron 's project belong to the Spruce Goose genre of ego @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to achieve his dreams ? <p> " I think it certainly helped because I put in the seed money to get the ball rolling and to start building and designing the sub , " Cameron says . But his tone soon reverts to his film 's fairy floss idealism , the Hollywood notion that anybody can do anything if they set their minds to it . <p> " You can find a way to piece the finances together . I did n't just write a cheque for this whole thing , This is too big a project , so I spent a lot of time going around and finding the right partners to work with . Anybody can do that . It 's really just a question of will , " he says . <p> " This is not just about some rich guy writing a cheque and getting some race car built for him to go on a ride .

" I 'm not the filmmaker on this one , I 'm just along for the ride . " <p> But could his three directors have had complete autonomy ? This is billed as James Cameron 's Deepsea Challenge 3D for a good reason . The documentary follows Cameron 's expedition , which took place on a vessel he co-designed , co-funded and built with a team he managed , and he is also the film 's executive producer . Then there 's Cameron 's reputation as one of the toughest nuts in Hollywood -- somebody you do n't want to get off-side . Well-known Cameron phrases include " I eat pressure for breakfast " and " firing ( people ) is too merciful " . <p> If Cameron , looking back over his long career , believes he ever pushed somebody too far , he does n't show it . In fact , he seems to regret the premise of the question . <p> " There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far . I set challenges for people . That 's what I do on my Hollywood films , that 's what I do on my expedition projects . I tend to find that people can go beyond what they think they can do . " he says . <p> " That 's why they always feel very loyal to the project after the fact and want to do it again . Because they feel it was a crucible in which they got to prove something to themselves , and I foster that . Now , as you go along , you find there are some people who just do n't want to be part of that culture . <p> " Ernest Shackleton , when he put together his Antarctica expedition , he advertised it as ' this will be really difficult . You may not survive . ' " <p> And does Cameron share the same view of Hollywood -- that only the strong survive ? Not so , he says .

Where 10 years ago there was a yawning gap between rankings - with customers rating ANZ satisfaction at 73.1 per cent and CBA at 63 per cent , today there is only a couple of percentage points between all of them and the overall level of satisfaction is over 82 per cent - which is close to a record high . <p> The old adage that " banks are bastards " has faded as the big institutions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ user friendly products . <p> Advertisement <p> ( Business banking customers are generally not as happy with the big four - but for different reasons . ) <p> Given that most of us no longer use the physical branch network , it is understandable that IT has become the battle ground as most of our contact with banks will be via a device - either a computer or a smart phone . But one could argue that the current wave of IT spending has more to do with stay in business capital expenditure rather than a technology revolution . <p> The Commonwealth maintained its mantle on customer satisfaction but with a narrow margin of 0.2 per cent over Westpac - with the others close behind . And they were sufficiently tightly bunched that it 's hard to imagine customers changing their banks on the basis of differentiated customer experience . <p> But for the bank bosses , customer satisfaction results mean plenty - in large part because this measure forms a part of their remuneration bonus packages . <p> The CBA is renowned as having industry leading IT , having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would put it in a market share winning position . <p> However the others have been playing catch up and when it comes to customer facing products , such as the latest banking apps and contactless payment , its competitors ( especially Westpac ) will argue it is every bit as innovative . <p> As one banking expert said this week : " No-one has a competitive advantage for more than two years on the back of IT . " <p> It is hard to see how the latest banking software really moves the dial on customer satisfaction or market share . <p> There are far bigger forces at work when it comes to how one feels about their banking institution . And by far the most important of these is the general level of interest rates . We all feel a bit better inclined towards our banks right now and its a fair bet that their halos will slip when interest rates eventually move up . <p> In terms of levels of customer satisfaction between individual banks , this comes down to interest rates ( again ) . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ satisfaction when it promised to cut fees and offer the lowest variable interest rate among the big four .

But , unlike the consumer market , the big four banks rank quite differently . Westpac is ahead of the pack on 71.4 per cent and its closest peer is NAB with 67.1 , while the CBA trails with a score of 63 per cent .

Whilst the story itself whizzes by in very broad brushstrokes ( a dinosaur ! clockwork droids ! ) , Capaldi 's Doctor is a more subtle and pointillist portrait . He bristles with moments of commanding elegance and energy .

If this were an outright commercial programme , rather than something cloaked in the BBC 's public service identity , I doubt whether Peter Capaldi would have been cast : looked at from a brand-image point of view , he 's a considerable departure from the past few TARDIS incumbents . <p> Sure , by arguing that we need to gaze through the veil of outer appearances , Steven Moffat 's screenplay strangely keeps drawing attention to those very surfaces .

In a world where capital with a long-term focus is in huge demand , agriculture needs to find innovative ways of attracting domestic and foreign investment . " <p> As with the ABARES paper , the ANZ report suggested it could be possible to " more than double the real value of annual agriculture exports by 2050 " . <p> At present about 53 per cent of Australia is already under active farming either for crops or livestock , according to the ABS , which puts the figure at about 410 million hectares of farming land ( Australia totals 769 million hectares ) . That 's down from 490 million hectares used for farming in 1976 . <p> On that basis it is unlikely Australia could double its food production levels to feed 120 million or 150 million people in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone . <h> CSIRO findings <p> Brian Keating , deputy director of CSIRO 's Agriculture Flagship , told Fact Check that while the concept of a " food bowl of Asia " is not precisely defined , " it is reasonably clear that Australia would not qualify as a major supplier of Asia 's food needs in volume terms " . <p> However , he says , that does n't mean Australia 's food exports can not grow in volume or value terms in the years ahead , in response to expected strong demand . <p> While a target to double the value of agricultural exports between now and 2050 is " not an unrealistic stretch goal " , Mr Keating said it would require continuing innovation in agricultural science and business , and is likely to involve a mix of value growth as well as production growth , supplemented by sustainable development of well suited new regions . <p> However , doubling the volume of production is expected to be more difficult . <p> It is reasonably clear that Australia would not qualify as a major supplier of Asia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Australia 's competitive ability to respond to this growing demand in Asia remains an open question . It would require a significant step up in production and/or a significant shift in the nature of our production towards higher value products , " Mr Keating said . <p> " It may involve new production areas ( such as northern Australia ) but these are only likely to make a modest contribution to overall agricultural output . " <p> Any major production or value increase will hinge on efforts to lift productivity in existing agricultural areas . <p> " As a historical point of reference , aggregate output from Australian agriculture doubled between 1965 and 2000 , ABARES data says . This required massive technical innovation and structural change , " Mr Keating said <p> " It also required a three-fold increase in irrigation within the Murray Darling Basin and a five fold increase in nitrogen fertilizer inputs . " <h> The verdict <p> With consistent business and technology improvements , Australian farms could potentially double the export value of their produce by mid-century . Doubling the physical volume of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ views on whether Australia has sufficient land and water , or adequate infrastructure and technology , to increase its primary production to a scale where it could viably be seen as a major provider of food for the Asian population . The accepted wisdom is that Australia 's food production is sufficient for about 60 million people . By mid century , the middle class in Asia alone is expected to hit 3 billion people . <p> It remains to be seen whether technological advancements will enable Australia to open up sufficient land and water resources , and new infrastructure to generate exponential increases in production.Even if it doubled production levels , Australia could not feed even half of Indonesia 's 250 million population , let alone Asia . <p> Mr Joyce 's view that Australia should not be touted as the food bowl of Asia is justified .

Yet he raised a real issue : Where do we get the concept of self from and how do we justify it ? Is the self to be included among the furniture of the universe , or is it merely an elusive fantasy ( as Buddhism teaches ) ? <p> How much insight do we have into the philosophical problem of the self ? MattysFlicks <p> Although there is much to debate concerning the self , belief in it can be defended . <p> Does this entail that it is part of our basic ontology , that is part of the inventory of what we believe to exist ? Yes , and for two reasons : <p> A sense of being someone and of having conscious awareness that is one 's own and no one else 's is essential to normal functioning in the world . <p> Even if the concept of being a personal self is displaced within some broader spiritual or theoretical perspective , the self is no less immediately real to us right now than are physical objects , which can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of particles and/or esoteric forms of energy . <p> So what is a self ? <p> Hume is surely correct to state that it is not some thing that we can " stumble on " in our inner experience , or that is constantly present to our consciousness . Yet there is still room to argue that the self is a network of relationships forged by significant experiences ( past and present ) , actions , and connections with people , places , things and events . The self therefore becomes " a bundle of relationships . " <p> And what we make of these relationships and do about them manifests who we are . <p> A self comes into being and perpetuates itself by means of choices and actions that create connections -- relationships -- with the world around us and with ourselves , which we integrate into our self-understanding as we move through life .

Experiments on pre-linguistic children have shown that cooperative relationships with others are apparent at a very early age . See , for example , the work of Michael Tomasello in his book A Natural History of Human Thinking . These tendencies begin to help determine a self , even at the first stage of human development . <p> I suggest , then , that a self is the organised complex of relationships with people and other entities , events , states of affairs , memories and so on , established over time , and that the beliefs and values we adhere to are built up from our responses to what goes on outside as well as within our own self-consciousness . Strangely enough , this entails that the self exists within us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , paradoxically , a self-made being . <p> For this reason , the question is : <p> What kind of self do I choose to be ; and is there room in this self for the concerns of others to gain recognition and response -- especially those in relation to whom I have become who I am ? <p> Surely , confronting this question seriously is the cure for self-obsession.

And yet this is also a spectacular misuse of history . As a historian , I hate bad history . But in this case the stakes are much higher than my discipline 's lofty principles . Pyne 's proposals for higher education bode ill for equity and Australia 's economic competitiveness . <p> History can help us with policy , but only if we properly understand it . True , Whitlam did little to shift higher education 's socio-economic statistics in the 1970s . This historical fact was a surprise . People were popping up all over the place to point to someone who would never have gone to uni if it were not for Whitlam . <p> Stories , however , are not statistics . Under Whitlam , higher education did not get a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 25% to 276,559 enrolments by 1975 , just three years after Labor 's election . Still , that is not a lot of students , not compared to the mass system we see today , with more than one million enrolments . Nor was it very diverse . <p> Why did n't free education make universities more inclusive ? Firstly , it did not have enough time . Free education was not dismantled until the Dawkins reforms in 1988 , but shifts in the global economy and the local labour market hindered expansion well before that . <p> In 1973 , the world faced an oil crisis , which led to growing unemployment . By the late 1970s , this affected young peoples ' decision to go to uni . <p> It was a different time . A couple of decades earlier , hardly anyone went to university . You did n't need to : good jobs were available without a degree . So after the oil shocks , when going to uni did not guarantee employment , students stopped going , even though it was free . <p> Enrolment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 8.6% , but by 1981 it was just 1.3% . It stayed very low until the Dawkins reforms . <p> Under these economic conditions Australia never really had time to see whether free education would have the desired effect . So , on the facts , free education did not make university more inclusive ; but that is only part of the story . <p> Pyne , oddly enough , is using the same data and argument Labor used in 1987 to introduce HECS . While enrolment was still so elite , it was not fair to use working-class taxes to perpetuate privilege . <p> Under HECS , students share the cost of their education . This made it fairer . It also injected some much-needed cash into universities , allowing the system to expand and become more inclusive , which it did . <p> This understanding of history ought to lead us to consider what a fair share of the cost of going to uni might be . This might lead us to review HECS . Deregulation , however , is completely different . <p> Let 's think about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a result , is at stake . In the global economy , competitiveness is connected to the number of educated people in the workforce . Since the Second World War , every nation expanded university participation for this reason . We had to educate more people if we were to compete internationally . <p> In Australia , people with a degree get better jobs . If we are a fair country , we want to give everyone the best chance of success , regardless of background . We also want the best people selected for our jobs . <p> No one believes talent is distributed according to birth and wealth , so we need universities to admit students based on merit . This is what Australians expect , but what university leaders want is different . Universities Australia this week encouraged the government to deregulate fees . <p> To understand why , we should consider the way vice-chancellors are constantly worried about their bottom line . Charging fees that match their costs is seductive . Being a pragmatic bunch , vice-chancellors ( and thus Universities Australia ) are also thinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from this government . <p> Australians should be worried , even though deregulation will take some time to affect us . At first , fees will not increase by much . Equity , for a year or two , might even improve under a scholarship system , at least in some universities with current poor equity enrolments . <p> Things will change , however . Universities , like the businesses they have become , will want to grow and competition will compel them to raise fees . <p> Imagine : Monash increases its fees , so Melbourne does too . In fact , to keep up with Monash 's world-class research program Melbourne will have to -- and Sydney will need to follow suit . Eventually universities will charge fees as high as the middle class can bear , but higher than low-socioeconomic families can pay . <p> Australian society will be less equal . Our workforce and therefore our economy will also be less competitive internationally .

Closing two specialist libraries ( Medical and Badham ) and turning two others ( Camden and Dentistry ) into 24-hour vending machines , it targets anything not borrowed in the last 5 years , removing and/or destroying up to 500,000 books and jeopardising about 60% of the librarians ' jobs . Protests have been campus-wide but are unavailing . <p> Sydney is not alone . Many of its books were given to the University of Western Sydney -- and then dumped . Univeristy of NSW had already undertaken a similar process , while the University of Technology , Sydney library has gone proudly underground , into a space that could earn the university extra income as a set for Stasi thrillers . <p> And it 's not just old fiction being dumped .

Overseas institutions have been book-dumping for years . In 1993 , after a specialist library in Manchester was discovered privately flogging its very rare books , Charles Cutting wrote a satirical novel in which , he said , " libraries would cease to be repositories of books , and would instead become buildings housing vast banks of terminals " .

So we should not mourn too much , the loss of some literature from libraries .

Their arguments are emotional - and while I have respect for how they feel and for their right to have those feelings , they do n't form the basis of coherent exposition .

The same happened in 1975 when the equally barbaric Khmer Rouge ransacked the Bibliotheque nationale in Phnom Penh , destroying perhaps 80% of books , whilst murdering anyone they accused of being an intellectual . 90% of artists perished between 1975-1979 in Cambodia , an entire generation . What is happening today in the West has been happening intermittently since time immemorial , usually during war , but has been accelerating since 1989 - the year of birth of the world wide web .

Sometimes that 's fine , but not always . Secondly , few of the books being thrown away have actually been digitised . their " content " as you would probably say , is lost forever .

@@2755230 <h> Food fraud is still hard to detect -- so follow the money <h> Author <h> Disclosure statement <p> Lisa Jack works with BDO LLP through the Centre for Counter Fraud Studies at University of Portsmouth and consults to NSF International Ltd . She receives funding from the Chartered Institute of Management Accountants . <p> Food fraud is a huge problem in the UK , and much of it is as a result of organised crime . Unfortunately , as the report of the Elliott Review on the 2013 horsemeat scandal now points out , there is too little evidence to gauge the full extent of fraudulent practices in the industry . <p> Food mis-labelling is widespread , as is the practice of substituting premium commodity products in whole or in part with cheaper ingredients . Actually , substituting modestly priced ingredients with even cheaper ones is not unknown . We might have guessed that substitution was happening -- there must be a reason some foods are so cheap -- but it becomes serious when , say , ground peanuts are substituted for ground almonds and appear in restaurant meals . This could prove dangerous or even fatal to people with allergies . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are systematically adulterated with chemicals or are even completely counterfeit . As an Observer editorial warned , such organised criminal activity could have catastrophic consequences . <h> Spot test trouble <p> The obvious response to this growing threat is to do more scientific spot testing on products , of which a wide range are now available . The horsemeat scandal was probably the first time it occurred to most people that DNA testing could be used on meat for human consumption . Testing , however , can be costly and time consuming . Large quantities of data are collected but not necessarily aggregated into information on trends . In an industry as frenetic and as large-scale as the food industry , it is not possible to scientifically test every batch of food . <p> Deterrence and prevention of food fraud , however , is not just a matter of tests . Defences can also be found in three rather less glamorous areas : management controls , forensic accounting and information processing . And the food industry is beginning to explore these ideas . <h> Changing allegiances <p> Generally speaking , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prevent fraud . Like householders with minimal security , there is a tendency to hope that break-ins are something that other people experience . Food supply networks , however , are vulnerable . They are characterised by a relatively small number of major retailers and caterers being supplied by thousands of small and medium businesses which are owner-managed . <p> Allegiances and arrangements between suppliers , intermediaries and customers change frequently . Contracts are used less often than is supposed and verbal communication is often preferred , to keep things moving . Some chains , as noted in the interim Elliott Review , are very long and one batch of one product can be widely dispersed . <h> Blow the whistle <p> The Elliott Review into the horsemeat scandal suggests that whistleblowing mechanisms be set up for food fraud as they have been for other areas where anonymity is needed . <p> There are supply chain management standards in the industry and most suppliers have certification to show that they comply with them . Retailers , caterers and manufacturers rely on these certifications but until recently , these standards and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , questions on fraud . <h> Forensic accounting <p> Forensic accounting reconstructs transactions for presentation in court but includes audit-based techniques that assess the possibility that fraud has occurred . Regular analytical reviews of prices offered by suppliers against commodity prices -- and against costs of processing and production -- should indicate when prices are too low and the product is likely to contain substitutes . <p> Unexpected variations in prices offered , or prices that are slightly too high , can be also be detected , perhaps indicating that an employee is receiving a kickback to accept fraudulent goods . Tracing back products to their origins and reconstructing the audit trail for high-risk products can highlight where unusual suppliers have been used or there is variation from normal supply routes . <p> Finally , few businesses appear to have the systems in place to turn the mass of data that they do have on food safety events and traceability into useful information for management . Businesses which monitor agri-food news and other data have an advantage . However , the small and medium-sized businesses that make up the majority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not have the resources for management control , audit or pro-active data seeking that are required . <p> Making these resources available is one of the challenges for UK agencies overseeing food safety on behalf of consumers .

@@2755238 <h> Al Qaeda 's new Indian subcontinent branch : What it means for Myanmar <p> Al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri 's statement on Wednesday that he wants to expand operations to Myanmar and the Indian subcontinent will likely result in a new wave of violence . But the initial assailants may not be Islamists , but rather Buddhist extremists . <p> The video places new emphasis on al Qaeda 's presence on the Indian subcontinent , from Pakistan to Myanmar . Al-Zawahiri begins ( a transcript is available here ) by calling on the Ummah ( community of believers ) of the subcontinent to ' unite ' . He attacks the West 's double standards , comparing the ' crocodile tears ' shed over Sudan and Indonesia with the ambivalence shown over ' massacres of Muslims ' in Bangladesh , Myanmar , the Philippines , Sri Lanka and a long list of others . He suggests the West , New Delhi and Beijing are colluding in a conspiracy to allow the massacre of Muslims . <p> Mid-way through his 55-minute address he turns to the situation of Muslims in Myanmar : <p> With every passing massacre , the enemies of Islam provide even more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ improvement in the human rights situation in Burma ' ... We must make a serious effort to bring an end to these oppressions on Muslims in Bangladesh , India , Burma and Sri Lanka with everything within our capacity . <p> Al-Zawahiri 's statement , while probably intended as a reaction to gains made by Islamic State in Iraq in recent months ( in effect , it is al Qaeda 's attempt at a ' counter narrative ' to IS ) , will carry weight in Myanmar . Buddhist extremists will use it as fuel for a simmering fire which flared in deadly communal violence in 2012 . Since then , over 140,000 Muslims , known as Rohingya , have fled to internally displaced people ( IDP ) camps in western Rakhine state and central Meiktila . <p> The al Qaeda video appears designed to attract recruits from disenfranchised Muslims on the subcontinent . After recent religious intolerance ( bordering on ethnic cleansing ) in Myanmar , it is feasible that recruits could come from IDP camps or from Rohingya refugees across the border in Cox 's Bazaar in Bangladesh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Myanmar police carried out raids on the IDP camps , allegedly to root out militants of the Rohingya Solidarity Organisation . The group has relatively few members and is based mainly in southeast Bangladesh ( an excellent explanatory piece by Bertil Lintner on extremist elements in Bangladesh and the relation to the Rohingya can be found here ) . <p> Most Rohingya are focused on survival . Half of the IDPs , or 70,000 people , have insecure access to food . If al-Zawahiri 's call is heeded by any , it is more likely to be from among well established radical elements such as those in Bangladesh and further afield in Pakistan , which already have ties to al Qaeda . None of these groups have thus far succeeded in extending their theatre of terror internationally . <p> In fact , attacks by Islamic extremists in Myanmar seem far less likely than a violent backlash from nervous and angry mobs of Buddhist extremists , at least in the short term . These will likely be provoked by firebrand clerics such as the much criticised ' bin Laden of Buddhism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closely with the onset of recent religiously inspired violence in the country ) and those of his ' 969 ' movement will be closely watched . With 140,000 Muslim Rohingya confined to IDP camps , security of these massive complexes will need to be significantly improved . <p> The prospect of a widespread and a polarising religious conflict appears to have escalated . So there has never been a better time for interfaith dialogue and calls for religious tolerance from government and religious leaders . Aung San Suu Kyi should be pressed to finally speak on this issue . These efforts should be buttressed by greater regional security cooperation on the subcontinent -- an effort that has been anaemic for far too long . As I have long advocated with senior government officials in Bangladesh and Myanmar in regard to the Rohingya , regional problems require regional solutions . Now is the time for those solutions to be markedly enhanced .

@@2766237 expanded substantially in the half century since the first international drug treaty ; the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime estimated the total retail value of the global illicit drug trade in 2003 at US$320 billion . <p> And deaths , disease , crime , corruption and violence have all soared . It 's clearly time to go back to the drawing board . <p> Drug policies have to be realistic to be effective , and prohibition clearly is n't . Whatever else drugs might be , they also create powerful markets ; in the absence of a legal source , strong demand finds other forms of supply . <p> Since the start of the war on drugs , governments across the world have allocated most funds to drug law enforcement . But the policy failed abjectly because drug laws can not be enforced . <p> Drug traffickers make so much money that they can corrupt or intimidate whoever stands in their way . Prohibition has undermined governments and eroded important civic institutions in both supplier and transit countries , such as Afghanistan and Pakistan . <p> Indeed , the drug trade is too big , too powerful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Still , we can do something about it . <p> To be effective , drug policies have to be based on evidence , rather than intuition about what should or should n't work or public opinion . But while it is a terrible policy for society and public health -- it lands masses of people in jail for minor crimes , for instance , and makes the difficult task of controlling blood-borne viruses almost impossible -- the war on drugs is often good political strategy . It helps political candidates win elections on a law-and-order platform , providing a disincentive for ending the hardline approach . <p> Health and social interventions , on the other hand , are relatively inexpensive ways of making a bad problem less bad , albeit slowly . Such approaches include harm reduction in the form of needle syringe and drug-replacement programs , and social interventions such as encouraging people who use drugs to get treatment . <p> Consider Switzerland , which was swamped with drug problems in the 1980s . When increasing funding to police and making penalties more severe failed to halt the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sharing , and drug overdose deaths , the government turned to a different approach , including improved drug treatment . <p> A 2006 study in the nation 's largest city Zurich showed the annual number of new recruits to heroin in the city went from 80 people in 1975 to its estimated peak of 850 in 1990 , and then dropped to 150 in 2002 . It showed similar falls in crime , HIV prevalence , and drug overdose deaths . <p> The Swiss case illustrates how gains are small and slow rather than heroic and overnight . But slow and small gains are definitely worthwhile in the face of the alternative . <p> This kind of harm reduction approach is very effective and quite inexpensive . A 2008 UK review of the evidence for the cost effectiveness of needle syringe programs found they were overwhelmingly worthwhile . <p> The Australian government , for instance , spent A$150 million on such programs between 1988 and 2000 , preventing an estimated 21,000 HIV infections and 25,000 hepatitis C infections . The program saved around 4,500 lives that would have been claimed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dollar the government spent , it saved A$4 in health-care costs and A$27 in the lost economic contribution of drug users and the cost of drug use to the users themselves . <p> By contrast , reducing drug use remained the priority in the United States , so HIV spread extensively among and from people who inject drugs there . <p> There are only two studies estimating savings or social and health advantages from drug law enforcement . <p> A 1994 RAND Corporation report looked at the benefit of every dollar the government spent on coca plant eradication in South America , interdiction of powder cocaine being transported from South to North America , US Customs and police , and treatment of severely dependent US cocaine users . <p> US citizens benefited 15 cents per dollar spent on the first , and 32 and 52 cents , respectively for the second and third . But the benefit of the last measure , that is , treatment rather than law enforcement was US$7.46 for each dollar spent . <p> Another report found the annual reduction in total US cocaine consumption for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mandatory minimum sentences , 27 kilograms for conventional law enforcement , but over 100 kilograms for treatment of severely dependent users . <p> Punitive drug policies have turned out to be an expensive waste of time , at great social cost . When newly-elected Mexican president Felipe Calderon assumed office on December 11 , 2006 , he freshly declared war on drugs . When he left the presidency six years later , around 70,000 Mexicans had been murdered by drug traffickers , the army or the police . <p> Prohibition also helps more dangerous drugs to push less dangerous ones out of the market . <p> In the 1950s and 60s , anti-opium policies in Laos , Hong Kong , and Thailand where the drug was traditionally used , turned out to be pro-heroin . Young , sexually active men injecting heroin replaced old men smoking opium , leading not only to a heroin industry but an increase in the price of narcotic drugs and health problems because of parental drug use . It also created the right conditions for an HIV epidemic among injecting drug users . <p> Another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of law enforcement . This is only good news for people who work in customs , police , courts and prisons . <p> The number of people incarcerated in the United States , for instance , increased from 500,000 in 1980 to 2.3 million in 2009 . Much of this growth was the result of sentences for drug-related offences . Indeed , one estimate puts the number of years of life lost in New York state as a result of the punitive drug laws of the early 1970s was comparable to the number lost as a result of 9/11 . <p> If we approached drug policy with a return-on-investment approach , high cost-low gain interventions such as incarceration and sniffer dogs would be wound down . <p> Supporters of drug prohibition often insist reform supporters articulate a fully worked-out alternative . But reform should be thought of as a process rather than an event . It should be carried out in incremental steps with further steps adopted if evaluation shows the earlier reforms have been successful and more is required . <p> The threshold step is redefining the problem as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , taxpayers clearly get significant benefits from government spending on reducing the demand for and harm from drugs . <p> Once the problem is redefined , most decisions fall into place . The paramount aim of the reformist approach must be to reduce the adverse health , social and economic costs of both drug use and drug policy , rather than aiming to reduce drug use regardless of consequences . <p> When the drug market has been brought down to a manageable size using health and social interventions , drug law enforcement may well start to be effective . <p> The aim should be to regulate the market as much as possible while acknowledging it will never be completely regulated . There will always be a black market for drugs , and the best way of shrinking it is to expand the regulated market . <p> Drugs can be regulated by prescription controls , pharmacy controls , premises where drugs are sold with consumption occurring on site , and premises where drugs are sold but consumption occurs off site . <p> Methadone is a good example of a drug regulated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ represents a pragmatic compromise between the preference of drug users to keep using heroin and the community , which would prefer drug users to abstain . <p> This is not a shot in the dark ; there are examples of countries that have seen positive results from embracing an alternative to the war on drugs . <p> In 2001 , Portugal set threshold quantities for every type of illicit drug . People found in possession of quantities above the threshold levels are referred to the criminal justice system . Those found in possession of quantities below the threshold are referred to the Commission for Drug Dissuasion where a small panel carries out an interview to determine how the person is functioning as part of the community . <p> If they are leading a normal life -- raising children , for instance , or studying or training , or holding down a job and keeping up with financial commitments -- they are reviewed again in a year or so . Those not functioning poorly are referred to drug treatment . <p> Portugal also improved its drug treatment system as any country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And treatment has be raised to the same standard as the rest of the health-care system . The policy has worked well for the country ; overdose deaths , HIV , crime , and problematic drug use have all fallen . <p> Instead of this way to deal with drugs , most of the world continues with a criminal justice approach and draconian policies despite evidence of its failure . <p> Clearly , the war on drugs has taken a grave international toll , and not all of it has been discussed here . Many of the nations it affects are in the process of developing and they are often brought to their knees by corrosive effects of drug prohibition . <p> The first thing to do is publicly acknowledge the failure of the war on drugs . Then we can start reversing the system . This may be difficult , but it is by no means impossible . <p> This article is the first in a series that will examine the complex problems facing humanity , and assess the evidence on what works best to fix them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @

This presser is always held in April so it was just a coincidence that the Istanbul airport was teeming with Australians flying in and out of these antique cities on various Gallipoli and World War I tours . SQ391 from Istanbul to Singapore on 28 April was like a Fanatics tour , such was the green and gold presence . I was sat next to a couple of teenagers from the choir that had sung the national anthem at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Dardanelles . These two teens -- one boy and one girl -- were lamenting how poor the economy class headphones were ; how they did n't block out any of the engine noise and you can barely hear the audio track of whatever film you 've selected from the in-flight entertainment system . To pass the time before being able to descend into iPads and Kindle , we made small talk about technology . <p> The reason this otherwise instantly forgettable moment in plane take-off history sticks in my mind is because the teenage boy , envisioning 24 hours of tedious engine noise ahead of him , on seeing my pair of Soul noise cancelling headphones , said , " I need to get a pair of Beats " . Not headphones -- not even the brand of headphones I was using -- Beats : The marketing phenomenon that brings together gangster rap , Lady Gaga , Tom Daley and Tim Cook . It 's such an oddity that one particular brand can bridge so many cultural divides : credibility 's Dr Dre , discredibility 's Justin Bieber , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , smoking 's Jack Wilshere and spellcheck 's Nicki Minaj . The common denominator is distinct mainstreaminess -- while some of these celebrity endorsers can be polarising , there is nothing particularly niche about any of them -- and it runs in peculiar contrast to Dr Dre 's original proclamation in 2008 that , " People are n't hearing all the music . With Beats , people are going to hear what the artists hear , and listen to the music the way they should : the way I do " . <p> Somehow it 's hard to fathom that the MC who took us a ride we 'd never been on befo ' , " a producer who can rap and control the maestro " , who will " continue to put the rap down , put the mack down and if yo bitches talk shit " will " have to put the smack down " , is sitting in a studio wearing bright purple headphones blaring ultra-loud overproduced music into his aural canal . Few artists are more responsible for bringing rap mainstream than Dr Dre but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him mainstream . <p> The first set of Beats by Dre were released as a manufacturing partnership with Monster , a company famous at the time -- perhaps maybe still -- for a gazillion per cent mark-up to the cost of cables . It was Friday 25 July 2008 and for just under $350 , eager consumers could rush to Apple Retail Stores and Best Buy outlets and pick up a pair . The media release said this first set had " extreme clarity , deep bass and full power , which has been lacking in conventional headphones " . <p> In the first Beats headphone review I could find on the internet , two days before the on-sale date , the headphones cognoscenti at head-fi.org said " audiophile types will be pleasantly surprised " , and said the sound quality was " pretty articulate " . <p> The following day at TechCruch , John Biggs said his review pair compared quite favourably to other high-end headphones of the day . " They were quite comfortable and cancelled a lot of plane noise ... I was happy to sit back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amplifier . " <p> Biggs did complain about the price , as did Joel Evans at Geek.com , who perhaps was n't prepared for the packaging revolution about to hit electronics -- a tree felled for every unit -- " The box that the ' kit ' comes in is quite large , unnecessarily so , in my opinion . I can only assume that it 's because the headphones are pricey and that they wanted you to feel something substantial , " he wrote in a quote that seems both prescient and quaint at the same time . When it came to audio quality , however , Evans echoed his contemporaries : " I was pleasantly surprised , " he said , praising the " crisp highs " and " bass pumping lows " ; he even heard some background noise from a James Taylor record for the first time . Despite this joyous experience , Evans reported feeling nauseas while listening to the headphones , though he assures us that 's a personal malady and not a fault of the headphones ( or James Taylor , one assumes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the coming year and these too were met with tempered praise . Caleb Denison did n't review that pair , he " auditioned " them , so I guess this means he is one of those wanky audiophiles worthy of quoting : <p> " There 's a distinct difference between the dimensionless sound of a cheap pair of headphones vs the richness and depth you experience from a well-made set . Thankfully , the Solo falls firmly into the latter category , offering up depth , warmth and detail rather well . " <p> Jasmine France at Cnet said the Solos had a " killer , travel-friendly design " that was perfect for on-the-go use , but she criticised the " muddy " sound quality and said the cans " leak a fair amount of sound " . <p> Exactly a year later , in December 2010 , Beats had become " nothing short of a phenomenon " , according to Jeremy Horowitz at iLounge . He was reviewing Beats ' then good/better/best set , comprising Studio , Solo and the then new Beats Pro . Horowitz actually scored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " most balanced sonics , active noise cancellation , and an iPhone-ready cable option " . He wrote that the expensive Beat Pro , retailing for $450 in the States , were " fine rather than great " and compared them with derision to similarly priced JBL and AKG models . In a telling line , Horowitz wrote that he ca n't dispel " the lingering sense that nothing we heard is actually worth the price tag " . <p> And from there the theme was set . In one of the more amusing reviews , the withering Andrew Robinson at Home Theatre Review called them " atrocious " and labelled them " expensive electronic ear warmers " . <p> James Rivington at TechRadar said Beats by Dr Dre headphones were " a triumph of marketing " that " do n't sound half as good as they look " . Fellow Briton Hugo Jobling told Trusted Reviews ' readers that Beats headphones have " a serious problem with ... audio reproduction " . Earlier this year , The Guardian 's Gibbs and Phipps -- they could be a rap duo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The general theme of ' nice marketing shame about the product ' reached its obvious zenith when Geoffrey Morrison penned a Forbes article titled ' 10 Headphones Better Than Beats ' . All this overwrought handwringing makes the humourless Marques Brownlee viral video ' The Truth About Beats by Dre ! ' seem clich ? . <p> So as I sit here tapping away while witnessing the strength of street knowledge on a pair of Beats Solo2 on-ear headphones ( RRP $249 ) , my expectations managed to the subterranean , I ca n't help but feel they sound pretty good . Like most people , I am not an audiophile : I 'm just a dude who like listening to popular music on public transport while commuting to and from work , tuning out while at work , or plugging a pair of noise cancellers into an in-flight entertainment system while on a longhaul flight . I am normally content with Apple Earbuds . <p> So , shock ! Horror ! There 's a lot to like about these headphones thumping noise into my brain . <p> On If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from can to can and the detail is surprisingly fresh and distinct ; the scratches and cymbals resonate with flare . The ivory tinkles on Parental Discretion Iz Advised are quite delightful . The bass is phenomenal and it still sounds really good when the volume is cranked up to maximum , even if that causes everyone in the cubefarm to pop up like meerkats to see who is listening to gangster rap in the office . This is an unsubtle pair of headphones . <p> When listening to more nuanced music , Beats ' deficiencies are more pronounced . Arcade Fire 's The Suburbs has a tinny redolence ; Amnesia by 5 Seconds of Summer is distorted ; Katy Perry sounds like an alien on This Is How We Do and the folk stylings of Vance Joy sound distant , though that may just be his loneliness . <p> Podcasts sound hollow and nigh on unlistenable : I returned back to the Apple earbuds for my doses of Football Weekly and How Did This Get Made ? . <p> It 's on the heavier , deeper tunes that Beats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2014 must be a Godsend for headphone manufacturers looking to present a very large , heavy sound , immersing the user like at a pentecostal baptism into the rich tapestry of corpulent poundings exuded by this new wave of producers , all of them growing up listening to far too much KLF ( or maybe even Scooter : some of them are so young ) . <p> Animals by Martin Garrix sounds amazing , Robin Schulz 's remix of Prayer In C is orgasmic , Klingande 's Jubel is jubilant . Somewhat ironically , All About That Bass by Meghan Trainor sounds overproduced , though that may be intended . <p> So much of Beats ' appeal comes down to the type of music you will be playing on it . If you listen to a lot of dance and rap , then Beats is ideal . If you are planning on doing up your top button , mixing a dark and stormy and pressing play on Ezra Koenig 's b-sides then best look elsewhere . If you want to listen to a mixture of styles then Beats receives a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fresh , full bodied and fantastically loud , with just some slight imperfections that occasionally present themselves when the tune does n't match the tuning . <p> Enjoying music is only half the Beats experience . The point of these ultra-stylish if decidedly plasticky headphones goes well-beyond audio consumption . Beats are not just a headphone choice but a lifestyle choice : the wearer is making a very pointed social statement when they walk down the street with these bulbous cans -- blacks , reds and whites muddled into a chic pastiche of tech style -- banded over their noggin in an ostentatious display of wealth , grandeur and pride . Beats are like an inverse branding : they are the social marker idealised by slaves to consumerism . <p> I definitely experienced a heightened sense of self-worth while walking down the mean streets of North Sydney wearing Beats Solo2 in black with red piping . The shimmer of the ebony plastic band reflecting the sun ; the super-tangle-free cord in brilliant crimson clashing delightfully with my lime green Modest Mouse t-shirt ; that ' b ' on the exterior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the north is a symbol of both understatement and bold expressionism : Schr ? dinger 's Logo . <p> While walking around indulging in the covert glances of passers-by intrigued by Interpol leaking out of these on-ear style headphones , I constantly had to adjust their positioning on my skull and it must be said that the breadth of band adjustment is woefully inadequate . At their tightest , these headphones still slip from place -- and I have a big head -- and only when I put on my trusty Arsenal cap were they finally able to stay rigid . While the ear cushions have a tasteful thickness , they are hardly pillowy clouds for the ear , and after a long session of use my left ear especially started to feel the strain of their levity brevity . This could be random , like late 90s/early 00s French Open winners , but I suspect it 's a common affliction , like late 50s/early 60s rugby league winners . Philips Citi Scape Downtown headphones currently hold the proud mantle of my at-desk headphones ( and I suspect plenty of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their excellent sound quality , but because they treat my ears with luxury , like a glass of Johnny Blue treats my tongue or business class on an A380 treats my person . <p> In the lead-up to Christmas 2013 , in the pre-Apple acquisition days , the rush to have Beats was significant : summer was coming and that provided ample opportunity to show off Beats to an audience of hip young things , scantily clad and nominally at play . <p> Speaking in February 2014 about headphone sales during that period , Gwenno Hopkin from consumer electronics sales tracker GfK said , " Aided by the strong performance of mobile devices , gifting and some significant promotions and price cuts , the headphones segment enjoyed a strong quarter , reflected in a double-digit value sales growth " . Further strengthening its prominent place in the market , the headphone category overtook audio systems and DVD/Blu-ray Players in terms of total retail value . <p> There is a certain unavoidable feeling of cheapness to Beats Solo2 , not just that corners were cut by using so much plastic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There is so much to like about these headphones -- the sound quality ( essentially very good ) , the accessories ( cable with in-line remote , carry case , carabiner ) , the unequalled elegance of the packaging ( the unpacking of which is like a spectator sport ) -- that it is such a letdown to be holding-cum-wearing something so fundamentally plastic , and not good plastic like the polycarbonate you get on an iPhone 5c : the Beats Solo2 feels like cheap plastic . <p> Appliance Retailer understands that Beats is the number one selling brand in the Australian headphones market , upsetting a number of traditional players that fancy themselves as manufacturers of superior headphones . " The market has turned and our competition has shown that headphones in any colour sells , " said Sennheiser 's local MD Bj ? rn Rennemo Henrikson . Sennheiser 's response is the Momentum series of robust , metallic headphones with a modest injection of colour and style while retaining a highly functional form factor that is so tactfully German . <p> The mindset expressed by Henrikson has fuelled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , AKG and Bose ; and the image conscious , mega-marketing-backed brands , of which Beats is the poster child . The nasally criticisms of Beats that stemmed from its rapid rise do have sound groundings : these headphones definitely do not cost anywhere near $250 to manufacture -- we saw similar but unDoctered models in Hong Kong 12 months ago with $16 unit prices -- but how can you put a price on the intangible , like artificially stimulated self-esteem ? <p> Californian brand Sol Republic emerged in the wake of the Beats ' derision , marketing itself as a heady mixture of style , sound quality and star power . <p> " The headphones were either very cheap and of poor quality or very expensive and high quality , " said company founder Seth Combs in an interview with Silicon Republic . " So our mission from the start has been to bring sound to the masses -- headphones should n't cost more than your smartphone . " <p> Combs talks about high-fallutin ' concepts like " our own sound signature " inspiring " aspirational " purchases while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it were -- a long way shy of Beats Solo2 's US $199 asking price ( RRP $249 in Australia ) . It 's no surprise then that six months after Hopkin 's aforementioned excitement for the headphones category she was forced to dampen the mood : <p> " One of the stronger performing segments in recent times has been headphones . This dynamic segment experienced a significant slowdown in growth in quarter two , partly due to the plateauing of attachment categories such as smartphones and tablets . A year-on-year decline in the number of models available for sale , after several quarters of strong growth , provides further evidence of a maturing category . " <p> Obviously there is more to the decline in the headphones market than simply price erosion and there is likely to be a big surge in the lead-up to Christmas when glamourous new smartphones from Samsung and Apple hit the market . <p> And that brings us to the uncertain future : a Rip !

Now that Beats is owned by Apple there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in market climates and emerge as one of the great survivors , even if the universe itself expires . <p> My contemporary , the very amusing Stilgherrian , today Tweeted that Beats is : " For when you want the whole world to know you 're a gullible tool " .

Not much . <p> We agree with the PHG Foundation , a health think-tank with a focus on genomics and emerging health technologies , that it is crucial that efforts should be put in place now to ensure that patient benefit occurs as a result of the investment in genomics . But doing this wo n't be an easy task . Embedding new genomic knowledge into routine healthcare will involve understanding complex processes of change and innovation in the NHS . <p> It is not clear how the medical specialities of cancer , cardiology and paediatrics ( in which some genetic testing is already being done and which are the areas in which the work of Genome England is focused ) are gearing up to interpret , communicate and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ potentially their family members ) .

Are medical specialities other than clinical genetics prepared to provide routine counselling and informed consent for genetic tests ? These are only some of the myriad complex sociological factors involved in " mainstreaming genomics " in healthcare , but which do n't seem to have been addressed . <p> These are not questions that can be hived off as simply ethical , as if these issues were not part of clinical practice . We argue for more sociologically informed understanding of how all of Genomics England 's endeavours will lead to the promise of patient benefit and transformation of healthcare -- and in ways that are feasible , effective and patient-centred.

This exceeds the returns from the other two major commercial property sectors being retail and office property which generated returns of 9.8% and 9.0% respectively . <p> The strength of the industrial property sector has resulted from strong demand for distribution and warehousing services generated by increases in retail spending in the Australian economy .

It used research to show that many of Australia 's most iconic investments were duds . <p> Apartments at Noosa Heads were at the top of my list of iconic failures -- and today , despite some value growth in the past 12 months , the typical Noosa unit is still worth considerably less than it was 10 years ago . <p> On average , Noosa apartments have fallen in value at a rate of 3% per year for the past decade . It 's the ultimate real estate lemon among our iconic locations . <p> Surfers Paradise apartments have been little better . Despite all the clamour and propaganda about the recovery of the Gold Coast market , there has been no growth in the past 12 months in the median unit price in Surfers Paradise .

It was a press release from the developer of a small project described as " a luxury beachfront development " . <p> The development had sold five apartments off the plan and that , apparently , constituted a boom . Clearly , Byron is growing off a very small base . <p> The research shows that Byron Bay prices have spent more time going backwards than forwards in the past decade . House prices have collapsed several times in the past 10 years , including double-digit declines in 2006 , 2009-2010 and 2012-2013 . <p> Over the past three years , the Byron median house price has dropped by an average 3.4% per year . The long-term growth rate , the average annual growth over 10 years , is marginally better than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to houses , the median price for units remains lower than three years ago and the average growth rate over five years is basically zero . <p> Australian Property Monitors figures indicate the typical Byron Bay apartment placed on the market takes almost a year to find a buyer , while houses typically take seven to eight months to sell . <p> The Australian quoted local agents as claiming that sales turnover in Byron Bay is up 150% on a year ago . But a quick check of the latest data shows no change at all in overall sales volumes compared to a year ago -- and for houses there has actually been a small decline in sales volumes . <p> The problem for Byron is that there is no economic substance to the iconic status . Investing in Byron is like buying in a mining town -- it 's a one-industry town . <p> And , like mining , tourism is volatile and vulnerable .

One is how disruptive this new watch technology will be for the existing market . With speculation that the elite version of the Apple Watch could cost as much as US$5,000 or $10,000 with customisation options , it 's worth considering what kind of an impact this will have on the long-established luxury watch industry and its Swiss heartland . <p> Research I conducted with colleagues into the how the Swiss watchmaking industry responded to the introduction of quartz watches by Japanese producers in the early 1970s can help shed some light on the impact of today 's new technology : the smart watch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the quartz watch then was -- affected the industrial dynamics of traditional Swiss producers of mechanical automatic watches . <p> Quartz watches were not only much cheaper , but even much more accurate than mechanical watches -- anyone who owns an automatic watch knows that it is always a few minutes late . Now , 40 years later , the Apple Watch may represent a similar challenge to Swiss watch producers , even though the nature of the disruption is quite different . <h> Market niche <p> The most interesting result we found from our analysis was that the Swiss firms which focused on improving and developing their mechanical watches were more likely to survive the turmoil of the 1970s and 1980s . Not all Swiss companies stuck with their existing technology -- some started producing quartz watches -- and tended not to fare as well . <p> These results highlighted the existence of what 's called " non-overlapping market niches " . The fact is the new competition quartz watches appealed to a different market . Buyers of expensive mechanical watches were willing to pay high price premiums @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Meanwhile , quartz watches appealed to a different category of watch buyer . With a starting price of US$349 , it would seem that the Apple Watch for the most part will still fall under the " newer and cheaper " category . <h> High-end and heritage <p> Another important differentiating factor for Swiss watchmakers is that they are an elite population with a very strong identity . They are well represented by the " Swiss made " label , proudly exhibited by the Federation of the Swiss Watch Industry and targeting high-end customers . <p> This is something that you can truly feel when you climb up the " Watch Valley " to La Chaux-de-Fonds to visit the International Museum of Horology , where you can surprise yourself by observing decades of history of Swiss automatic watches . People who buy into this heritage will not necessarily view smart watches like Apple 's as a comparable product . <p> In more recent times , a consolidation process has taken place , creating larger and stronger players with deeper pockets , which puts the Swiss watchmaking industry in an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large groups like Swatch and LVMH , which provided them with the needed resources for sustaining innovation and global competition . Their total export was 21.8 billion Swiss francs worldwide in 2013 , of which the vast majority is still represented by mechanical watches . <p> So , if you were to draw a direct comparison between what kind of a threat the Apple Watch may have on the traditional , mechanical watch industry and that of the quartz watches that entered the watch market in the 1970s , you 'd conclude that the Apple Watch will not be a considerable threat . <h> Different kind of disruption <p> But there is an important difference between the Apple Watch and quartz . The innovation of quartz had to do with the core functions of a watch : it made it more accurate and cheaper . The Apple Watch has been presented as a wearable device , doing much more than keeping time . Its disruption has not to do with higher efficiency , but with the introduction of cool new applications . <p> Meanwhile , the market for the Apple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mechanical watches .

Apple will not , however , be able to compete with the heritage of the Swiss watchmaking industry . <p> But , it 's worth noting that when Apple releases new products they have generally beaten expectations of their success . And they have attacked established markets that , at the moment of the their launch , were not seen to be closely related . So , while time may stand still in the Swiss valleys , their traditional watchmakers would be mindful not to underestimate the potential an Apple Watch has to disrupt their market .

Those seeking to radicalise others will be able to summarise it in a single sentence . That sentence is likely to be accepted because it is difficult to find a simple counter argument . The more negative the policy is perceived to be , the less human the government or even British people are perceived to be . <p> This is important because radicalisation thrives when we start to see our enemy as less human than ourselves . <h> Us and them <p> The process of radicalisation involves getting us to focus on the negative experiences we have had and the negative experiences of those we love or should love .

He lays the blame for each of the killings squarely with British and American foreign policy . <p> Religion can also provide a simplistic , absolute framework behind which to hide from discussion , debate and accountability .

The more human we can make the enemy , the less we will feel separated from them . Only when we stop seeing the opposition as completely different to us , can we start to be reconciled with them . <p> Rational arguments are one way to contradict the line peddled by radicals . The UK 's policy on Syria has many dimensions . The British public is deeply committed to humanitarian and charitable support , as was made clear when ? 3.4m was donated to the cause in just 48 hours in March 2013 .

Shouting about the positive work it does internationally , offering young people the chance to make a positive contribution and acting transparently are all ways to counteract the messages being sent to young people by those who wish to indoctrinate them .

@@2806231 <p> Perhaps the most interesting type of reform to have emerged from the global financial crisis is the call for " macroprudential " regulation . Macroprudential regulation , in broadest terms , seeks to manage the level of risk in the financial system at the aggregate -- and hence " macro " -- level . <p> Reserve Bank Governor Glenn Stevens , a reluctant supporter of macroprudential regulation , has suggested there 's room for it to be used in Australia for a " limited time " . <p> " That 's the kind of thing that is in my mind , nothing more . I do n't think that 's any kind of change of tune or anything -- I 've always said I have a certain scepticism about macroprudential tools as a panacea , but I remain open to using them if it seems sensible to do so . " <h> A crisis of ideas <p> The global financial crisis was not simply an economic crisis . It was also a crisis of ideas .

Closer to home , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into question the prevailing neo-liberal economic orthodoxy of the past 30 years . " <p> Yet , expectations of rapid change were soon frustrated . Instead , policymakers like US Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner recognised the wisdom expressed by John Maynard Keynes in 1933 -- that goals of reform and recovery could often be at odds with one another . Keynes even advanced these views in an open letter to Franklin Roosevelt , arguing : <p> " even wise and necessary reform may ... impede and complicate recovery . For it will upset the confidence of the business world ... before you have had time to put other motives in their place . " <p> In other words , even as nervous animal spirits had caused the boom and bust , reform could now push the " state of confidence " in the wrong direction .

In this light , an important early move by the Geithner Treasury was to introduce " stress tests " which were designed -- much like the Roosevelt bank holiday of March 1933 -- to provide a means to revive risk taking . <p> Now , a half-decade out from the GFC , it 's clear what emerged is a gradual transition rather than a " Great Transformation " ) . <h> Managing micro risk at a macro level <p> Macro-level regulation worries less about the health of individual firms than the direction in which the overall economy is trending . Indeed , the oft-derided Geithner Treasury stress tests represented a macroprudential innovation , to the extent that they were meant to increase systemic risk at a time of market pessimism . <p> More formally , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meanings of macroprudential regulation . Fischer argues that macroprudential rules pertain to both " the supervision of the financial system as a whole " and " the use of regulatory or other non-interest-rate tools of policy to deal with problems arising from the behavior of asset prices . " <p> It is because of the second meaning of macroprudential regulation that macroprudential regulation has acquired increasing support since the GFC -- particularly among central bankers . This reflects most importantly their institutional or bureaucratic interests , as they are loathe to risk financial instability , but equally unwilling to impose restraint where it threatens to undermine real growth or employment -- and so prompt the sorts of political backlash that may jeopardise the ultimate value of policy independence itself . <p> First , while monetary policymakers might seek to limit inflation or financial instability , they are often hesitant to do so where this requires " taking away the punch bowl " and limiting economic policy growth . <p> Macroprudential instruments -- Fischer 's " regulatory or other non-interest-rate tools " -- may enable policymakers to keep a lid on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real pain across the economy -- and so incur calls for limiting monetary policy independence . <p> Secondly , where wage-price spirals or asset-price bubbles acquire a self-reinforcing momentum , this can render them resistant to conventional monetary restraint . In such contexts , central bankers often must impose a punishing degree of austerity across the wider economy to achieve " targeted " reductions in financial instability , labour market power driving wage-price pressures , or commodity price pressures . <p> Where they can employ regulatory mechanisms that contain such pressures " at the source , " policymakers can negate ostensible trade-offs between monetary stability and full employment , as controls can be used to " keep the lid " on financial or monetary instability , while expanding the space for fiscal or monetary easing to spur growth onwards . <h> Delivering stability and growth <p> Such benefits of macroprudential regulation have facilitated not simply the broad ideological support for change that marked the early post-GFC setting . They have also fueled a shift in institutional attitudes , as central bankers -- most explicitly at the US Federal Reserve -- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to better thread the needle of reconciling stability and growth and provide an " alibi " that might limit political calls for restrictions on monetary policy autonomy . <p> In more historical terms , macroprudential concerns -- albeit by other names -- have been at the centre of policy debates for nearly a century . First , in the midst of the bull market of the 1920s , again by wartime economists in the 1940s in the form of wage and price controls to boost wartime production , and in the 1970s when Nixon-Ford Federal Reserve Chairman Arthur Burns argued that wage-price restraints could limit " stagflationary " excesses , holding down labour pressures for higher wages while enabling fiscal activism . <p> In the early 2000s , Federal Reserve Board Member Edward Gramlich urged more direct regulatory efforts to tamp down on subprime abuses , in advance of the acceleration of the subprime bubble itself . <p> " it is critical for regulators to complete their efforts at implementing a macroprudential approach to enhance resilience within the financial system , which will minimize the likelihood that monetary policy will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ price stability and full employment . " <p> Taken as a whole , this analysis highlights the irony that the most substantial policy changes to emerge from the GFC have reflected less populist appeals or a neo-liberal critique so much as a shift in technocratic attitudes . In short , where bureaucrats " stand " depends not only on where they " sit " but also how they think .

@@2806237 <p> Clive Palmer has struck a deal with the government to reintroduce temporary protection visas.AAP/Stefan Postles <p> Once again Clive Palmer has shown he 'll deal on Coalition legislation , at a price . And once more Immigration minister Scott Morrison has demonstrated he 'll do what it takes to " land " government 's policy . <p> The Palmer United Party has agreed to support the government 's bid to reintroduce temporary protection visas but only with another category of visa being set up , the bizarrely named Safe Haven Enterprise Visa . These would be temporary but they would provide the possibility -- no more than that -- of a road to permanent settlement . <p> Under the deal , all those asylum seekers currently in Australia , including people who arrived after this government was elected , would be processed . The total is around 30,000 people . Most are living in the community ( without work rights ) but some , including hundreds of children , are on Christmas Island . <p> After processing , those not found to be refugees would be sent home ; the rest could apply for TPVs or SHEVs . <p> Under the SHEVs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was a labour shortage and which wanted them . SHEVs would be valid for five years -- if a person worked for three and a half , they could apply for some other visa such as a student visa , a 457 visa , or a skilled migrant visa . They could n't seek a permanent protection visa . <p> Palmer talks up the opportunity that would be provided by SHEVs , pointing out that " some regions have critical labour shortages " . Morrison talks it down . He tried to avoid admitting directly this could be a road to permanency via a back door , instead stressing that " they will never get a permanent protection visa " ( and that , he said , was the Coalition 's election commitment ) . <p> " These benchmarks of working or studying in these regional areas are very high . Our experience on resettlement for people in this situation would mean that this is a very high bar to clear , " Morrison said . " Good luck to them if they choose to do that and if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The ability of people to walk that road would depend on regional communities and employers being willing to receive them . It would be up to these communities -- the government would not be dictating to any region - and Morrison was hardly spruiking the benefits to them . <p> " I would urge regions to think about what they 're able to bring to the table to support people coming into their communities and to consider that carefully and to talk about it and make it an informed decision . " <p> TPVs are inhumane -- people would be reviewed after three years and those found no longer in need of protection would be sent home , forcibly if that were necessary and possible . The TPV system means people who are genuine refugees are consigned to a life of uncertainty . There are no rights of family reunion ; the person ca n't leave the country and return . <p> On the other hand , at present all these asylum seekers are in limbo , without ability to plan for the future and surviving on minimal welfare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be eventually cleared . Refugees who went onto TPVs would be able to work . The SHEVs could provide long term hope for some people , but equally they could be a cruel mirage . For those on them to have a prospect of success would require some enlightened communities and employers , and help by refugee advocates and voluntary organisations such as churches in finding places for people . It should be possible but it would be challenging . <p> The Morrison legislation toughens executive powers to prevent successful court challenges and also removes reference to the Refugee Convention to which we would remain signed up . " We are a sovereign country . We get to decide what our rules are and what are obligations are , " he said . " We were part of the original group of countries that signed the Refugee Convention . We know what we signed up to and those commitments are contained fully in this legislation . "

Those brokerage statements showed liquid assets ranging from 4.4 billion yen to 4.8 billion yen .

Rather than selling a single share of a small recruiting company called J- Com for 610,000 yen , Mizuho offered 610,000 shares for 1 yen each .

That site is no longer around , but in the summer of 2013 , someone authored a Wikipedia page about CIS . It 's complete with a bar chart purporting to show how his fortune snowballed , starting with 1 million yen -- about $10,440 -- in 2000 . " The numbers are a little off , " CIS says . " But the basic idea is right . " <p> Cheap wine <p> Early in his career , CIS made a name for himself trash-talking on 2channel , Japan 's most heavily visited online bulletin board . He became notorious for such lines as " Not even Goldman Sachs can beat me in a trade " and " Excuse me while I go flush some cheap wine that only cost me 800,000 yen . " <p> In 2011 , CIS made his only TV appearance , on a popular variety show called Waratte Iitomo , or It 's OK to Laugh .

" The guy 's a star , " says Naoki Murakami , a trader who blogs under the name Murayan . " Everybody read his 2channel posts .

" <p> A careful chronicler of his own trades who spares himself no embarrassment in posting his results online , Murakami has become a minor celebrity in his own right and gets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investor conferences . <p> He shares chat room friends with CIS , the kind of connection that 's typical in Japan 's day-trader world , where everyone knows everyone through several degrees of chat room separation . ( Some even vacation together ; Murakami and three other traders went to see Canada 's northern lights a year ago . It was Bali the spring before that . ) <p> In person , it 's not easy to square CIS with the bravado of his online alter ego -- or his wealth . Pale from hours staring into computer monitors , he looks like the video game junkie he once was . Stress has given him chronic stomach pain and a dusting of gray at the temples . <p> No bling <p> CIS 's friends are primarily other traders , people like Kenji Uemura , a former Sony engineer and the author of a how-to book on trading now in its fifth printing . A 39-year-old with an Elvis-style hairdo and sideburns , Uemura says he has put together 300 million yen in a decade of trading , and like CIS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The kind of person who wastes money on that stuff would never have made it this far , " says Uemura , whom traders know as Kemu . " Self-control is so important . You have to conserve your assets . That 's what insulates you from the downturns and gives you the ammunition to make money . " <p> Skipping class in high school to play pachinko , a hybrid of slots and pinball , CIS discovered he had a talent for winning games . At 15 , he says , he could earn 400,000 yen a month gambling . One secret was identifying the machines most likely to give bigger payouts . Another was being able to endure 13 hours at a time in smoke-filled and deafeningly loud pachinko parlors ; he had to play thousands of consecutive games to take advantage of the odds . <p> Stockpiles <p> CIS says he barely got his degree in mechanical engineering , having devoted most of college to the fantasy role-playing game Ultima Online . Holed up in his bedroom , he spent days on end roaming the game @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He calls this an early exercise in building and protecting assets . <p> Wicked keyboard skills were a must . He memorised more than 100 key-stroke shortcuts -- control-A to guzzle a healing potion or shift-S to draw a sword , for example -- and he could dance between them without taking his eyes off the screen . " Some people can do it , some ca n't , " he says with a shrug . But the game taught a bigger lesson : when to cut and run . <p> " I was a pretty confident player , but just like in the real world , the more opponents you have , the worse your chances are , " he says . " You lose nothing by running . " <p> That 's how he now plays the stock market . CIS says he bets wrong four out of 10 times . The trick is to sell the losers fast while letting the winners ride . For him , a well-played stop-loss is just about the most beautiful trade there is . <p> Thing of beauty <p> That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the one from February may turn out to be his best move this year . On the first trading day of the year , he dumped 4.5 billion yen worth of SoftBank shares . He took a 2.5 percent loss on the day but got out with a 650 million yen profit on the position , which he 'd built since mid-October . SoftBank slid 18 per cent in the month after he sold , and weeks later , regulatory filings showed why : Capital Group , the giant US fund manager , had been offloading the shares . <p> Stocks entered the picture for CIS when he was in his early 20s and working as a designer of industrial shock absorbers at a small manufacturer . He began by betting on what he thought were undervalued companies , and he lost money . <p> He found success after a friend gave him a piece of advice : Forget the fundamentals . CIS does n't subscribe to the Nikkei or any other newspaper . Nor does he scrutinise earnings reports or parse central bank statements or spend much time looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with technical trading . <p> One rule <p> Instead , he keeps his ears open in chat rooms and his eyes glued to bid-ask screens , on which he monitors the market 's appetite for its 300 most heavily traded stocks . If there 's one basic principle , he says - repeatedly and slowly , as if instructing a child - it is this : " Buy stocks that are being bought , and sell stocks that are being sold . " <p> That 's more profound than it sounds , according to Hersh Shefrin , professor of behavioral finance at Santa Clara University in California and author of Beyond Greed and Fear , a 2007 book about the role of psychology in investing . The human mind is hard-wired to bet on reversals , Shefrin says . <p> It 's a phenomenon called the gambler 's fallacy . At a craps table , for example , players tend to shift their bets toward numbers that have n't come up , even though the odds do n't change with each roll of the dice . In the same way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buying when stocks fall and selling when they go up . <p> Momentum <p> " If you can get yourself out of that mindset and bet against the crowd , who act instinctively , then you have an opportunity to make money , " Shefrin says . <p> Two years after learning to follow the momentum , CIS says , he 'd made 80 million yen day trading on the sly at the office . In late 2003 , he quit the salaryman life to work the market full time . <p> Since then , there have been more than a million trades , CIS estimates . Early on , he held most positions for just seconds at a time , making hundreds of moves each day . Now that he has more money , there 's no choice but to hold positions longer , because shifting such large sums in and out of the market influences prices . <p> Toward the end of a slow day in early July , CIS e-mailed a screen shot of his brokerage account at SBI Holdings . It was a snapshot that looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the course of the year . Unrealised gains on the day were in red : 200 million yen . <p> Mah-jongg <p> The holdings : 254,000 shares of Toyota , 4.2 million shares of Nomura Holdings and 6 million shares of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group , among a dozen other positions . It was a 13.2 billion yen portfolio , financed with 4.4 billion yen in cash , that would probably all be liquidated within days . <p> One thing CIS would n't sell was a 100-share stake in Yoshinoya Holdings , operator of a fast-food chain beloved by cash-strapped college kids . It 's a " little keepsake , " he explained as he speed walked to a mah-jongg parlor in the Roppongi nightlife district , where he has a regular 3pm game with trader buddies . <p> When CIS is n't betting on stocks , he 's gaming elsewhere . He plays low-stakes mah-jongg most afternoons after the market closes and is ranked in the top 99.94 percentile of 3 million players on a site called Ten Hou , where he plays under the name CISCIS . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's poker or blackjack , online and sometimes in person .

Tax records show he owns two apartment buildings , the larger of which-a modernist cube in central Tokyo with a French bar on the ground floor-could easily be worth the 700 million yen CIS says he paid for it , according to an estimate from Tokyo real estate consultant Mount Partners . <p> Many of the day traders in CIS 's circle can be considered wealthy , especially after the bull market of 2013 . But CIS is on a different level .

@@2809237 be a new dawn . Since June 30 this year all UK employees have been granted the right to request flexible working . It is clearly an important step in the battle to achieve some form of balance between our work and non-work lives , but it looks like being a tricky battle . Research still shows that there are gaps between the idealised outcomes and realities of flexible working . <p> Persistent gender stereotypes are affecting those who make use of the new entitlements and there is also a stigmatisation of those employees who try to take advantage of the policies on offer . There is also evidence that flexible working can actually lead to an increased workload and the inability to " switch off " from work . <p> This raises the question of how flexible working actually affects the balance between work and non-work life , and what it means in our day-to-day lives . <p> My recent research project sought to explore the impact of flexible working on the daily experiences of dual-earner couples by asking these couples to keep daily diaries over a month . I was interested in particular in how flexible working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times <p> Findings revealed that the question of who has access to flexible working within the couples had an important impact on how daily work-family conflicts were experienced and resolved . <p> When women worked flexibly but their male partners did not , they actually experienced an increase in demands from the home . In these cases , women tended to assume the majority of duties related to home and family , while their male partners tended to be excused from such responsibilities and therefore shielded from the daily experiences of conflict between work and family demands . <p> It was also evident that some of the women in the study were reluctant to share family responsibilities with their partners -- for some women , maintaining a " maternal role " remains an important part of how they view themselves and they may feel a sense of failure if they do not retain full responsibility for all elements of this role . They may also simply be accustomed to carrying out these responsibilities , leaving less opportunity for their partner to be involved . Either way , this research shows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flexible working can help perpetuate traditional gender divisions . <h> Conflict resolution <p> However , in cases where men had more flexible jobs than their female partners , women remained highly involved in the resolution of daily work-family conflicts , even when they were unable to resolve the conflict themselves directly . <p> Those men whose partners worked flexibly often failed to report incidents of work-family conflict , there were no conflicts recorded in a male 's diary that were not at least mentioned in their partner 's diary . This was still the case for those females whose partners had substantially greater flexibility at work than they themselves had access to . <p> While a woman with flexible working arrangements might to some extent shield their partners from the experience of daily work-family conflicts , this does not necessarily work in reverse , but rather leads to greater equality and sharing of family responsibilities within these couples . <h> Overcoming stereotypes <p> The research suggests that when women have more flexibility about the hours they work it is more likely to perpetuate the gender stereotype that they are more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for home-related tasks , rather than allowing their partners to help . This can lead to an intensification of responsibilities for women and often an increase in work-family conflict . <p> Meanwhile when it is men who are able to be more flexible about their working arrangements it can help couples achieve greater equality in terms of managing family responsibilities . <p> So if flexible working and other " family-friendly " policies are to have the desired effects , encouraging men to take up this opportunity is very important . There needs to be a conscious move away from maintaining the usual female focus in policy implementation . Human resource professionals and managers alike need to encourage all employees , regardless of gender , to achieve a genuine balance between their work and non-work responsibilities if flexibility is to be truly beneficial to employees and families . <p> We just have to wait and see whether the new legislation will have the desired impact . It certainly seems a step in the right direction , but the question remains as to whether people 's traditional ideas of their gender roles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full advantage of this new legislation in a way that it might have a positive impact on our work-life balance . 
@@2809238 <p> It 's difficult to see how Tony Abbott can avoid a summer reshuffle and easy to believe he 's not relishing the prospect . <p> Few around the Coalition believe that Arthur Sinodinos will return to his assistant treasurer post after he performed unimpressively at the Independent Commission Against Corruption hearings , although ICAC 's assessment is not out until later in the year . <p> Abbott would like to retain Sinodinos but to keep him as assistant treasurer would surely not be politically practical , after it has become obvious that he did not have his eye on the financial balls in his company and party roles . Could Abbott have him in some other position ? That would probably depend on precisely what ICAC says . <p> Some PMs look upon reshuffles as opportunities but Abbott does not appear to be one of them . He seems to dwell more on the risks . People who are dumped , excluded or otherwise disappointed can cause trouble . Even dropping as minor a player as Ian Macdonald from his frontbench when he came to power has caused Abbott grief . And whatever he does from now on , there will be muttering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just deal with a single vacancy without having to make consequential changes . But let 's assume Abbott went for minimalism . Ambitious backbenchers , some of them with not just talent but experience , would be annoyed and maybe restless . They would fear that another opportunity could be a political eternity away . They 'd be asking : how long does a Christian Porter , former treasurer of Western Australia , or a Kelly O'Dwyer , well-qualified former banker and staffer to then treasurer Peter Costello , have to wait ? <p> And if Abbott did not take advantage of what effectively would be a forced reshuffle to get more women into the team , when -- if ever -- would he do that ? <p> At the higher levels of the existing team , there is another sort of pressure . Immigration minister Scott Morrison is bursting out of his political skin . <p> Morrison has stopped the boats . This week he did a deal with Clive Palmer which , assuming he gets the necessary extra Senate votes , will restore temporary protection visas and see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He finished the week with a trip to Cambodia to sign an agreement for refugees from Nauru to go there . <p> As Morrison ticks off his KPIs he also dramatically shrinks his job . Anyway , it 's not a post any minister wants for long . <p> Morrison is doing a side shuffle without waiting for a reshuffle . He has moved himself into the anti-terrorism rhetorical space , doing many media appearances . <p> Whether it will come about is another matter , though certainly Attorney-General George Brandis , who 'd stand to lose some of his territory , is said to be twitchy . <p> Like Morrison , Brandis had a win this week , when the first tranche of the anti-terrorism legislation cleared the Senate . But the gloss was somewhat rubbed off for the Attorney by TV pictures of Labor shenanigans in the Senate over his joining the rather quaint male-only Savage Club in Melbourne . The club was chaired by Robert Menzies from 1947 to 1962 . Brandis ' membership nomination was seconded by Tom Harley , a moderate and a federal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year to have replaced , enlisting the aid of Christopher Pyne . Brandis backed Harley , who survived against the odds . <p> There is n't a compelling case for a homeland security portfolio , despite the superficial logic . It would hardly be worth having it if ASIO were not brought under it . But it would n't be desirable to take ASIO out of the Attorney-General 's portfolio . There are already serious issues of civil rights with the anti-terrorism legislation -- that problem would be exacerbated if ASIO were under a more operational portfolio . <p> It is understood the Prime Minister 's Office believes that ASIO should stay with Attorney-General 's ( as does ASIO ) . The more practical play is potentially around the Australian Federal Police , who currently come under the Justice Minister Michael Keenan . But again , the argument for bringing them into a homeland security ministry is n't strong . While their counter-terrorism work is high profile , the largest part of their activities is dealing with organised crime . <p> Anyway , present arrangements in the anti-terrorism area seem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more pain than gain . <p> If the homeland security ministry is n't a goer , Abbott would be left with the interesting problem of a minister whose wings had outgrown his cage . <p> Abbott recently has been having meetings with his ministers to discuss how things are going . These reportedly have been one-on-ones -- not even Abbott 's chief of staff Peta Credlin has been in them . <p> In a political party performance assessment goes both ways -- the leader assesses the troops and the troops assess the leader . Assuming the reshuffle comes , how he handles it will be one of the KPIs by which Abbott will be judged .

They have to switch their mindset from playing as individuals to playing as a team -- and four of the five rounds are played as a pair , teams within teams . When teams work well , the whole is greater than the sum of the parts . And instead of the usual big cash prizes , the prize is preserving their esteem against their fellow players . <p> Because it only happens once every two years , if you get it wrong you are going to be remembered among your peers as the one who duffed the vital shot .

The scars can be deeper . <h> Chokers beware <p> During the practice days at Gleneagles for this year 's tournament , many of the players were focusing heavily on putting . The team that putts the best will win , not least because putting is the skill which is most vulnerable to players losing their nerve , known as " choking " in the trade . From a sports psychology point of view , helping golfers to recreate the sense of all-or-nothing pressure is vitally important . One technique I use is to wait until the end of a training session , until the player is tired and wants to go home , then ask them to sink 20 consecutive putts . If they miss one , they have to start from the beginning again .

It 's important to have an external focus on the ball , the club , even the blades of grass by the tee . That 's better than thinking about the position of your arms , your feet or something else internal . <p> Psychologists for the Ryder Cup would also want to work on team play . International football managers strive to recreate club team spirit , but you ca n't do that in golf . But you 've got to succeed in getting a team mentality together all the same .

McGinley has picked Ian Poulter as one of his , a player who missed three cuts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . McGinley is backing his instinct that Poulter will be transformed into the player who won all four of his matches in 2012 , again as a wildcard . <p> Scotland 's Stephen Gallacher is the only wildcard rookie on either side . Without him there was the prospect of the Ryder Cup being played in Scotland without any Scottish players . He was picked ahead of Luke Donald , the English player who topped the world rankings early in 2012 . In Gallacher 's final tournament before the Ryder Cup , he missed the cut , citing the distraction of the upcoming date at Gleneagles .

And if we put aside copyright for a moment , the undisputed champion in the world of sharing music is the humble mix-tape . <p> A thoughtful mix-tape is the culmination of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years listening to the Wu Tang Clan are revived as Ol ' Dirty Bastard 's dulcet tones neatly segue into a Janis Joplin classic and back into an instrumental by Hermitude . And now that you 've moved beyond the nonsense of " guilty listening pleasures " , you 're free to determine whether Billy Ocean , Phil Collins or Heart is appropriate to follow . The mix-tape curator should have a clear head and be open to all the tools at their disposal , including Def Leppard . <p> Advertisement <p> Music illuminates meaning where all else fails , and the mix-tape succeeds because it draws from your personal perspective ; it 's a recommendation but more importantly an invitation ; and as a participatory act in music culture , it 's greatly underrated . <p> More than all of the above , though , it 's an expression of love and/or respect requiring no expertise whatsoever . <p> Ultimately , it 's an exercise in genuinely thinking about the other person and how the music relates to them . When judged in this context , there 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this personalised collection . It is part of the bridge that links the maker and receiver of the mix-tape and it 's not merely sentimental awesomeness , it 's a beautiful way of communicating . If modern life is defined by the hyper-competitive focus for our attention , then this is a deep breath . Accidental therapy . <p> Never let copyright get in the way of such an act of generosity . The music industry needs you and your ridiculously weird and great song selections because you 're reminding us about how great music is . Also , you 're not on the sidelines while the musicians take centre stage ; you 're bringing people in the door and that 's vital -- music needs non-experts as much as it needs the professionals . It may be that you do n't have a musical bone in your body , but that is irrelevant here . Besides , when has that ever stopped anyone ? Hi Redfoo ! <p> Streaming services know it - they have identified tastemakers and those individuals who want to share playlists with others - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their platforms . They are carving out an important role that was previously the domain of music journalists and radio DJs . And while there is nothing like a physical mix-tape - think about the artwork and the handwritten tracklist - streaming does has a role to play in evolving the concept . The song options are almost unlimited and you do n't have the space constraints of a cassette tape or CD . It 's almost too easy . <p> At the conclusion of the first Make Me a Mix-tape show I recently did in Brisbane , I was taken aback by the amount of people saying they were heading home to make their own . I could n't have thought of a better outcome . Make your own and save my bloody time . <p> So while not quite the radical call Peter Costello made for the country to have wild unprotected sex , this is a loud endorsement for more mix-tapes in whatever style and shape they take .

@@2890235 <h> Authors <h> Disclosure statement <p> Claire Crawford receives funding for her research from a range of government departments , research councils , charitable trusts and other organisations , including the Economic and Social Research Council , the Nuffield Foundation , the Department for Education , Universities UK , the Education Endowment Foundation and the Sutton Trust . All of her research is independent and the views expressed in this article are entirely her own . <p> University is often seen as a route to social mobility , providing the chance for all students to get higher status and better paid jobs no matter what kind of school they went to . But in our new research we found that three and a half years after finishing university , graduates who attended private schools earn an average of 7% more per year than graduates who went to state school . This is even if we compared those who went to the same universities to study the same subjects and who received the same degree class . <p> Previous research has suggested that education plays an important role in " levelling the playing field " between poor and rich students . This has prompted substantial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ results of young people from disadvantaged backgrounds to achieve greater levels of social mobility . <p> Implicit in these policies is the assumption that once a person has graduated from university , their family background and the school they went to will cease to impact on how much they earn , or that the link will at least be reduced . But our new research proves that there is actually a strong relationship between the kind of schools graduates attended and their success in the labour market . <h> ? 1,500 premium <p> Our work relies on data from a cohort of British graduates who studied full-time for a first degree and graduated from a UK higher education institution in 2006-7 . We have measures of earnings six months after graduation as part of the Destination of Leavers from Higher Education survey and then for a subset of the cohort some three and a half years after graduation . <p> We found that graduates who attended a private school went on to earn significantly more than graduates who went to state schools . As might be expected , some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down to the fact that they have better A-level grades and go on to attend more prestigious universities and study subjects which tend to be more highly rewarded . <p> But even when we accounted for differences in the universities attended , subjects studied and the class of degree achieved , those who went to private school still earn 7% more , on average , than their state-educated contemporaries . <p> Our previous work found that graduates who attended private schools are more likely to enter higher status and higher paying occupations . But even when we allowed for differences in choice of occupation amongst our sample , we still found that privately educated graduates earn 6% more , on average , than their state-educated peers . This is equivalent to around ? 1,500 a year in our data . <h> Networks and fuller CVs <p> So why does private schooling continue to exert an influence on graduates ' earnings ? And why does higher education not level the playing field ? Our research can not provide definitive answers to these questions but there are a number of possible explanations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , aspirations or other soft skills that help the graduate in the labour market and which could help to explain their higher earnings . Alternatively , it may be that private schools provide opportunities to develop strong personal networks that then help the graduate succeed in the world of work . <p> Or perhaps families that invest in private schooling also invest in other aspects of their children 's lives that then benefit these children in their early careers . For example , families may spend money on tutors , music lessons , art trips and foreign travel , which could provide additional skills that look good on a CV and prove useful in the labour market . <p> Since we do not have data on all these aspects of parental inputs , we have n't been able to separate out their effects on the relationship between private schooling and subsequent earnings . Future research might usefully focus on distinguishing between these alternative explanations for why the influence of family background lingers long beyond graduation. @ @ @ @ @

Burkina Faso is one of the US 's centres of operation in a part of the world that 's become increasingly relevant to the fight against terrorism , a country wedged between Boko Haram in Nigeria , Al Qaeda in the Islamic Mahgreb in Algeria and Niger , and Ansar al Dine in Mali . <p> Compaore 's Burkina Faso was important for a separate yet related reason : the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lose sight of this now , what with the country 's current relative stability and a spate of other , fresher terrorism-related sagas over the past couple years . But the collapse of Mali after a coup in March of 2012 threatened to create a vast terrorist safe haven in west Africa and rapidly became one of the world 's major security crises . <p> Junior officers ousted the country 's elected president in March of 2012 , partly because of his failure to confront an intensifying Tuareg insurgency roiling the country 's north . In the ensuing collapse of the Malian state , most of the northern half of the country was taken over by a constellation of hardcore jiihadist groups and Tuareg nationalists , some of them former mercenaries for recently ousted Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi . <p> By mid-2012 , and with astonishing speed , Mali became an example of how an obscure and essentially local dispute over governance , ethnicity , and citizenship could mutate into the possible jihadist takeover of a sizable country not far from mainland Europe . <p> The crisis seemed to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in January of 2013 , sending the jihadists fleeing from the region 's major cities and leaving the new government in Bamako to negotiate with the Tuaregs . But as Thomas Miles , an independent scholar and author of an upcoming book on Mali and Niger told Busines Insider , Compaore played a crucial mediating role in a situation that remains in flux , providing a safe haven for non-jihadist Tuareg groups while holding a certain amount of leverage over them . <p> " This removes somebody who 's abetting the conflict , " Miles says , " but it also removes somebody who can control some of its actors .

" <p> Compaore was well-positioned both politically and geographically to become a vital US ally in West Africa . It does n't seem like the immediate transitional period will threaten American activities in the country : the military is supposed to shepherd Burkina Faso through a transitional period before handing off power to a civilian government . <p> But as Miles explains , a more open political system could complicate US policy . Burkina Faso has an unusually active left-wing bloc by regional standards , thanks partly to the legacy of Thomas Sankara , the Burkinabe president sometimes referred to as West Africa 's Che Guevara . Compaore was part of the plot that resulted in Sankara 's ouster and execution in 1987 . <p> " Opposition to American basing could become a real card for the left , a really active left that has a lot of popular support , much more so than in other places in the region , " says Miles . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even though it 's not something that most of the actual power brokers share .

And the US could always redeploy its forces to neighbouring Niger , whose government has also been broadly cooperative with American security efforts . <p> But Burkina Faso 's change in leadership already poses some major challenges . It could upset the ever-fragile and unresolved situation in Mali , where there have been deadly clashes between the French military and militant groups this week . And it could lead the US into conflict with a future government in Ouagadougou the character of which is currently unknowable -- at least in the frantic 24 hours after nearly 30 years of US-friendly rule has come to an end . 
@@2893238 <p> One would think a man with four stars on his collar leading U.S. forces in Afghanistan just one year ago would have no problem working with military leadership in the fight against militants of the so-called Islamic State at present . <p> But for retired Marine Gen. John Allen , who was appointed by President Obama in September as special envoy to lead the global coalition to counter the militant group , that calculus has been wrong . <p> ReutersGen . Lloyd Austin <p> An article posted at Foreign Policy on Thursday by Mark Perry lists a surprising number of detractors to Allen 's appointment , including many in and out of uniform . The most obvious rift comes from Gen. Lloyd Austin , the man in charge of Central Command , tasked with carrying out the military plan to " degrade and destroy " ISIL , the administration 's preferred acronym for the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant . <p> " Why the hell do we need a special envoy -- is n't that what Secretary of State John Kerry 's for ?

Austin at Centcom , who is charged with overseeing relationships , offering military support , and carrying out operations when necessary in 20 Middle Eastern countries , including Iraq and Syria . <p> REUTERS <p> Indeed , Gen. James Mattis -- the commander before Austin at Centcom -- demonstrated a perfect example of the military 's ability to build coalitions without outside support , in retelling how he got 29 nations together to counter Iran 's attempt to mine the Strait of Hormuz . <p> " The military overseas can do more than simply reinforce foreign policy , " Mattis said earlier this year .

It was a slight " that left Allen steaming , " a former high-level civilian Pentagon official confirmed . <p> Even Gen. Anthony Zinni -- himself a former Centcom commander who later served as special envoy to Israel for peace talks in 2002 -- was critical of Allen 's appointment ( via The Tampa Tribune ) : <p> " John Allen is a great guy , but does it take a retired general to coordinate a coalition ?

Bizarrely , she once attended a London cocktail party with a " gigantic handbag " that contained a head of lettuce covered with snails , whom she said were her " companions for the evening " . <p> A Texan by birth , Highsmith is renowned as one of the leading psychological thriller writers of her era . Her novel Strangers on a Train was adapted into a film by Alfred Hitchcock in 1951 .

I put this down to being a SUV ( aerodynamics ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -- which journalists do not mention at all .... but auto do -- esp Volvo <p> The performance of the XC60 T5 is very good , FWD standing starts needs a gentle approach , as you have DSG ( Ford Powershift ) but amazingly gets better with mileage -- over 15000km . If you want to race cars from the lights then FWD is not the go but even though I have done drag racing for years I do not find the FWD a limitation in urban driving . <p> Also , the tip in throttle response and turbo -- ECU tuning on the Ecoboost engine is tuned to drive that way , very toey like a big V6 low down but not much more push after . Would get the S60 chipped and even if it does not have any more power would drive more linear type driving but I guess thats a driver preference . <p> Peter <p> Gold Coast ! I 'm talking about the 2.5 5 cyl turbo , not the whatever 4 cyl that they call a T5 ? ? ? ? My missus has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It also has a slushbox and not dsg . But I 've had heaps of 5 pot turbos -- the 2.3 HPT in a C70T5 coupe ( did n't notice fuel economy back then ) , the 2 s40T5s ( 2.5 SPT ) , and a manual s60R with the 225KW/400Nm 2.5 HPT ( I was getting 14l/100km out of that but driving it hard , I 've mellowed since ) . The current 5 pot turbo in the v40T5 is about 185KW with some overboost as well I think , it is about as quick from 0 -- 100 as the s60R was ( the manual was a bit faster ) and far more efficient , though still thirsty compared to ( say ) the Benz 4 cyl turbo . <p> Norm <p> Volvos do n't mind a drink . That 's been their history . Yes the aerodynamics of an SUV are what they are but there are plenty of reasonably economical mid size SUVs around now . <p> Rav-man <p> Would be interesting to see a comparison between the v60cc vs xc60 ... let the battle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me that I do n't get why they are building it ! V60 and xc60 have virtually identical length , wheelbase , cabin space and style -- the xc60 is taller and so feels more light and airy inside . Not a whole lot of difference . <p> Norm <p> This one 's a bit prettier than the XC60 which really does n't work for me . Maybe the XC90 set the bar too high ? <p> Smart US <p> i have seen Falcon wagon on higher springs and bit of body work and it looked the money . <p> Anton <p> These are among the longest comments I 've ever seen . <p> Snurf <p> Hm <p> Cam <p> Great ! I was worried about the XC70 not being replaced with something similar ... I am going to guess this is the answer to it . The new XC60 I 'll assume will move up-market ( in line with the new SC90 ) and this will fill the $65K -- $80K bracket . <p> The sad part is the XC70 will probably not be replaced . Such a shame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love this car . <p> tonyW <p> This V60 CC does not replace the XC70 . The XC70 ( along with the S80 sedan and V70 ) will be continuing for at least another 12 months before being replaced by the all new S90 sedan and V90 wagon . There will also be a high-riding CC version of the V90 which will replace the current XC70 . We probably wont see these new models in Australia until early 2016 . The current 60 series Volvos ( S60 , V60/V60CC &amp; XC60 ) will be replaced by all new models in 2 years time . <p> Cam <p> Hey -- thanks for the info . I was n't sure if the new V90 would come with a high-riding AWD version ( to be honest , I did n't even know there was going to be a V90 ) .

@@2907234 <p> It was April 1993 , just a few weeks after his 31st birthday , when Ilyumzhinov became leader of Kalmykia , a small autonomous republic found deep in Russia 's south-west . <p> Far from the prying eyes of the capital , Ilyumzhinov brought a pro-capitalist mentality to the Buddhist-majority region after a short but successful private sector career made him a millionaire . <p> While he may have failed to deliver on the promise of prosperity , he made use of his political currency to achieve something close to his heart - perhaps even closer than his homeland . Something money ca n't buy . Allegedly . <p> When Ilyumzhinov became FIDE president in 1995 his promise was clear : to unify a fractured community under one body . <p> This proved to be difficult after awarding the 1996 world championships to Baghdad . Graciously , he accepted the outcry of this decision and withdrew the offer to disappointed friend Saddam Hussein . In a remarkable coincidence , he instead chose Elista , the capital of Kalmykia . <p> I went over and saw something like a transparent half-tube . I went into this tube and saw people in yellow spacesuits . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was his organisational prowess which reverberated far enough in the galaxy to be of interest to extraterrestrials . The following scene takes place in 1997 , as described by Ilyumzhinov in a 2010 interview translated from Russian . <p> " I had already fallen asleep when I sensed that the balcony had opened and someone was calling me . I went over and saw something like a transparent half-tube . I went into this tube and saw people in yellow spacesuits , " he said . <p> Once understanding the game of chess as a " gift " from otherworldly civilisations , Ilyumzhinov would go on to spend tens of millions on a so-called chess city by the capital , forge connections with leaders such as Moamar Gaddafi , and be linked - though never directly - to the murder of critical Kalmyk journalist Larisa Yudina . <p> One undeniable feat has been his ability to hold the FIDE presidency in near-perpetuity , prevailing in a high-profile election in August over the iconic Garry Kasparov , perhaps the greatest player in history . <p> The man who famously lost to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ critic of both Ilyumzhinov and Vladimir Putin . Some say his leanings left him no realistic chance of winning . That , and the one-country , one-vote system leaves smaller nations open to persuasion . <p> The Australian delegation , in case you were wondering , voted for Kasparov after being inundated with gifts from both parties . Our support was inconsequential as Ilyumzhinov won 110-61 . <p> In 2010 , Ilyumzhinov 's time as leader of Kalmykia came to an end , but in the chess world he is still unpredictable , still powerful , and , most of all , still president . <h> The prince : Golden boy who is chess world 's heart-throb <p> Magnus Carlsen is your average 23-year-old Norwegian part-time model . <p> He enjoys playing tennis , has a penchant for Donald Duck comics , and this year will defend his world chess championship crown for the first time . <p> Carlsen is quite simply the golden child of the chess world .

He is certainly in the realm of Federer , Messi and Jordan in terms of reimagining what it means to master a domain . <p> In an age where the amount of raw information a grandmaster must have at their ready continues to snowball , Carlsen is almost impossibly simple . <p> He does not mind what kind of position he plays , he simply aims to find the best move each time - and often does . <p> In 2013 he was one of Time 's 100 most influential people and among Cosmopolitan 's sexiest men .

Of course he won . It was his destiny . <h> The fallen king : Five-time champion looks to reclaim his throne <p> Carlsen will face a great challenge to remain the dominant player , as the rise of 22-year-old Italian Fabiano Caruana is sure to catch up to him at some point . <p> For now , however , Carlsen will have to prove his worth against the five-time world champion he defeated last year . <p> Viswanathan Anand , affectionately known as Vishy , has been named Indian sportsperson of the year by various publications with the same frequency as Sachin Tendulkar . <p> He is a complete professional when it comes to chess . Technically outstanding at every aspect of the game , Anand has made a career of having no obvious weaknesses and being extraordinarily difficult to beat . <p> That was , of course , until Carlsen disposed of him convincingly in Chennai last year . <p> His wife and manager Aruna is often seen by his side during press @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immeasurable suffering her husband went through after losing grip on the title . <p> At the age of 44 , he will struggle to match Carlsen 's energy and resilience . <p> However , Anand will put everything he has to reclaim the crown that for so long defined him with the unfamiliar freedom of the underdog . <h> The prize : Single lapse could cost place in history <p> The title will be decided over a best-of-12 series . Six games with white , six with black . They will split the $1.45 million prize pool almost evenly , no matter the result . <p> The lead up to this year 's event proved less romantic than last . <p> Sponsorship , match conditions and even a host city were not finalised by FIDE until relatively late , and the choice of Sochi 's Olympic village seemed to please Ilyumzhinov and Russia more than Carlsen . <p> Facing the possibility of his world title being stripped , the champion agreed to a severe pay cut to ensure the match would continue as scheduled . <p> True preparation will have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the right to challenge the new champion . <p> Not only must the two be equipped for what they already know about one another , but they and their teams of assistants , known as seconds , must also anticipate what new , unpublished ideas could prove important - and come up with surprising novelties themselves . <p> The level of mental exertion and stress they will exert and endure is immense . A single lapse in concentration will be punished - realising you are doomed to defend a hopeless position for hours is psychological torture . <p> The two will likely lose weight over the three-week match . As strange as it may sound , physical fitness and nutrition is a key element to high-level chess . <p> This is shaping up to be a battle for the ages , and all under the watchful eye of the all-seeing president , perhaps with a little help from above .

Calling someone a " conspiracy theorist " is not a neutral naming act given the term 's association with paranoia , crazy thinking and tin-foil hat fashions . <p> Ellerton 's ready use of " conspiracy theorist " as a pejorative -- alongside his positioning of science in opposition to conspiracy theorising -- also implies that conspiracy theories only circulate in a particularly non-rational , unscientific and deluded sector of the community . <h> The non-partisan nature of conspiracy theories <p> While common wisdom has it that conspiracy theory is generated almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not a cognitive or explanatory style peculiar to any political allegiance : conspiracy narratives draw numerous advocates on all sides of politics , and among both progressive and conservative social groups . <p> The ' birther ' campaign was a conspiracy theory that Mr Obama , whose father was from Kenya , was not born in the US and is not eligible to be president.EPA/Aude Guerrucci / POOL <p> These observations are not meant to suggest party-political affiliations are completely irrelevant when considering conspiracy theories .

Microsoft has used similar tactics in the past , such as including licenses to less-popular server products in a bundle with licenses to products that had higher demand .

" These are the most important companies for growth of the cloud . Amazon and Google dominate share in these new high growth companies . " <p> The other danger to the plan is profit margins .

It will make money aplenty from that . <p> " Under Nadella 's mandate , commercial product development teams are focused on driving innovation into the cloud versions of its properties first ( on-premises software second ) .

" <p> Challenged on what those changes would mean for the program Ebeid revealed that he felt the award winning show was in a " difficult slot " at 9.30pm on a Tuesday and needed to be in a " lighter " format . <p> " The format is still being decided . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what we are going to do with Dateline but we have n't resolved them yet , " said Ebeid . <p> " I do think that Dateline brought some really important stories from around the world for us and there is a lot going on in the world .

It 's is a difficult slot . " <p> Ebeid 's comments come in response to a critique by Hogan which claimed that management was seeking to keep the news of the changes to one of SBS 's flagship programs from the public . <p> " Next Tuesday the last Dateline for 2014 will mark a watershed moment for the program that has run for 30 years , earning the praise of its peers and the respect of its loyal viewers , " he wrote . <p> " Not that SBS is about to make that decision public . So far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pressed management will argue that in some form or another the program will still be on air next year . But planned budget cuts mean it can only be a shadow of its former self .

It 's the result of a collaboration between architects and design students <p> Melbourne Museum : An entry in Wearing the City inspired by Melbourne Museum <p> I went to Melbourne 's MPavilion on the weekend for Wearing the City . Students from Monash University 's faculty of Art , Design and Architecture ( MADA ) worked with " leading Melbourne architecture practices to translate iconic city buildings into wearable forms " . <p> This was an interesting exercise because architecture and fashion have plenty in common . They reflect the same culture ; they elevate aesthetics and appearance ; and of course they both have a functional purpose ( or if you prefer , a functional constraint ) . <p> They share the intellectual ideas that drive form , as well as many common elements like space/volume , colour , planes , texture , structure , and so on . Developments in technology mean that building designers can now feasibly explore ideas like draping , pleating , folding and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in scale . Moreover , unlike clothing , buildings are bespoke rather than one of a number ; they 're long-lived rather than ephemeral ; they 're inhabited by many bodies not just one ; and the owner often is n't the user ( and in this exhibition many owners are public agencies ) . <p> You can pretty much wear what you like in public , but buildings are part of the public realm and require approval . In some jurisdictions third parties can object to proposed developments . <p> Architects nevertheless have some advantages over fashion designers . They do n't have to worry anywhere near as much about weight , about bulk or , critically , about movement . <p> If their design generates too much or too little heat for human comfort they can turn to air conditioning to keep things comfortable . So far , incorporating that level of power in clothing has n't proven practical . ( 1 ) <p> The event itself was a pretty informal affair . The public were n't shown the brief or the logic used by the judges in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shortage of enthusiasm or delight . <p> I do n't know what the designers were asked to do , but if the task was simply to creatively embody ( pun ! ) the visual essence of the building in a form that a model could stand up in for a couple of hours without collapsing or offending prevailing standards of modesty , then I thought all the entries succeeded admirably . <p> The architects can take some credit here too because , despite occasional complaints about the homogenisation of architecture , all these buildings have distinctive visual personalities . No doubt they were selected for that reason but it helped me to easily match each design to the corresponding building . <p> The concepts produced by the students were mostly costumes in the literal sense ; they might work for a fancy dress occasion like the famous ball in 1931 in New York when architects came dressed as their own designs , but not for going to many other places . <p> The theme " wearing the city " was of limited relevance to most costumes ; they could as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body .

They both have to accommodate movement and they both rely on human power ; so attributes like lightness , nimbleness , robustness , reliability , ease of use , and design ingenuity really matter .

In others they are so deep and wide that they will comfortably swallow the hand of a man , all the way down to the wrist . <p> The big dry makes it relatively easy to walk across the bottom of the dry dams on Mal Burge 's farm but it is impossible not to step on the cracks . The floor of the dams have cracked so much that they resemble giant jigsaw puzzles . <p> There are 25 dams on Mr Burge 's farm at Woosang , near Charlton in north-west Victoria.Though summer has n't started , 24 are bone dry . The 25th , near the farmhouse , contains just half a metre or so of water . <p> Advertisement <p> The big dry means that Mr Burge is carting more than 50,000 litres of water around his farm each week to keep his flock of 1600 sheep alive . Every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his old Bedford and , with two large tanks on the tray behind , he rumbles slowly along the local dirt roads and farm tracks distributing water pumped from the Wimmera-Mallee Pipeline into strategically located tanks in the paddocks . The tanks then automatically re-fill large plastic troughs for the sheep to drink from . <p> With eight mobs of sheep spread around his 1100-hectare farm there is a lot of driving and pumping - plus , of course , rising fuel and water bills . <p> Mr Burge is one of a growing number of farmers in the districts around Wedderburn and Woosang carting water . He has been doing it for more than two months . " This year we 've only had about seven inches of rain . In 2013 , it was around nine inches and the same for 2012 . We normally have 15 to 16 inches in this area , " he says . <p> The 57 year old has farmed on the wide plains beside the Calder Highway for nearly 40 years and has never seen the farm so dry . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the moment . The fact that we 've had no run-off for over three years - and we really rely on our run-off for our dams , " he says . " I 'm expecting that last dam to probably go dry early next year some time . I 've never seen that in my lifetime . " <p> While the drought conditions across northern New South Wales and most of Queensland have hit the national conscience , the dry hitting Victoria 's north-west is receiving little attention in Melbourne and southern Victoria , where it remains relatively cool and green . <p> In parts of north-west Victoria some farmers will make a loss from their grain crops this season . Some crops were so poor farmers long ago gave up hopes of harvesting them , instead opening the gates to let livestock in to feed on them . Livestock producers have also been selling stock earlier than they otherwise would have . <p> The Victorian Farmers Federation has brought the big dry into the election campaign , calling for drought assistance as farmers are confronted by a " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the state and federal governments to sign off on a drought concessional loans package as soon as possible - and he wants the state to allocate funds to farmers to help offset the costs of carting water . <p> " After 10 or 15 years of extremely dry weather , with only a couple of good years among them , this drought period has added to their pain and the financial woes of quite a number of producers in that area . So they will need financial help to be able to plant next year 's crop and to manage their businesses , " he says . <p> The farmers federation welcomed one of the few intrusions of rural water issues into the campaign this year , when opposition leader Dan Andrews said a Labor government would not change the rules governing the operation of the controversial north-south pipeline . <p> Built by the former Brumby Labor government for about $700 million at a time when the state had endured years of drought , the 70 kilometre pipeline can pump water from the Goulburn River on the north side of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Melbourne 's water storage network . <p> The project caused outrage in country communities , particularly in northern Victoria , and led to a protest vote against Labor in some electorates in 2010 .

Wary of a fresh backlash over the issue , Labor will keep the rules in place . <p> At a local level , some steps are being taken . Recognising the severe dry conditions many farmers face , the Loddon Shire Council will fund the installation of four hydrants for farmers to access water for stock . Local mayor Gavan Holt says : " It 's as dry as I 've ever seen it . <p> Back on Malcolm Burge 's farm the conditions could not be any more different from what they were in January 2011 , when floodwater covered most of the property .

This means that when a copyright scofflaw like , well , me , tries to get access to The Pirate Bay nothing happens . The domain name does n't resolve correctly , and so it 's like the site does n't exist . <p> There are some good policy reasons to be troubled about this type of action -- essentially it breaks the guarantee of internet connectivity -- but even if the government ignores that principle , the bigger problem is that it just does n't work . <p> The Pirate Bay will just change its domain name , forcing a constant game of Whack-A-Mole for the content companies and the courts . In any event , I can still get access to The Pirate Bay by getting a virtual private network ( VPN ) or change my domain name system ( DNS ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , every 15-year old will know how to do this if the government introduces domain name blocking . ) <h> Blocking is a technical nightmare <p> Blocking websites at the internet address level is trickier . This involves stopping all traffic from a given IP ( internet protocol ) number or a given block . <p> The problem with this type of action is that it inevitably catches and stops some innocent content . For networking reasons numerous websites can share the same IP number or address block , and so shutting down one IP address can wipe out other sites that are completely fine . <p> Back in 2013 , the Australian Securities and Investment Commission ( ASIC ) applied a little-used section of the Telecommunications Act to block three websites that were hosting investment scams . ASIC ended up with egg on its face when the block also wiped out Australian access to around 250,000 innocent websites that happened to be hosted on the same address . <p> The other really serious technical problem is that you actually ca n't block many of the places where infringing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BitTorrent ( a peer-to-peer file transfer protocol ) , a huge swarm of computers from all over the internet is responsible for sending me bits and pieces of the movie file . <p> Although a court could order ISPs to block sites like The Pirate Bay that aggregate the initial seed for the torrent files , there is no way to block all the computers that eventually provide me with the movie . <p> So all in all , blocking is a technical nightmare . However , these problems pale compared with the policy problem of how you write a law that catches only the " bad guys " . <p> The law ca n't just block sites that host infringing content , because sites such as The Pirate Bay actually do n't host infringing content . But if you draft the law to catch sites like this which help me find movie torrents , then you 're going to shut down Google . <p> Beyond Google -- who will never let a law like this get through -- a poorly drafted law will inevitably be used to threaten Australia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where a large number of infringing files are found these days . <p> So , once again , we 'll have laws that favour US content industries at the expense of Australia 's digital future . <p> At best , blocking laws might be slightly effective to reduce the access to overseas movie streaming sites . Maybe . This should make Foxtel and Australian market newcomer Netflix happy because a small number of people will buy a subscription because they can no longer get programs like Game of Thrones free on the internet . <p> But after a while you have to ask whether it 's worth spending the amount of time , money , and effort that the government keeps expending to keep the copyright lobby happy .

@@4783240 <p> Since the inception of the AFL National Draft in 1986 , there has rarely been a period of time that the draft process has remained unchanged . <p> New rules , concessions and sanctions have all contributed to compromising the AFL competition 's premier recruiting activity -- making it more difficult for clubs to develop consistent and long term strategies in the composition of their player lists . <p> The most significant change in the talent pathway around the AFL National Draft occurred in 1991 with the abolition of metropolitan zoning and the establishment of the TAC Cup competition in Victoria . <p> Until this time , VFL/AFL clubs had developed young players in designated metropolitan areas -- retaining priority access to talent within their region . But the expansion of the national competition into South Australia resulted in these boundaries being removed -- with teams being able to draft players from anywhere across the country for the first time . <p> The subsequent introduction or relocation of clubs such as Fremantle in 1995 , Brisbane Lions &amp; Port Adelaide in 1997 , Gold Coast in 2011 and Greater Western Sydney in 2012 all involved major recruiting concessions that have further impacted on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's 28-year history . <p> Combine this with state-based academy programs , scholarship models , the father/son bidding system , free agency and various requirements of the CBA , and the draft has become a ' logistical minefield ' that operates against a backdrop of increasing professionalism in the game . <p> But despite these ongoing changes and complications , the draft has still only gone part way to achieving the ideal model that the late Alan Schwab proposed when establishing the original system almost 30 years ago . <p> Sadly , his untimely death in 1993 resulted in an interruption to the natural evolution of the AFL National Draft -- a system that he was committed to ensuring would become the leading draft model in the world of professional sport . <p> Having been involved with the VFL draft sub-committee in 1985 that researched the introduction of the draft to Australian football , I recall preparing a document for the AFL in 1995 titled " It 's Time ! " which addressed a number of the initiatives that Schwab had planned for the draft and trade periods over following @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the then AFL general manager of football operations during a meeting at the MCG late in 1995 where we discussed many of the issues confronting the draft system as the AFL made the transition towards a full-time professional competition . <p> While some of the initiatives raised in the document have since been introduced -- such as the on-trading of previously acquired draft selections and the opportunity to trade draft picks for draft picks only -- either a reluctance towards change or a lack of intimate knowledge of the original draft model has meant that various initiatives remain missing links in the picture proposed by the VFL draft sub-committee . <p> It 's worth noting that the AFL has the most constrained player list parameters in professional sport with changes only being allowed via the trade period , free agency or draft over a seven-to-eight-week period at the end of each season . <p> Compare this to other sports where transfer windows exist at various intervals throughout the year or active and inactive player rosters operate in conjunction with a mid-season ' supplemental draft ' , and the importance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obvious . <p> The AFL and AFLPA have tried to increase player movement via the introduction of Free Agency but further change is required to increase the flexibility for both clubs and players to better manage their player lists and individual careers . <p> In the first compromised AFL Draft in 2010 , Gold Coast had six of the first 10 picks . Picture : AFL Media <p> Some of the initiatives proposed for the AFL draft system during the past 20+ years that are still to be introduced or maintained include : <p> 1 . Trading of future draft picks <p> The capacity for clubs to trade selections from drafts in future years . This particularly increases the ability for clubs to trade talented players where multiple draft picks are required to complete a deal -- especially if they involve extra first round selections . Currently , other clubs are needed in such trades , which only complicates and compromises the likelihood of these deals being completed . When raised with the AFL in 1995 , there was some intrepidation expressed around the possibility of a club " trading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be initially limited to draft selections in the following year ( with a view to maybe extending it to two years when clubs became more familiar with the process ) . This initiative would also increase the opportunity for clubs to expedite the re-development of their player lists by providing greater inventory for trade activities . <p> 2 . Post-draft trade period <p> While the NFL allows clubs to on-trade players as the draft is being conducted , the AFL 's reluctance for such activities has stalled one of the key planks in the original draft model . The draft was established on the preface that clubs should always be able to recruit their preferred players -- even if only to strategically position themselves to attract an opposition player or draft selections from another club at a later date . For example , if a club was unable to convince a team to complete a particular deal during the trade period , by subsequently drafting a player that they knew would attract greater interest from the opposition club , they could then use that player as an incentive to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provide teams with clearer transparency as to which player a specific pick would equate to in the draft rather than speculate whether a player may or may not still be available a certain selection ( as is currently the case ) . The post-draft trade period could run in between the national and pre-season drafts and involve all listed or recently drafted players -- based on a club 's perceived satisfaction with their results in that year 's draft and trade periods . The introduction of ' future trading ' would further complement this initiative as it would provide increased collateral to complete trades post the preceding national draft . <p> 3 . Mid-season draft <p> The constraints limiting changes to player lists after December is a genuine concern to both the clubs and players alike -- especially when considering that the season runs from March-September in each year and provides minimal opportunity to address collective injury concerns or a lack of team performance . A club 's season can effectively be " over " ( in a competitive sense ) during the first half of the year , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and/or ' top-up ' players onto a list would provide benefit to all parties . Should such additions be made via a non-compulsory draft , clubs could follow the existing process of reverse ladder position or utilise the NFL 's model of having teams nominate ( ' use ' ) the draft selection by round number that they would be willing to use on a player in the proceeding national draft -- similar to the current father/son bidding system . Either of these methods would essentially tie the player to that club beyond the current season while the alternative option of adding ' top-up ' players mid-season could give draft prospects the chance to impress AFL clubs without binding them to any particular team ( with the player still being eligible for the draft later in the same year ) . <p> 4 . Transfer from the primary list to rookie list <p> While clubs can currently elevate a player from the rookie list to their primary list at the end of a season , they can not do the reverse -- even with the player 's consent . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greater flexibility to teams as it allows the easier transfer of players while putting the onus back onto clubs by only protecting active list players from opposition recruitment . AFL clubs should be permitted to move primary list players to the rookie list at the end of each year providing the nominated players voluntarily agree to the transfer .

@@4786233 <h> Ferguson has reinforced racial fear and lethal stereotypes <h> Author <p> Lecturer in Organisation Studies , Department of People and Organisation , The Open University <h> Disclosure statement <p> Peter Bloom does not work for , consult , own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article , and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond the academic appointment above . <p> After months of deliberation , a grand jury ruled that there was " insufficient evidence " to convict Wilson of acting illegally . At the heart of the controversy is whether this incident was motivated by racism or the officer 's " reasonable fear " for his life . American law enforcement officials are permitted to use deadly force when their safety is perceived to be in mortal danger . Opponents charge , however , that this shooting had little to do with fear and everything to do with the unjust racial profiling by police . <p> These are not mutually exclusive . The public stereotyping of black American males still justifies the use of lethal force against them by authorities at increasingly alarming levels . And as long as racial fear can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brown will continue . <h> Scare stories <p> Racial fearmongering has long been used to legitimise violence against African-Americans . Before the civil war , black slaves were commonly depicted as savages who needed to be tamed by the white race . In the late 19th and early 20th centuries in particular , an image of blacks as sex-crazed threats to white moral decency was used to justify their lynching and the rise of white supremacist terrorist groups like the Ku Klux Klan . <p> In today 's America , racial fear is most obviously manifest in the widely held stereotype of African-American males as dangerous criminals . The image of the " violent thug " terrorising the inner city and increasingly the suburbs remains a strong . <p> It is this fearful representation that has helped to legitimise the government 's war on drugs that has disproportionately targeted black communities and led to the incarceration of African-Americans at a staggeringly disproportionate rate . <p> It is not surprising , then , that police officers would " instinctually " have a heightened fear for their safety when confronted by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coming into play . Instead it is the result of years of social conditioning to see blacks as " dangerous " . In the words of one expert : " The fact of the matter is that whiteness presumes innocence and blackness presumes guilt , and you have to prove yourself otherwise . " <h> Lethal force <p> This purportedly " reasonable " fear of African-Americans makes them especially vulnerable to aggressive and often lethal policing tactics . These tactics are needed , police argue , to effectively deal with " thugs " whose lifestyle is supposedly defined by the use and celebration of violence . Otherwise innocuous fashion choices -- hoodies and low-slung jeans -- become coded as warnings that people should fear for their safety . <p> Not surprisingly , the parents of Trayvon Martin have supported the Ferguson movement , saying publicly that the officer " should be held accountable " and even visiting the Brown family and protestors in Missouri . <h> Smear campaign <p> In the case of Ferguson , much has been made of the fact that the vast majority of the town 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its citizens are black . It 's also been reported that more than 90% of all arrests in Ferguson are of black people -- despite evidence that they are less likely to be carrying contraband , for instance , than white citizens . <p> Tellingly , in the immediate aftermath of the shooting , the Ferguson police made an ill-planned attempt to depict Brown , who had just graduated from high school and was headed to college , as a " typically " dangerous black youth . They released a video showing him appearing to steal an item from a local shop where he briefly fought with the store owner . <p> The police were widely criticised for taking the time-honoured approach of demonising their black male victim as " dangerous " to imply he somehow " deserved " his violent end . And yet , the strategy has not only persisted ; it 's been extended to the protesters now taking to the streets of Ferguson . <p> According to an Amnesty report , police met protesters " using armored vehicles which are more commonly seen in a conflict @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the United States " . <p> This echoed video footage of police taunting the crowd . One CNN video showed an officer saying to the protesters : " Bring it you fucking animals ! Bring it ! " <p> Some sections of mainstream US media , however , have largely blamed the protesters for the violence , depicting them as an angry black mob creating " chaos " who the authorities were acting appropriately in aggressively putting them down . <p> Equally , the Ferguson protesters made much of another example of the racial double-standard : a violent riot among mostly white individuals intoxicated after a " pumpkin fest " in New Hampshire , which was widely depicted as merely being " rowdy " and chaotic despite the fact that police used tear gas to shut it down . <p> Now , instead of talking to the media , the Ferguson protesters are increasingly relying on social media outlets to get their message out and present themselves as constructively fighting for justice . As one woman who went to the protests to observe what it was like for herself first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) totally took advantage of stereotypes about race and making any black person that shared emotion seem violent . They painted all these protests to be violent mobs of people terrorising , and that 's absolutely not the experience I had . <p> In response to the police 's racial stereotyping , a national twitter campaign has begun , with the hashtag #IfTheyGunnedMeDown . <p> Black men in particular have used the feed as a forum to post everyday pictures of themselves next to ones that could be misused to portray them as " thugs " ( for instance holding a fake gun at a costume party ) . <p> After the jury 's decision on November 24 , the first concern of the authorities was to make sure the protesters did n't engage in widespread violence . This masks the broader message being promoted by those in the movement , one they expressed in an open letter in the aftermath of the ruling : <p> This fight for the dignity of our people , for the importance of our lives , for the protection of our children is one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end with this announcement . The " system " you have told us to rely on has kept us on the margins of society ... housed us in her worst homes , educated our children in her worst schools , locked up our men at disproportionate rates and shamed our women for receiving the support they need to be our mothers <p> To end this cycle of violence and preserve the dignity of black lives , we have to end the stereotype of the " dangerous " and " violent " black threat . Until then , as Ferguson has so tragically shown , American racism will continue to make the fear and killing of blacks seem " reasonable " .

@@4792231 <p> It seemed like a poisoned chalice when Lord Smith of Kelvin was handed the task of chairing a cross-party commission to advise on devolving further powers to Scotland after September 's referendum .

As well as aiming to reach a consensus with the five main political parties in Scotland , he also initiated a consultation with the wider population that must have left everyone involved exhausted .

There was always a danger that the Smith Commission 's report would , by attempting to please all of the people , end up pleasing none of them . <p> The fact that Lord Smith managed to get a consensus from ten politicians from five different parties with very different devolution agendas to publish a report ahead of deadline was no mean feat in itself . Lord Smith also claimed at the launch on November 27 that his report reflected the issues put to him by the wider electorate . <p> The main Smith proposals <p> These proposals do not equate to devo max , but they do go way further than the three main UK partiesproposed earlier in the year . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Scottish parliament more autonomous and accountable than ever before .

There would be clear incentives to raise tax revenues by growing the economy , to create a fairer welfare and benefits system , and significant policy levers to achieve change . <p> At the same time , these powers will not give the Scottish parliament the power to defend itself against Westminster austerity measures , and certainly not the full control over macroeconomic policy it would need to tackle poverty , inequality and other significant social policy challenges . <p> But the ball is in Westminster 's court .

@@4792233 <h> The curious anti-Americanism of South Korean movies <p> One of the nice things about blogging is that it opens up topics we international-relations specialists would otherwise never explore . One area is representations of world politics in film , games and other media . ( Duck of Minerva , where I used to write , is good on this . ) <p> This is a tricky area to write on , academically . How many of us would want to accredit a dissertation about hyper-patriotic US military tropes in the Call of Duty game series or the Transformers film series ? These are actually interesting questions , but the international relations field does not reward it professionally . Still , we notice this stuff all the time . <p> American geopolitical entertainment is notorious for its rah-rah patriotism , ' patriotic ' violence , and often brutality . John Wayne made Green Berets to shore up popular support for the Vietnam War . Rambo and Red Dawn capture popular American Cold War thinking so well that I have seen them listed in international relations syllabi . <p> Since 9/11 , it is even more obvious . The TV show 24 was so influential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Call of Duty channeled the Bush-era hysteria of high-tech terrorists lurking everywhere , which therefore required a massive military response like the Iraq War . The franchise even got right-wing hero ( and convicted felon ) Oliver North to plumb for the games as possible ' real-life ' ( ! ) scenarios . 2012 's Battleship was basically a metaphor for the US and Japan working together to repel Chinese domination of the Pacific . <p> So here is a little social science fun on the Korean movie industry . I live in Korea , so inevitably I watch the films ; the geopolitical ones are the most interesting for international relations types . And if there is one trope I notice again and again ( perhaps because I am an American ) , it is the preposterous American villain scenarios the Korean film industry just adores .

To the south , Korean officials arguing against the raid are over-ruled by the arrogant American air staff . But thankfully those Northern and Southern soldiers , who have since found their shared Korean-ness , work together to resist the air raid and save the idyllic village from American aggression . <p> A terrorist threatens to nuke Korea , but the Americans are more concerned that their secret plot to contain China and Russia will be leaked . Korea , and basing nuclear missiles there , is central to this scheme , so Washington invokes ' OPCON ' to prevent Korean defensive action . Thankfully patriotic Korean SEALs launch a suicide mission without American permission and save Korea .

The most famous sequence is at the very beginning when a US military doctor forces his reluctant Korean assistant to dump formaldehyde in the Han river ( the main river bisecting Seoul ) . The agent produces a river monster that terrorizes the city . The evil US authority figure is standard-issue Korean anti-Americanism . But the best part is actually when the creature attacks .

Instead , the most egregious interpretation of the event was adopted . The Americans massacre hundreds , and the US soldiers ( portrayed wholly unconvincingly by non-Americans with vaguely Russian accents ) are mindlessly gleeful and bloodthirsty . For a sustained response to the AP articles , go here . <p> A coup in North Korea brings to power a mad general determined to reunite Korea and punish America .

Thankfully , the Korean version of Tom Cruise saves the day from American nuclear war-mongers . <p> Just in time to stoke your Ebola paranoia , this film will teach you that the American response to pandemics is to massacre the hapless ill with a massive airstrike in the middle of a major city . Seoul is wracked by your standard-issue Hollywood plague , and the ill are congregating in the streets . To stop it from spreading , top American officials in Korea -- once again in bad suits and with accents that sound an awful lot like the director just grabbed some Russians from a bar in Seoul -- plan an airstrike on the infected people massed in public .

The guy is a genius footballer but a grub of a man . I am proud that my club ( eventually ! ) stood up against his violence , his racism and his cheating . If we have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the right thing then so be it . Let 's get our priorities right . cb <p> Liverpool had a release clause on Suarez 's head of 75m . Barca took it to 75 m , and it was out of LFC 's hands . <p> While I 'll agree with you that we 've made some transfer blunders ; namely exits , I 'm not keen to judge our ins yet ( though Balotelli makes it very difficult ) I would n't say Lallana , Origi , Markovic , Moreno have " nothing about them " . Markovic was rated a year ago as one of the best young prospects in the world -- he 's in a trough now ( and lack of games is a worry ) but talent like that does n't go away overnight . I think Lallana proved last season he was good enough to excel in a top side and I still think he can , Origi is banging ' em in for Lille and he has the potential to be a world class striker , and if Moreno can learn to balance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LFC 's best attacking full back in ... er .... <p> Why I think we 're sucking is because : 1 . I feel like even though it 's november we still have n't had our best team on the park -- through both injuries AND shite team selection . Ironically the 1-0 game where BR got slaughtered in the press for " throwing it away " was closer to the side I 'd like to see playing . Gerrard , though he does take a couple of months to get going , should be on borrowed time at the moment . Rodgers is seemingly playing him in a role which does not suit him -- and compounding the matter is we have players better placed to play in it . <p> 2 . We 're low on confidence . Defeats are breeding defeats at the moment , and with wholesale changes we 've lost something of our team identity ; a problem compounded by results . I.e. New players are struggling to understand and buy into our system because it just is n't working . Famliarity in defence is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't have the faith in each other that you get from winning and clean sheets . <p> 3 . Tactical mistakes . We 've lost speed and incision to our play . We spend far too much time passing the ball between our centrebacks instead of getting the ball up the pitch into the midfield . We have n't won in 5 games , 3 of which we have scored first in . What this says to me is that we still have enough in attack to put in goals . It also says to me that we 're shaky at the back , and we 're taking the pedal off . With a team so bad in defence , why , WHY do we so frequently sit back and allow our opponents to pin us back ? Once we hit the front we should be looking for more so people CA N'T score one and be back on level terms , we need the insurance if nothing else . <p> 4 . It 's apparent we ca n't play Lallana , Markovic , Coutinho , Sterling , and Ibe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 21 . Why did we think we 'd need another project winger in Markovic ? The unders ' are littered with glittering wide prospects ; Ibe , Teixeira , Suso , Canos , Wilson and more -- did we really need to go after another one ? <p> Final thought : LFC bought in big in just about every position ( bar GK ) this year . The most disappointing thing is that none of them are currently up to the grade . I 'd also like to apologise for making this comment so damn long ? ? <p> Great comment mate top notch analysis , i agree with your points and they explain what Liverpool have been missing this season , they should be top 4 certainties but they are shooting themselves in the foot , mark my words if they do n't finish top 4 Rodgers is out .

The last thing the embattled Premier needs is a repeat embrace from Abbott . <p> But Foreign Minister Julie Bishop is another matter : she 'll be campaigning on Friday with Napthine . They 'll appear in Bentleigh -- a key Liberal marginal seat on a swing of under 1% . Earlier Bishop will do a street walk in Mordialloc . The federal government is on the nose , but Bishop is seen as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own trouble but its problems have been exacerbated by Canberra . Apart from the unpopularity of the budget in May , the introduction by regulation of fuel excise indexation -- which started from November 10 -- and Abbott 's canvassing of possible changes to the GST were unhelpful . One federal issue coming through in Liberal focus groups has been the plan to deregulate university fees . State Liberal messages have also tended to get knocked out by federal stuff-ups . <p> Now we have had what can only be described as a shocker week for the feds , which included the continuing row about cuts to the ABC and SBS and the fracas over Defence Minister David Johnston 's outburst against the Australian Submarine Corporation . <p> From the Victorian government 's point of view , the most damaging federal issue this week has surely been the extraordinary contortions over the proposed Medicare $7 co-payment . <p> After prime ministerial sources on Wednesday were confirming reports the co-payment would be dropped , on Thursday Abbott and his ministers insisted the plan remained on the agenda in some form or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The GP co-payment remains our policy . " Health Minister Peter Dutton said : " The government is pragmatic about the situation in the Senate -- we will continue negotiations with the senators , but we will look at every option that is available to the government to make sure that we make Medicare sustainable . " <p> Asked whether the government was considering regulating rather than legislating , Dutton said : " I am not going to rule things in or out . I am saying that there are options that are available to the government . " <p> That invites the question : if there are other options , why has n't the government taken them already ? The Senate 's view has been clear for some time , even though the legislation has n't even been introduced . <p> Abbott reaffirmed support for a price signal . Treasurer Joe Hockey said the co-payment was n't dead or shelved and would be taken to parliament ; he would n't go into what form this might take . <p> The numbers are not there for legislation and that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regulation , that could be disallowed . The public could also feel that such a backdoor course , instead of legislation , added insult to injury . <p> The way the co-payment story was allowed to develop this week was one illustration of the government 's version of political " fat fingers " . It had plenty of time on Wednesday to kill the suggestion the co-payment was to be dumped , but did the opposite . After Thursday 's U-turn it refused to declare how it intends to act . <p> The kindest construction one can put on this is that the government does n't know . If it has a plan , it should announce what it is rather than treat the voters with contempt by playing games . <p> There was another case of political " fat fingers " , this time in the House of Representatives on Thursday , when Opposition Leader Bill Shorten asked Abbott whether Johnston would still be defence minister when parliament resumed next year . <p> Leader of the House Christopher Pyne jumped up to say this was hypothetical and could not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have the question unanswered because that left doubt over Abbott 's position on Johnston .

He was forced to use his reply to a totally unrelated opposition question to declare full confidence in Johnston . <p> Struggling all week , the government 's defensive tactic has been to step up its attack on the opposition . Abbott repeatedly refers back to Shorten 's knifing of two leaders of his own party . But as the time since the election increases , this is a dubious approach . The public want something more positive . <p> Next week will be the last for the federal parliamentary year and its atmospherics will be affected by the Victorian result . <p> While voters distinguish between federal and state governments , a Liberal defeat , expected on the strong evidence of the polls , would contain a federal element and certainly be seen that way .

A change of government in Victoria would also be an unpleasant reminder that it is possible to lose after one term - although Abbott 's circumstances , with a big buffer of seats , are quite different from those of Napthine . <p> A Victorian loss would make the federal backbench more nervous . With the prosecution of the federal budget and reform agenda spectacularly unsuccessful this year , defeat in Victoria could weaken the Abbott government 's backbone for reform as it goes into 2015 . On the other hand , it might encourage some federal reality check , which , God knows , is needed . 
@@4792240 <h> REVIEW : The Magic of Chuck Close 's Prints at MCA , Sydney <p> American artist Chuck Close 's singular artistic vision is not something that can be taught , or for that matter explained . In fact , walking through the Sydney Museum of Contemporary Art 's ( MCA ) amazing 2014 summer blockbuster , " Chuck Close : Prints , Process and Collaboration , " there is a strong sense that Close sees the world differently to everyone else , which is quite possible considering his neurological disorders . Not only is Close dyslexic , he also suffers from prosopagnosia , or " face blindness . " Without wanting to discredit his incredible talent , Close 's unique visual language is at least partly the product of his " disabilities , " which to his credit he uses to his advantage , treating them as challenges rather than obstacles . In the hands of Close the print becomes a source of awe and inspiration while the portrait takes on a whole new level of significance and profundity , with the artist 's incredible depictions of the human face engaging the viewer in an experience that can only be described as revelatory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1970s with his photorealist portraits , but he is perhaps best known for his more recent " pixelated " mosaic compositions which showcase the unique grid technique that forms the basis of his practice . " Chuck Close : Prints , Process and Collaboration " is the largest exhibition of Close 's work ever presented in the southern hemisphere , spanning his entire printmaking oeuvre . The exhibition reveals his pioneering innovations across twelve different print processes including lithography , etching , aquatint , handmade paper , direct gravure , silkscreen , reduction linocut , and traditional Japanese woodcut . <p> Close is an influential advocate of the print medium and a staunch opponent of the notion that printmaking is inferior to " original " mediums such as painting . " Chuck Close : Prints , Process and Collaboration " is proof that the medium of printmaking is not at all inferior to that of painting , or any other medium for that matter . Close 's printmaking practice is so complicated and time consuming that in many cases it could arguably be elevated above any of the other mediums @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months to complete , but when it comes to his prints , the most complex can take up to two years to realize . According to Terrie Sultan , director of the Parrish Museum of Art , New York , and the curator of the exhibition in collaboration with MCA curator Glenn Barkley , the only printmaking process that Close does n't like is lithography , because it is a process that he ca n't control . " I do n't like litho because it is all chemistry , " Close is quoted as saying in the exhibition catalogue . <p> As the title suggests , the exhibition is n't just a survey of his printmaking oeuvre , it explores in depth the complex processes and techniques that are the hallmark of his prodigious practice . And if you think that such an in depth investigation in some way dispels the magic of his work , think again . If anything , the exhibition enhances the mystery of his unique talent and the magic of his unique visual language , which even Close himself seems to struggle to explain . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ communicate to the viewer with your work ? , " Close said " my visual language , as you call it , is really about moving information from one place to another -- from the photograph to the canvas or the paper . How that 's done -- a brushstroke , a fingerprint , a dot , a blob of pulp paper -- is part of the process . " <p> One of the most interesting aspects of the exhibition is the investigation of the role of the grid in Close 's work . In an interview with the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art , Close explained that the reason he follows a grids goes back to his learning disabilities . " I am often overwhelmed by the whole , " he said . " If I break things down into small , bite-sized pieces then this big , overwhelming problem becomes much more solvable . " Speaking to BLOUIN ARTINFO , Close said that for him , the process is about using a series of integers -- small bits of information -- to create a whole . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ divide the whole into individual bits of information . I 'm only looking at each square when I translate that information from one square to another , " he explained . <p> The triumph of " Chuck Close : Prints , Process and Collaboration " is the breadth and depth of the content , but also the level of cohesion that permeates the underlying framework of the exhibition . Extending beyond the realms of the regular museum survey , the exhibition reveals the extent of Close 's experimentation and innovation , explores the intensity of his collaboration with printmakers , and celebrates the genius of his many different processes and techniques . <p> One of the best examples of the importance of process and technique in Close 's work is the silk screen " John , " 1998 . Comprising thousands of squares , each its own little abstract painting , the print is constructed using 126 handmade silkscreens for each of the 126 colors that constitute the image . Included in the exhibition is the series of state proofs that reveal the amazing complexity of the printing process that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colors at a time , Close added another ten layers of color for each proof . The fact that each proof holds its own as a work of art in its own right is testament to the genius of his practice . <p> Close 's intriguing pulp paper edition " Roy Paper/Pulp , " 2009-2010 reveals the importance of collaboration in Close 's practice . Constructed of 13 different shades of gray pulp paper which are applied using a series of complicated stencils , it takes 3 people about 6 hours to complete one impression of the edition of 30 , according to Pace Prints . This remarkable work exists in part because master printmaker Ruth Lingen of the hand printing and papermaking studio Pace Paper , with whom Close has worked on a number of prints , responded to the challenge of transforming Close 's reduction linoleum-cut portrait of the artist Roy Lichtenstein into a pulp paper print that pushed the boundaries of the technique , taking it to new heights . <p> The realist mezzotint " Keith/Mezzotint , " 1972 is one of the defining works of Close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his first as a professional artist , it is one of the most important works in the exhibition . But it is also important because it reveals the importance of collaboration in his practice . Close deliberately chose to work with a process that was rarely used by his contemporaries and on a scale that was unheard of for the Mezzotint process . The printer of the work , Crown Point Press , had to acquire a special press just to accommodate the scale of the work . " Keith/Mezzotint " also signifies the moment that Close made the decision to leave the grid visible in his work . <p> A photograph is always the starting point for Close who is widely regarded for his skills as a photographer . And although he only paints family and friends , mostly artists , he has photographed many different people including the likes of Kate Moss , Hillary Clinton , Diane von Furstenberg , and Brad Pitt , to name a few . " I have taken photographic portraits of others , such as the portfolio I did for Vanity Fair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I take a photograph of a member of my family or a friend , I look for interesting things in the composition -- like Philip Glass 's hair , for example -- that is infinitely visually interesting to me , " he added . <p> In 1988 Close suffered a spinal blood clot that left him a quadriplegic , leading many to believe that his career was finished . However , he regained enough movement in his arms to begin working again , and continues to produce new works . When asked what the future holds , Close said that he did n't know . " I never know if a new technique is going to be interesting to me until I try it , " he explained . " The new technologies involved in making the tapestries and the archival watercolor digital prints opened up a whole new world . But then , so did exploring the older technologies of the Woodburytypes . Each new print is a new adventure , and each master printer brings new ideas to the table . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @

What I cared about more was an article written on it by Seth Killian for the Penny Arcade Report . In it , Capcom 's former Community Manager completely broke down the famous scene . He expertly weaved a narrative of the dominant Justin Wong against the flailing Daigo Umehara . In the process , he never spoke over the head of his audience , instead choosing to carefully define each piece of the puzzle clearly or compare it to a large sport that the majority of readers would understand . He wrote , " Umehara tends to be a much more aggressive player , and the strain of playing against Wong 's ultra-conservative Chun-Li @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easy and enthralling to anyone who appreciates competitive sports . <p> After having my students read through Killian 's explanation , I replayed the video . One of my students , now better understanding the full extent of Daigo 's brilliance , murmured out , " That 's sick . " Surely enough , the others discussed the moment with a much higher appreciation and understanding after Killian 's explanation . <p> I asked if anyone knows why I showed them this . Most students remained silent or shook their head . Next , I asked if anyone played a sport other than football or basketball . One replied , " Track . " I told her that I did n't understand track and only perceived it as a bunch of people running in a circle where some happen to run faster than others . She thought it was an ignorant statement . I agreed , but I also asked her how she would explain its subtleties to someone who knows nothing about the sport . <p> Communication is a major problem in a generation that 's told it never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minutes on Facebook to see the motivational messages about ignoring people who do n't understand you or your life choices , how you never have to defend or explain your actions . It 's a wonderful ideal , is n't it ? Sadly , it has little basis in reality . The truth is that you could be the smartest person in the room , but if you ca n't communicate clearly , no one will care to listen . <p> What we say , how we say it , and even what we do n't say affects how others perceive us and our passions , but most people continue to funnel themselves into circles of those already initiated in their hobbies . While comradery is great , there is an undeniable importance to apologetics and to a lesser extent minor evangelism . It 's how a community grows . <p> Communication is also how we defend ourselves . To give an example , if we 're a supervisor for a cyber security department that receives a $US400,000 budget during a time when the company posts a loss for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their budget and wonder , " Why the hell are we giving almost half a million dollars to a bunch of geeks ?

You 're given ten minutes to explain what your department does and why it needs that money to function . I hope you know how to communicate effectively . <p> But why am I writing all of this to you , the fighting game player ? I 'm explaining this because growth and perception have always been a major problem for the FGC . We wonder why gaming media outlets often hone in on our scandals . Some argue that the rough and politically incorrect nature of the FGC is part of its grass roots beginnings , that we 're actually one of the most racially diverse communities in gaming . We 're even extremely generous and selfless in the pursuit of helping others .

It 's up to us to be the salespeople and defenders of our coven . This applies to any group , but especially to ours . The community likes to state that fighting games are one of the easiest to appreciate since the basic ideas are easy to grasp ( ex . A player loses when their health reaches zero , and getting hit causes damage , etc ) ; however , the flip side is that it causes the casual spectator to oversimplify what it is they 're watching . Though this is anecdotal evidence , I witnessed plenty of gamer friends comment on Street Fighter 's boring " fireball spamming .

@@4795237 <p> Relaxing the labyrinthine restrictions over the use of our abundant land could fundamentally transform the economy and enhance our standard of living . <p> A National Commission of Audit report released this year trained a spotlight upon the continuing extensive ownership of land and property , right across the country , by the federal government . <p> This includes the 3 million hectares managed by the Defence Department nationally , incorporating , in turn , the more than 24,000 square metres of empty workspace held by the department in Canberra . <p> Reducing holdings of land and property held by the public sector , to be sold off to private and other interests for more efficient uses , should ordinarily be the course of affairs for any reformist government with an objective of cost control in mind . <p> Advertisement <p> But in a submission to the Defence white paper , the ACT government called upon the Commonwealth to give it the " first right of purchase of any surplus Defence land in the ACT , as well as appropriate consultation and engagement during the planning and sale process " . <p> The ACT government warned " if Defence were to rationalise its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Finance directly onto the ACT market , this could have a long-term impact on urban planning , land sales and future development sequencing in the ACT and surrounding region " . <p> This response to the prospect of selling excess Defence properties represents more than just another political stoush between two levels of government . <p> It provides critical insight toward which of the divergent interests within the land and property market scene the territory , and indeed other state governments and local councils , leans by way of favouritism . <p> Lower levels of government in Australia have long maintained some direct land ownership , and presided over regulations such as planning restrictions , zoning requirements , and development assessments , which serve to artificially inflate the costs of land and property beyond their fundamental values . <p> This strategy is financially lucrative in that it furnishes public treasuries with an assured source of growing revenue . <p> As recent revelations from New South Wales have prominently attested , it also helps governing parties secure political donations from developers and other propertied interest groups . <p> But restricting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in dribs and drabs , and determining what kinds of properties can be established in which locations , often comes at a major cost to suppliers seeking to expand markets and to consumers searching for affordable products . <p> Arguably the most recognisable manifestation of governmental influence over land is the astronomically high house prices observed in every capital-city market in Australia . <p> A median-priced house in Canberra late last year would have set a prospective buyer back about $573,000 , representing 8.3 times average earnings in the ACT . <p> At the time of self-government a Canberra median-price house cost about $115,000 , or 3.7 times average earnings in 1989 . <p> The US-based think tank , Demographia , has assessed the ACT housing market to now be " severely unaffordable " , even despite ample supplies of vacant land surrounding Canberra " s existing town centres and over the border . <p> And three years ago the ACT Auditor-General pinned the worsening housing affordability crisis in Canberra down to " a shortage of the supply of residential land , capable of being built on , to meet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does not appear that the likes of the territory " land bank " , the Land Development Agency , have dramatically sped up releasing raw land onto the market , if scenes of tent pitching by prospective home buyers to snare available lots at inflated prices , and accusations of potential rigging of lot-purchasing ballots , are anything to go by . <p> The perverse effects of an overly prescriptive system of land use regulations spread beyond the residential housing market , with impacts upon the prevalence of competition and affordable prices in product markets . <p> International studies have shown that highly detailed planning and zoning regulations , which specify the allowable number , size , operating model and mixes of business in certain areas , stifle spatial competition between similar kinds of businesses . <p> Together with the high commercial rental rates , themselves partially induced by restrictive land supply , the lack of competition puts upward pressure on prices . <p> The manipulation of land-use regulations by the ACT government with regard to the supermarket retail industry , as part of apparent efforts by the government to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under immense criticism over the years as being costly and ineffective . <p> The ACT Treasurer Andrew Barr had undertaken , in the last year , to pursue a " less interventionist approach to supermarket competition policy issues " . <p> That is all fine and well , but there is still great scope for regulatory interference in retail , and other sectors of the local economy , through the application of planning and other land use provisions . <p> For example , the Territory Plan specifies that regulators must assess a proposed development in a local centre zone , a location set aside to provide convenience shopping for local consumers , with regard to its economic impact on other business concerns . <p> The risk with this sort of regulatory provision is that vetoing a new development can effectively shield incumbent retailers from additional competition , which would otherwise produce greater product variety and lower prices for the general public . <p> Over the decades the Commonwealth government has increasingly intervened in the affairs of state and local governments , leaving premiers , chief ministers and mayors with precious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the underlying preferences of regional and local communities . <p> Although the long arm of the feds has also reached into the likes of land-use planning and urban development , especially since the Whitlam era , lower levels of Australian government maintain considerable scope to control the availability and use of land and property . <p> But rather than ensure ample land is available to grow our businesses and residences , governments have long adopted a campaign of restriction , to fatten up land and property prices so as to bolster taxes and secure political donations as the price for making regulatory concessions . <p> Even in our digital age , land remains a critical factor in the production of goods and services , as well as providing essential lifestyle amenity for home buyers and renters . <p> Selling off excess properties held by government , at federal , state , and local levels , will be one effective way to relax land supply constraints . <p> But if we want a more

Screenshot by Stephen Shankland/CNET <p> Yandex , the Russian search , email and e-commerce site , has released a new version of its browser that tries to pare down user-interface distractions to the absolute minimum . <p> The software , available as an early alpha version for testing , is designed to focus as much as possible on Web content , with interface elements like the address bar and back button presented in subdued form . It also serves as a model for Yandex 's planned future browser for mobile devices , the company said . <p> " To be comfortable with websites that look more like desktop programs , users need a totally different browsing experience so that they would feel like they are using a desktop rather than a Web app , " Yandex said of the new version , released Thursday in alpha-testing form . " To meet this requirement , we stripped our browser of everything nonessential , integrated search even deeper , redesigned the user interface to make it more simple , more informative and more engaging , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new Yandex browser does indeed look different , but it 's just the newest step in the industry 's removal of interface elements . The move began in 2008 with Google 's Chrome , which was named for the fact that it actually did away with a lot of user interface elements called chrome that surround the Web content . Internet Explorer , Firefox , Opera and Safari followed suit . It 's rare nowadays to see menu bars across the top of a browser window , while status bars are hidden by default and toolbars are frowned upon as clutter . <p> Browsers , though free , can be financially important by driving traffic to search engines . Those searches produce revenue from search ads . The Yandex browser , marketed as " Yandex.Browser , " first launched in 2012 . Based on the open-source Chromium project at the heart of Google 's Chrome , naturally it uses Yandex as its default search engine . <p> The new browser puts tabs across the bottom , color coded according to the website 's own colors . The address bar shows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ top of the website itself . Screenshot by Stephen Shankland/CNET <p> The new version does indeed look somewhat different from most of today 's browsers . It puts video backgrounds on the new-tab page , for starts , and a customizable grid of tiles similar to Opera 's Speed Dial grants quick access to pinned or frequently used sites . A right click on the new-tab page background lets you pick those links , change the background video or image , and pause the background video . <p> Browser tabs are organized along the bottom of the page . Multiple tabs from one domain -- for example , several articles at CNET -- are grouped into a single bunch . The most recently used tab is on the top of the stack , but it 's not obvious there are others until you click on the top item , at which point the others appear side by side in the tab section . That cuts down on tab clutter , but it can be confusing . For example , Google Calendar and a Google search page compressed into the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but Gmail and Google Inbox get tabs of their own . <p> Each tab is color-coded , coordinated with the website 's own colors . A thin white bar overlays the top of the active tab to help you figure out where you are along the tab strip . This approach to color coordination helps you figure out what 's what , but like other browser makers , Yandex has n't figured out what to do with people who have dozens and dozens of tabs open . <p> The layout looks like it 'll work reasonably well on a touchscreen interface and mobile devices . That 's no coincidence , Yandex spokesman Vladimir Isaev said . <p> " We do plan to use same approach when building a new browser for tablets and for smartphones , " Isaev said . <p> Typing Ctrl-L or Cmd-L puts the cursor in a combined address-search bar , just as with other browsers . But Yandex.Browser overlays the search box atop a blurred version of the already-open page . Screenshot by Stephen Shankland/CNET @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @

But Germany is also well ahead the rest of the world when it comes to building technology , creating some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so ? Because the German government has taken a leadership role in sustainability . Germany has adopted comprehensive regulations on building energy efficiency . <p> Take the Multi , a magnet-propelled elevator concept that in addition to moving up and down can also go sideways . Why is that important ? It will revolutionise skyscraper design . Because elevators that just go up and down are not particularly efficient , because you put a lot of energy into lifting the cables that the elevator is attached to , and it 's not particularly versatile , because the cable restricts your potential directions of movement . <p> To solve both of these problems at once , you need a completely new non-cable propulsion system for your elevator . Something futuristic . The Multi uses a technology called magnetic levitation to move multiple elevator cars along the same shaft without the need for wires and cables . Wait times for elevators can thus be drastically reduced , and the ability to move the cars in almost all directions could let architects stretch their design innovation . <p> The Multi 's cabins are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But they move more people in the same amount of time as traditional elevators since cars come every 15 to 30 seconds . The Multi elevator is set to begin testing sometime in 2016 , and German innovation company Thyssen Krupp hopes to have a fully operational prototype running in its test tower in Germany by the end of 2016 . <p> German company Seele is also involved in developing intelligent building shells which come fitted with a patented , self-conditioning pressure compensation system . It 's a system that ensures passive ventilation through interaction with the external climate . It creates a glass sandwich element fa ? ade that offers excellent heat and sound insulation and protects from the sun . <p> Another innovation is PassivHaus , a German-born building performance standard that strives to achieve a very comfortable ultra-low energy building that requires little or no energy for space heating or cooling . It is catching on around the world . The world 's first Passivhaus public bathhouse and swimming pool just opened this month in L ? nen , Germany . It pairs a super-efficient building @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offsets energy use with solar electric panels . The 50 per cent energy reduction translates to a whopping projected savings of ? 193,000 ( $A283,519 ) each year . Bernward B ? cheler of Passivhaus Australia now lays claim to having built Australia 's first certified PassivHaus , a single storey partly underground residence in South Australia designed by Max Pritchard Architects . Passivhaus is super-insulated and allows no drafts . <p> There are also radical buildings like the five-storey Bio Intelligent Quotient ( B.I.Q. ) in Hamburg which is actually a vertical algae farm that generates heat , as well as revenue , from growing the micro-organism . The algae are fed liquid nutrients and carbon dioxide to spur growth . Pressurised air is pumped into the panels to further increase growth and prevent the micro-organisms from settling down and causing rot . Scrubbers in the panels automatically keep the glass clean . <p> The panels double as solar thermal collectors to convert sunlight into usable energy . The part of the light that is not absorbed by the algae for the photosynthesis is converted into heat which can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ building 's underground geothermal system . <p> Periodically , the algae is collected and stockpiled in tanks in the building . A local energy company then buys the harvest and transport the biomass to a nearby heat and power plant , where it undergoes fermentation . The process produces methane gas to generate electricity . <p> One of the best examples of innovation is the Reichstag , the home of Germany 's parliament , which produces its own energy . According to Bloomberg , the chamber is capped by a giant dome and inside the dome is a cone-shaped " light sculpture " made of 360 mirrors , extending from the apex of the cupola down into the heart of the chamber 75 feet below . <p> The cone funnels sunlight throughout the building . A bank of solar panels , seamlessly embedded in the roof , powers a swivelling metal shade that reduces glare by tracking the sun 's path and filtering its harshest rays . There 's also a co-generator in the Reichstag 's basement . <p> Powered by rapeseed oil , it produces both electricity and heat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ environment and lost forever . But excess heat from this co-generator is pumped into a natural aquifer nearly a thousand feet underground , where it is easily reclaimed to warm the building in winter . The Reichstag generates half of all the electricity it consumes , and gets the rest from renewable sources offsite , making it the greenest parliament in the world . <p> The fact that it 's the Reichstag tells the world that Germany 's politicians are champions of sustainability . <p> There is for example the Solarsiedlung or Solar Estate located in Frieburg , on the western edge of the southern Black Forest . It is one of the warmest and sunniest regions of Germany with approximately 1800 hours of sunshine per year . It features " plus " energy houses . That is , they produce more energy than they consume . <p> By using full benefit of passive solar heating , more insulation than even the typical German home , and an extended roof of solar photovoltaics , these houses create a surplus of electricity . <p> As reported here , the settlement at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kilometres from the city centre of Freiburg . On the site of the former French Vauban barracks , there are 2000 flats and community needs facilities for approximately 5000 people . It has been in existence since 1997 . <p> The building strategies there include reducing the number of cars , sustainable water management , energy-conscious construction , building waste management , promotion of joint building projects and cooperative building and the design of a cooperative planning process . <p> And the Germans are exporting their know-how . The German architecture firm Ingenhoven designed 1 Bligh Street in Sydney . It 's so innovative . As reported here , the large space is open and ribbed with each level following the perimeter the building . The curves and flow of the floors echo the organic form of an upended whale allowing the imagination to soar all 28 floors or ribs . The central balconies form the spine and look like vertebrae while the glass lifts shoot up and down like corpuscles in the vascular system . <p> The waste water treatment and recycling system can reduce water consumption with an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capability to recycle much more than just the waste water produced within the building . The building is the first high-rise tower to receive the highest six star certificate of the Australian Green Star environmental rating system . <p> There is so much we can learn from Germany about creating green buildings . When it comes to sustainability , the Germans are showing us it 's just a matter of good design . <h> Comments <h> 3 Responses to " Green MashUp : Germany building technology in the lead " <p> I am not quite so sure that the German government should be held up as an example of sustainability . After all , no single largest source of their electricity is the burning of so-called " brown coal " which is even dirtier than the coal we burn here in the US.

Influenced by all of the normal experiential stuff , I think this is as important in measuring our approach to design and architecture as formal education . After all , architecture is a very experience-focused profession . <p> I studied at the Dublin Institute of Technology in Dublin , where the architecture degree had a meaningful connection to the construction technology element of our profession . A parallel degree exists in ' architectural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reference . Exposure to this system and graduate experience working with individuals specifically qualified from each area has had a significant influence on my approach to design . A clearer focus on technology expertise here in Australia specific to the architecture profession could further enhance our ability as a profession to achieve exceptional outcomes . <p> What do you think Australians could learn from Ireland ? <p> I think it 's very much a two way street . I see many areas where I have learned a great deal from my time in Australia and the perspective that has afforded me . <p> For me personally there already exists a strong knowledge and experience sharing between Ireland and Australia . <p> The substantial increase in the arrival of young Irish professionals in Australia in recent years has also strongly contributed to a mutual sharing and understanding in all areas of the design and construction industries particularly here in WA . With increased exposure to complementary talents in these areas I would hope there is a great deal we can learn from each other . <p> You participate in UWA 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the program and why do you think mentoring is important at the university level ? <p> Since joining HASSELL in 2007 I 've been involved in mentoring programs in one way or another . Originally I worked with a young graduate group within HASSELL called the Young Designers Group promoting leadership through initiatives in placemaking and community engagement . This developed into opportunities for collaboration with universities and intimately led me to get involved in Architecture tutoring at Curtin University alongside Khoa Do , an inspiring former HASSELL colleague and general provocateur . <p> Students benefit immensely from gaining direct exposure to active practitioners and getting an insight into the common challenges faced in the industry . I believe seeing and questioning the relevance of theory and method against the day-to-day grind is a great opportunity for the students and very often proves to be a rewarding and inspiring experience for me . <p> You were involved with the Fiona Stanley Hospital Mental Health Unit in Perth . How did you approach the project differently to how mental health units have previously been designed ? <p> The desire to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our design response and prompted us to create safe , secure and usable courtyards with effective connection to the surrounding natural landscape . These spaces were draped in a single , large and gently undulating curved roof which floats over the whole facility to unify the plan form , with openings cut out in direct response to the need for courtyards , daylight and planning . <p> Evoking a sense of belonging and integration with the broader hospital was key to the success of the design outcome . Viewed from nearby ward towers , the roof element acts as a piece of topography , integrated with a linear park and responding to contour changes , presenting an important ' fifth elevation ' . <p> Viewed from within the courtyards the soffit is seen as a gently curving element that ties the plan components together , providing shading , familiar orientation and a calming environment in a mature yet safe landscape environment . <p> Is mental health design changing in Australia ? What do you think it will look like in 10 years ? <p> Yes . I believe like all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more broadly , design in general is changing in response to mental health and our understanding of it . <p> Possibly the most important changes happening with respect to mental health in Australia are outside the realm of design and more central to the issue of public awareness . Organisations like Beyond Blue and various advocacy groups have done a huge amount to raise public awareness of the sobering statistics regarding the number of men and women experiencing mental illness and have set about challenging mindsets and the stigma historically associated with mental health issues . These statistics very clearly identify that mental illness is all around us and the solution can not be confined to specialised care facilities . <p> This realisation has been further confirmed to me in recent times in other areas of design , having recently attended and participated in a number of student housing forums . I found a common theme existed where dealing with issues of student welfare and mental health needs are front and centre in the minds of accommodation providers and residential life professionals . Also , through recent experience , awareness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among aged care providers . <p> The challenges facing the design industry are multilayered in contributing to meaningful , positive change in this area . In health care , embedding the principles of evidence based design is fundamental while tracing the relevant benefits of this paradigm across sectors is something which interests me a great deal and certainly warrants further consideration . <p> As to where we 'll be in 10 years in terms of design , I would hope improved awareness will facilitate positive change for all consumers and carers alike and the existence of the real need will challenge innovation , particularly in the area of improving the normalisation of care to a point where seeking help is the norm and the mental health care facilities are simply beautifully designed environments to get well .

It is to reduce by $5 the rebate for general practice visits for most people . This excludes pensioners , concession card holders and people under 16 . The government is encouraging GPs to recoup the $5 rebate cut from patients . <p> The second change is to freeze the indexation of rebates for all medical practitioners . As the rebate drifts further away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , GPs are likely to increase their charges to cover their costs . <p> As a result , all patients ( including pensioners and health care card holders ) are likely to face increased out-of-pocket costs . The problem is likely to be worst in areas where access to care is lowest , where patients are already more likely to pay out of pocket costs . <p> The third change is to the funding rules for GP consultations . Currently there are four levels of rebates for GP consultations : <p> The vast bulk of consultations are level B , up to 20 minutes .

Again it is highly likely that GPs will pass on $20+ gap to patients . The $5 co-payment has quickly morphed into a $25 one . <h> Higher patient payments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has listened to complaints and fixed the problems that torpedoed its initial proposal . Originally , the co-payments applied to all patients , including concession-card holders , such as pensioners and people without a job . GPs would be forced to collect the $7 , which seemed unworkable . <p> But the comparison should n't be with what the budget suggested . Instead , the watered-down co-pay plan should be judged by the impact it will have on patients , on GPs , and on the budget bottom line . <p> At budget time every year , the temptation has been to increase patient co-payments a little bit to reduce spending . This obscures the fact that for many people health care fees are already too high . The fees have crept up continually under successive governments . Partly as a result , Australia relies more on direct fees to pay for health care than most similar countries . <p> There is strong evidence from around the world that co-payments stop people from getting health care . That means less spending immediately , but those gains are offset when people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ health system and the broader economy much more if people get sicker . <p> The consequences are serious . Already 5% of people report that they avoid doctor visits because of the cost , these changes will exacerbate that . <h> Longer appointments <p> Currently , shorter level B consultations can lead to GP revenue of up to $9 a minute ( see the notes under the chart for more detail on these figures ) . The government pays around $2 a minute for a level B visit that lasts 20 minutes . <p> With the new minimum length for level B visits , the potential hourly rates for the different types of consultations are much more even , essentially reducing the incentive for " 6-minute medicine " . <p> The reality is that most consultations take much longer than that -- the average is closer to 15 minutes and the median only a few minutes shorter -- so this policy initiative may be " solving " a problem which is n't there . <p> Discouraging turnstile medicine has previously been seen as a good policy .

What might have been able to be promoted as quality-enhancing will now almost certainly be access-reducing and probably quality-reducing as well if patients miss out on needed care . <p> The changes announced yesterday are much more complex than the simple $5 headline number . They save the Commonwealth government roughly the same amount as the budget proposals . This means that collectively , consumers , GPs , or both , will be out of pocket to the same extent as was proposed in the budget . <p> The distribution , though , will be different .

But the level B definition changes are to be snuck in by regulation to apply from January 1 , 2015 . Because the Senate can disallow regulations , the government delayed the changes until a few days after the Senate rose for its Christmas break . <p> The big question is whether these changes will survive the Senate when it resumes on February 9 .

In recent months unlikely claims have materialised in the Italian media and spread , from there , into worldwide reports . <p> The first wave was based on claims that Pantani was murdered by persons unknown , an allegation altogether at odds with the previously-accepted finding that he had died alone of acute cocaine poisoning in a messy hotel room on February 14 , 2004 . <p> The second claim was that his expulsion from the 1999 Giro d'Italia while leading the event was due not to a haematocrit over the permitted 50% -- or , rather , not solely -- but also because those test results had somehow been sabotaged in an attempt by the gambling mafia to avoid a massive payout on his victory . <p> In more recent weeks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into problems . First off the police officers concerned decided to fight back against the allegations by Pantani family lawyer Antonio de Rensis plus Pantani 's mother Tonina that they had made a botched job of the investigation and missed evidence that would have implicated a number of assailants . <p> Those officers declared that they would no longer tolerate claims that they had behaved in a haphazard and amateurish way , and would instead take legal action to defend their honour . <p> The second blow was the news that Professor Franco Tagliaro , the consultant asked by the court to provide a scientific response to the queries raised by de Rensis , had come to the preliminary conclusion that Pantani 's injuries were in line with the findings of the original autopsy carried out by Professor Giuseppe Fortuni . <p> This original conclusion had ruled out categorically the hypothesis of any kind of struggle ; Tagliaro agreed , dismissing any possibility of a fight due to the absence of hand injuries characteristic of active defence , and injuries to the arms characteristic of passive defence . <p> There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just released a detailed book about Pantani , speaking in detail about the rider 's final days and also dismantling , point by point , the doubts raised in recent months by de Rensis and others . <p> That publication has now been translated by Matt Rendell , who himself is regarded as a strong authority on what happened to the rider . His book The Death of Marco Pantani is very highly regarded ; his collaboration with Rossini has converted the latter 's work into English and resulted in the fascinating new book , ' Pantani : Debunking the Murder Myth . ' <p> That work is divided into two parts , each of them essential reading . The first describes Pantani 's disintegration , a descent which started the moment he was ejected from the 1999 Giro d'Italia and which reached a sorry conclusion almost five years later in that thrashed hotel room in Rimini . <p> The second deals with questions raised by those who are trying to rewrite history and repackage Pantani 's demise . Rossini goes through each point by point , providing answers that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CyclingTips has published extracts from both sections below , starting with one of those 23 questions and Rossini 's answer.Extract one : Dissection of the doubts raised <p> Q : Why were Pantani 's calls for help undervalued at the hotel reception ? <p> A : On the morning of his death , Pantani called down to reception complaining that someone was making a noise . The receptionist and the cleaner both went upstairs , but were unable to unravel the mystery . A few minutes later , Pantani called down again . He could still hear noises , he said . Then , twice , he asked the receptionist to call the Carabinieri . Why did his requests go unheeded ? <p> Pantani complained about strangers whom neither the receptionists nor the maid had seen enter , and heard voices that no one else could hear ( even after listening from the next room ) . The picture is entirely consistent with perception altered by cocaine abuse . The brief messages , unclear and incomprehensible , can only be interpreted as one more sign of the abnormality or confusion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ encountered him . One of them , in Spanish , had described him as loco -- mad . In the final call , to the question " Could I do anything for him ? " -- this is from the receptionist 's statement to the police -- " he replied , in a gentle tone of voice , that , if I wanted , I could call the Carabinieri , otherwise , it was all the same . " <p> Receptionist ( Lucia D. ) -- My first instinct was to ask why , what was happening , and when he did n't explain or , at least , when he said , no , do n't worry about it , forget it , I was more confused than anything else , I did n't know what I could do , because I did n't know , at that precise moment , if that was what he really wanted ... To tell the truth , I was confused . <p> It was , after all , Pantani . A possibly misjudged sense of reserve prevailed . The hotel owner advised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ famous guest : <p> Owner ( Sandrino D. ) -- I did n't tell her to call the Carabinieri because I was thinking of the identity of the guest . They had described Pantani as closed , distant . I thought he might have problems , and I thought we should leave him in peace . <p> " When you say Someone 's making a noise " -- observed judge Carlo Masini during the trial -- you are not asking for help . " In any case , the hotel room telephone was an outside line which Pantani had used before . There was a list of emergency numbers beside the handset . If he had been in real danger , Pantani could have called the Carabinieri himself . <p> Either way , it is hard to understand why the phantasmal killers , having gained access to the room , and preparing to forcibly drug Pantani to death , would have allowed him , between 10.30 and 10.55 a.m. , to make two calls down to reception , and then take an incoming call . <p> Extract 2 : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> Pantani flew back to Cuba from Madrid , taking his bike . His friend Michael knew about the journey and feared the worst . Sure enough , after a week , Pantani 's father called , begging him to go to Havana , all expenses paid , and bring Marco back . He was in trouble . He was surrounded by suspicious characters . He had taken some strange substance . Nevio alone could no longer protect him . In Cuba , Marco wrote in his passport : <p> -- Dreams break like waves on an outcrop of drugs . <p> When Michael found him , Marco was a mess . Dr Greco gave instructions by telephone , and they saved him by the skin of his teeth . Marco returned to Italy a changed man . He craved cocaine .

Michael took him in at his home in the village of Predappio , while he looked for somewhere else to stay . Marco asked if the Russian girl could stay over on the night of 25 December . Michael agreed . Marco paid for the girl 's company . The following evening he took her to Rimini . Michael only learned why two days later , on 27 December . With Dr Greco , he rushed to the hotel at Miramare where Pantani had rented a room . Hi behaviour had become erratic and the Russian girl had fled . The door was locked . The room was very hot . The room was in chaos . There were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was white powder everywhere . Greco brushed a finger down his blue jacket , then put it to his tongue . He felt the telltale tickle .

Spanish , Italian , moments of clarity followed by incongruous phrases . Incomprehensible . <p> He sat on a sheet daubed with phrases written in blue ink . The handwriting was illegible . There was no time to lose . Greco gathered cocaine from every corner .

He was eating it . Another physique would have collapsed . Pantani 's strong heart could cope for now , but until when ? The doctor recommended emergency measures . <p> -- It is no longer a good idea to refuse compulsory admission . Michael is all very well , but he needs support from someone who is qualified . You should think very hard about involuntary treatment and having him declared incompetent . <p> The road to recovery through Predappio was no longer viable . It was too compromised by the frequent arguments between the various parties who were trying to manage an increasingly dramatic situation . The disagreements would flare up again after the tragedy . The shadow of cocaine had fallen over the relationship between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the seams : the homeowner had had enough of finding white powder everywhere . The climate had become violent . Michael vented his frustration in the police station : " I ca n't cope with him on my own any more . " Pantani could pass entire days and nights without leaving his room . He had let himself go . He spent New Year behind a security wall of friends chosen by Michael , then broke through it and made for his new dealer in Rimini . The new situation was the subject of a meeting in Predappio on 3 January 2004 . Around the table were Ronchi , Greco , the parents . Michael was kept away . The goal was to convince Marco to go into rehab . <p> -- You can not make me . I just want you to leave me in peace . I 'm an adult and I have the right to my freedom . I can cope . Give me my prescription . Other than that , I do n't need anyone . <p> His birthday was approaching .

Ten thousand Euros . <p> -- I want to buy myself a present , he explained ... <p> -- <p> The full book has been translated to English and can be purchased here . As well as painting an absorbing and sobering account of Pantani 's fate , the publication includes three pieces of completely new information that shed new light on his death . <p> RIP Pirata . You , who passed away too soon like Fausto Coppi , will always be an unfinished story . I suggest reading Manuela Ronchi 's " Man on the Run " together with Rendell 's " Death of Marco Pantani " to better understand the whole saga .

@@4842239 <p> Jakobson 's report argues that China lacks a grand strategy in the South China Sea . However , I would argue that competition or lack of coordination among government agencies is not incompatible with the existence of an over-arching strategy . China 's maritime agencies do appear to take actions independent of each other , but they do not aim to contest or alter Beijing 's overall strategic objective . That objective is clear , which is to advance Beijing 's control of the ocean to the best of its capacity . <p> This suggests that we should be less concerned about the complex interaction among government agencies and more concerned with understanding the very nature of Beijing 's claims . <p> Beijing claims a ' historical right ' over waters within the nine-dash line . It claims all the features within the nine-dash line as Chinese sovereignty . So far there is no sign that China would compromise these claims for a peaceful resolution with other claimants , even though Chinese leaders have on different occasions acknowledged the existence of disputes and the need for a peaceful resolution . <p> Perhaps the best evidence of a grand strategy is that China 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ facto jurisdiction over the water and features within the nine-dash line .

Often , institutional defects intervene in China 's foreign policy-making , and make it difficult to predict China 's actions . As Jakobson rightly points out , not every action taken by the government agency rightly reflects the will of China 's leaders , even when it 's done in the name of protecting China 's national interests . This creates problems at a tactical level for Chinese policymakers and may have foreign policy consequences they might not want . But China 's leadership does not hide the fact that it has strategic objectives in relation to the nine-dash line , and none of the actions by China 's maritime enforcement agencies we are seeing now seem to be at odds with these . @ @ @ @ @ @ @

@@4848238 <p> Just on a year ago at the Karaka sales in south Auckland , New Zealand 's most famous breeder , Sir Patrick Hogan , made a statement in relation to the last of the Zabeel breed being sold at next year 's Premier yearling auction . <p> It went something like this : " God willing and if my health permits , I would dearly love to take the very last Zabeel to be sold through the sale ring to honour the champion stallion he has been for the past two decades . " <p> Bloodlines recalls the statement only too well and this week contacted the Cambridge Stud maestro to see if he still had visions of going ahead with his plan to take lot 102 -- the colt by Zabeel from Organdy -- through the sale ring about 2.30pm on Monday , January 26 . <p> Advertisement <p> Not only did Hogan give me an answer but gave some wonderful memories about Zabeel , the son of Cambridge Stud 's previous super-horse Sir Tristram . <p> " 1994 saw the first crop of Zabeels offered at Wrightsons Bloodstock 88th national yearling sale series -- 28 yearlings in all with 13 colts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first Zabeel yearling to be offered was lot eight , a colt from the mare Agreeableness , which fetched $NZ30,000 and who was named Naning Star . <p> " Interestingly , however , was that the third colt through the ring to be offered was lot 121 , the Zabeel-Eight Carat colt who became Octagonal . Lot 315 , the ninth filly to be offered , was the Zabeel-Passefleur yearling and she raced as Jezabeel , the 1998 Melbourne Cup winner . " <p> Hogan told Bloodlines that in those halycon days he was at the top of his game : " To be in the sale ring with the bluebloods was like being on stage performing for a Hollywood movie . I rather think I wo n't be able to re-enact that sort of a performance . But who knows , on the day I may try and give it a go .

The Hogans part-own Precedence and he finished a courageous sixth . <p> Hoofnote : The only other Zabeel scheduled for sale at the Karaka 2015 sales is lot 28 , a filly from Laurinel Princess being offered by Trelawney Stud . <p> Glowing tribute <p> Hong Kong-based trainer John Moore has paid the Australian breeding industry a glowing tribute after the success @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The Australian-born son of legendary jockey George Moore , John told Aushorse Marketing he firmly believed Able Friend 's success " has a lot to do with the start in life he got in Australia " . <p> John 's son , George Moore jnr , paid $550,000 for the colt by Shamardal from Ponte Piccolo from Stuart Ramsey 's Turangga Stud in the Hunter Valley at the 2011 Inglis Easter sales . <p> Able Friend was left in Australia under the care of John Hawkes and had two starts -- one a Wyong maiden win -- before switching to Hong Kong . <p> John Moore said after Able Friend scored his eighth win from 14starts , taking his earnings to $A4.83 million : <p> " I consistently find the Australian-bred horses are tougher .
