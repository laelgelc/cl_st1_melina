Guterres ' report , " Making Migration Work for All , " which offers his vision for constructive international cooperation , examining how to better manage migration , for the benefit of all -- the migrants themselves , their host communities and their societies of origin -- is his contribution to this process . <p> Managing migration is one of the most profound challenges for international cooperation in our time . <p> Migration powers economic growth , reduces inequalities and connects diverse societies . Yet it is also a source of political tensions and human tragedies . The majority of migrants live and work legally . But a desperate minority are putting their lives at risk to enter countries where they face suspicion and abuse . <p> Demographic pressures and the impact of climate change on vulnerable societies are likely to drive further migration in the years ahead . As a global community , we face a choice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prosperity and international solidarity , or a byword for inhumanity and social friction ? <p> This year , governments will negotiate a Global Compact on Migration through the United Nations . <p> This will be the first overarching international agreement of its kind . It will not be a formal treaty . Nor will it place any binding obligations on states . <p> Instead , it is an unprecedented opportunity for leaders to counter the pernicious myths surrounding migrants , and lay out a common vision of how to make migration work for all our nations . <p> This is an urgent task . We have seen what happens when large-scale migration takes place without effective mechanisms to manage it . The world was shocked by recent video of migrants being sold as slaves . <p> Grim as these images were , the real scandal is that thousands of migrants suffer the same fate each year , unrecorded . Many more are trapped in demeaning , precarious jobs that border on slavery anyway . <p> There are nearly six million migrants trapped in forced labor today , often in developed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prevent them recurring in future ? <p> In setting a clear political direction about the future of migration , I believe that three fundamental considerations should guide discussions of the compact . <p> The first is to recognize and reinforce the benefits of migration , so often lost in public debate . <p> Migrants make huge contributions to both their host countries and countries of origin . <p> They take jobs that local workforces can not fill , boosting economic activity . Many are innovators and entrepreneurs . Nearly half of all migrants are women , looking for better lives and work opportunities . <p> Migrants also make a major contribution to international development by sending remittances to their home countries . Remittances added up to nearly $600 billion last year , three times all development aid . <p> The fundamental challenge is to maximize the benefits of this orderly , productive form of migration while stamping out the abuses and prejudice that make life hell for a minority of migrants . <p> Secondly , states need to strengthen the rule of law underpinning how they manage and protect migrants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the migrants themselves . <p> Authorities that erect major obstacles to migration -- or place severe restrictions on migrants ' work opportunities -- inflict needless economic self-harm , as they impose barriers to having their labour needs met in an orderly , legal fashion . <p> This not only puts them in vulnerable positions , but also undermines governments ' authority . <p> The best way to end the stigma of illegality and abuse around migrants is , in fact , for governments to put in place more legal pathways for migration , removing the incentives for individuals to break the rules , while better meeting the needs of their labor markets for foreign labor . <p> States also need to work together more closely to share the benefits of migration , for example through partnering to identify significant skills gaps in one country that migrants from another are qualified to fill . <p> Third and finally , we need greater international cooperation to protect vulnerable migrants , as well as refugees , and we must reestablish the integrity of the refugee protection regime in line with international law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doomed efforts to cross seas and deserts is not just a human tragedy . It also represents the most acute policy failure : unregulated , mass movements in desperate circumstances fuel a sense that borders are under threat and governments not in control . <p> In turn this leads to draconian border controls which undermine our collective values and help perpetuate the tragedies we have too often seen unfold in recent years . <p> We must fulfill our basic obligations to safeguard the lives and human rights of those migrants that the existing system has failed . <p> We must take urgent action to assist those now trapped in transit camps , or at risk of slavery , or facing situations of acute violence , whether in North Africa or Central America . We have to envisage ambitious international action to resettle those with nowhere to go . <p> We should also take steps -- through development aid , climate mitigation efforts and conflict prevention -- to avoid such unregulated large movements of people in future . Migration should not mean suffering . <p> We must aim for a world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , development and international unity . It is in our collective power to achieve this goal .

Interiors are equipped with softer , more plush materials . Suspension systems move from rugged leaf springs to more forgiving coil spring set ups . We also see body kits and low-profile tires that certainly make the truck look tough , but actually hinder its off-road capabilities . These adaptations come as no surprise in urban city environments , where pickup trucks are more of a statement than a vehicle that does any real heavy lifting . <p> Head out of the Metro and into more provincial areas , however , and you 'll find an automotive landscape filled with pickup trucks doing exactly what they 're designed to do .

It speaks an almost utilitarian design language in its simplicity . A recent refresh has updated its looks to make it look more modern , with its chrome grille , projector headlamps , LED daytime running lamps , and bumper coming together to form a well-integrated front fascia . Its exaggerated fenders give the D-Max a muscular stance , indicative of its ready-for-work attitude . <p> Clean interior <p> Its no-nonsense personality carries over inside , where easy-to-clean plastics and a well-laid-out center dash greet you once you open the door . Dominating the center console is a large eight-inch touchscreen display which handles audio , communication , and GPS navigation duties . Below the touchscreen is the circular console that handles air-conditioning duties . <p> The instrument cluster has been updated to reflect information such as outdoor temperature , water temperature , fuel levels , drive mode , and odometer in a digital readout , with the highly legible speedometer and tachometer reflecting a carbon-fiber themed layout with touches of red .

@@23216238 <h> Recent Posts <h> Price stability <p> As inflationary pressures build up caused by the uptick in increased excise taxes for essential commodities and higher prices for basic commodities like rice due to the imperfect trading structure , one looks at the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas ( BSP ) to mitigate the consequences on the public . The continuing depreciation of the peso while favorable for Philippine exports will mean still higher inflation as imports prices in peso values go up . Again , the BSP is seen as the enabler to keep inflation at manageable levels . <p> It is in these times that I recall the views expressed by the first governor of the BSP and chairman of the Monetary Board , Atty . Gabriel " Gabby " C. Singson who steered BSP in its early years and set the foundations for the credibility and respect that this institution has today .

In his book , Price Stability : The First Three Years , he stressed that as spelled out in the law , " the BSP 's primary objective is to maintain price stability conducive to a balanced and sustainable growth in the economy .

With a high 60% in October of 1984 , the average inflation figure in 1994 was 9.8% in August and brought down to 8.5% by year-end . He expressed that " the medium-term objective is really to bring down inflation to around 4% by 1996 to strengthen the economy 's competitive footing . " <p> The present situation can benefit from Gov . Gabby 's analysis of the factors behind the first quarter of 1996 's uptick in the consumer price indicator . His take -- " Agricultural setbacks especially in rice production were clearly a major factor behind recent unfavorable price trends .

As a group we were starting to have problems . <p> I think I was sensing that The Beatles were breaking up , so I was staying up too late at night , drinking , doing drugs , clubbing , the way a lot of people were at the time . <p> I was really living and playing hard . The other guys were all living out in the country with their partners , but I was still a bachelor in London with my own house in St. John 's Wood . <p> And that was kind of at the back of my mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ someone , because it was before I got together with Linda . <p> So , I was exhausted ! <p> Some nights I 'd go to bed and my head would just flop on the pillow ; and when I 'd wake up I 'd have difficulty pulling it off , thinking , " Good job . I woke up just then or I might have suffocated . " <p> Then one night , somewhere between deep sleep and insomnia , I had the most comforting dream about my mother who died when I was only 14 . <p> She had been a nurse , my mum , and very hardworking , because she wanted the best for us . We were n't a well-off family -- we did n't have a car , we just about had a television -- so both of my parents went out to work , and mum contributed a good half to the family income . <p> At night when she came home , she would cook , so we did n't have a lot of time with each other . <p> But she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> And when she died , one of the difficulties I had , as the years went by , was that I could n't recall her face so easily . <p> That 's how it is for everyone , I think . <h> ... with the Fabulous Four Ringo Starr , John Lennon and George Harrison -AP Photo <p> As each day goes by , you just ca n't bring their faces into your mind ; you have to use photographs and reminders like that . <p> So in this dream 12 years later , my mother appeared , and there was her face , completely clear , particularly her eyes ; and she said to me very gently , very reassuringly , " Let it be . " <p> It was lovely . <p> I woke up with a great feeling . It was really like she had visited me at this very difficult point in my life and gave me this message : <p> Be gentle , do n't fight things , just try and go with the flow and it all will work out . <p> So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the piano and started writing a song : <p> " When I find myself in times of trouble , Mother Mary comes to me " ... Mary was my mother 's name .. " Speaking words of wisdom , let it be . There will be an answer , let it be . " <p> It did n't take long . <p> I wrote the main body of it in one go , and then the subsequent verses developed from there : <p> " When all the broken-hearted people living in the world agree , there will be an answer , let it be . " <p> I thought it was special , so I played it to the guys and ' round a lot of people , and later it became the title of the album , because it had so much value to me , and because it just seemed definitive , those three little syllables . <p> Plus , when something happens like that , as if by magic , I think it has a resonance that other people notice , too . <p> Not very long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which was the saving of me . <p> And if it was as if my mum had sent her , you could almost say . The song is also one of the first things Linda and I ever did together musically . <p> We went over to Abbey Road Studios one day , where the recording sessions were in place . <p> I lived nearby and often used to just drop in when I knew an engineer would be there and do little bits on my own . <p> And I just thought , " Oh , it would be good to try harmony on this . " <p> But I had a high harmony in mind , too high for me , and although Linda was n't a professional singer , I 'd heard her sing around the house and knew she could hold a note and sing that high .

" <p> So those words are really very special to me , because not only did my mum come to me in a dream and reassure me with them at a very difficult time in my life -- and sure enough , things did get better after that -- but also , in putting them into a song and recording it with The Beatles , it became a reassuring , healing statement for other people , too . <p> Las Vegas matchmaker Sean Gibbons described WBA welterweight champion Lucas Matthysse of Argentina as a dangerous opponent because of his raw punching power but said Sen.

I remember way back when I was still teaching ( there was no internet then ) , and whenever I would come across something interesting , I would write those in a journal that I kept . <p> Later on , I compiled these quotations and typed them up on a page layout software called Pagemaker , printed them out on board paper , then cut them into small 4x5 cards . I would shuffle the cards , pick out one , and pin it on my corkboard at the faculty area where it would stay for a few days until I got tired of it , and I would pick another one to replace it . <p> Then the internet came along and memes became popular , and people would post quotations along with who said them . I noticed some of them were from my old collection , but sometimes they were attributed to other people . <p> There was one time when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kurt Vonnegut Jr . If you 've been around long enough , you 've probably read it or heard about it also . It was supposedly delivered by the author as a commencement speech to the M.I.T. class of 1997 .

When he sought out the author to ask for permission to use the words , he found out then that Vonnegut did n't actually write the speech , but a Chicago Tribune columnist named Mary Schmich . <p> It turns out that many famous quotations have been misattributed or even misquoted .

Do an image search for this phrase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line to Lao Tzu and some attribute it to Confucius . The truth is that neither of them actually said this line . The original sentence is found in the Tao Te Ching by Lao Tzu and it translates roughly as " the journey of a thousand li begins beneath one 's feet . " ( The li is a Chinese unit of measure and a thousand of them converts to roughly 400 miles ) . <p> So the exact original phrase would be something like " The journey of 400 miles begins beneath one 's feet . " Then again , that would n't look as good on a meme . <p> Sometimes , a person is quoting someone else and that person is attributed as the source of the quote . For example , do another image search for " Education is what remains after one has forgotten everything he learned in school " and you will see many memes attributing this quote to Albert Einstein . <p> The truth is Einstein was not the originator of this statement as he was only quoting someone else , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just called the person as " some wit .

Very simple , it 's kindness and love . And this kindness and love should generate from this place and it comes with skills , academic excellence and social responsibility . " <p> Pinky says that the building makes concrete what the Sy family believes , which made Tessie and her siblings nod in agreement .

This is the unmistakable truth that stares everyone in the face in the Philippines today . The question is , is this something unusual or extraordinary ? The answer is no , if one is a reader and a believer of the Christian Bible . <p> The fact is that , domination of any country 's economy ( not just the Philippine economy ) by foreigners -- -and not just by ethnic Chinese -- is actually written in the Bible , particularly in its Deuteronomy 28:15 , 43-44 .

Then you will become prosperous and successful . " <p> The same message is actually echoed in many other parts of the Bible , notably Deuteronomy 28:1-14 , Proverbs 3:1-2 and Matthew 6:33 .

" Star Wars " , written and directed by George Lucas , introduced moviegoers to the Force , the Empire , the Deathstar , the Rebel Alliance , and the Skywalker family . One of the characters in that first film was space smuggler Han Solo played by Harrison Ford , who had already given up acting and was now into carpentry . <p> You 'd need a Time Stone to find out what could have been if Ford had not been cast . If Star Wars is a space opera , Han Solo would be its bastard child with an unruly heart - the rebel who rejects the rules , gets the girl , and ends up doing the right thing after all . <p> Ford played Han with a smirking , devil-may-care attitude that could have reflected his own circumstances when he got the role . Fans quickly latched on to his character @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed bothered by the Empire 's machinations because he was too busy making a quick buck for himself . He did n't have The Force but he had the Falcon , and that was good enough . <p> Fast forward to 40 years later and we 've got the inevitable prequel , with Han Solo played by Alden Ehrenreich . " Solo : A Star Wars Story " , directed by Ron Howard , ticks off all the boxes for an origin story - the landspeeder , the dice , the Millennium Falcon , and the Kessel Run . We 've got thievery and space smuggling , with the Galactic Empire looming over the proceedings . What 's not to love ? <p> Set a few years before " A New Hope " , Solo starts with the titular Han hot-wiring a landspeeder after stealing a small cache of coaxium , which can fuel starships . Solo wants to leave the squalid planet Corellia with girlfriend Qi'ra ( Emilia Clarke ) so he can finally be free from the thumb of Lady Proxima , an aquatic space-worm that serves as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their plans leads to Han actually enlisting in the Imperial Army , going to war , and then trying to hook up with grizzled space grifter Beckett ( Woody Harrelson ) and girlfriend Val ( Thandie Newton ) .

But it does lead to some of the more interesting places for Han 's story . <p> The narrative finds a pulse when Han finally meets up with Chewbacca ( Joonas Suotamo ) , a Wookiee from the planet Kashyyyk . Chewie gets a tragic backstory here , and his decision to partner up with Han is believable for the most part . Han 's ploy to escape a savage beating from Chewie is the film 's first real laugh out loud moment . Surprisingly , it 's probably the only drop-dead funny scene involving Han . <p> The two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Calrissian ( Donald Glover ) and his perky droid , L3-37 ( Phoebe Waller-Bridge ) . As the first owner of the Millennium Falcon , Lando is the unruffled charm machine that is more than a match for Han 's overconfidence . Glover is a gravity well of charisma , and every scene he 's in just elevates the movie . <p> Similarly , L3-37 - a female droid with a militant streak that would make William Wallace proud - is absolute dynamite . Star Wars has always used the droids to great comic effect but L3 just takes things to a whole new galactic level - a droid that thinks and acts like a believable , sassy human partner and has her own plans to empower fellow droids . When Lando asks her : " Can I get you anything ? " and she answers " Equal rights ? " - the whole cinema just exploded with laughter .

L3 seeks to rebel in order to free the droids while the Rebellion , which is seeded here , seeks to free the worlds under the Empire 's jackboots . Han 's rebellion is against his own forgettable past ; he 's the child of a man who built starships but never got to pilot one . He loses the love of his life , gets thrown into war , and then joins a band of mercenaries . Han 's innate goodness is there from the start . He may join a band of space train robbers , but he 'll always do the right thing in the end . " A New Hope " gave us some doubt on Han 's motivations , which is why his return in the final battle is so exhilarating . None of that doubt is here . <p> Somewhat lost in the shuffle is Ehrenreich , who gets the plum role of young Han . It 's a starmaking role if played @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bravado that taps into later Han 's arrogance . The hard truth about his performance , though , is that he plays Han too trippingly - unsure and somewhat lacking that Lothario vibe . Too pop when he should rock . This Han ai n't in complete control of anything yet , so the layered subtext of his backstory has yet to be established . It 's a disservice to his story , though , that everyone else has their acts together . Instead of zipping at lightspeed , Han is still learning how to shoot first . <p> Thankfully , there are other distractions that keep this movie swinging . Corellia is imagined as an industrial planet controlled by the Empire and dingy alien thugs . Dryden Vos ' star yacht is imagined as a decadent entertainment palace for an edgier clientele . There are aliens with box-like contraptions for a head , a giant space octopus , extra Wookies , and a surprise appearance of an old villain that smells of sequelitis . The Solo-Qi'ra romance works well when it does n't get bogged down by director Ron @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bottomline : " Solo A Star Wars story " is an enjoyable space romp that doubles down on what Star Wars does best - starship fights , exotic mud and spice planets , and fascinating creatures .

By pointing to a reason other than Osme ? a 's marketing and " negotiating " skills for developers gaining interest in the SRP , Garganera minimized what the mayor has been boasting for a long time now : that only he can better sell SRP lots . <p> This has long been an Osme ? a theme , a continuation of the line that only he was responsible for conceptualizing the reclamation of the city 's seafront -- and which he uses to control the SRP development as if it were his own land , forgetting or intentionally downplaying the fact that all the money poured into the project came from Cebuano taxpayers .

@@24888233 <h> Cabaero : How much wage hike ? <p> THE Central Visayas wage board , tasked to decide on petitions to increase workers ' salaries in the region , is about to determine the amount of adjustment to grant . <p> That is how it appears to me . No longer a question of whether it would grant an increase , given the clamor for it . The issue is on how much adjustment to give . <p> One proposal from a labor coalition is for a P155 across-the-board daily wage adjustment , another group wants a lower amount at P120 . Other sectors point to how 4.5 percent more to the current minimum salary should be enough to cover the 4.5 percent increase in consumer prices year-on-year in April 2018 . <p> Then , there is the proposal of the House of Representatives ' Makabayan bloc filed Monday that seeks to grant workers in all regions of the country a national minimum wage of P750 a day . This means Regional Tripartite Wages and Productivity Boards would be abolished to pave the way for a P750 national minimum wage . The idea is preposterous not only because of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the law requires the pegging of amount per region to consider conditions peculiar to a locality , the law that created these wage boards would have to be repealed . <p> The Cebu-based regional wage board is expected to decide soon on the petitions after gathering information on economic condition , updated prices of basic agricultural products , inflation rate , and consumer price index . Before the board are petitions for a P155.80 across-the-board daily wage adjustment filed collectively by the Cebu Labor Coalition and five workers ' groups inside companies here , and a P120 adjustment proposed by the Associated Labor Unions-Trade Union Congress of the Philippines . <p> Business groups in Cebu opposed the petitions saying it was n't the proper time for a wage adjustment because of the new law on taxes and recent amendments to the country 's labor laws . They also said a pay hike would be counterproductive . <p> The labor groups had said a wage increase would help workers cope with rising prices of commodities and fuel , and the continued devaluation of workers ' purchasing power . <p> The last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and added P13 to the daily basic pay , placing the minimum wage at P366 per day . <p> Although it would only be a little over a year since the last pay adjustment , an increase should be granted by the board to help millions of workers burdened by rising prices . <p> Results of a Pulse Asia poll from March 23 to 28 showed that 50 percent of Filipinos want government to improve the workers ' pay , while 45 percent believed President Rodrigo Duterte 's government must control inflation . A wage hike was listed as a concern by residents of Luzon ( 56 percent ) , Visayas ( 50 percent ) , Manila ( 45 ) , and Mindanao ( 39 percent ) . It is a nationwide clamor to help workers meet their basic necessities . <p> These figures answer for the region 's wage board the question of whether it should increase wages .

@@24888234 <h> Malilong : SK as battleground for city council control <p> SPECIAL attention will be focused on Cebu City today when the Sangguniang Kabataan ( SK ) chairpersons in Cebu elect their respective federation officials . The presidency of the federation will be a hotly contested position despite assurances from the opposition that they will not attempt to influence the results of the election . Mayor Tomas Osme ? a has openly declared that he will be supporting a candidate for federation president . <p> Nothing less than control of the city council is at stake in the youth elections . With the Association of Barangay Councils firmly in the hands of the BOPK , the opposition is banking on the SK representative to maintain the current political configuration in the council and allow Vice Mayor Edgar Labella to cast his vote and break any tie . <p> Here is how the numbers work : There are sixteen regular Cebu City councilors , eight each from the north and the south districts . One of the seats in the south is currently vacant because of the order of the Ombudsman dismissing James Cuenco . The dismissal is on appeal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Eight of the 15 sitting regular councilors are allied with the BOPK . Barug has seven but Philip Zafra who is an ex-officio member by virtue of his being ABC president levels the count at 8-all . <p> With Zafra good as gone and BOPK 's Franklin Ong 's imminent election as his replacement , the count should stand at 9-7 in favor of the administration party . But Cuenco can narrow the gap at 8-9 by winning his appeal or , failing that , by abandoning it . In the latter event , a replacement will be appointed by the president upon nomination of the UNA , the party under which he won , and which is headed in Cebu by former mayor Michael Rama . <p> That is why the election of SK president is very crucial to both sides as he will also be an ex-officio member of the council like the ABC president . ( We have n't had an SK federation president since the youth group 's temporary " abolition . " ) <p> If Osme ? a 's candidate wins , he will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then have ten BOPK members . The situation becomes complicated for him if his bet loses because then the council will be evenly split at 9-all .

( I was told that it was actually Secretary Bong Go who invited the youth leaders after they waited for hours to see President Duterte at the Waterfront Lahug Hotel last week and Dino was only asked to make the necessary arrangements . ) <p> Forty-two of the SK chairmen are said to be identified with the BOPK , 38 with Barug or PDP-Laban .

@@24944236 <h> Trump plays down chances of quick breakthrough as North Koreans bring letter <p> NEW YORK/ABOARD AIR FORCE ONE -- US President Donald Trump on Thursday played down the chances of a quick deal in getting North Korea to abandon its nuclear arms as a delegation from Pyongyang headed to meet him with a letter from North Korean leader Kim Jong Un , suggesting a proposed summit may be back on . <p> US President Donald Trump ( REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst/MANILA BULLETIN ) <p> Trump told Reuters he was still hoping for an unprecedented meeting with Kim on June 12 in Singapore to push for North Korean " denuclearization , " but North Korea 's leader said his position on that central issue had not changed . <p> " I 'd like to see it done in one meeting , " Trump said in an interview on Air Force One . " But often times that 's not the way deals work . There 's a very good chance that it wo n't be done in one meeting or two meetings or three meetings . But it 'll get done at some point .

He has since held summits with South Korea and made two visits to China as part of a campaign of diplomatic outreach aimed at easing Pyongyang 's isolation and US-led international sanctions . <p> North Korea has rejected US calls for its unilateral nuclear disarmament and argued for a " phased " approach to denuclearization of the entire Korean peninsula , which in the past has meant removal of the US nuclear umbrella protecting South Korea and Japan . <p> US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kim Yong Chol , with whom he held two days of talks with in New York , would make a rare visit to the White House on Friday and give Trump a letter from Kim . <p> The letter appeared to be in response to a comment from Trump last Thursday when he canceled the summit , accusing Pyongyang of hostility , but urged the North Korean leader to " call me or write " if he had a change of heart . <p> Kim 's letter seemed to be a sign that the summit might now go ahead . There has been a flurry of diplomatic efforts in the past few days to get it back on track . <p> North Korea , whose nuclear ambitions have been a source of tension for decades , has made advances in missile technology in recent years and its nuclear arsenal now threatens the United States . <p> Trump has sworn not to allow it to develop nuclear missiles that could hit the United States .

" <p> Kim Yong Chol is a close aide of Kim Jong Un and is vice chairman of the ruling Workers ' Party 's Central Committee . <p> The United States and South Korea blacklisted the official for supporting North Korea 's nuclear and missile programs in 2010 and 2016 , respectively .

@@24960231 <p> Years ago , I was invited to speak to a faith-based group and was told 300 people would attend . Only 40 people showed up . I was disappointed , but I did not show it . The usual reasons given : <p> * " There was a simultaneous seminar ... " <p> * " It was too late to inform the congregation ... " <p> * " Perhaps because of the long vacation ... " <p> I learned a valuable lesson . It does not serve me well to be disappointed with the numbers . No matter what the size of the audience , is whether 2,000 or two , I will give my best for those that have invested their time to be there . Excellence , therefore , is not related to the number of people who are in the audience , but excellence is a matter of the heart , and a grim determination to do my best regardless of the number . <p> I still maintain this position today . After thousands of speaking engagements , my smallest audience was two people : the HR directress and the president of a top company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full-packed coliseum and arena , but I still give my best regardless of the number . <p> Another observation I have is that there are different types of organizers ; those who over-promise and those who do not . Usually , the organizers from the corporate world would be very accommodating to a fault . They treat their speakers like VIP 's . Make sure their needs are taken care of . When I asked about the expected number of participants , they tend to give a lower number so as not to disappoint the speaker . <p> I shared my experience with a friend of mine about how that particular faith-based organization promised 300 and only 40 showed up . In his characteristic dry humor , he rubbed his chin and said , " I do n't think they intended to lie , but when they said 400 would show up , they might have included the angels in the congregation .

Just show me where I can get a cup of coffee and I can personally go there and have one later ... " <p> Here is one lesson I would like to share . There was a time when I wore " transition glasses " and forgot all about it as I spoke to 300 leaders of a famous food company . The stagelight beamed directly into my eyes , but I could see the audience well unlike the many times that I could not .

I did some research and to my surprise discovered that spotlights carry UV rays and transition lenses react to it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protect the eyes . What a learning experience ! <p> Another lesson is this : you have probably seen speakers or performers putting up their hands and shading their eyes from the spotlight as they try to look at the audience . They seem so uncomfortable on the stage do n't they ? I can assure you they are . Let me explain . <p> The light that is beamed directly is to the eyes of the speakers and performers hinder their concentration . Ever notice how police or interrogators beam a strong light on their suspects ? They do it to hinder the suspects ' concentration for them to start " confessing " the truth . <p> However , newbies , start-up speakers , and performers can not identify what is wrong and so they chalk flame their inability to concentrate to " stage fright .

@@24960232 <p> Budget Secretary Ben Diokno was in a moment of frankness when he described those complaining about the elevated inflation rate as " crybabies . " A hard-nosed economist , he knew that rapidly expanding economies do create inflationary pressures as a matter of course . <p> The presidential spokesman tried to walk back that description . He was wary about rising public discontent over the movement of prices . But he failed to provide a more apt word for those using the inflation rate to bludgeon the administration . <p> Perhaps " crybabies " is not the precise word . It adds a tinge of innocence to critics banging populist pans by demanding the tax reforms be rolled back , the minimum wage raised and subsidies rolled out . I preferred to describe them cynical rabble-rousers . The sum of all their demands is hyperinflation . <p> To be sure , governments need to at least appear to be doing something to douse an inflationary surge .

That holds little promise . <p> The Russians are unlikely to undercut themselves and sell us oil at prices lower than they might get selling to the open market . That will be an obscene act of charity if they do that and other nations will be demanding the same bargain rates for themselves . This will politicize the price of oil and blow away the normal channels for openly trading the commodity . <p> Besides , even if government manages to procure some amount of crude oil on what might seem to be bargain rates , we will be politically indebted by that deal . Then we have to go find refineries to convert crude to usable oil products . After that , government will have to devise a way to distribute the commodity , sidestepping the developed and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the end , because of the public sector 's legendary inefficiency , we might be selling politicized oil at a much higher price than what could be sold by private sector players with efficient refineries and distribution systems . <p> Buying oil on the basis of some political arrangement with oil exporting countries has never been an efficient way of doing things . This option is pure political gimmickry . It is as much an insult to public intelligence as those cynical leftists demanding the oil industry be " nationalized " -- which can only mean that end-products are heavily subsidized using taxpayer money . <p> Those demanding the " nationalization " of the oil industry are the same ones demanding that government subsidize rice so that they can be sold without reflecting true value . They want prices to defy the laws of the market .

The traditional oil exporters will lose market share to shale oil producers who are profitable at $60 . <p> Right now we are looking forward to a series of oil price rollbacks , reflecting the softening of crude oil prices in the global marketplace . Even before we actually negotiate with the Russians for a piece of their oil bounty , prices in the open market have dropped below what they might offer us . <p> The point is this : before hyperventilating , allow some space for prices to self-correct . <p> The inflation rate for May is expected to hit five percent .

The excise taxes imposed on a highly polluting commodity like oil , on tobacco and alcohol and on sugary beverages are all below levels imposed by other countries on the same commodities .

@@24960233 <p> No one can pass up on a success story . In our continuing quest for Proud Pinoy Entrepreneurs in this column and in our TV show , we found the saga of Bo 's Coffee most interesting and its founder , Steve Benitez , even more so . <p> Steve Benitez , known as the father of Bo 's Coffee , started the chain way back in 1996 . But even before that , he was already the quintessential entrepreneur . <p> Coffee shops in the Philippines back then were of a different breed , so unlike the coffee shops in Europe and the US . Coffee was not considered an experience , so to speak , and it was a plain beverage which was more often than not an accompaniment to a more significant order of pastries or sandwiches , or even pasta . <p> Steve did not want to be lost in the fold , so even before he opened his first coffee shop , he studied the business for two years , attended several conferences and expos , and travelled a lot to immerse himself in the coffee culture . <p> No one believed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience , but he relied on his guts and went ahead with the project . Two months before the shop opened , his two business partners backed out on the project , leaving him to cope alone . Actually , his studies indicated that it was n't a viable venture , but he stubbornly relied on his guts and felt he was ready to take on the challenge . <p> He remembers well a lady customer who felt that P15 was too much to pay for a cup of coffee at Bo 's Coffee . Back then , restaurants just gave it away after a pricey meal and people were more familiar with instant coffee . He gave the coffee for free and the next day the lady came back for his coffee , ready to pay P15 for it . <p> The first three months were disastrous , with daily sales amounting to just P300 up to a maximum of less than P1,000 . It was n't even enough to pay the monthly rent of P10,000 , and how about the salaries , etc ? As a business proposition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , this venture was not just a business , it was his way of executing the passion he had for coffee . He was giving away free coffee and it was on the sixth month that his sales picked up and steadily increased . On the eight month , he opened his second kiosk , and the rest , as they say , is history . <p> What makes Bo 's Coffee click ? He adopted the same concept in the US and in Europe where there is a coffee culture to speak of . He wanted to share the coffee shop experience with the budding coffee community here at home , but tweaked it a little to be more acceptable to the local market . He recreated the European scene of having coffee shops on the sidewalks , having about six small tables in the middle of a mall hallway where it is cool and people can enjoy a steaming cup of good coffee . <p> The coffee experience that Steve wanted to cultivate here also meant elevating the coffee experience by introducing coffee that uses espresso as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got intimidated by it . Years back , not too many folks ordered cappuccino or latte . The lady he talked about earlier was one such customer , but she came back the next day and that was one of his greatest fulfilments in the early days of Bo 's Coffee . It simply meant the market needed to be educated on the coffee experience . <p> Steve says that the biggest thing that makes them different from other coffee shops is that they are a homegrown coffee company as against the foreign brands that dominate the local coffee scene . Bo 's Coffee is the biggest-homegrown coffee chain , and that is the feather on his cap . <p> Serving Philippine coffee and showcasing it serves him well to fulfil his dream of bringing Philippine coffee to the global stage . In the late 1800s , says Steve , the Philippines was the biggest coffee grower in the world . We sadly lost that position over time , maybe because of lack of investments and government support to the coffee farmers . Before Steve can bring Bo to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ popular here at home first and ensure enough supply to bring the brand abroad . We only supply 30 percent of the local demand , so even if we increase awareness , we still can not supply the demand . He does his big share by procuring Philippine coffee directly from local coffee farmers and is initiating an industry-wide campaign . This involves all the coffee stakeholders and a partnership with the government . The Philippine Coffee Council 's objective is to increase the yield of coffee farmers and ultimately increase their income . They source their coffee from different parts of the country , depending on the variety of coffee . Robusta , for instance , is sourced from the lowlands of Cavite , Batangas , and Mindanao . The higher quality Arabica , which Bo 's Coffee uses , is sourced from the highlands of Benguet , Sagada , Mountain Province , Mt . Apo in Davao , and Mt . Katinglad in Bukidnon . <p> He also works with other social entrepreneurs to take the coffee experience in Bo 's Coffee by using Philippine materials such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ social entrepreneur Anya , was grateful to have Bo 's Coffee as her biggest client so she could scale up her social enterprise using woven Philippine fabrics .

He created a social procurement platform for them which they can just plug into and they can have quick market access . He cites Bayani Brew , Tsaa Laya , Rags2Riches , and Theo &amp;Philo among the social enterprises he has engaged with . They monitor the progress in their communities ( tea farming , weaving , etc. ) to make sure their impact is felt by the communities . They also give support by way of equipment and education . <p> Now , Bo 's Coffee has over a hundred stores and counting , and is set to open 20 more this year .

Remove the constitutional infirmities , he declared , and we concede the Bangsamoro Basic Law . <p> The Senate 's version of the BBL shows that someone was paying attention . The Senators were as joined in solidarity as the Congressmen , voting 21-0 . But the Senate had its amendments . The Senate insisted , among others , that Bangsamoro residents remain as citizens of the Philippines ; there would only be a one time opt in and no opt out ; the block grant of 6% was lowered to 5% ; police and security @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( PNP ) which is a PRRD condition . <p> Why we need the Senate . The action of the Senate in the BBL debate as well as its posture questioning the Supreme Court 's Quo Warranto ouster of Chief Justice Ma . Lourdes P.A. Sereno makes its institutional raison d'etre self evident . <p> At the House , the general rule is that members can not be bothered to do the grunt work on pressing national issues . The reality is that most are on permanent campaign mode , perpetually caught up in the quagmire of needy constituency work . Blame this on the short three-year term . Given the lower age qualification , they are less seasoned than their Senate counterparts and , in several districts , the merit in their selection is grounded on parochial considerations . Congressman armed with more than a modicum of knowledge and expertise are the exception . But such grand exceptions they are , specially in the areas of their own specialization . The best of the House can compete with the best of the Senate any day . <p> It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come to expect from our Senators and their committees a deeper grasp of policy considerations . Given their six-year terms , they have the luxury of growing into a technical legislative proficiency . Their smaller number also forces each Senator to have a wider and more diverse policy horizon . You can enter that chamber an empty vessel yet emerge with the equivalent of multiple advanced degrees , all the better for shaping legislation . In the upper house , the clueless is the exception . <p> The Senate was designed to serve as the coolant to a House prone to overheat from the passions of its members . It is now also essaying the same role to the Supreme Court . <p> Dancing with no music . Individual members of Congress have contested with fervor the administration 's West Philippine Sea policy . This more activist stance is good for the institution . When it comes to China , the Legislature is seen as abdicating its foreign policy role to the Executive . <p> The Supreme Court has embraced the theory of the President as the sole organ , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hypothesis to death arguing that there is no basis to limit the power to the President . Certainly , he alone implements policy but he acts with the Legislative , actually leads the latter , in formulating the same . This is a divided power which has become more Presidential only by default -- because Congress has been silent . But not anymore . <p> Twist and shout . Congressman Gary Alejano has been hectoring the administration for the past two years . A " strategy of silence " ? Finally , he gets face time with Sec . Alan Peter Cayetano at that House hearing . Cong . Alejano articulated the popular position against the government 's inaction , even now with bombers parked at our doorstep . He elicited a vital disclosure : we did file a diplomatic protest on , among others , the installation of missiles on Spratlys island and the harassment of our navy men on their resupply missions to Ayungin shoal by Chinese navy helicopters . It is unclear if the landing of the bombers on Paracel islands or the seizure of Sandy Cay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finding solutions quietly . They prefer not to shout . If this is their strategy choice , then it becomes our first option . But when the actions of the other party are even louder than shouts , then the strategy of silence becomes curious . How does one disguise as a protest something that is just whispered in confidence ? Acting Chief Justice Antonio Carpio is right that without a vigorous objection , not only China but the entire community of nations may treat our inaction as consent or acquiescence . <p> NTH , NTF . PNP Director General Oscar Albayalde trotted out the immortal " if you have nothing to hide , then you have nothing to fear " proposition to demonize those who would not freely embrace a National I.D . System . If you hear this from someone who questions your lack of a Facebook account , you dismiss it with a guffaw . But if uttered by the Nation 's top cop , the chilling effect is undeniable . Leave it to our law enforcement agencies to make the argument that only the guilty insist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helm of the PNP was supposed to be a public relations game changer . His disciplinarian streak was widely applauded even before his promotion . The PNP image problem would get its improvement . Non sequiturs like this just muddle the discussion instead of helping clarify issues . <p> A lot of the noise against the proposal is voiced by those who have trust issues with the authorities . To a nation already skeptical of the PNP 's capacity to respect privacy rights , this is an ill timed disconnect with the basic principle that guilt needs to be proved and is never presumed .

The wond'ring forests should dance again ; the moving mountains hear the powerful call , and headlong streams hang listening to their fall ! -- Alexander Pope <p> Orpheus , the son of god Apollo and the muse Calliope , is a poet of unparalleled prowess . In what is probably the most famous story surrounding him , his searing song lamenting the untimely death of his wife Eurydice moved Hades so much that the god of the underworld allowed him a trip to his realm to fetch his beloved . Hades ' only rule is that Orpheus can not look back at Eurydice as she follows him back to the land of the living . Orpheus ' stubborn humanity gets the best of him and he checks on his love who , true to Hades ' warning , disappears the very moment he disobeys the god . <p> The fate of Hugo Haniway , the esteemed poet of Lav Diaz 's Ang Panahon ng Halimaw , seems to be carved from the Greek myth . Lorena , his wife , has gone to Ginto , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and has not returned . Depressed and despondent , Hugo , who is now less a poet and more a drunkard whose invisible conscience does most of the singing , is urged to follow Lorena to the ironically named town that feels more ghoulish than golden . This is where Diaz separates from the famed myth . Hugo never sees Lorena . Instead , he sees a populace beholden to all sorts of stories spread by the trigger-happy men and women under the employ of a demagogue whose misshapen head bears not one but two faces . One face does the blabbering of impassioned nonsense , while the other , which resembles the mug of Ferdinand Marcos , is in a state of perpetual contemplation , awaiting the right time for a return . Hugo 's challenge now is not the temptation of looking back at his beloved but to have his personal aches deter him from his responsibilities as an artist living in a country whose tainted culture has forced it to be subservient to abusers . <p> Diaz is an ardent believer in the power of culture , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , is not new . The Greeks believed that Orpheus 's sung lyrics could move mountains and deities . Marcos created tales of aswangs and other monstrosities to deter communist uprisings in the provinces . The first revolution in EDSA was one where the crescendos of nationalistic anthems were louder than guns and bombs . Today , clever distortions of truths are flooding all the corners of the internet to the glee of demagogues who are grossly satisfied with just a veneer of virtual satisfaction to support their inhumane regimes . The sad part of this history of how stories are used to carve up a nation is that dissent is curiously disappearing , with the artists and poets of our time seemingly content with whispers and whimpers as opposed to their more pronounced presence in the past . The Filipino artist , it seems -- or at least from the perspective of Diaz in Ang Panahon ng Halimaw -- has cowered in apathy and compromise , preferring the safety and comfort of personal satisfaction to the responsible pursuit of truth . <p> Diaz does n't see just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sees a troubled archipelago that has long been blinded by a culture that has been dumbed down to the point of ignorance . Boxing matches , inane jingles , filmed sex lessons , and expletive-ridden pronouncements now tickle the fancy , turning nobodies into national leaders . Intelligence is now frowned upon . Culture is commoditized and commercialized . The nation has been reduced to numbers appearing in surveys . Diaz 's film poses a reasonable request . Artists have responsibilities not just to themselves but to the nation that has shaped their rich consciousness . In a state where stories are used to warp reality to favor those with irresponsible intentions , it is the duty of the artist to use his words , his songs , his art , to , in the words of Alexander Pope , make the forest dance again , to make the moving mountains hear , and the headlong streams to listen . <p> Stories should never be this nation 's downfall .

Undoubtedly , motorcycles are the perfect choice of transport by hired guns and other criminals for quick get-away vehicles , especially to avoid being caught in our traffic-gridlock roads . <p> The bill is being shepherded in Congress by the House committees on transportation chaired by Catanduanes Rep. Cesar Sarmiento and on public order chaired by Antipolo Rep. Romeo Acop , also a retired police general . Both House committees endorsed a consolidated bill of the four related measures proposing bigger plates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and design is to be determined by LTO and that the plate should be readable from a distance of 12 meters . <p> The Senate , much earlier , already approved on third and final reading a similar bill that would require motorcycles and scooters to have bigger and reflectorized license plates . Senate Bill No. 1397 , or the Motorcycle Crime Prevention Act of 2017 , authored by Senator Richard Gordon , chair of the Senate committee on justice and human rights , and then Senate majority leader and now Senate president Vicente Sotto III , co-authored the bill . It was approved in July last year , with 21 Senators voting in favor . <p> The funny part is , the proposed legislation mandating the use of larger motorcycle plates might get passed into law sooner than the LTO could even deliver car plates . <p> Owners of vehicles bought and registered in 2016 but up to now have not gotten their car plates from LTO . Car dealers have resorted to issuing " virtual " car plates . But for many others , they have been using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Some motorists have come up with a funny car plate but with a stinging rebuke : NO PLATE AVAILABLE , Republika ng Walang Plaka . <p> Galvante admitted the LTO is precisely waiting for the passage into law of this proposed bill before they start producing the motorcycle plates . While there is logic to wait for this bill to be passed into law , we could not help but sigh in disbelief . <p> Supposedly , the LTO started the production of license plates at its own manufacturing facility last April this year to address the more than two-year backlog in motor vehicle plates . The Department of Transportation ( DOTr ) , under which the LTO is one of attached agencies , gave assurances to the public they can expect the delivery of license plates by the second half of this year . <p> DOTr Secretary Arthur Tugade who inspected the LTO Motor Vehicle License Plate Facility last April gave these assurances . This was after the administration of President Rodrigo Duterte decided for the LTO to produce instead its own license plates as part of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Manufacturing Corp . and J.H. Tonnjes E.A.S.T . GmbH Joint Venture . <p> The backlog in license plates started during the term of President Benigno Aquino III when the Commission on Audit ( COA ) issued a Notice of Disallowance over the P3.8-billion motor vehicle license plate procurement deal . The COA ruled the contract did not follow procedures prescribed under Republic Act ( RA ) 9184 , or the Government Procurement Reform Act . <p> Tugade explained they wanted the LTO to produce its own plates in order to avoid a repeat of the problems which caused the backlog to hit over six million . That was in April after he inspected the seven units of Manual Embossing Machines that were calibrated and operated for ceremonial testing . According to the DOTr , the seven manual embossing machines are capable of producing 22,000 plates per day at full production and are expected to be delivered this July . <p> But yesterday , the LTO chief clarified they will still not be able to completely meet the backlog until the COA resolves the pending payment demand of the original contractor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for by registered motor vehicles owners . <p> Really , such bureaucratic nightmares mess up our government services . <p> Take the case of the P3.6-million donation given by the Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corp .

@@25025237 <p> Concern about rising prices has led to renewed demand to raise the minimum wage . In fact , it has led to proposals to radically raise the country 's already high national minimum wage . <p> The minimum wage in the East Asia development context . The Philippine minimum wage is the one of the highest among the country 's major competitors within ASEAN . ( I refer mainly to Thailand , Indonesia , and Vietnam , which have fairly sizable economies . ) <p> These other countries face similar inflationary pressures that we encounter , but they have done much better in raising investments to generate jobs and are conquering poverty faster . <p> These countries used the minimum wage to protect the entry level wage rate for the unskilled workers , not to raise the average incomes of most workers . To encourage the rise in wages , they relied on government policies to stimulate market forces . <p> What their governments did was to accelerate employment growth by attracting investments and to improve worker productivity through training and education . <p> This was the way to raise employment to wipe out the large amount of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and agriculture . <p> In fact , the typical East Asia model of economic growth has relied mainly on using inexpensive labor as the principal resource to attract industrial investments . They all mainly used foreign trade to enlarge the markets served by their industries . <p> The spectacular growth of East Asian economies , beginning with Japan , South Korea , Taiwan , Hong Kong -- and , of course , more recently China -- have been exemplars of this successful strategy . <p> Labor groups propose high minimum wage . Though the Philippine minimum wage is still the highest among ASEAN countries today . ( I have in mind Thailand , Indonesia , and Vietnam as active comparators ) , the Trade Union Congress of the Philippines ( TUCP ) is proposing an even higher , minimum wage to raise worker incomes by state mandate . <p> In addition , it is proposing to abandon the current policy of regional minimum wage-setting in favor of a single national minimum wage set by Congress . <p> For specifics , as suggested in a bill introduced in Congress by their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wage -- of P750 a day . ( At this proposal , and if the national base pay is at P400 a day , this would be an 87 percent increase in base pay ) . <p> One reasoning prevalent among labor groups is the following : " Regional wage boards heavily base their determination for the increase in minimum wage rates on the employers ' capacity to pay , instead of on the prevailing cost of living and living wage . " <p> The above is a quote from the leader of the Partido Manggagawa . Thus , they want to emphasize the cost of living and the calculation ( bureaucratically calculated ) of the living wage , or what the amount it takes to allow a worker with dependents to live comfortably . <p> The logic of the proposal is that the employers ' capacity to pay is not relevant , but the calculations of cost of living and the " living wage " are . <p> Of course , the cost of living is important in determining wage rates . But so is the capacity of employers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wage that is paid provides an outcome that both workers and their employers need to mutually accept . <p> Unrealistic or excessive demands concerning minimum wage could escalate into unproductive outcomes for all involved . Unfortunately , in our present case , where the good jobs are less plentiful in relation to all the workers seeking to fill them , the imposition of high minimum wages will only cause loss of jobs for many workers . <p> In such cases , the biggest loser is the laborer . Relative to the success of other countries in generating more jobs and economic productivity in their economy , our country has lost much ground because of the failure to create sound labor and employment policy . <p> Cart before of the horse : a recipe for economic disaster . The logic of labor markets in a capitalist economy is that somehow , job opportunities must expand if the country 's labor force is large and wanting in job opportunities . This has surely been the case still in the Philippines . <p> Labor leaders need to be more grounded on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should look at the employment situation and examine why there is so much unemployment and underemployment . <p> The cart can not pull the horse . It is the horse that pulls the cart . If they understand the problem better , they will come to the conclusion that jobs are wanting because investments are wanting . <p> So , their tack of improving the welfare of workers would be to support policies that create in employment : improving the investment climate , reforming industrial incentives , and supporting moves to open the economy toward greater competition . In addition , they should support the removal of economic restrictions to the entry of foreign investments into the country . <p> Labor leaders need to think more about the overall conditions of employment and unemployment . In the current situation of the country , the bigger problem is to generate more jobs and to raise worker productivity . As long as such problems persist in a country , it is difficult to imagine how high minimum wage mandated by government could effectively be successfully carried . <p> That is because when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the scene , the nation 's productivity rises and incomes rise for the average worker and for all . <p> The meaning of this point on our political leaders is important . It is to recognize that the minimum wage should be mainly for the protection of the entry wage earner . <p> All other labor policies should be geared toward raising investments in the economy , promoting greater flexibility in the rules pertaining to employment and promoting reasonable standards of protection of the worker in the workplace through the enhancement of social security , worker 's compensation , and the expansion of training programs so as to create greater labor productivity at the workplace . <p> In the end , some of these policies are not directly in the realm of direct labor policy . They are policies to promote industrial investments .

For God 's folly is wiser than men and his weakness , more powerful than men . " ( I Corinthians 1:23-25 ) <p> " Blest are you when they insult you and persecute you and utter every kind of slander against you because of Me .

Growing up on oldies radio , I was raised on a template of songs that rarely exceeded three minutes , that got in and out with a maximum amount of hooks and catchy choruses , and that found innovation in subtle moments . After writing about music for a number of years , I 've become increasingly drawn to bands that make what might be referred to as " difficult " music , because they 're inherently easier to write about . Still , I find myself becoming complacent with who I choose to listen to . <p> In these times , I find it 's helpful to remember the times when my father unceremoniously dropped into the world of progressive rock .

Despite the heroic efforts of the Flash Wolves -- who defeated the LCK 's Kingzone DragonX at the beginning of the night -- the region went out with barely a whimper , as the region 's only two victories both came from Flash Wolves as the trio of G-Rex , Machi E-sports and MAD Team lagged behind with three losses on Friday .

There could have been no better matchup to decide the fates of the two regions than between the two Mid-Season Invitational finalists , LPL 's Royal Never Give Up and LCK 's Kingzone DragonX . Thanks to two tiebreakers , victory in this final match would put either one in the lead . <p> The game certainly lived up to the hype as it boiled down to a hotly contested battle between varying playstyles from either side .

From session resumption on July 23 to candidacy filing in Oct. , election campaigning in Feb. -May to bow-out in June , it can explain federal shift to the people . More important , it can demonstrate clean intentions for going federal . <p> The best way to do that is to outlaw political dynasties once and for all .

@@25685232 <h> Withdrawing from the bank account of a deceased person <h> Let 's Talk Tax <p> By Lina P. Figueroa <p> Matters relating to death are usually not a good topic to discuss . However , what is worse is not knowing what to do when one is faced with death-related situations , such as when the family of the deceased needs to pay the hospital bills or funeral expenses , or when funds are needed to transport or repatriate the deceased . <p> Unpleasant as the topic may be , I am sharing with you the clarifications issued by the Bureau of Internal Revenue ( BIR ) on the requirements for withdrawing from the bank account of a deceased depositor . <p> Most of us are already aware that the Tax Reform for Acceleration and Inclusion ( TRAIN ) Law has opened a window where the estate tax return will not be a prerequisite to withdraw funds from the bank account of a deceased . The old law required estate taxes to be first settled and a BIR clearance secured prior to the release of the funds . There were many instances in the past when families of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pay for their expenses , while the bank account of the deceased remained frozen pending the settlement of the estate tax . <p> Now , the TRAIN Law only requires that the 6% estate tax is paid on the amount withdrawn . Families of the deceased need not wait for the estate tax to be processed before getting funds from the bank account . Based on the BIR clarifications , though , the heirs can not just go to the bank and demand the release of the funds . The BIR clarifications issued under Revenue Memorandum Circular ( RMC ) No. 62-2018 are as follows : <p> 1 . A TIN FOR THE ESTATE RMC No. 62-2018 mandates the bank to require the executor , administrator , or any of the legal heirs applying for the withdrawal to present a copy of the Tax Identification Number ( TIN ) of the estate of the decedent and BIR Form No. 1904 of the estate duly stamped received by the concerned Revenue District Office ( RDO ) of the BIR in accordance with the existing guidelines on the issuance of TIN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , could simply refer to the appropriate BIR form for applying for registration , which the BIR would stamp as received and where the BIR would write the assigned TIN . BIR Form 1904 is the application for registration for one-time taxpayer and person registering under EO 98 ( securing a TIN to be able to transact with any government office ) . For estate tax purposes , the Death Certificate should be attached . <p> Where shall the TIN of the estate be secured ? The registration of the estate is applied in the RDO having jurisdiction over the residence of the deceased at the time of death . If the deceased is a nonresident , the TIN shall be secured from the RDO where the executor or administrator is registered . If the executor or administrator is not a registered taxpayer , the registration of the estate shall be made with the RDO having jurisdiction over the place of residence of the executor or administrator . <p> The TIN is normally issued within an hour at the time of application , if the documents are in order and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . PERIOD TO WITHDRAW FROM THE BANK ACCOUNT Withdrawing from the bank account without first settling the estate tax and the BIR clearance shall be allowed only within one year from the date of the depositor 's death . This prescription period complements the one-year deadline for filing the estate tax return . Beyond the one-year period , the heirs would have no other way of withdrawing the bank deposits , except to file the estate tax return and secure the BIR clearance . The prescriptive period for the withdrawal will discourage complacency on the part of the heirs in settling the estate tax . <p> 3 . IF THE ACCOUNT IS A JOINT BANK ACCOUNT If the account is in the name of two or more depositors , the 6% withholding tax shall only be imposed on the share of the deceased in the joint bank account . <p> One of the surviving joint depositors will also be required to sign a sworn statement in the withdrawal slip to the effect that all the other joint depositors are still living at the time of withdrawal , and that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ RMC No. 62-2018 acknowledges that banks are not precluded from requiring pertinent documents to ascertain the identity and the right to claim of the heirs or its authorized representative before allowing any withdrawal from the bank deposit accounts . Banks would have their own policies in this regard , whether internal or in compliance with requirements under applicable laws , rules , and regulations . <p> The heirs , nonetheless , should bear in mind that it is best to first evaluate if the bank deposit can be exempt from tax , if the estate tax return will be processed . If the taxes are paid through the estate tax return , there is a P5-million standard deduction and a deduction of up to P10 million of the value of the family home . A maximum of P300,000 in estate taxes can be saved , if the cash of up to P5 million is included in the estate and subjected to tax as part of the estate tax return . Likewise , claims of debtors against the estate , as well as unpaid mortgages , are still deductible expenses under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can only be availed of if the estate will be settled by filing an estate tax return . <p> There are just a few of the possible reliefs from taxes . For estate taxes , these reliefs can be availed of only once in the life and death of a person . Our legislators have fought hard so that these reliefs can be part of our laws . The opportunity should be enjoyed when it comes . <p> Lina P. Figueroa is a principal of the Tax Advisory and Compliance of P&amp;A Grant Thornton .

@@25685237 <h> Lessons from Lolo <p> YEARS AGO , the Philippine Council of Management asked me to make a presentation at their National Management Conference and provide an entrepreneur 's point of view for responding to the challenges of the global economic crisis . They suggested that I focus on the values of resilience , ethics , and strategy for not just surviving but for succeeding through the challenging times . They also suggested that I make my presentation lively and light . <p> After I agreed to do the presentation , I hit a stonewall . <p> Planning a strategy , essentially , involved research , intelligence , planning , structure , discipline and a large amount of ruthlessness towards the achievement of personal or organizational goals . Ethics , on the other hand , brought up responses about compassion , honesty , transparency , righteousness , and morality . <p> These two ideas were like two mountain goats heading in opposite direction on a narrow bridge . <p> I was stuck ! <p> On the night before the presentation , I went to bed fraught with anxiety and chaos . <p> Finally , past midnight , a mentor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visiting . This was a man who had lived through the great depression , survived World War II and the partition of India-Pakistan in 1947 . This guru from the past had not just lived through these devastating periods of human history but had also succeeded through them with a combination of spunk , sincerity , and suppleness of strategy . <p> LOLO MAKHIJA Lolo Makhija , born and raised in Karachi , Sindh , was brought up by a lawyer father . Though he never did go to college he 'd acquired the sharpness and the analytical mind of his father . Lolo Makhija had built and nurtured several successful businesses in his lifetime . <p> By the time he was in his early fifties , he had turned into a very conservative investor whose life had acquired calm and stability which we all strive for . From his position of strength and stability , he was able to support his life and family with grace and dexterity . <p> The lessons that he had shared with me are the ones that I presented to the members of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picked up not in one sitting but over a period of time through my growing years . <p> I 'd like to create a larger context on why his ideas made so much sense and meaning given how the world moves and changes so fast . <p> Gandhi , once , claimed that man is the center of a circle which has no circumference . The bigger truth is that humans are , really , the center of a sphere with no boundaries in any direction . We are also all that we do , which in turn creates ripples and affects the universe . All these ripples we create over time and space also come right back at us , affecting our lives . This fact of interconnectedness and synchronicity is now being recognized much more than it was a few decades ago . <p> Now we know , understand and believe that when a butterfly flaps its wings in Batangas , it can create a bagyo storm in Bombay . Now we also know that excessive and reckless lending of money by banks in America can generate joblessness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remember , had an unspoken and a deep understanding of how waste , frivolity , and abuse can seriously exploit nature , humanity and life . <p> Lolo , even though he was substantially rich for his times , used to have a minimal number of personal clothing . He lived in a small home and would use public transportation on most of his commutes and travel . He also had another habit too which I , as a kid , and many other family members used to tease him about . Lolo used to pick up and gather little nuts , bolts , coins , milk bottle caps , etc. , from the street and bring them home . Here are certain things he told me that I have n't forgotten about . His tips also became values for organizations and , even , global development . <p> Taipan Henry Sy made his best deals and investment in the early 1980s when the country was undergoing political and economic turmoil . <p> When everyone else was closing shop and moving funds across borders and economies , Henry Sy bought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the crisis , built his first " mega-mall " called SM North Edsa . It makes Sun Tzu kind of strategic sense to always be ready with more than enough ammunition to conquer adversities and capture opportunities . Business acumen is the right hand of success and frugality , like that of my Lolo 's , makes up the left hand . <p> LESSON TWO : FIRST , HAVE , AT LEAST , ONE REVENUE STREAM THAT IS STEADY , SAFE , AND SUSTAINABLE AND ONLY THEN INDULGE IN OTHER INVESTMENTS . It is always good business strategy to be standing on solid ground . If one is not standing on steady ground how can he aim correctly his actions towards his targets in life ? If all our income sources are volatile and chaotic then the welfare of the organization and its stakeholders will remain at high risk . Finding and starting from solid ground again and again , makes every warrior a lethal and strong one . Finding solid ground and working from that angle is a matter of strong discipline and allows us to unleash unlimited power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stable ground builds strong bridges , in business , between aspirations and accomplishments . <p> If money was the only goal then all those chasing it would be on the right track to success and happiness . On the contrary , the opposite is the truth . Those who chase curiosity , learning , and discovery end up being truly wealthy , successful , and fulfilled . Likewise , business entities that focus on innovation , true growth , and socially responsible constructivism succeed phenomenally . Companies like Ayala group of the Philippines and Tata group of India are shining examples of such a paradigm . <p> LESSON FOUR : WHEN ENGULFED IN A WHIRLPOOL , STAY CALM AND USE ITS ENERGY RATHER THAN FIGHT IT . This particular tip from Lolo came at a time in my life when my personal life , my career and my financial status had made a home in the dog house . " The more you fight it the worse it 'll get , " I remember him telling me . " Be less frantic , complain less , bear more , put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ providence will find you a way out . " <p> Though I did not act on his advice right away , it became my mantra . Over the years , I have benefited powerfully from living calmly through all crises . <p> For businesses , patience , positioning , and proper timing become a powerful synergy . Becoming intrinsically and strategically " cool " drives our actions and judgments to become more proactive and powerful . <p> LESSON FIVE : LOOK AFTER ALL FAMILY , NEAR AND FAR . From his fifties right until his moving on to the next world , Lolo Makhija , kept supporting and sponsoring the growth , the welfare , and the education of near and distant family . His employees , his associates were always well looked after . Though he led the family quietly and firmly , he never claimed recognition . He was , also , always grooming others to take over and take charge . <p> In business , it makes profound sense to have leaders who build other leaders and not followers . It makes profound sense to run a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organization . <p> This amazing sense of family and community is intrinsic to humans regardless of cultural diversity . In the Philippines , I have seen proof of its existence during the People Power Revolution of the 1980s and most recently during the onslaught of typhoon Ondoy . <p> During these times , ordinary people from the street came together as one and looked after the welfare and relief of the larger family -- the country . <p> My take on Lolo Makhija 's amazing personality is that the man was made out of a very special stock . In a time and age when people were just content with safe , long-term jobs , in a place and country where people struggled for food and simple household needs , he managed to walk taller than them . He had this raging desire to be different , to stand apart and to be always strong and supportive . <p> What really and truly drives every individual and organization to be different is that same " raging desire " to be different . This deep , burning desire to succeed and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ key to success . Thus , for us to always succeed , we need to ignite ourselves in a such a way that people from far and wide should come watch us burn .

His career-best Tour finish to date is 15th , in 2015 and 2016 . <h> How did Thomas get the yellow jersey ? <p> Thomas -- who wore the race leader 's jersey for the first four days of the 2017 Tour , courtesy of his win in the opening individual time trial -- attacked out of a small , elite group that included Froome and won the uphill finish of Stage 11 at La Rosiere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's current 1:39 deficit to Thomas is because of his Stage 1 crash in which he landed on grass and was able to ride away , jolted and delayed but uninjured . <h> With Froome 's accomplishments , why did Sky come into the Tour with co-leaders ? <p> Sky was hedging its bet on Froome for two reasons . There was at least a slim possibility he would be barred from racing the Tour because of a then-pending doping case , and Tour organizers had indicated they might try to prevent him from starting . Froome tested over the allowable threshold for salbutamol , an asthma medication , during last year 's Vuelta a Espana , and the investigation into that result was leaked in December . Amid mounting criticism of both his team and the ponderous doping jurisprudence system , he continued to race and won the Giro d'Italia in May . <p> The UCI , cycling 's governing body , relied heavily on the World Anti-Doping Agency 's scientific advice in ultimately deciding against pursuing a case against Froome , but that decision was not announced until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raced in a couple of important tune-up events and won the Crit ? rium du Dauphin ? in the Alps in June . His prerace status as co-leader protected Sky in the event Froome was overly fatigued from the Giro campaign or unable to race . <h> Why does n't the team just pick one rider to support ? <p> Even this late in the race , it 's still to Sky 's advantage to keep both men where they are in the standings in case one man has a bad day physically , a mechanical problem or a crash -- and perhaps to keep both egos intact , although that 's pure speculation . Very few teams have this kind of problem to solve . The Spanish Movistar team came into the Tour ostensibly with three leaders , but the designations seemed more like honorifics than a true triptych . If one of those men were leading the Tour at the moment , no question the other two would be conscripted into his service . If Sky 's current No. 2 were anyone but Froome , the internal rankings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thomas : Yellow Jersey does n't change situation with Froome <p> Team Sky rider Geraint Thomas played down his G.C. lead over team leader Chris Froome , after the Welshman won stage 11 of the Tour de France . <h> Do they get along ? <p> There 's been no outward hint of tension between the two riders , who were young teammates on the Barloworld squad ( 2008-09 ) and several Olympic and world championship rosters for Great Britain . Thomas has made continual reference to Froome being " the man , " a proven quantity in three-week races who has won six Grand Tours and is the current defending champion of the Tour , the Giro and the Vuelta . Froome -- who in past years has evinced almost no emotion under severe stress of various types on and off the road -- has repeatedly said it would be a good result if either man wins the Tour and their positioning puts them in a " dream situation . " <h> Who could still threaten Sky 's one-two punch ? <p> The most obvious and proven rival to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dumoulin , who currently sits 11 seconds behind Froome in third place . Dumoulin won the 2017 Giro d'Italia , is the reigning world time trial champion and is seemingly unintimidated by Sky 's dominance . Former elite ski jumper Primoz Roglic of Slovenia , who last year became the first rider from that country to win a Tour stage , is still a threat in fourth at 2:38 behind Thomas , and his LottoNL-Jumbo team has performed well for its under-the-radar leader . <p> Saturday 's individual time trial is so short ( 19 miles ) and both Thomas and Froome are strong enough in the discipline that both would-be spoilers will have to make up considerable time in the upcoming Pyrenees stages in order to be competitive . The rest of the men in the top 10 are long shots unless they -- along with Sunweb and LottoNL -- can find a way to gang up on Sky . Thomas and Froome also lost a support rider expected to help them in the mountains when Gianni Moscon was kicked out of the race for punching a French rider @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fans have heckled Chris Froome along the Tour de France race route after the Team Sky rider was cleared of doping by the International Cycling Union . AP Photo/Christophe Ena <p> Sky as a whole and Thomas and Froome specifically have faced hostility at this race , ranging from roadside and podium booing , to rude gestures , to a fan 's shove ( which Froome was able to fend off ) , to multiple reported incidents of spitting . Hazardous smoke flares set off in some crowds have been attributed to anti-Sky sentiment , but there 's no way to be certain about that . A confluence of unruly fans and a bottleneck on Alpe d'Huez caused 2014 Tour champion Vincenzo Nibali to crash , fracturing a vertebra , and his Bahrain-Merida team has threatened legal action against the Tour for failing at crowd control . <p> Past Tour crowds have sometimes impeded riders and altered results even without the kind of personal animus being expressed toward Sky . Riders have been manhandled and shot at with BB guns , and Lance Armstrong received death threats during the 2004 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ running through Sky 's brief history has caused fan negativity to spike again -- a situation that may have been exacerbated by Sky general manager Dave Brailsford , who Monday called the overt ill will " a French cultural thing , " conveniently ignoring the multicultural makeup of Tour crowds in the mountains . It was an aggressive statement -- another kind of punch thrown -- that could backfire with spectators and Tour organizers . Let 's hope it does n't lead to anything more serious than has already occurred . <h> Where will the rubber hit the road ? <p> Tuesday 's stage includes a couple of Category 1 climbs and a downhill finish . It 's suited to a breakaway winner , and the guess here is the overall contenders will mark each other 's moves and keep their powder dry for Wednesday 's short ( 40-mile ) Stage 17 that ends on one of the toughest climbs on the course . That day could make the difference , but if not , Thursday features two " beyond categorization " climbs before a downhill finish , then the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is capable of defying convention : He went on a 50-mile solo attack that cemented his Giro win in May . But that dramatic come-from-behind victory required a concerted effort from the entire team and staff , and thus far , Sky has shown no signs of consolidating its loyalties .

@@26201236 <h> NAIA closure , passenger rights , and MIAA responsibilities <h> My Cup Of Liberty <p> By Bienvenido S. Oplas , Jr . <p> On Aug. 16 , 2018 , Thursday near-midnight , a Xiamen Airlines plane skidded at the Ninoy Aquino International Airport ( NAIA ) and caused the runway closure for some 36 hours . The result was a nightmare for thousands of passengers . Many arriving flights were rerouted to Clark and Mactan-Cebu airports while passengers departing from NAIA were stranded for a day or two or even more as it was not easy to rebook a flight . <p> Among the issues and questions that came out of the incident are the following : <p> 1 . The DoTC-DTI Joint Administrative Order No. 1 , s. 2012 , " Providing for a Bill of Rights for Air Passengers and Carrier Obligations " -- does it apply to stranded passengers in this case ? <p> 2 . If not , who should shoulder at least the meals of the stranded passengers -- the passengers themselves , Xiamen Airlines , MIAA , TIEZA/DoT ? <p> 3 . This is not the first time that NAIA was closed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lessons learned ? <p> 4 . What are the impacts on the Philippine tourism sector ? <p> AFP <p> On #1 , seems that the answer is No . The cancellations and flight delays at NAIA were not caused by the other airlines , they even suffered huge losses because of extra hours , fuel and other costs associated with landing in Cebu or Pampanga , and flying out with no passengers as their passengers were trapped at NAIA . <p> Thus , those airlines may not be obliged to give free meals . Passengers who opted to cancel their delayed trips should get refunds but it takes a long time and there are standard deductions from the original ticket prices . <p> On #2 , still subject to investigation and legal debates but it seems that Xiamen Airlines and/or the Manila International Airport Authority ( MIAA ) , as well as the Tourism Infrastructure and Enterprise Zone Authority ( TIEZA ) , should have covered even the meals of the stranded passengers . <p> MIAA collects P200 per domestic passenger as airport terminal fee , and P550 per international @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the passengers especially for emergency cases like this . <p> TIEZA , an attached agency of the Department of Tourism ( DoT ) , collects travel tax of P1,620 per Filipino traveling abroad on economy or business class , and P2,700 for those on first class . TIEZA projects seem " invisible " and non-tangible for Filipino travelers , the government simply collects money from them and give the officials and personnel lots of perks and good salaries . <p> On #3 , the answer seems to be No . This is because each administration brings its own airport officials and bureaucrats , some of whom may have little skills in managing big and strategic agencies like MIAA and NAIA . <p> On #4 , the impact is obviously negative . Foreigners or returning Filipinos ( balikbayan ) with only few days of stay here have already blown off their vacation with lots of unnecessary stress and expenses . <p> Philippine tourism arrivals in 2016 were only one-half ( ? ) those in Vietnam and Indonesia and one-fourth ( 1/4 ) those in Malaysia . In tourism receipts , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Singapore and one-eighth ( 1/8 ) that of Thailand . <p> Too bad for the new DoT Secretary , this event is a sure headache in terms of missed targets . This is on top of the ugly Duterte policy of Boracay closure for six months , April 26 to October . <p> Some implications and policy adjustments for this event would be the following : <p> One , MIAA and TIEZA which are regular collectors of taxes and fees from passengers should learn to spend for the affected and often hapless passengers . <p> Two , MIAA should be considered for privatization but the private owners-operators still subject to various regulations by government agencies like the DoTr , CAB , SEC . The purpose is to strengthen professionalism and help depoliticize the management and operation of the airport , since officers are not subject to mandatory replacement every time a new administration comes to power . <p> Three , NAIA expansion to have a second or third big , wide runway for big planes , should be expedited . Or the creation of second and third international airports @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and/or Bulacan should be expedited as well . <p> Four , integrated PPP ( construction then O&amp;M to be done by the same entity ) and not hybrid PPP should be adopted in NAIA expansion and/or creation of alternative airports .

@@26217230 <h> PPP Center 's key role in infrastructure in small towns , cities <p> AS THE Philippines gears up for more investment in infrastructure , the government-run Public-Private Partnership ( PPP ) Center is extending its support from mainly advising the central government to assisting provinces , cities , and small towns across the archipelago on how to tap private capital to upgrade and modernize transportation networks and other aging infrastructure . <p> The PPP Center , housed in the Manila suburb of Quezon City , serves as the lead coordinating and monitoring body overseeing the country 's PPP program . Specifically , it helps improve government agencies ' abilities to prepare and structure projects and facilitate and monitor project implementation . The center also manages the Project Development and Monitoring Facility ( PDMF ) , which helps government agencies and local government units ( LGUs ) develop bankable PPP projects and monitor project progress . <p> The Asian Development Bank ( ADB ) has been supporting the PPP program and the PPP Center since it was set up in 2010 through a technical assistance ( TA ) . Apart from the TA , ADB 's policy-based loan , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provided comprehensive support since 2012 to three major areas in the country 's infrastructure development program , namely improving policy and legal frameworks , strengthening government commitment and support , and developing capacities of key infrastructure institutions such as the PPP Center in building a robust pipeline of projects . These reforms also included the setting up of the PDMF . <p> Banking on these initial gains , ADB 's Board of Directors approved last Friday a second EPPIP loan of $300 million to further encourage private participation in infrastructure development . <p> Over the medium term , the EPPIP will further sustain major PPP policy initiatives such as the passage of the PPP Act , currently pending in Congress , which seeks to modernize the 28-year-old Build-Operate-Transfer Law , the legal framework governing private sector participation in infrastructure development and financing . The bill will also institutionalize existing PPP best practices , simplify and clarify project development procedures , and create a risk management program , among other reforms . <p> " The last seven years of the PPP program highlighted numerous lessons in infrastructure development , financing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phases of its evolution under the current infrastructure development regime . The EPPIP has significantly supported the PPP Center and infrastructure institutions in their key objectives : policy enhancements , project pipeline development , and continuous capacity building , " said Deputy Executive Director Eleazar E. Ricote , a career official at the PPP Center . <p> The EPPIP also reinforced a new direction for the program , which is to bring down PPP options to local governments . This strategy , launched by the PPP Center in 2017 , is anchored on the local development agenda of the government of President Rodrigo R. Duterte which aims to improve infrastructure and service facilities across the country . <p> Equipped with manuals , project references , templates , and other information materials developed under EPPIP , the PPP center , along with its mother agency , the National Economic and Development Authority , has partnered with the Department of Interior and Local Government ( DILG ) to train LGUs on how to use the PPP model . The DILG , in turn , mandated LGUs to create their own local PPP @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ private sector assistance . <p> In recent months , the PPP Center has received at least four requests a week to train LGUs on how to use the PPP model , Mr. Ricote said .

" We are committed to supporting the Philippine government 's vision of connecting regions and markets , generating jobs , and spurring economic development through better infrastructure .

This program is estimated to require $168 billion in investments for high-impact priority projects nationwide , using an optimal funding mix of government spending , official development assistance , and private sector financing . <p> " The Philippine PPP program , now expanding to local and regional jurisdictions and openly enjoining private sector-initiated unsolicited proposals , will continue to be a reliable infrastructure financing and development option , as consistently advocated by government institutions such as the PPP Center and enabled by ADB 's committed support through the EPPIP , " Mr. Ricote said . <p> In total , the government has awarded about $6.2 billion to 16 national PPP projects under the PPP Center 's watch since 2010 . One of these big-ticket projects is Terminal 2 of Mactan Cebu International Airport . The facility , opened in June , nearly doubled the airport 's capacity to 8 million passengers annually from the previous 4.5 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awarded so far , involving a public market redevelopment and a slaughterhouse project .

" <p> Majority Leader Rolando Andaya Jr. , who chairs the rules committee , said the impeachment complaint would be referred to the committee on justice on Tuesday . <p> The process the ouster case against the seven justices will take will be one of the fastest , if not the fastest , in the history of the House . <p> Under the impeachment rules of the chamber , the Speaker has 10 session days to send a valid complaint to the committee on rules , which in turn is given three session days to include it in the OB so it could be transmitted to the committee on justice . All that is happening on Tuesday . <p> The committee on justice has 60 session days to dispose of a complaint and submit its report to the House . <p> Lagman 's opposition colleagues Teodoro Baguilat Jr . of Ifugao , Gary Alejano of party-list Magdalo and Tom Villarin of Akbayan joined him in filing the complaint . <p> They accused the seven justices of " culpable violation of the Constitution " and " betrayal of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that impeachment is the only mode or process of removing impeachable officials , like the chief justice , which is buttressed by the wealth of relevant jurisprudence of no less than the high court and the pertinent deliberations in the Constitutional Commission ( Con-Com ) on the same issue , " Lagman said . <h> Confusion over ' may ' <p> He said the eight justices who voted to oust Sereno misinterpreted the provision of the Constitution that provides that impeachable officers like the chief justice " may be removed through impeachment . " <p> Lagman stressed that the eight wrongly " construed the word ' may ' as suggesting the availability of other options ( of removal ) " and therefore " violated the unmistakable context and intent of the Constitution . " <p> According to members of the 1986 Con-Com that wrote the present Charter , they used the word " may " in the impeachment provision to allow for the possibility that an impeachable official may not be convicted in his Senate impeachment trial . <p> If the word " shall " were used , an impeachment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> They said the " may " should not be interpreted as providing for another means of ousting an impeachable officer , since it is clear in the Constitution that such officials could be removed only through the impeachment process . <p> Lagman said De Castro , Peralta , Bersamin , Tijam and Jardeleza " betrayed public trust by refusing to inhibit themselves in the adjudication of the Calida quo warranto petition despite their patent and continuing ill will , bias and prejudice against Sereno as shown by their respective testimonies before the House committee on justice and their statements during the oral arguments in the quo warranto case . " <p> " Unethical ulterior motives induced Justices De Castro , Peralta and Bersamin to oust Sereno . With the removal of Sereno , a vacancy was created in the position of chief justice . These justices were expected to vie for said position as in fact they are , " he said . <p> He urged the Judicial and Bar Council ( JBC ) to disqualify the four , since they are facing an impeachment case , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Under JBC rules , a nominee should not have a pending criminal or administrative case . <p> Former associate justice Samuel Martires was not included in the impeachment complaint because he has already been appointed ombudsman . <h> No more quo warranto <p> Meanwhile , Baguilat said his " primary reason " for joining the impeachment initiative against the justices is to " ensure a quo warranto is not resorted to in removing officials who clearly can only be removed legitimately through impeachment . " The seven justices , he said , " must be taken to task for ousting the former chief justice through the questionable route of quo warranto . " <p> He maintained the magistrates used the quo warranto as " legal tool to wage their personal vendetta " against Sereno . <p> " If we do n't strive to stop them now , it will happen again , " he added . <p> " Some of these honorable justices even used their esteemed positions to vent personal grudges . They admitted as much during the oral arguments for the quo warranto case . Some even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ judge of the country , despite demonstrating that they can not separate personal concerns from their judicial duties , " Baguilat pointed out . <p> For Calida , the author of the quo warranto petition that sealed Sereno 's fate , the impeachment complaint " will not see the light of day . " <p> " If the opposition legislators ' logic will be followed , then all justices , whose constitutional interpretation differ from them , can be impeached . Worst , following also this logic , justices who dissented from the majority view in constitutional cases , can also be impeached . This will reduce impeachment to a mere vengeance mechanism , far from which it is intended for , " Calida said in a statement . <p> " Thus , when justices vote on an issue like the quo warranto case based on their interpretation of the Constitution , they are merely performing their constitutional duty . And in doing so , it can not be said that they committed culpable violation of the Constitution , " he added . -- With Evelyn Macairan , Artemio Dumlao @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Kuala Lumpur to work the recent WBA welterweight title fight between defending champion Lucas Matthysse and Sen.

Scott Kelly , the former NASA astronaut who spent nearly a year in space , said in an email to The Washington Post that it " would be a dramatic shift from the rules prohibiting government officials from using their public office for private gain , " he wrote .

Duterte expressed hope the Trabaho bill can be approved before Congress 's Christmas break . <p> THE Department of Finance ( DOF ) has expressed confidence that the second package of its Comprehensive Tax Reform Program ( CTRP ) will still be passed within this year , despite senators earlier expressing concerns that the hoped-for timeline of the administration -- passage of the bill by Christmas -- may not be met . <p> " I am still confident of passage this year of the Trabaho bill , " Finance Secretary Carlos G. Dominguez III said on Thursday , when sought for comment on a BusinessMirror banner story about a bipartisan consensus emerging in the Senate for a more careful deliberation of the Tax Reform for Attracting Better and High-Quality Opportunities , as it is called in the House of Representatives . <p> The House voted 187-14 on Monday to approve the Trabaho bill on third and final reading , with three members abstaining . <p> On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ te- ? -t ? te " with Presidential Legal Counsel Salvador Panelo , expressed hope the bill can be approved before Congress 's Christmas break . <p> However , separately interviewed on Thursday , senators said they will give it ( passage by Christmas ) their best shot but added that it may be difficult to pass the tax bill before the Christmas break . <p> Several senators both from the majority and the minority told the BusinessMirror that rushing the next-round reforms , which would cut corporate income taxes and " rationalize " fiscal incentives to business , is made difficult by three factors . The first is time constraint , since the lawmakers first have to work on the 2019 General Appropriations Act , amid debates on the shift to cash-based from obligation-based budgeting , as well as the political distractions from the October deadline for filing certificates of candidacy , with several senators as reelectionists . <h> Controversial provisions <p> The second hurdle to meeting a December deadline for Trabaho bill 's passage in the Senate is the need to vet controversial provisions , especially the projected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Export industry leaders and the Joint Foreign Chambers of Commerce in the Philippines had warned that two of the biggest export revenue drawers , the electronics and semiconductors group and the business-process outsourcing ( BPO ) , could take a hit as many of them are based in economic zones . <p> Finally , a third factor is credibility , as raised by Sens . Francis Escudero and Joel Villanueva . The two said the fallout from TRAIN 1 , which took effect on January 1 , 2018 , continues to be felt as the nation reels from a 6.4 percent higher-than-expected inflation in August , partly blamed on the excise taxes imposed by that law . <p> Escudero told the BusinessMirror earlier that the " mistaken and inaccurate assumptions of the same economic managers who proposed TRAIN 1 that resulted or at the very least triggered , to a large extent , the extraordinarily high inflation we are suffering from now " give these people " a not-so-high credibility with respect to whatever guarantees or projections they may give in connection with the proposed TRAIN 2 . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on reelectionists re : their schedule and the fact that its a tax measure which might , at the very least , affect their time and enthusiasm to support the proposed measure , " he added . <p> On Thursday Senate President Vicente C. Sotto III indicated to the BusinessMirror that passage of TRAIN 2 can be facilitated , " if it is the version that we will propose . " Sources have said there are major points where the Senate and House versions diverge , as the latter underwent at least 80 changes before Monday 's third-reading vote . <p> Package 2 of the CTRP , which aims to reduce corporate income tax rates from 30 percent to 25 percent while rationalizing the country 's fiscal incentives regime , was submitted by the DOF to Congress in January this year .

Sherwin Gatchalian , said for his part -- also at the Arangkada Forum -- that his committee will work to safeguard the incentives of the electronics and semiconductors sector , as well as BPO , considering their hefty contributions to the economy . <h> GIE incentive may be kept <p> Gatchalian said he is open to retaining the 5-percent gross income earned ( GIE ) tax incentive under TRAIN 2 . <p> The Senate is considering keeping the 5-percent GIE tax incentive for certain industries depending on their cost-structure , but he said the government should not grant such tax perks for an indefinite period .

Imagine the adventures of those who had chosen to go even beyond Santiago de Compostela : the pilgrims who traveled to the ominous Coast of Death along the treacherous waters of the Atlantic Ocean ; the ones who headed to a small town called Muxia , which was closely linked to the apostle St. James ; or the people who braved the roads to Finisterre -- a place the Romans believed was the end of the earth . What possessed these early travelers to venture so far away from home , virtually into the unknown ?

For the medieval pilgrim , therefore , walking to Santiago was a ticket to heaven . Today , pilgrims walk the Way of St. James or Camino de Santiago for countless other reasons . Surrendering completely to the road , my goal simply to get to my destination before sundown , I found myself a new friend : the yellow arrow . <p> FOLLOW THE YELLOW ARROW <p> To go where the yellow arrows point to is a poignant walk through history , following in the footsteps of generations of peregrinos who paved the way for pilgrims like me . With most medieval pilgrims beginning their journey straight out of their doorsteps , the only Camino travel guide available then was a collection of manuscripts called the Codex Calixtinus . Written in the 12th century , it describes the routes to Santiago from France and what a pilgrim could expect to find along the Camino Frances . <p> Marker with yellow arrow to help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a familiar site along the Camino . <p> It also mentions the medieval practice of gathering scallop shells from the Galician coast , which have come to be known as the symbol of St. James . Wearing one signified that the bearer was a pilgrim . These shells also served the practical purpose of scooping food and water for the pilgrim . It was a precursor to the modern-day Pilgrim 's Passport , or Credencial , a document that serves as proof ( through stamps from churches , bars , and accommodations along the way ) that the bearer has walked , cycled , or ridden on horseback the minimum distance required to earn a Compostela or certificate . The Credencial , also allows one to stay in accommodations meant for pilgrims , just as the scallop shell once did . <p> FINDING MY BEARINGS <p> The walk from Sarria , where most pilgrims like myself begin the Camino , to the village of Portomarin was both exciting and unsettling . I did n't know what to expect . In fact , intent on getting to Portomarin as soon as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Even the charming bars in the tiny villages could n't tempt me .

This village welcomes pilgrims with a breathtaking view of the bridge over the River Milo , which we eventually crossed , followed by a steep climb on steps that lead to the new settlement up the hill of Monte do Cristo , which had been moved there after the original town got submerged by the river . What remains of the old town still makes a haunting appearance , though , during the summer months . Fortunately , not all was left at the mercy of the river .

But what a view I got as I reached the top of the hill of Castromaior -- an amazing canopy of clouds hanging over the town below .

I was to walk 30 kilometers from Palas de Rei to Arzlia , which I naturally assumed would be easy . I 'd walked almost 25 kilometers the day before , a lot of it uphill . So what was five more kilometers , right ? As the day progressed , I noticed the fog disappear quickly and the sun come out much earlier than in the previous days . By noontime , the heat started to beat down with a vengeance -- and just Would . Not . Stop . The reason I chose to walk in autumn in the first place was precisely to avoid the heat . Where were the woods when you needed them ?

Melide happens to be where the Camino Primitivo ( the original Camino route ) converges with the Camino Frances , bringing with it a constant influx of pilgrims from both routes . Of course , today just had to be the day when all I seemed to do was trudge uphill . Each time I thought I was finally in Arala , I was n't . Which made me wish I had broken up this leg with one night in Melide -- until I got to my accommodations for the night .

Or spend a bit more money for a room in a hotel , a casa rural , or a parador . And what of food and water ? Though fruit-bearing trees , crop farms , running bodies of water , and water fountains found along the route may have provided sustenance to early pilgrims , I instead took advantage of the food offered by the innkeepers to take with me on the road .

I refrained from wearing my earphones , for one , and trusted my instincts by waiting to walk alongside other pilgrims whenever I felt it was the smarter thing to do .

" innings , with just five home runs allowed . <p> A year ago , Marquez was primarily a fastball/curveball guy , mixing in a few changeups and mediocre sliders . His big surge has come with the refinement of the slider , which he has thrown about 15 percent of the time ( and slightly more often in the second half ) . Batters are hitting .147 against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two wipeout pitches for strikeouts . <p> When the Dodgers lost 7-2 to the Diamondbacks , the Rockies moved a half-game ahead of the Dodgers in the NL West , and they 're 1 ? ? games ahead of the Cardinals for the second wild card . The Rockies might not lose again this season , given that they have one more game against the Phillies and then three against the Nationals ( and Max Scherzer has already been scratched from a Sunday start ) . If all this feels familiar , you might recall the Rocktober run of 2007 , when the Rockies won 13 of their final 14 , won a tiebreaker game against the Padres and then swept the Division Series and NLCS -- an incredible run of 21 wins in 22 games -- before finally being swept by the Red Sox in the World Series . <p> With Marquez , Kyle Freeland ( who should finish fourth in the Cy Young voting ) and Jon Gray ( who can be as good as anybody when he 's on ) , the Rockies have a 1-2-3 top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ team in the NL .

Will it be as the surprise champs of the NL West ? <p> Brewers clinch , sweep Cardinals : The Brewers beat the Cardinals 2-1 as Jhoulys Chacin pitched five solid frames and four relievers threw the final four scoreless innings . The game will be remembered -- at least by bitter Cardinals fans -- for an epic pinch-running blunder : <p> Incredible : It looked like Cardinals pinch-runner call-up Adolis Garcia was going to score on a throw that got away -- and he lost his balance rounding third and stumbled , fell ... and was tagged out to end the bottom of the eighth .

Still , the rookie Garcia was so distraught after the loss that he turned down requests to speak to the media . <p> While MVP favorite Yelich knocked in eight runs and scored four in the series , Craig Counsell kept Matt Carpenter , the Cardinals ' best hitter , in check with some creative usage . Carpenter batted 13 times in the series , and eight of those plate appearances came against left-handers ( including one against Dan Jennings , who started Monday and faced only Carpenter before being removed ) . Carpenter did reach base five times , but he had just one hit , one RBI and one run . His teammates did n't pick him up when he did get on . <p> Cubs survive a Bartman play , win in 10 : The Cubs remained a half-game up on the Brewers with a 7-6 win over the Pirates , but that was only after they blew a 6-4 lead in the top of the ninth .

Instead , Albert Almora walked if off : <p> Cy deGrom : It 's no surprise that the Mets ' current Twitter banner is three photos of Jacob deGrom . He has earned them all . He finished a remarkable campaign with eight scoreless innings against the Braves -- all their regulars played , by the way -- with 10 strikeouts and two hits . He even finished over .500 , as his record improved to 10-9 . Most impressively , he lowered his ERA to 1.70 . As great as Max Scherzer and Aaron Nola have been , deGrom is the clear favorite for the Cy Young Award : <p> Entering 2018 : 7 instances of a pitcher with an ERA of 1.70 or lower since the Cy Young was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Only 2 of those did not win the Cy Young : - 2015 Zack Greinke , 1.66 ERA ; won by Arrieta ( 1.77 ERA ) - 1968 Luis Tiant , 1.60 ERA ; won by McLain ( 1.96 ERA ) <p> You can come up with all sorts of impressive numbers . He has held opponents to three runs or fewer in 28 straight starts -- something nobody else has ever done . As Mark Simon pointed out , the past four pitchers with ERAs as low as 1.70 and at least 269 strikeouts were Dwight Gooden in 1985 , Bob Gibson and Luis Tiant in 1968 and Walter Johnson in 1912 . DeGrom should join Gooden , R.A. Dickey and three-time winner Tom Seaver as Mets Cy Young winners . <p> So long , Bryce ? The Nationals played their final home game -- which means Bryce Harper might have played his final home game in a Nationals uniform . He received a standing ovation in his first at-bat from a pretty sparse late afternoon crowd in what was a 9-3 win over the Marlins . Harper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Victor Robles went 4-for-5 with five RBIs .

@@70092232 <p> Over the past week , President Duterte and the Armed Forces of the Philippines , with puerile collaboration by the Philippine National Police , have tried to drum up as " real " their conjured plot to oust him next month , which they tagged as " Red October . " However , they have n't presented to the public any credible evidence to back up their allegation . <p> AFP chief Gen. Carlito Galvez and his deputy chief for operations , Brig . Gen. Antonio Parlade , allege that Communist Party of the Philippines founding chair Jose Ma . Sison and the CPP central committee are " spearheading " the plot . And they try to implicate Rey Casambre and me without providing any proof whatsoever . Which , to say the least , is unfair . <p> ( Rey Casambre is the executive director of the Philippine Peace Center . He 's a political consultant to the peace panel of National Democratic Front of the Philippines in the GRP-NDFP peace talks that Duterte " terminated " in November 2017 . Upon invitation by the NDFP panel , I acted as an independent cooperator in the peace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political consultant . ) <p> There 's even confusion on the provenance of the alleged ouster plot . <p> Upon returning from his official visits to Israel and Jordan , Duterte disclosed that he had in his possession a document about the supposed ouster plan , which he said was provided by a foreign government he did n't name . But on Sept. 26 a PhilSTAR report quoted Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana as claiming the alleged plot was uncovered in February 2017 in an encounter between AFP troops and the New People 's Army in Bukidnon . <p> " It was hatched by the CPP-NPA in October 2016 , even before the President cancelled the peace talks , " Lorenzana said . " Their plan was to get as many civil organizations as possible to join their mass actions led by the progressive fronts . It is supposed to culminate this October , " he added . <p> Yet Parlade earlier ( Sept. 24 , PhilSTAR ) had insisted that the previously reported plan of a broad alliance to oust Duterte last Sept. 21 was real but unsuccessful , citing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he claimed the plan would go on next month . <p> Parlade even claimed credit for supposedly having induced the anti-Left Tindig Pilipinas ( which includes Liberal Party leaders and Sen. Antonio Trillanes and his Magdalo colleague , Rep. Gary Alejano ) to opt out of the broad alliance " on Sept. 19 or 20 . " The fact is Tindig Pilipinas , which had joined the " United People 's SONA " in July together with other groups protesting against the government on varied issues , had decided much earlier not to join the Sept. 21 United People 's Action rally in Luneta . <p> Still , some personalities that had earlier joined Tindig Pilipinas activities spoke at the Luneta rally , whose rallying cry was to oppose a looming Duterte dictatorship . They included Liberal Party internal vice president , former Rep. Lorenzo " Erin " Tanada III , and Sen. Antonio Trillanes ' lawyer , former solicitor general Florin Hilbay . Quo-warranto-ousted Supreme Court Chief Justice Ma . Lourdes Sereno , whom Tindig Pilipinas had supported , also spoke at the rally and was roundly applauded . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remark that Duterte would not last in office until the middle of 2019 , ventured a speculation . " Maybe they have moved their goals , " he conjectured , as he jeered at what he considered a " lackluster performance of their so-called massed rallies last martial law anniversary . We are closely monitoring them , including other groups . " <p> But take note of what AFP spokesperson Col. Edgard Arevalo has told the media . The information that the AFP supposedly holds regarding " Red October , " he said , would be used in presenting a draft executive order to President Duterte that would form a National Task Force to End Communist Insurgency . The proposed EO , he explained , would " integrate and harmonize all efforts of government agencies to solve the lingering issues that drive armed conflict . " <p> In this regard , AFP chief Galvez is pushing the inclusion of " parliamentary struggle " as an anti-insurgency target along with a clampdown on the growing progressive youth movement to " stop recruitment " in schools allegedly into the underground revolutionary movement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ condemned what it described as Galvez 's " chilling worldview : that no legal dissent can be allowed because this will lead to more militant struggle . " In a September 24 press statement , MAT warned the Duterte government : " Filipinos will not draw back from the challenge of tyranny . We will fight and we will overcome . " <p> The proposed executive order seeks to target , among other legitimate activities , the open mass movement and the party-list system in the electoral arena . While these same activities became targets of the brutal and bloody AFP counterinsurgency program , Oplan Bantay Laya ( versions I and II ) under the Gloria M. Arroyo regime , their targetting today are planned to be given legal authorization under the proposed executive order to be signed by President Duterte . <p> Recall that the Arroyo government repeatedly sought to prevent the progressive partylist Bayan Muna and its allied parties , Anak Pawis and Gabriela Women 's Party , from winning in the 2001 and 2004 elections .

" So if the President believes that there is a threat , he is working from good information .

@@70092233 <p> I have been using Stephen Kinzer 's book " Overthrow " as an example of how evil can masquerade as good . That truth springs from the fact that nothing in this finite world can be completely good or completely bad . <p> This wide philosophical background helps us understand what is happening to the Philippines today and why Duterte is being besieged and singled out for overthrow using organizations defending human rights . <p> Let me explain . <p> Stephen Kinzer was part of the human rights movement so what he says comes from a long experience working in it and with it . He is an award-winning foreign correspondent who has covered more than 50 countries on five continents . His articles and books have led the Washington Post to place him " among the best in popular foreign policy storytelling . " <p> " For those of us who used to consider ourselves part of the human rights movement but have lost the faith , the most intriguing piece of news in 2010 was the appointment of an eminent foreign policy mandarin , James Hoge , as board chairman of Human Rights Watch . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absolutist view of human rights permeated by modern western ideas that westerners mistakenly call ' universal . ' In some cases , their work , far from saving lives , actually causes more death , more repression , more brutality and an absolute weakening of human rights . " <p> Kinzer adds that the great a challenge is to remake the human rights movement itself . It may have been founded by idealists who wanted to make the world a better place , but it became the vanguard of a new form of imperialism . <p> " Want to depose the government of a poor country with resources ? Want to bash Muslims ? Want to build support for American military interventions around the world ? Want to undermine governments that are raising their people up from poverty because they do n't conform to the tastes of upper west side intellectuals ? Use human rights as your excuse . This has become the unspoken mantra of a movement that has lost its way . " <p> " Human Rights Watch is hardly the only offender . There are a host @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Borders to the Carr Centre for Human Rights at Harvard and the pitifully misled ' anti-genocide ' movement . All promote an absolutist view of human rights permeated by modern western ideas that westerners mistakenly call ' universal . ' In some cases , their work , far from saving lives , actually causes more death , more repression , more brutality and an absolute weakening of human rights . " <p> George Soros ' gift of $100 million went a long way for making Human Rights Watch the global standard . <p> This is how it happened : " In its early days , emerging from the human rights clauses in the 1975 Helsinki Accords , it was the receptacle of the world 's innocent but urgent goal of basic rights for all . Just as Human Rights Watch led the human rights community as it arose , it is now the poster child for a movement that has become a spear-carrier for the " exceptionalist " belief that the west has a providential right to intervene wherever in the world it wishes .

To defend the rights of those who have none was the reason I became a journalist in the first place .

" By my standards , this authoritarian regime is the best thing that has happened to Rwanda since colonialists arrived a century ago . My own experience tells me that people in Rwanda are happy with it , thrilled at their future prospects , and not angry that there is not a wide enough range of newspapers or political parties . Human Rights Watch , however , portrays the Rwandan regime as brutally oppressive .

The question should not be whether a particular leader or regime violates western-conceived standards of human rights . Instead , it should be whether a leader or regime , in totality , is making life better or worse for ordinary people . <p> When the global human rights movement emerged nearly half a century ago , no one could have imagined that it would one day be scorned as an enemy of human rights .

Getting him on the Court is critical for the Republican agenda . His will be the 6th vote that shores up a conservative majority expected to dismantle long standing liberal doctrines on abortion , same sex marriage , affirmative action , gun control . He is 53 , with the prospect of serving for life . Think Ma . Lourdes P.A. Sereno who was 50 when first appointed to the court .

We are not spared this rigmarole -- even at arguably the height of the #MeToo movement in the US -- because it may be the only chance for President Trump . If Democrats take back the House and Senate this November , there is no way he gets to appoint a replacement for this seat .

She ended up in the hot seat before a world audience . She , nonetheless , sat on it and wore her bravest face . <p> In cases of sexual abuse , we in the Philippines are peculiar for having a special rule . As these situations are almost always between the accuser and accused , classic he said , she said scenario , the credibility of the testimony becomes key .

Then spokesman Teddy Te had to rush a clarification that only the Court sitting en banc had that power . The 3rd division decision was not enough . So Maria Clara is alive and well and lives on in our Jurisprudence . <p> The US is long past the age for any such stereotyping . Prof. Ford had no such presumption in her favor .

In fact , Bowen was probably headed to Arizona until Wildcats guard Rawle Alkins decided to return for the 2017-18 season . Little had Arizona among his final five schools until former Wildcats assistant Emanuel " Book " Richardson was among the coaches arrested by the FBI in September 2017 . <p> ESPN reported in February that defendant Christian Dawkins and Arizona coach Sean Miller had discussions about a $100,000 payment to ensure that star center DeAndre Ayton , the No. 1 pick in June 's NBA draft , signed with the Wildcats . Arizona 's outside counsel , Paul Kelly of Boston , said Ayton denied receiving money to influence his decision in multiple interviews with the FBI and NCAA . <p> At the time , Miller denied the allegations -- and adamantly insisted he had never willfully broken NCAA rules . Arizona officials have denied multiple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the federal government for information and grand jury testimony related to the investigation . They repeatedly cited " the balancing test established by the Arizona courts to protect the best interests of the state . " <p> Creighton also recruited Bowen -- he made two visits to the Omaha , Nebraska , campus -- and Bluejays assistant Preston Murphy grew up with Dawkins in Saginaw , Michigan . Bowen also strongly considered DePaul , which hired two assistant coaches with strong ties to him : Shane Heirman , Bowen 's coach at La Lumiere School in LaPorte , Indiana , and Tim Anderson , who coached Bowen in the Nike-affiliated Mean Streets program in Chicago . <p> In court documents filed last month in former Louisville coach Rick Pitino 's lawsuit against the university , the school 's attorneys alleged that Pitino ignored red flags after hearing allegations that DePaul had offered Bowen $200,000 to play there . The court filing included a text message that Pitino is said to have sent to then-Cardinals assistant Kenny Johnson on June 2 , 2017 , saying : " Coach DePaul trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world ! " <p> After the court filing was released , Pitino said he never believed DePaul had the financial means to pay Bowen that much money , and DePaul officials told ESPN that the school had n't been contacted by the NCAA or federal prosecutors . <p> Michigan State also recruited Bowen , and Spartans coach Tom Izzo has been a longtime friend of Dawkins ' family . Jason Richardson , the nephew of Bowen 's father , also played for the Spartans from 1999 to 2001 . <p> LSU recruited Little and Koprivica , who might decide to skip college altogether , sources told ESPN . Tigers coach Will Wade signed the No. 5 class in the country this past year , including four players in the ESPN Top 100 . In response to an open-records request from ESPN , LSU officials said no calls were found in records for Wade 's university-issued cell phone to two cell phone numbers registered to Dawkins . <p> THIS IS ONLY the beginning . The scandal could grow even more after the current trial of Adidas executive James Gatto , Adidas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pay high school prospects and/or their families to sign with Adidas-sponsored schools . Another five defendants await prosecution . <p> Former Auburn assistant Chuck Person and onetime NBA referee Rashan Michel are scheduled for trial in New York on Feb. 4 . Person is accused of accepting $91,500 over 10 months to steer Auburn players to certain financial advisers . <p> People involved in the current case believe there might be another superseding indictment coming from the government in the Evans case that could add criminal charges related to the pay-for-play schemes at other schools . <p> It 's not yet clear how the NCAA will react toward any schools that get sucked into the scandal , but action seems likely at some point . <p> Multiple people involved in the federal investigation have told ESPN in recent months that the FBI advised NCAA officials to stand down until the criminal trials are over . <p> Yahoo reported in February that NCAA officials were taking a closer look at LSU 's recruiting practices ; the school and NCAA denied the report . When Kansas officials self-reported details of freshman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him while it looked into the " financial picture " of the car -- to NCAA officials in November , there was n't much the NCAA could do because the FBI was also investigating alleged payments from Adidas to Preston 's mother . <p> The government contends the defendants and others purposely concealed illicit payments from coaches and university officials , so it 's difficult to say how schools such as Kansas and Maryland will be impacted . Miami 's coaches contend they were unaware of a pay-for-play scheme involving Little , and attorneys involved in the case told ESPN that the Hurricanes are probably in the clear . <p> There is evidence , however , that assistant coaches at Louisville and NC State might have been involved in the facilitation of impermissible payments , which might open those schools to NCAA punishment . In March , Cal State Northridge hired Mark Gottfried , who was NC State 's coach when Dennis Smith Jr. , whose father is said to have received $40,000 , played there . <p> De Sousa , meanwhile , was expected to sign with Maryland before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the school received a federal subpoena requesting information about his recruitment . Fenny Falmagne , De Sousa 's legal guardian , has denied receiving money . Falmagne is also the guardian of Bruno Fernando , another player from Angola , who played for the Terps last season . <p> On Aug. 9 , the NCAA adopted a sweeping series of policy and rules changes that it hopes will clean up college basketball , based on a series of recommendations from a committee led by former U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice . One change that took effect immediately was allowing people investigating NCAA cases to accept information established by another administrative body , including a court of law , government agency , accrediting body or a commission authorized by a school . For example , the NCAA could accept evidence and findings from the federal government 's investigation and punish those found guilty of wrongdoing -- without conducting its own investigation . <p> GOVERNMENT PROSECUTORS ARE taking some action to limit schools ' exposure in this trial . <p> They have asked U.S. District Judge Lewis A. Kaplan to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ schools ' past infractions , including the stripper parties that occurred inside Louisville 's athletics dormitory and the actions of Ponzi schemer Nevin Shapiro , who alleged he provided impermissible benefits to more than 70 Miami student-athletes between 2002 and 2010 . <p> In its motion , the government argued that " none of the above-described major NCAA rules violations have any bearing on the specific facts of this case . Nor do they serve to negate any element of the offenses charged because none indicate that the universities encouraged , tolerated , or expected the sort of false and fraudulent representations made here . " <p> Additionally , the federal government wants to prohibit defense attorneys from discussing cases that involve non-victim schools . For example , the government might not want defense attorneys talking about how former USC basketball star O.J.

Augustin and Jerian Grant . /Tugs collar <p> Steve Clifford is a smart coach , but his Charlotte teams were ( effectively ) boring : get back on defense , do n't dare crash the offensive glass , play low-risk offense . I 'm interested to see how he adapts to this strange personnel . <p> Random : I like watching Wesley Iwundu . He moves like an NBA player . David Steele and Jeff Turner are a top-five announcing duo . And these ? <p> These rule , forever . <h> 26 . MEMPHIS GRIZZLIES ( 21 ) <p> This hurts . No big-small duo brings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Conley . Big Spain even whipped out a finger roll last season ! <p> And this one-handed flick , where he holds the ball above his head like a taunting older sibling , is one of the league 's meanest and most beautiful shots : <p> But those three wings might be overstretched on offense . The algorithm factors in continued decline for Memphis ' tentpole stars . Last season , the Grizz played at a crawl and fouled the bejesus out of everyone . The infusion of veterans should mitigate the hacking , but this team is a slog on bad nights . <p> A bright spot : The Grizzlies ' artistic overhaul proves you can make a splash without veering into garishness . <p> Count me in on this court , which is radical in design without registering as such : <p> NBA <p> I love the multicolored wood running from sideline to sideline -- perpendicular to the flow of the game . The bold navy stripe creates an asymmetry that extends to the baseline wordmarks -- very unusual . That one-sided striping is repeated on two of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flowing through one side of Memphis . The jerseys are filled with goodies . Two favorites : this stylized " MEM " mark that appears on all three belt buckles : <p> And the use of a curved wordmark on these fantastic Beale Street Blue duds -- as opposed to the straight-line wordmark on the other two : <p> Also : The great Ralph Lawler , on a farewell tour with a rotating cast of analysts after the Clippers canned Bruce Bowen for daring express an opinion counter to organizational interests . ( Score another for fascist TV homerism . ) <p> One of my favorite Lawlerisms : How he refers to viewers as " gang . " As in , " Buckle up for the stretch run , gang ! " It feels like Lawler is addressing us personally -- like we are all sharing this experience . Also , I think it 's something old people say . My dad has always used " gang " like this . Hearing it makes me happy . <p> Without Blake Griffin -- and with Teodosic sure to miss a bunch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get others involved . The absence of DeAndre Jordan hurts in this regard , too ; his rim-runs draw tons of attention , unlocking passing lanes . <p> Lob City might become Layup City , and that 's no fun ; Jordan and Griffin accounted for almost half of LA 's dunks last season . The knockoff art is Fudd Beer-level chintzy across the board . This may be the worst jersey front in the league : <h> 24 . DETROIT PISTONS ( 22.5 ) <p> Watching Griffin and Andre Drummond develop high-low chemistry will be fun ; Griffin enjoyed rampaging coast-to-coast and finding Drummond for alley-oops . Detroit outscored opponents with Griffin and Drummond on the floor , but that number flips into the negative when you eliminate their first four games together -- all at home , against teams on the second end of back-to-backs . In fairness , the Griffin-Drummond duo logged only 44 minutes with Reggie Jackson . <p> But the Griffin who disintegrated fools is gone . He ranked 87th in dunks per 100 possessions last season , per Second Spectrum . Jackson is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Griffin 's mastery facilitating from the elbow cannibalized Drummond 's emerging passing game . Small-ball lineups with Griffin at center have entertainment potential , though I 'd expect Dwane Casey to rely some on Zaza Pachulia 's sharp elbows . ( Pachulia is the league 's loudest and most ridiculous groaner upon contact near rim microphones . Once you hear it , you ca n't unhear it . ) <p> The battle for wing minutes will evolve night-to-night . Casey looks like an aerobics instructor jumping and clapping at opposing shooters , tie flapping in the wind . Art and commentary are all first class . <h> 23 . PHOENIX SUNS ( 22.5 ) <p> This feels low , but bad basketball grows tiresome . A late tankathon between last season 's Suns and Grizzlies -- two of the league 's half-dozen fouliest teams -- was the worst NBA game I 've watched in at least five years . <p> But Devin Booker and Deandre Ayton running spread pick-and-roll in an Igor Kokoskov-designed system makes for at least 20 interesting possessions every night . Josh Jackson flings himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gear when they see a chance to go one-on-three in transition . <p> You have to admire the year-by-year consistency of T.J. Warren 's assists-per-36-minutes : 1.5 , 1.5 , 1.4 , 1.3 . It is hard to have the ball so much , and shoot so often , while recording so few assists . <h> 22 . NEW YORK KNICKS ( 23.5 ) <p> The Mike Breen-Clyde Frazier boost is powerful . New York games just look and sound better than anything else on League Pass . That said , it 's time to spice up the Knicks art . The logo is stale . The new alternate jerseys have been timid . <p> The on-court product will be very bad with a unicorn-shaped hole at power forward , but the backcourt situation is worth monitoring . The Knicks seemed to discover Frank Ntilikina works better as a hybrid guard instead of lead playmaker . He can hang on the wing while Trey Burke and a trimmed-down Emmanuel Mudiay run the show , and attack scrambling defenses off the catch . Whatever time Ntilikina spends at point guard -- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in those situations . He is already a ferocious , in-your-jersey defender across two and sometimes three positions . <p> Only the Wolves jacked fewer 3s than New York last season . Expect David Fizdale and his immaculate beard to have these guys running and launching . ( Better NBA glasses : Fizdale or Sam Presti ? ) New York has something of a perimeter logjam , so let 's get crazy and slide Mario Hezonja to power forward in small-ball lineups . Hezonja provides the very best kinds of bloopers . He flies too close to the sun : <p> I think Frank Vogel just felt a shiver run down his spine . <p> I have n't given up on Noah Vonleh . Unfortunately , we can not factor Ron Baker 's contract into the comedy category . <h> 21 . BROOKLYN NETS ( 24 ) <p> The Nets play a pleasing style -- turbo pace , tons of 3s -- but a bunch of superior teams do that , too . Who beyond the legend Ian Eagle and Sarah Kustok is making you stick around in case of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because Allen has zero fear of getting dunked on . Giannis Antetokounmpo pulverized Allen with three of the best dunks of the entire 2017-18 season , and Allen just kept on coming . He eventually pinned Antetokounmpo at the summit . Allen dunks hard , too , and he 's so tall he sometimes literally throws the ball down onto an opponent 's head . <p> Caris LeVert has some nasty shimmy to his game . Rondae Hollis-Jefferson 's herky-jerky dribbles and tilting floaters flummox even savvy defenders . D'Angelo Russell has been more style than substance , and empty style wears thin . This will be a huge season for Russell , and he knows it . Ditto for Spencer Dinwiddie , whose shooting cratered after everyone stopped paying attention . The Nets are one quality shot creator away from butting into the pathetic race for the No. 8 seed in the Eastern Conference . <p> Their minimalist black-and-white look works , but seven seasons into the Brooklyn era , we 're still waiting for our first killer jersey . <h> 20 . CHARLOTTE HORNETS ( 25 ) <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same number of games every season playing the same style with the same people . Credit Kemba Walker , the league 's most underrated showman . Walker 's dribble is magic . He has every move , and he strings them together like a boxer pummeling some dazed , flat-footed opponent with four-punch flurries . The moves flow so smoothly , you barely register how many mean things Walker pulls in a two-second span . <p> He turns entire defenses inside out . I mean , look at this : <p> This team has always been sneaky fun -- and good -- with Cody Zeller at center . Dwight Howard 's interminable , zombie-stiff post-ups are gone . It was painful watching Howard stumble ; he led all rotation players in travels per game , according to NBA Miner . <p> James Borrego wants more pace and spacing . He started Jeremy Lamb in place of Michael Kidd-Gilchrist in the first preseason game , and he 'll likely use MKG almost exclusively as an ultra-switchable small-ball power forward . Stick him in lineups with Frank Kaminsky as a stretchy center @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ screen-and-dive guy . Kaminsky as backup center also means less of Bismack Biyombo fumbling passes ( but also , sadly , less of Willy Hernangomez 's crafty game ) . Malik Monk is going to be fuuuuuunnnn . <p> For 30 years , the Hornets have somehow been able to clutter their art with ridiculous design elements and still have it look awesome . When other teams imitate them , it fails horribly . I do n't get it . Is teal just unassailable ? <p> The broadcast needs to dial back the Orwellian optimism . For the love of Muggsy Bogues , stop calling Kemba " the Captain " ! <h> 19 . INDIANA PACERS ( 25 ) <p> Perhaps the algorithm ca n't quantify effort . This was the league 's hardest-playing group , and they do n't seem the type of surprise team that lets up in the year after The Year . <p> Victor Oladipo existed in a permanent state of hunched fury , accelerating toward help defenders with a violence that unnerved them . <p> That toughness is part of what made their retrograde shot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hunting mismatches , even if it took a few swing passes : <p> That predatory approach will come in handy when they play Domantas Sabonis and Myles Turner together . Defenders have never figured out Thaddeus Young 's arrhythmic hooks and flippy shots . ( Love is still recovering from the beating Young inflicted in that epic first-round series . ) Indy signed more capable release valves should teams swarm Oladipo the way the Cavs did in the playoffs . <p> It will be fun watching Nate McMillan toggle through lineup options -- big , ultra-big , small and shooting-heavy , even groups with no nominal point guard . Kyle O'Quinn is always sprinkling in pieces of flair : <p> The Pacers deserved better . What can I say ? The NBA is really watchable , and on bricky nights , Indy 's effort comes across as more exhausting than invigorating . Indiana played in molasses after a super-fast start . There is nothing funny about them . They do n't have highlight producers beyond Oladipo , and he averaged a hair below one dunk per game . <p> Quinn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time he circles a player , the guy is long gone . <h> 18 . SAN ANTONIO SPURS ( 26 ) <p> Manu Ginobili 's retirement dropped them at least two spots . I 'll miss Slow-Mo Anderson , loping with a slowness so extreme , it actually worked as a trick . Defenders would slide to the place they expected Anderson to be , only to discover he was still on his way . When Anderson arrived , those defenders were off-kilter . Anderson weaponized slowness . <p> Curiosity about this team -- how DeMar DeRozan and LaMarcus Aldridge share space , whether Gregg Popovich prefers big or small lineups -- will gave way to the realization that they play sludgy ball . Sophisticated , but sludgy . They posted up more than anyone last season , per Second Spectrum , and that only generates must-watch entertainment three or four nights per season when Aldridge cooks a long run of step-back jumpers . <p> DeRozan can do that , too , and he 's good for a few hammer dunks . ( Thank the basketball gods . San Antonio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mills is the league 's most caffeinated player . Dejounte Murray has four arms . Pau Gasol has ably carried on Tim Duncan 's tradition of making ridiculous shocked faces after every foul . <p> The broadcast is must-mute unless you want Spurs Pravda . I like the silver-and-black palette , but it 's time to add a dash of spice . ( It 's not coming this season . ) Let 's push for a return of the fiesta colors in 2019-20. <h> 17 . DALLAS MAVERICKS ( 27.5 ) <p> I have to get this out : The rim microphones are too loud . I did not think this was possible . We all love to feel closer to the game . But I do not need to hear Salah Mejri moaning at this level of volume and clarity . <p> Even when they 're bad and kinda losing on purpose , the Mavs put forth a professional effort dotted with quirky game-to-game adjustments non-warlock coaches could n't conceive . Rick Carlisle tries every goofy zone . Toward the end of last season , he started posting up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) <p> The Mavs run a creative half-court offense , take care of the ball , and avoid fouling -- key for a pleasant viewing experience . And there is Dirk , always Dirk , lofting one-leggers so buttery , the ball seems to melt into the backboard and drip down . I do n't care if he can barely move . I do n't care if he goes entire weeks without hunkering down on the left block . I do n't care if all he does is trail the offense , catch at the top of the arc , bend so deep his ass damn near touches the floor , and fling up the prettiest straight-on 3s in league history . I want to watch every Dirk shot . <p> And now : LUKAAAAAAAAAA ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! Luka freaking Doncic -- MVP of the world 's second-best league , perhaps the greatest international prospect in history -- is about to run spread pick-and-roll with DeAndre Jordan and three shooters surrounding them . Oh , baby . What if Smith becomes ornery off the ball @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it will be fun to watch . ( A hybrid role is absolutely Smith 's best shot at hitting his NBA ceiling . ) <p> J.J. Barea is floptastic and fearless , and he and Nowitzki have maybe the most nuanced two-man chemistry in the league . They communicate in flinches and winks . They could get buckets into their 50s -- in the NBA . <p> It 's long past time the Mavericks burn all their art . All of it . It is dull and bad . <h> 16 . MINNESOTA TIMBERWOLVES <p> Umm ... TBD ? <p> This team 's brutish offense was effective -- Minny ranked fourth in points per possession -- but it made for an unattractive watch . <p> One solution regardless of how the Jimmy Butler fiasco ends , and whether Tom Thibodeau survives : Let your best offensive player shoot more . Karl-Anthony Towns ranking fifth in usage rate on his own team was among the league 's most preposterous stats last season . Dude is sniffing 55-40-90 territory and has to watch Andrew Wiggins brick 20-footers . Towns is an elite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not an exaggeration to say he could end his career as the most versatile scoring big in NBA history . <p> And just when you think he 's kinda slow , or that he moves with a strange leadenness , Towns will jet from the top of the arc to the rim so fast , it almost appears he 's gliding .

Luong Xuan Truong : Van Tu is slightly different in style to Xuan Truong , who is less energetic and direct but can dictate proceedings with his passing and vision . <p> Nonetheless , the way Van Tu showed the most urgency in getting his side on the front foot suggests that he has what it takes to fulfil the midfield lynchpin role . <p> 6 .

This file photo taken on June 17 , 2014 shows Amazon founder and CEO Jeff Bezos presenting the company 's first smartphone , the Fire Phone , in Seattle , Washington . Photo by David Ryder/AFP <p> WASHINGTON , DC , USA -- Online retail giant Amazon announced on Tuesday , October 2 , it would raise its starting wage for US workers to $15 an hour , amid long-standing criticism of low pay , and would advocate for a higher minimum wage nationwide . <p> The pay raise will apply to 250,000 employees starting November 1 and to the more than 100,000 seasonal workers the company expects to hire for the holiday shopping season , it said . <p> Amazon founder and CEO Jeff Bezos said the company -- valued at nearly $1 trillion -- was heeding complaints about its pay structure . <p> " We listened to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do , and decided we want to lead , " Bezos , the world 's richest man , said in a statement . <p> Amazon is encouraging other large US employers to follow its lead and said it would lobby lawmakers for an increase in the federal minimum wage , currently at only $7.25 . <p> But the company did not say it would push for a US minimum wage of $15 per hour , a long-sought goal of worker advocates .

Self-driving companies are well aware of the problem , but there 's not much they can do at this point . Tweaking the algorithms to produce a smoother ride would compromise safety , undercutting one of the most-often heralded justifications for the technology . <p> It was just this kind of tuning to minimize excessive braking that led to a fatal crash involving an Uber Technologies Inc. autonomous vehicle in March , according to federal investigators . The company has yet to resume public testing of self-driving cars since shutting down operations in Arizona following the crash . <p> If driverless cars ca n't be safely programmed to mimic risk-taking human drivers , perhaps they can be taught to better understand the way humans act .

' s driverless unit racing to deploy a ride-hailing business in 2019 , the shortcomings of robot cars interacting with humans are coming under increased scrutiny . Some experts have advocated for education campaigns to train pedestrians to be more mindful of autonomous vehicles . Startups and global automakers are busy testing external display screens to telegraph the intent of a robotic car to bystanders . <p> But no one believes that will be enough to make autonomous cars move seamlessly among human drivers . For that , the car needs to be able to decipher intent by reading body language and understanding social norms . Perceptive Automata is trying to teach machines to predict human behavior by modeling how humans do it . <p> Sam Anthony , chief technology officer at Perceptive and a former hacker with a PhD in cognition and brain behavior from Harvard , developed a way to take image recognition tests used in psychology and use them to train so-called neural networks , a kind of machine learning based loosely on how the human brain works .

But the trouble is the usual confusion for those who have identified certain candidates with particular political parties and those they are allied with . The colors red , blue , orange and yellow have not emerged but a combination of everything and everyone -- the usual list as they say . <p> This glaring phenomenon of political turncoatism has been a traditional hallmark for Philippine politics and governance . Once enemies , now friends . Once a family , now rabid competitors for power . This pattern of electoral behavior has been lingering for decades -- from the American era up to the present . The switching from one political party to another , depending on who seats in the Palace , has been a legendary tale of old . <p> While numerous efforts have been exerted by well-meaning academics , NGOs , political strategists and even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of party-switching , the malaise remains . Because our voters are used to popularity-driven , personality and patronage-based politics , the culture of our political parties continues to further engender and perpetuate the same . <p> With no ideology , concrete action plan nor basic principles , these parties simply recruit those who they believe " will be winnable . " Worse , there is no clear coordination and cooperation between national and local-level supporters . Horse-trading is not frowned upon but encouraged under the mantle of " practical tactics . " Because of a sheer lack of an organizational framework , rules on recruitment of party members , paucity of mechanisms for dismissal or discipline and accountability for party assets and funds , there is no group or entity , at present , which can claim to be an honest-to-goodness , genuine political party . <p> What we have are " momentary " coalitions that serve only for the purpose of installing one or two stellar candidates in public office . Even the party-list system , which was envisioned to espouse particular causes and advocacies , has failed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the traditional politicos . Anyway , winning seems to be the ultimate goal . Or perhaps , the only goal . <p> This reality has been recognized by some proposed bills in the old and new congresses . But nothing spectacular has moved so far . So refreshing is the news that the Consultative Committee which drafted the new Federal Constitution included a new provision that prohibits turncoatism . The latest version was finalized on May 2 , 2018 . The suggested changes include prohibitions for candidates and party officials from shifting parties two years before and two years after an election and for members of a political party elected to public office from changing parties during their term . Violations will lead to cancellation of the parties ' registration and the violators shall lose the post to which they have been elected , can not be appointed and barred from running again in the succeeding elections , among others .

The results of next year 's elections will either complete the destruction of the system of checks and balances on which it has been focused since day one of the six-year term it wants to extend beyond 2022 , or strengthen opposition forces and influence in government enough to prevent the further abuse of executive power . <p> The first result would be another nail on the coffin of the protracted democratization process that began with the Revolution of 1896 .

But that has not happened , among other reasons , because the Duterte regime has so debased public discourse that its profanity , simple-minded solutions to complex problems , lawlessness and violence , non-accountability , and the demonization and dismissal of critical thought have dumbed down rather than enlightened what would otherwise have been the informed citizenry needed for the survival and development of any nation . <p> In keeping with its primitive concept of governance in which power has no purpose other than itself , the Duterte regime is fielding , and has encouraged , candidates whose election to the Senate is unlikely to raise the already basement-level quality of congressional deliberations .

One of his most violent advocacies is the total extermination of the entire Muslim community . In the aptly named Lower House , among the party-list candidates is one of the country 's leading purveyors of false information ( " fake news " ) online who has done more harm to the rational discussion of public issues than a roomful of cheap lawyers . <p> The continuing threat of despotic rule , the ongoing ruin of the system of checks and balances -- and , overall , the urgent need for a semblance of intelligence in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who are committed to the defense of human rights , the rule of law , and the people 's welfare to declare their own candidacies .

The unchallenged assumption is that the ultimate expression of the rule of the people -- their supposed capacity to decide upon whom they have chosen to delegate their sovereign powers -- is every three years revalidated through " fair " and " generally peaceful " elections in which " only " a few dozen people are killed . <p> The reality is far from the ideal .

Democracy after all means the rule of the majority , while the word " elite " refers to the handful of men and women whose special attributes -- whether in skills , knowledge , or , in the Philippine case , in wealth and power -- make them dominant within a particular population . <p> Despite the seeming contradiction , however , the phrase aptly describes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1946 to 1972 and from 1986 to the present : it is the rule of the few rather than of the many . <p> As challenging as an election is to those aspirants for public office who do have a vision of an alternative state and society , it should nevertheless be an opportunity to enlighten citizens on their responsibilities , the governance issues that should concern them most , and the need to look beyond the dynasties for solutions . <p> Elections should also broaden the involvement of the citizenry in their own governance so as to change the rule of the political elite into the rule of the majority by putting in office those individuals who can truly represent them and fight for their rights and interests . But as limited as it already is , even Philippine elite democracy has been severely damaged over the last two years by a thoroughly reactionary regime focused on its total destruction through the elimination of all opposition .

@@70175240 <p> DETROIT -- One of the biggest criticisms of Detroit Lions general manager Bob Quinn during the past two offseasons was his inability to adequately address the team 's issues along the defensive line . The Lions struggled to get to the quarterback . Stopping the run was an adventure . <p> In trading a fifth-round pick to the Giants for Damon " Snacks " Harrison , Quinn not only shored up Detroit 's defensive line with one of the best run-stoppers in the league , he also proved that the Lions believe they have a window to win . Now . <p> Harrison , who turns 30 in November , is a dominating presence in the middle of Detroit 's defense . At 355 pounds , he 's the big , space-eating nose tackle the Lions just have n't had . They hoped Sylvester Williams could be that player , but he has n't reached the level of Harrison , a 2016 first-team All-Pro who can force double teams to take place in the middle . It could give Detroit a presence reminiscent of what head coach Matt Patricia had in New England , when his best defenses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line , controlling what went on up front . He lacked that player in Detroit , but not anymore . <p> It 's almost a better version of what the Lions had in Haloti Ngata , who missed half of last season due to injury before leaving for Philadelphia in the offseason . And when the Lions failed to really replace Ngata , that left a massive hole . In trading for Harrison , Detroit has filled it . <p> The Lions ' run defense gets an upgrade with the acquisition of Damon Harrison , one of the best run-stoppers in the NFL . Brad Penner/USA TODAY Sports <p> They 've done it for now , with an option for more later . Harrison is under contract until 2020 , with cap hits of $7 million in 2019 and $9.25 million in 2020 . The Lions can afford that because they had significant cap room heading into the next two seasons . But with none of the money guaranteed , they are locked into nothing after this season . That means they can turn Harrison into a half-year rental or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , paired with young players like Da'Shawn Hand and his former-and-once-again teammates , Romeo Okwara and Devon Kennard . <p> Having Harrison in the middle should also improve Detroit 's pass rush , even if he is not a significant pass-rusher himself . The attention that he will command in the middle will keep offenses from being able to focus too much on Kennard , Eli Harold , Okwara and , when he returns , Ezekiel Ansah . So that could give those players more one-on-one matchups that could lead to quarterback pressure . <p> This move also did something else . It showed that the Lions , at 3-3 , clearly believe they have a team that can win -- and win this year . That should n't be shocking considering Detroit fired Jim Caldwell last year after back-to-back 9-7 seasons , with Quinn saying at the time he felt his team was better than its record . <p> He hired his friend Patricia to make Detroit better . After a rough start , the Lions have shown some promise over the past month , winning three of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Detroit 's biggest problem . And one Quinn needed to address if the Lions had any realistic hope of winning the NFC North this year . <p> The Lions had to . Being No. 30 in the league in rushing yards allowed per game ( 139.3 ) and last in yards per rush allowed ( 5.32 ) was going to be a problem , especially as the weather got colder and the Lions hit a string of talented teams in the last two months of the season . It was clearly going to be one of the issues that held them back , as they had allowed 89 yards rushing or more to every opponent this season ( and 105 yards or more in four of six games ) . <p> That was n't going to cut it the rest of the way , and the easiest way to fix it was to find someone to send them the run-stopper they could n't find anywhere else . <p> The Giants did -- and Detroit just became a team to be a little more concerned about in the NFC North .

That guise is further complemented by the 16-inch multi-spoke alloy wheels wrapped in 185/55 series rubbers . More so , we like those optional black with red accent sticker trims which gave the car some added touch to the already unmistakable European-inspired persona . In fact , it made the test unit more indicative to the well-known English-made small car . <p> The cabin , meantime , also received major enhancements . Let alone the new dashboard layout now made more ergonomic with controls clustered within reach . We like the new D-shaped steering wheel upgrade as it matches the sporty dark themed interior . It also has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fabric-draped and snug front seats have bolsters similarly shaped like typical sports car seats . It also has a manual vertical adjuster to further aid you in finding that ideal driving position . We also like the minimal amount of white trims inside for that needed highlight . <p> For a base variant , the seven-inch , touch-operated infotainment is absolutely a steal . While it 's about an inch smaller compared to that of the top spec 's , still it is about the same compared to other top end models out there . It may not have the usual smartphone operating systems , but still , it has connectivity functions for telephony , Bluetooth , USB , and is equipped with offline navigation system . There 's also storage pockets everywhere for cups , bottles and other stuff . Best part is , the 60:40 rear seats , once folded , can further increase the cargo space . <p> Motivation comes from the same K-series 1.2-liter , four-cylinder with VVT mill from its subcompact sibling Dzire . Despite the smaller displacement , this new engine loves to rev @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Its torque registry becomes more aggressive toward the midrange . This is where you 'll appreciate the vehicle 's small and light yet rigid frame . What 's more fun was operating the coupled five-speed manual gearbox with short shifting-like characteristic . Clutch operation was easy and has a good friction point on gradual release as well . <p> When it comes to the vehicle 's road manner , the overall ride quality was generally composed . The only rebounds felt were from road imperfections , but were still tolerable despite the lower series tires and low ground clearance . But the lower stance and equal tire tread measurements provided an impressive nimble feel as body rolls were close to none . That slight damping rigidity also aided in demonstrating superb handling and control on turns . But everything else turned out smooth and steady on highways . Another plus factor was how the shorter wheelbase , along with the small frame , made maneuvering through tight roads and crowded traffic situations a walk in the park . Steering was also soft and responsive with nice and steady stiffness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , this GL grade shares almost all the features across the board leaving only both the parking sensor and reverse camera exclusive to the GLX variant . These are dual SRS airbags , pedal release system , Isofix for child seat , side-impact door beams , antilock brake system with electronic brake distribution , and brake assist function , among others . Just like the all-new Vitara , even pedestrians are protected with the front end 's impact-absorbing structures with mitigating effects . <p> Not all base variants have a lot of elements to sacrifice in favor of affordability . Because in the case of the all-new Swift GL , the only missing elements are the embellishments and certain features you can surely live without . In fact , with its head-turning look , not to mention the catchy optional sticker trims installed and engaging driving dynamics , this particular variant will change the way you look at Suzuki base models . <h> Today 's paper <h> Today 's weather <h> A year ago today <h> Two years ago today <h> BM Social Media Presents <h> Archives <p> Archives <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look at the nation 's business in these challenging times .

@@70185238 <h> The ' right ' formula <h> From drilling for oil to the nuclear option , DOE pursues multipronged approach to energy security <p> THE Philippines is a net importer of oil products . This means that the country 's fuel supply is generally sourced from abroad , making the country vulnerable to changes , or price fluctuations , in international oil-price markets . <p> In view of the country 's heavy reliance on imported fuel , industry stakeholders are calling for more oil and gas exploration in the country . <p> The nine consecutive weeks of oil-price increases from August 14 to October 9 -- a total of P5.85 per liter for diesel , P5.05 per liter for gasoline and P4.65 per liter for kerosene -- had made it more pressing for the government to exhaust all options to mitigate rising fuel prices and taxes . <h> ' Drill , drill , drill ' <p> One proposal strongly urges the Duterte administration to be more aggressive in its pursuit of energy self-sufficiency by launching a " Drill , Drill , Drill " program to explore and develop the country 's untapped oil and natural gas resources . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Senate Committee on Energy , made the call amid the latest round of global oil-price hikes , which , he said , is one of the primary drivers of the rising inflation rate that hit a nine-year high again in September at 6.7 percent . <p> " The Philippines is blessed with rich natural resources throughout its exclusive economic zone and extended continental shelf , including natural gas and oil . Unfortunately , we have been unable to tap the full potential of these energy resources . Because of this , we have no choice but to import crude oil from oil-exporting countries , even if the price has become unconscionably high , " the lawmaker said . <p> Based on records , the Philippines has been importing 94 percent of its oil requirements , with the total import bill jumping to $9.89 billion in 2017 , or a 31.2-percent increase from the $7.54-billion import bill in 2016 . <p> And yet , the country potentially has 3.5 billion barrels of oil deposits and 24.7 trillion cubic feet of gas deposits that are considered undiscovered . The Department of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ million barrels of oil and 3.8 trillion cubic feet of gas had been discovered since 2016 . <p> Despite these vast reserves of untapped resources , the Philippines only has six producing service contracts , three of which are nearing depletion . <p> " It is high time for the government to launch a Drill , Drill , Drill program , which will use these untapped oil and gas resources to pursue Philippine energy independence and pave the way for the country to become an energy-exporting powerhouse , " Gatchalian said . <p> Consumer group advocate Laban Konsyumer Inc. said that the proposed Drill , Drill , Drill program of Gatchalian is " a good program , " albeit , " it could take years to see the results . " <p> " A seismic study takes about two to three years . That is why the contract spans about seven years . Exploration is a good program but it 's long term . Besides , investors are worried about political instability , particularly in this sector . " <h> ' Challenges ' <p> However , the lawmaker noted that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and economic policies have discouraged foreign players from conducting petroleum exploration in the Philippines . <p> These include the Commission on Audit 's ( COA ) ruling on the Malampaya gas-to-power project 's income tax , the Supreme Court ruling on the validity of service contracts signed by the DOE secretary , and the looming passage of the Tax Reform for Acceleration and Inclusion law ( TRAIN Phase 2 ) , or the Trabaho bill . <p> " Investors , particularly major foreign oil and gas companies , are looking for more certainty and stability before buying into the Philippine energy sector . The government needs to address these problem areas in order for the Drill , Drill , Drill program to move forward , " he said . <p> The COA had overruled the Malampaya consortium 's petition that income tax was already included in the government 's 60 percent share in the Malampaya royalties . The consortium argued that the tax was deductible from the government 's share of the Malampaya earnings . <p> However , the COA said there is no provision in the law stating that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ share of the government , the resolution of which is pending with the SC . <p> TRAIN 2 , or the second package of the tax-reform program , meanwhile , seeks to reduce tax perks such as tax-free importation of equipment and supplies , and exemption from all taxes except income tax , among others . <p> Petroleum Association of the Philippines ( PAP ) Chairman Rufino Bomasang said now is not the time to remove the incentives for the upstream petroleum industry , considering the urgency of finding indigenous petroleum . <p> He said these incentives are needed , especially in light of the looming depletion of the Malampaya natural gas field . <p> Bomasang said major exploration companies have all adopted a wait-and-see position and nobody was actively looking for indigenous oil or the " next Malampaya " because of " the apparent instability of government policies . " <p> " Unfortunately , in the last four to five years , petroleum exploration in the Philippines has practically stopped with no major foreign oil and gas company coming in . This is all because of the perceived unstable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proposed TRAIN 2 , " said Bomasang . <h> Ready to cancel <p> The DOE is eyeing to award petroleum service contracts ( PSCs ) soon , amid the legal obstacles . <p> One way by which the DOE could persuade investors who qualified in the 5th Philippine Energy Contracting Round ( PECR ) in 2014 is to cancel the service contract . <p> For instance , DOE Undersecretary Donato Marcos said the agency may reject the bid of Colossal Petroleum Corp . in two exploration areas offered under PECR . <p> " We wrote them a letter and met with them . We warned them that if they are not supportive , we might not push through with the awarding .... If they do not comply soon , their proposal may be disqualified , " said Marcos . <p> Marcos added Colossal was told to abide by whatever the Supreme Court decides on the pending case between the COA and the Malampaya consortium . <p> Israeli firm Ratio Petroleum Ltd. , which won a separate exploration area under the same contracting round , agreed to carry on with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Last week Ratio was formally awarded the petroleum service contract for Area 4 in east Palawan basin covering 416,000 hectares for potential oil and gas resources . <p> Area 5 , which is within Philippine territory , and Area 7 , which is within the disputed area with China , were the ones won by Colossal . <h> Unpopular options <p> Apart from seeking petroleum reserves to lessen the country 's dependence on imported fuel , the DOE continues to seek for higher and expanded fuel discounts to public-utility vehicles , and even went to unpopular options , such as the re-introduction of Euro 2 at the pumps . <p> Oil firms and other sectors , however , view this move contrary to the purpose of the Clean Air Act , which mandated the sale of Euro 4 fuels for passenger and commercial vehicles in the country starting 2017 . <p> Besides , oil firms said , this was going to be a potential logistics nightmare for them . <p> And just recently , the exploration arm of the Philippine National Oil Co .

You are never that smartest guy or gal . <p> You check your calculator for simple arithmetic . What is 5 times 4 again ? And the engineering student checks his or her calculator just to be sure .

( PLDT/Smart ) and Globe Telecoms , Inc . ( Globe ) over the 700 megahertz ( MHz ) broadcast frequency and other frequencies that were conditionally assigned to them by the National Telecommunications Commission ( NTC ) . <p> ( MANILA BULLETIN ) <p> During its full court session , the SC directed the NPC , the Philippine Competition Commission ( PCC ) , and the involved telecommunications companies to comment in 10 days on both the petition and the plea for a temporary restraining order ( TRO ) sought by two lawyers who filed the case . <p> The SC 's action on the petition was confirmed by Acting Chief Justice Antonio T.

" <p> Thus , they said , the acquisition of the frequency " is undeniably anti-competitive and , worse , unconstitutional since the same is a combination ' in restraint of trade or unfair competition ' proscribed by Section 19 , Article XII of the Constitution , " it stressed . <p> When the " Co-Use Agreement " is revoked , the lawyers asked the SC to compel the NTC to make available the frequencies to the " best qualified " telecommunications companies . <p> PLDT/Smart and Globe acquired last year the said broadcast and telecom frequencies after purchasing , on 50-50 basis , all the issued and outstanding shares of stock of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Inc. for about P70 billion . <p> The two firms completed their acquisition of the Vega Telecommunications with the final payment of P13 billion . <p> The petition stated that while Liberty was no longer engaged in broadcasting business , " and despite the underutilization or , worse , non-utilization at all of the conditionally assigned said frequencies within the prescribed period , respondent Liberty continued to illegally hoard the said 700 MHz broadcast frequency .

All as a result of so called progress . I have learned much from my Internet research re the effects of cell phone towers . I have learned that some communities were successful in preventing a tower from being erected in their neighborhood . <p> I believe companies should approach the community first , and ascertain if it is acceptable to have a cell phone tower placed close to families with minor children .

@@70290235 <p> As the Raptors ready to host the two-time defending champion Golden State Warriors on Thursday night in a nationally televised game that many are viewing as a potential NBA Finals preview , it looks like the gamble by Raptors president of basketball operations Masai Ujiri has paid off . <p> " It 's a great trade for Toronto , even if Leonard leaves , " one league executive said . " I just never saw them going any further than they had with DeMar . " <p> ESPN surveyed several NBA executives to gauge their thoughts on Leonard through six weeks , and how he has looked after spending virtually all of last season on the sidelines due to a quad injury . And while there was some debate over whether he is all the way back to what he was before the injury , there was no disputing the fact that Leonard is , at a minimum , back to playing like one of the league 's elite players once again . <p> " He 's pretty much back to his old self , " Green said .

Watch on ESPN+ <p> Then Green smiled . <p> " I think he 's doing all right so far , " he said with a laugh . <p> Still , there was no guarantee that would be the case , which made the move a risky one for a Toronto team that was coming off a 59-win season and already had made a coaching change in hopes of reversing its postseason fortune . <p> Leonard played in only nine games last season because of tendinopathy in his left quad and has just this season remaining on his contract before he can enter free agency .

He was the backbone of a team that has consistently been among the Eastern Conference 's best for half a decade . <p> But to Ujiri , a theoretically healthy Leonard represented the potential to be better than any other player on the Raptors ' roster , including DeRozan . <p> So far , Leonard has been exactly what the Raptors hoped for . His averages -- 24.3 points , 8.6 rebounds , 3.1 assists and 1.8 steals per game -- are in line with his numbers before he got hurt . In fact , he 's actually averaging , by a healthy margin , a career high in rebounds . And that 's while still trying to adjust to playing with a new team , and new teammates , for the first time in his career . <p> " I 'm still learning my team , " he said after finishing with 17 points , 10 rebounds , 5 assists and 2 steals in Toronto 's 122-114 win over Memphis on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to do too much with all of this talent that we have .

Leonard attributed his lower percentage to challenging himself to take more difficult attempts . <p> " I 'm trying to get better , " he said . " It 's easy to shoot a good 3-point percentage if you catch-and-shoot . I 'm taking more shots off the dribble , more off the pick-and-roll , in transition . ... I 'm going to keep shooting .

" He ai n't all the way back . " <p> Even when setting aside the debate over whether Leonard should -- or needs to -- play in every game , the general consensus was that he 's almost , but not quite , what he was in 2016-17 , his last full season . <p> One executive said Leonard is " close to being back . " Another said he was " 90 percent " of the player he was before . <p> The numbers back that up . According to Second Spectrum data , both Leonard 's points per direct isolation play and points per direct drive are down slightly from two seasons ago , prior to his injury . That season , Leonard scored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each direct drive .

But while some may see that as a concern , it 's exactly the opposite for Nurse .

" <p> Thursday night 's matchup with the Warriors -- besides being a litmus test for the Raptors as a whole -- also will serve as one personally for Leonard .

" He 's creating a lot off the dribble , in the post , catching and shooting . He 's just creating a lot of offense in different places on the floor , and he 's very efficient at it . " <p> In one of Toronto 's four losses this season , Nov. 16 in Boston , the Raptors tried to put Leonard on Kyrie Irving on the defensive end in the fourth quarter , but they quickly went away from it after Irving successfully got away from Leonard in a couple of pick-and-rolls .

Instead , the rear motor runs on electricity and helps in delivering more grip from 0 -- 9 km/h .

@@70306231 <h> Duterte OKs 2nd round of fuel tax hike for 2019 <p> In Photo : A gas-station attendant shows the nozzle of a refueling hose in Makati . <p> PRESIDENT Duterte has approved his economic team 's recommendation to push through with the next tranche of fuel excise taxes taking effect in 2019 , Budget Secretary Benjamin E. Diokno confirmed on Tuesday . <p> Diokno said the President is just simply implementing what is stated in the Tax Reform for Acceleration and Inclusion ( TRAIN ) law . <p> Asked what prompted the President to make the decision , Diokno said it 's the " sharp turnaround in world crude prices . " <p> " From a peak of close to $80 pb to $68 pb on November 29 , with Dubai Futures prices projecting further decline below $60 per barrel in 2019 . At its peak , diesel price was P49.80 per liter , it will be P37.76 on January 19 , inclusive of the P2 peso excise tax . For gasoline 95 octane it was P60.90 at its peak , it will be 50.82 on January 19 inclusive of P2 additional excise tax , " he added @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Coordination Committee ( DBCC ) met to reassess the situation given the declining world oil prices . <p> The Cabinet decision also overrode concerns by several senators that proceeding with the second-round hikes purely on the basis of lower global prices was short-sighted ; and alarm by consumer and labor groups that spikes in prices of basic goods would follow the second fuel tax hike of P2 a liter , under the TRAIN law . <p> A forecast steady decline in global oil prices -- to " around the low $50s per barrel in the coming months " -- was seen to have weighed heavily on the final decision by the President and the Cabinet on whether to implement the second tranche in 2019 , besides concerns that suspending implementation spells a P41-billion revenue gap that might impair the " Build , Build , Build " infrastructure program . <p> Hours before the crucial Cabinet meeting that tackled the retraction by the interagency DBCC of its recommendation last month to suspend the second round of fuel excise tax hikes , Secretary Alfonso G. Cusi said the Department of Energy ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second tranche in January . <p> " We have submitted our position already alongside the forecast . The excise tax will proceed because the country will really need to build infrastructure so we need the funds , " said the DOE secretary . <p> Cusi said there could be another oil price rollback next week . " Next week , we expect another rollback and the DOF Department of Finance made a recommendation for the second tranche to be reinstated so we made our forecast for oil . " <p> He added : " Our forecast supports the recommendation by the committee with the DBM Department of Budget and Management and DOF . We are seeing Dubai crude oil to be at around the low $50s in the coming months . " <p> For the past eight consecutive weeks , gasoline prices have declined by P12.05 to P12.20 per liter and diesel by P10.45 to P10.65 per liter . These adjustments reflect movements in the international market . <p> Hours before the Cabinet meeting that began late Tuesday afternoon , Presidential Spokesman and Chief Presidential Legal Counsel Salvador S.

It called for an excise tax of P2.50 per liter on diesel , with an additional P2 to be imposed next year and P1.50 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on diesel to P4.50 per liter in 2019 , and P6 per liter in 2020 . <p> From the previous P4.35 per liter , the excise tax on gasoline was increased to P7 this year , with an additional P2 increase in 2019 , and P1 in 2020 . For 2019 and 2020 , the rates will be at P9 per liter and P10 per liter , respectively . <p> Last week the DBCC noted that Dubai crude oil prices have gone down by 14 percent to $68 per barrel in November , from $79 per barrel last month . The average price , the DBCC said , may maintain a downward trajectory and drop below $60 per barrel next year . <p> Besides the expected steady decline of fuel prices , Finance Secretary Carlos G. Dominguez III said they considered the impact of the suspension on the revenue and expenditures program for next year . <p> Dominguez said the erosion in revenue may force the government to cut spending just to ensure that the programmed deficit level of 3.2 percent of GDP for 2019 is not breached . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to government efforts to address supply-side constraints as well as falling oil prices . <p> The DBCC has also revised its assumptions on Dubai crude oil prices -- from a range of $75 to $85 per barrel , to $60 to $75 per barrel in 2019 . <p> Under the TRAIN law , the excise tax increase may be suspended if the international price of Dubai crude breaches the $80-per-barrel threshold for three months .

@@70313232 <p> EAST RUTHERFORD , N.J. -- Landon Collins has two Pro Bowls and an All-Pro selection on his r ? sum ? . He also likely has a lengthy recovery and uncertainty in his future after tearing his labrum in Sunday 's overtime win over the Chicago Bears . <p> Collins completed the game in pain . That is the kind of player and man he is . It 's why he is universally respected in the New York Giants locker room and was named a first-time captain this year at age 24 . <p> There are still no guarantees that Collins will be back next season . He is a free agent after this season who now likely faces a four- to six-month recovery from left shoulder surgery . It only adds to his uncertainty . <p> The unpredictability of the safety market already had muddled Collins ' future . Now this . The Giants can allow him to walk , use the franchise tag or try to sign him to a long-term deal . <p> The franchise tag seems the most likely option at this point . It was in the $11 million range last year , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ space after unloading pieces at the trade deadline in preparation for the future . The tag also would allow them the opportunity to see if Collins makes a full recovery and bounces back from what ( for him ) seemed to be a pedestrian season . <p> On one end , Collins is a difference-making playmaker near the line of scrimmage , a natural strong safety . That is what he is in this league . He led the Giants with 96 tackles , which included five for a loss , through 13 weeks . He wreaks constant havoc near the line of scrimmage . <p> " I think Landon displayed what he is this season , " Giants coach Pat Shurmur said . " He 's a very tough guy , very good tackler . I mean , he 's made a lot of plays for us , especially close to the line of scrimmage . I 've said it numerous times in a sport where toughness is required , he has a lot of it . That 's what I appreciate about him . " <p> On the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ends or running backs in coverage . Chicago 's Tarik Cohen caught three passes for 83 yards in the second half alone against Collins on Sunday . <p> Collins likely was asked to cover more than the Giants would 've liked . Maybe it would have been a different story if they did n't have such a void at the free safety position . Maybe then it would have allowed Collins to be a better fit in new coordinator James Bettcher 's defense . <p> " I think all safeties have to cover , " Shurmur said . " If you play any form of man , then the safeties have to cover , in most cases , either the tight end or a back . There are n't many choices beyond that . We asked him to do that . We play man like every other team . He 's required to do that . " <p> Probably more than anybody would 've liked . But it did n't stop Collins from being able to make plays near the line of scrimmage . That is his primary skill . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pro personnel scout told ESPN . <p> Good , not great or elite . <p> " Elite ? No , solid starter that can make some impact plays , " the scout added . <p> What is that worth these days in a depressed safety market that seems to only want to pay natural free safeties ? That is what the Giants will have to decide . <p> At one point , Collins was hoping to get paid in the Eric Berry range . The Kansas City Chiefs free safety is the NFL 's highest-paid player at that position at $13 million per year . That deal was signed almost two years ago before the salary cap continued to rise . The same deal today would likely be in the range of $15 million per year . <p> Collins is n't getting anywhere near that . But there is little doubt the Giants would welcome him back , at the right price . They received offers for him at the trade deadline -- including from the Chiefs -- but did n't seem all that interested in making a move unless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offseason ( and someone will pay up if the Giants allow him on the open market ) , New York will at least get a decent compensatory pick in return for 2020 . But it 's still more likely that Collins returns , if everything goes as planned medically . <p> The Giants are n't in much of a position to allow 24-year-old defensive playmakers to walk . They ca n't afford to let any defensive playmaker walk . And it 's not as if the locker room would n't welcome his return . <p> A source familiar with the Giants ' thinking told ESPN 's Adam Schefter last month that they were expected to place their franchise tag on Collins if they could n't sign him to a long-term extension first . The long-term extension option became more complicated with this week 's injury news . The franchise tag probably became even more likely .

@@70339230 <h> Lessons from 2018 and our economic future <p> AS the year draws to a close we reflect on how the Philippine economy has fared in 2018 . Possibly the most memorable economic events were the implementation of the TRAIN law , the inflation that affected the whole nation down to the most basic family unit , the rice crisis and the government 's investment in infrastructure . <p> At this point in the year , the nation 's exports are suffering . The trade deficit in October increased by 62.9 percent at $4.212 billion , a huge jump from last year 's and the previous month 's . All this came after imports increased to support the government 's infrastructure projects and after President Duterte signed Administrative Order 13 , which paved the way for faster import of food and agricultural products . <p> There is , therefore , a need to boost exports to be able to recover and reduce the trade deficit .

The ordinary Filipino felt the sting as prices continued to accelerate and affordable rice became scarce . Inflation , of course , was the biggest problem of the year . From 3.45 percent at the beginning of 2018 , it jumped to a worrying 6.7 percent in September , the highest in 10 years . <p> In November inflation was at 6 percent , which was still higher than the target for the year . Experts are almost unanimous in predicting that we wo n't be doing better next year as we head on to election season and start to shoulder TRAIN 's second batch of petroleum taxes .

The TRAIN law is projected to generate additional revenues of P6 billion , or 0.03 percent of GDP , in 2020 onward . <p> The TRAIN also had an adverse impact on the poorest households , requiring the government to provide unconditional cash transfers of P300 to P400 a month in the next three to four years . <p> " These developments provide a more conservative view on the ability of the TRAIN to fund the present administration 's ambitious ' Build , Build , Build ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ highlight the need for compensatory transfers to protect those who are most negatively affected by the TRAIN , especially the poorest two or the poorest four deciles , through targeted subsidies for three to four years , " she added . <p> While Republic Act ( RA ) 10963 reduced the personal income tax ( PIT ) liability of both compensation income earners and the self-employed and professionals , it also raised the excise taxes on certain products and broadened the coverage of the value-added tax ( VAT ) . <p> Manasan said the tax revenue estimates of the incremental revenues are lower than the official estimates , which place the revenue gains from the TRAIN law at P63 billion in 2018 , P104 billion in 2019 and P140 billion in 2020 . <p> She said actual revenues from the personal income tax may fall below its 2018 target by P43 billion , which suggests that the revenue loss from PIT reform may actually be closer to P190 billion , larger than the finance department 's P146 billion estimate by P43 billion and higher than this paper 's P210 billion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the collections of the Bureau of Internal Revenue and Bureau of Customs in October indicate that excise and VAT revenues may fall short of their collection targets for the entire year of 2018 by a combined total of P36 billion . <h> ' Regressive character ' <p> Manasan said the change introduced by the TRAIN increased the burden of households , particularly those belonging to the poorest decile , which saw a 3.5- percent increase in tax burden as a percentage of household income . <p> She added that as incomes rise , the impact of the TRAIN on households decline as a percentage of household income to 2.8 percent of household income for the richest families . This indicated a " regressive character of the reform .

Trump 's wrath over stock-market losses . <p> An emergency meeting with top United States regulators that Mnuchin convened on Monday and a call with executives from six major banks the previous day failed to address concerns about the administration that have intensified in the wake of a Bloomberg News report that Trump had discussed firing Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell . <p> Trump 's frustration with Powell over the market 's performance -- expressed in tweets and interviews -- now may turn to his Treasury chief . One person familiar with the president 's thinking says that Trump has weighed dismissing Mnuchin , while another said that Mnuchin 's tenure may depend in part on how much markets continue to drop . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ market as a benchmark for his presidency . Yet much of the gains in equities since his election have been been erased by months of turmoil , as investors grow increasingly concerned about the impact of the administration 's trade battles with China and Europe . <p> After Mnuchin 's call , which produced no public statement , stocks continued their Christmas Eve slide , ending the day with the benchmark S&amp;P 500 down 2.7 percent , hitting its lowest level in 20 months . <p> The president will continue looking for a scapegoat .

Trump 's trade war with China is creating uncertainty for businesses . US government debt is approaching $22 trillion . A partial government shutdown this week is raising concerns about Washington 's ability to find bipartisan solutions to pressing problems . The president 's musings about firing Powell and the abrupt departure of Defense Secretary James Mattis add to the sense of turbulence . <p> Representative Maxine Waters , a California Democrat and the incoming chairwoman of the House Financial Services Committee , said in a statement on Monday night that " The financial markets need certainty , and a Federal Reserve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the president and the Treasury secretary , however , have been erratic and are creating uncertainty and instability in the markets . " <h> Going way back <p> While Trump regularly took credit for the stock market 's rise , he has consistently pointed elsewhere to explain its decline . <p> Unlike others Trump has cut loose , the president goes way back with Mnuchin , 56 , a former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. partner and movie financier who served as Trump 's chief campaign fund-raiser . <p> But Mnuchin 's standing with Trump may be undermined by moves that risk his reputation on Wall Street , a Treasury secretary 's stock in trade . <p> Last week in an interview with Bloomberg News , Mnuchin pointed to long-standing phenomena to explain the stock market 's recent volatility .

@@70361234 <h> CA allows payment of benefits to INP retirees <p> MANILA -- A ruling by the Court of Appeals ( CA ) has allowed the payment of pension benefits to retired members of the defunct Integrated National Police ( INP ) . <p> In its eight-page decision dated December 12 , the special 14th Division of the appellate court ordered the full implementation of a 2016 CA decision for the release of PHP3.9 billion in benefits to the INP retirees by the Philippine National Police ( PNP ) and Department of Budget and Management ( DBM ) . <p> Entitled to the differentials are INP retirees , transferees and their survivors who had rendered service before the enactment of Republic Act 6975 , the law that created the PNP and made it a reorganized body under the Department of the Interior and Local Government , and their survivors . <p> A PNP and DBM petition questioned the order of Manila Regional Trial Court Branch 32 in July last year , which would use the list of INP retirees and the pension amounts due them submitted by PNP for the implementation of the pension payment . <p> The CA turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and apply a list from the Government Service Insurance System instead of the PNP list in the payment of pension differentials to the INP retirees . <p> The PNP and DBM argued that the participation of GSIS in the payment of retirement benefits is necessary as it is the only agency that can provide pension history of the INP retirees . <p> They further stressed that the retirement pay must be subject to conditions and limitations to ensure that such public funds would be released only to rightful beneficiaries . <p> The CA , however , sided with the position earlier submitted by the GSIS that " the responsibility to evaluate the list of retirees lies with the PNP as their employer .

The pull-out is childish and whimsical , if not heartless given the timing As a squad loaded with huge talents , they could have made another run when the third season kicks off in March next year , but Cheng 's cruel decision to dismantle its squad was a dagger right into the hearts of their supporters , who blamed anyone except for themselves and had the gall to point the finger at the PFF . <p> Mike Limpag was right when he called the withdrawal as nothing but a temper tantrum .
