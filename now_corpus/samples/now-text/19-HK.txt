Article 36 of the Implementing Regulations for the Trademark Law specifies that , " damages shall be payable if bad faith on the part of the trademark registrant caused another person to suffer losses " . <p> Grievance procedure : if , after the trials in the two courts at different levels , the administrative ruling is ultimately upheld , the rights holder may institute a grievance procedure with the people 's court that rendered the original effective judgment , or the people 's court at the next higher level , within two years after the entry into effect of the final judgment . <p> Q:What new provisions of the third amendment to the Trademark Law ( draft ) address the bad-faith registration of trademarks ? <p> A : On 2 September 2011 , the Legislative Affairs Office of the State Council issued the Trademark Law ( Draft for Comments on the Bill of Amendment ) . The Trademark Law Amendment Bill ( Draft ) was deliberated on for the first time at the 30th Session of the Standing Committee of the 11th National People 's Congress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for public comment . <p> The draft bill addresses the phenomenon of the registration of trademarks in bad faith . It prohibits the pirate registration of trademarks of which one is well aware of the prior use by another due to business relations , etc .

This will have a significant effect on halting those other pirate registrations of trademarks where the situation falls between the cracks in legislation , but where bad faith is clearly involved . <p> The bill also provides that if the registration of a trademark was obtained through fraud , or other improper means , the Trademark Office will declare such registered trademark invalid ; furthermore another entity or individual may request that the board declare such registered trademark invalid . The bill stipulates that where a trademark , the registration of which was maliciously pirated , is declared invalid , the exclusive right to use it ceases to exist .

Where the bad faith on the part of the trademark registrant caused another to incur a loss , the registrant will be required to pay compensation . <p> Q : How does a court come to a finding of bad-faith registration of a trademark ? <p> A : The First Intermediate People 's Court of Beijing Municipality held a news briefing on 3 December 2012 , at which it gave a summary report to the public on its trial of bad-faith registration of trademark cases and proposed concrete measures on how to stop the out-of-control phenomenon , for example by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ famous trade names ; stringent application of the rule under which an order for rectification within a specified period of time is given or the registered trademark is cancelled if use of it stops for three years in succession ; increasing the cost of maintaining trademarks the registration of which has been maliciously pirated , etc .

@@41283232 <h> Implementation of the Cape Town Convention <p> India acceded to the Cape Town Convention on International Interests in Mobile Equipment and the Protocol to the Convention ( CTC ) on 1 July 2008 , but it was not until the failure of Kingfisher Airlines that industry participants began to evaluate the implementation of CTC in India . <p> Shashank Jain <p> While the aircraft leased to Kingfisher were leased prior to India 's accession to CTC and thus did not have the benefit of CTC , industry participants came to realize that even if the leasing arrangements had been entered into after accession , some benefits available under CTC would probably not be available to them . This is mainly because India has not passed any new legislation or amended existing legislation in line with the provisions of CTC . <p> Under extant laws , India may enter into and implement a treaty after entering into an accession document , either with or without subsequent legislation . In the case of CTC , India has not enacted any legislation , thus while CTC is enforceable , in the event it conflicts with any other Indian legislation ( including @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Amendments proposed <p> Pursuant to requests by industry participants , the Ministry of Civil Aviation has now proposed to amend the Aircraft Rules , 1937 , to give legislative sanctity to the Irrevocable De-registration and Export Request Authorization ( IDERA ) under CTC , and allow the holder of an IDERA to procure de-registration , export and physical transfer of the aircraft without consent of the lessee ( i.e. the airline operator ) . That said , exercise of these rights would be subject to the rights of any governmental authority , inter-governmental authority or private sector authority to which any dues are pending , and accordingly the rights of such authorities will supersede those of the IDERA holder . <p> There are a few deviations between the proposed amendments and the declarations made by India under CTC . As a welcome deviation , the proposed amendment does not provide for extending such rights to " another aircraft object " , which could be interpreted to mean that primacy of the governmental authority , inter-governmental authority or private sector authority would not be on a fleet-wide basis . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Under the proposed amendments , governmental authorities , inter-governmental authorities or private sector authorities to which any dues are pending are proposed to be given the powers to " attach " and " sell " the relevant aircraft to recover their dues . The proposed amendment could be interpreted to mean that an aircraft which is an asset of the lessor or financiers can be attached and sold to recover dues owed by an operator ( i.e. a lessee ) which are not directly attributable to the lessor or financiers . <p> Additionally the proposed amendment gives the above-mentioned powers to " private sector authorities " as opposed to the declarations , where similar powers were conferred on a " private provider of public services " . The term " private sector authorities " has a wider connotation than " private provider of public services " as arguably all private sector authorities may not be providers of public services in a strict sense . <p> Under the extant Aircraft Rules , an aircraft may be de-registered by the Directorate General of Civil Aviation ( DGCA ) if a relevant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proposed amendments modify this condition to permit de-registration of aircraft if the aircraft lease has " expired ; or has been terminated in accordance with the law applicable " . <p> This modification could lead to delays in de-registration of aircraft , as the DGCA does not have the mandate or expertise to adjudicate whether a leasing arrangement between the lessee ( i.e. operator ) and lessor of an aircraft has been terminated in accordance with " applicable law " . It is therefore possible that the DGCA may require the lessors or financiers to procure an order from an Indian court prior to exercising its powers to de-register an aircraft . Further , inclusion of the word " expired " could result in the DGCA automatically de-registering an aircraft on a date set out in the relevant lease agreement , which may not always be in the best interest of the lessor , financiers or the lessee . <p> Conclusion <p> While the proposed amendments to the Aircraft Rules to implement CTC are a welcome step , more is needed to be done to fully incorporate and implement CTC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indian laws including those relating to taxation are required to be amended to ensure that India complies with its international obligations under CTC . India also needs to take steps to ensure compliance with obligations undertaken by it to ensure that lessors and financiers are able to obtain from a court speedy interim relief ( including preservation , immobilization and possession ) in relation to the aircraft , and ensure adherence to the timelines agreed to by India for the conclusion of legal proceedings , including insolvency proceedings . <p> Shashank Jain is a senior associate at Trilegal .

@@41283233 <h> Recognition and protection of television format rights <p> The " television formats " for unscripted reality shows such as " IDOL " ( American Idol , Indian Idol , etc . ) , " Big Brother " ( Bigg Boss in India ) , and " Who Wants to be a Millionaire ? " ( Kaun Banega Crorepati in India ) have become " properties " capable of monetization across different jurisdictions . Though licensing of formats is common in the television industry , the challenge posed by their unauthorized use is considerable . <p> Ameet Datta <p> A basic premise of copyright protection is that while ideas are not protected under the law , the expressions of ideas are protected . Therefore , even if an idea is " novel " and " original " it would not enjoy protection under copyright law unless it is expressed sufficiently to attract such protection .

The unauthorized use of this concept in a competitive environment , coupled with the confidential information contained within it , therefore would amount to a copyright infringement . <p> Bombay High Court , 2007 <p> Format rights paired with breach of confidential information also arose in Urmi Juvekar Chiang v Global Broadcast News Limited , decided by Bombay High Court in 2007 .

The court stated that in order for a work to be copied it needs to be established that a substantial part has been copied and this substantiality was a question of quality rather than quantity . Substantiality should be determined by individually examining the similarities between the programmes and then it should be considered whether the entirety of what had been copied represents a substantial part of the plaintiff 's programme . <p> The court also held that though there is no copyright protection for an idea , concept , principle or discovery , there may be a valid copyright in an original form of expression of an idea , concept or discovery . Another principle spelled out by the court was that a mere outline or theme is not copyrightable since it is only an idea . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ locale or setting of a story , is not an intellectual property .

How will the moves help cash-strapped corporations restructure their debt portfolios and access new sources of funding ? Karan Singh and Ameya Khandge report <p> India escaped the worst of the Asian financial crisis in 1997 . It was insulated from the fallout by its limited foreign currency exposure . The reverberations of the current financial crisis have hit the country much harder . <p> In 2007 , India saw robust foreign capital inflows , both in foreign direct investment ( FDI ) and foreign currency borrowings . These inflows raised liquidity levels and caused the rupee to appreciate . The Reserve Bank of India ( RBI ) responded with measures to cool the economy and fight inflation , including a range of restrictions on the use of participatory notes . Measures were also taken to tighten inward investment through foreign currency borrowings : Ceilings on interest were introduced , rupee capital expenditure was removed from the automatic route for foreign investment and a US$20 million ceiling on such expenditure use was imposed . The use of proceeds for the development @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Normally , such measures would have had only a short-term impact , but the global financial meltdown changed that . One of the immediate consequences was a significant outflow of foreign investment from the Indian stock market . <p> By the middle of 2008 the government was reversing exchange control measures in a bid to boost FDI and tackle the liquidity crunch . Controls on external commercial borrowings ( ECBs ) , for instance , were progressively lifted , as were regulations concerning security creation . Restrictions on the use of funds for rupee expenditure were relaxed and all-in-cost ceilings were substantially widened . More recently , the RBI went even further , relaxing borrowing norms and , for the first time , removing all-in-cost ceilings altogether under the approval route with the policy on this account subject to review in June 2009 .

The court was considering a decision of Punjab and Haryana High Court which had held that an attempt to commit murder under section 307 of the Indian Penal Code , 1860 , was incapable of being compounded ( i.e. resolved through a settlement ) and there could be no acquittal on the basis of such a compromise . <p> The Supreme Court held that the powers under section 482 are wide enough to provide for an acquittal pursuant to a compromise even in such cases .

Acting on a complaint by a group of individuals who had been allotted apartments that were being constructed by DLF , the Belaire Owners ' Association , the CCI also imposed a penalty of ? 6.3 billion ( US$140 million ) , which is 7% of its average turnover for the three preceding years . <p> The complaint against DLF was that it had abused its dominant position in the market . In so doing , it delayed handing over apartments to the owners and violated building norms by increasing the number of floors from 19 to 29 , which led to an increase in the number of apartments from 384 to 564 .

It also argued there could not be any " abuse " under section 4(2) ( a ) of the act ( which provides the circumstances that result in abuse of its dominant position by an enterprise or group ) , as the agreement was related to " sale of an apartment " and not for " purchase of service " .

The Associated Press also reported that a large number of China 's armed police were rehearsing on Sunday morning how to disperse protesters . <p> Leung said such rehearsals were not aimed at intimidating Hong Kong protesters but were part of security preparations for the celebrations on Oct. 1 , when the nation celebrates the 70th anniversary of the People 's Republic . <p> She said the extradition bill had been indefinitely suspended and the government had already responded to the public demands , but citizens are not satisfied with the government 's responses . <p> She urged all sides to calm down and hold discussions even as she called on lawmakers to persuade demonstrators to stop using violence , adding that those who played a role in planning recent clashes had done a really good job of getting the information spread . <p> Asked why the indiscriminate attacks by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dealt with , Leung said order must first be restored before previous violent incidents could be reviewed . <p> Nothing can be done in a turbulent society , she added . <p> Leung said many people have the wrong notion that participating in protests is a great thing that can help Hong Kong strive for freedom . <p> She said she hoped those people would awaken , adding that freedoms do not come without restrictions . <p> She also warned that if Hongkongers kept disregarding law and order , it would doubtful whether Beijing would gain confidence in allowing dual universal suffrage in the city . <p> Last Friday , over 5,000 accountants marched peacefully from Chater Garden in Central to the Central Government Complex in Admiralty to once again solemnly urge the government to positively respond to the people 's five demands .... <p> A group representing the interests of subdivided flat tenants has called on authorities to tighten regulations to prevent exploitation of the tenants by greedy landlords .

Photo : AFP <h> EU rebuffs British PM Johnson 's Brexit gambit <p> The European Union rebuffed Prime Minister Boris Johnson 's demand that it reopen the Brexit divorce deal , saying Britain had failed to propose any realistic alternative to an agreed insurance policy for the Irish border , Reuters reports . <p> After more than three years of Brexit crisis , the United Kingdom is heading towards a showdown with the EU as Johnson has vowed to leave the bloc on Oct. 31 without a deal unless it agrees to renegotiate the divorce terms . <p> In his opening bid to the EU ahead of meetings with French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel , Johnson wrote a four-page letter to European Council President Donald Tusk asking to ax the Irish border " backstop " . <p> Johnson proposed that the backstop -- part of the Withdrawal Agreement that then-prime minister Theresa May agreed last year -- be replaced with a " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deal on the post-Brexit relationship . <p> Merkel , Europe 's most powerful leader , said the EU would consider " practical solutions " but that the Withdrawal Agreement , which contains the protocol on the Irish border " backstop " , did not need to be changed . <p> " It is a question of the declaration on future ties , " she said during a visit to Iceland . " And I think we will act in a very unified way . " <p> Brussels was more direct . " Those against the backstop and not proposing realistic alternatives in fact support re-establishing a border . Even if they do not admit it , " Tusk tweeted . <p> A note seen by Reuters setting out the agreed joint position of the 27 EU states staying on after Brexit said the EU regretted Johnson 's bid to scrap a " necessary , legally operative solution " in favor of a " commitment to try to find a solution " . <p> Johnson told reporters the EU was being " a bit negative " but he believed a deal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the prospects of a no-deal departure , fell after Tusk 's comments to near three-year lows against the euro and the dollar , before recovering its losses after Merkel 's comments . <p> Brexit brinkmanship <p> European diplomats expect little progress on Brexit until the British domestic landscape becomes clearer when parliament returns on Sept. 3 -- after which the opposition Labour Party has vowed to try to collapse Johnson 's government . <p> Johnson said the EU was unlikely to make the concessions Britain is seeking as long as it believed there was a possibility that parliament would block Brexit . <p> With British politics in such turmoil , it is still unclear how , when or indeed if the UK will leave the EU . Many expect an election within months . <p> With such uncertainty , some suspect perfidy in London . <p> A diplomat from one EU country told Reuters that Johnson 's letter was " pure PR " and not meant to spur constructive talks but rather set the stage for a " blame game " with the EU . <p> The riddle of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ land border with the British province of Northern Ireland has repeatedly imperiled Brexit talks . <p> The EU wants to ensure that its only land border with the UK after Brexit does not become a back door for goods to enter the EU 's single market -- which guarantees free movement of goods , capital , services and labor . <p> But Ireland says checks could undermine the 1998 Good Friday agreement , which brought peace after more than 3,600 died in a three-decade conflict between unionists who wanted Northern Ireland to remain British and Irish nationalists who want Northern Ireland to join a united Ireland ruled from Dublin . <p> The UK does not want there to be any border -- effective or virtual -- between Britain and Northern Ireland . Johnson 's government is propped up by Northern Irish unionists . <p> The backstop was aimed at squaring the circle : it would keep the UK in a customs union with the EU until a better solution was found , and keep Northern Ireland aligned to the rules of the EU 's single market . <p> Johnson wrote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the application of single-market rules in Northern Ireland could divide the province from the rest of the UK . <p> He also said it risked upsetting the delicate balance between nationalists and unionists in Northern Ireland . <p> Every region in the world , except the Americas , is experiencing an increase in the number of cases of measles , the World Health Organization ( WHO ) said on Thursday .

@@41286235 <h> US regulators ease rules for Wall Street banks <p> US banking regulators eased trading regulations for Wall Street banks , giving them one of their biggest wins under the Trump administration but drawing criticism from consumer activists who warned of potential risks to taxpayers . <p> The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency ( OCC ) and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ( FDIC ) approved the revamped version of the so-called " Volcker Rule , " which aims to ban lenders that accept U.S. taxpayer-insured deposits from engaging in proprietary trading , Reuters reports . <p> The changes , first proposed in May 2018 , followed years of lobbying by banks , including Goldman Sachs Group Inc. , JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. and Morgan Stanley , which have long complained the rule is too vague and complex . <p> The new rule gives banks more leeway in terms of trading activity and simplifies how banks can tell if that trading is permitted by law . <p> While many regulatory experts have agreed the prior rule was too cumbersome , the changes were criticized by consumer groups and Democratic lawmakers who say a rewrite could put taxpayers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Democrat who backed the Volcker rewrite proposed in May 2018 , voted against the final rule on Tuesday , saying it would " effectively undo " the rule 's protections . <p> In particular , he warned that the new rule narrows the definition of banned trading in a way that could free up banks to engage in riskier bets with potentially billions of dollars in financial instruments . <p> " The final rule published today would curtail prohibitions in a manner that Congress never intended , " she said in a statement calling on other regulators to halt the project . <p> Analysts say the final rule , which is significantly different from the proposed 2018 version , could also be vulnerable to legal challenges . <p> The rewrite aims to clarify which trades are exempt from the ban , such as when banks facilitate client trades and hedge risks , and to expand those exemptions . <p> The final rewrite scraps a proposed new test for identifying proprietary trading that banks complained would have made the rule even more complicated . <p> That proposed " accounting test " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to identify if a trader intended a trade to be speculative . <p> But banks argued it could apply to a host of additional financial instruments not meant to be covered by the rule . <p> The final rule scraps that proposal for large Wall Street firms , instead simplifying the original test and only applying it to much smaller banks . <p> At the same time , the rewrite simplifies a separate part of the rule which makes it easier for banks to invest in hedge funds or private equity funds . <p> Regulators said they expect to propose further easing of the " covered funds " aspect of the rule , including for foreign firms , later this year . <p> The banking industry hailed the rule , while calling for regulators to expedite that additional relief . <p> " We urge the regulators to finish the job of Volcker Rule reform , " said Kevin Fromer with the Financial Services Forum , an industry group that represents the chief executives of the nation 's biggest banks . <p> The rule will become effective on Jan. 1 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The OCC and the FDIC are two of five regulators charged with implementing the rule .

Besides , he was not using them when he was accosted and apprehended . <p> To protest against Fong 's arrest , hundreds of people rushed to Sham Shui Po to stock up on laser pens and gathered at the Space Museum in Tsim Sha Tsui , where they pointed their lasers at the dome in an impromptu laser-light show . <p> Fong 's arrest also fueled fears that police might soon target people who buy eggs because protesters had pelted officers with eggs during recent clashes . <p> Eventually , police decided to release the student leader without filing charges against him .

It has also asked business heavyweights such as the Real Estate Developers Association to come out and condemn the violent protests . <p> When asked about the laser pen , China Mobile chairman Yang Jie said he saw nothing wrong with the gift . <p> Deviating from the position of the Hong Kong police , Yang said a laser pen is not an offensive weapon per se ; it depends on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uses of a laser pen , including as a torch , a pointer , and a tool to write on a digital screen . <p> So would the Hong Kong police still insist on their view of the laser pen ? <p> Last Friday , over 5,000 accountants marched peacefully from Chater Garden in Central to the Central Government Complex in Admiralty to once again solemnly urge the government to positively respond to the people 's five demands .... <p> A group representing the interests of subdivided flat tenants has called on authorities to tighten regulations to prevent exploitation of the tenants by greedy landlords .

" There were tears , lots of them , that 's for sure . It took a lot to get where I am today . Starting a business alone can be brutal , and being a single mum while doing so -- it 's like a candle burning at both ends . Very few , if anyone , recognised me when I was starting my career ; they did n't give me the time of day . But I was committed to succeeding and made a considerable investment . <p> " At the time , though , the concept of ' art jewels ' was not something people understood and bought into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ main concern . We were racing against time every day . Finally I had no choice but to sell my house in order to survive . But never once did I feel like giving up ; I spent days on end crouched at my desk , creating . " <p> Concerned that the demands of her fledgling business meant she was unable to provide the stability and quality time her young son required , Cindy sent him to boarding school overseas . " I looked at my son one day and realised that I was failing to provide him with the care he deserved . And while it pained me to send him away , I knew in my heart that it was the right decision . I recall vividly when I dropped him off at his dormitory . Despite my best efforts to stay calm and look cool , I burst into tears the moment I turned my back . <p> " After I paid his first tuition fees , there was only US$860 left in my account . My sister then turned to me and asked , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even afford it ? ' But I was resolute . I did n't have time to think about tomorrow , nor did I have the time to look back and wonder what I could have done differently . From that point on , the only way to go was forward , like a horse in blinders just looking ahead . I was determined not to stop till I succeeded -- and when I felt I had reached my goal , I would aim even higher . " <p> She soon achieved that goal and more -- and she continues to reach higher . <p> Dress by St ? phane Rolland ( Photo : Carter Smith for Hong Kong Tatler ) <h> Story continues below <p> From being strapped for cash , working out of her living room with only her younger sister and an assistant to help , today Cindy has beautiful showrooms in the most expensive districts in Taipei and Hong Kong , and her pieces are sought by art and jewellery connoisseurs and A-list celebrities . Her Black Label Masterpieces and White Label Collection have sold through prestigious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Museum , Tokyo 's Mori Art Museum and Washington DC 's Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History . <p> In 2018 , Cindy was invited to participate for the first time at Masterpiece London , where her Peony brooch won the Outstanding Object award . In March this year she made her debut at the prestigious European Fine Art Fair ( Tefaf ) in Maastricht , where she unveiled her 2019 Black Label Masterpieces , and then participated at Masterpiece London in June , where she won an award for her Masterpiece IX Winter Leaves necklace . The cherry on top was when surprise guest Julia Roberts walked on stage at this year 's Academy Awards wearing a suite of Cindy 's jewellery , which Roberts personally chose over pieces by other big industry names . <p> My grandfather was a perfectionist ; he taught me the importance of perseverance and attention to detail . -- Cindy Chao <h> Family Legacy <p> Between takes during our shoot , Cindy explores the chateau , marvelling at the antique furniture and sculptures in the extravagant salons . A beautiful antique mahogany writing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imagine herself creating wax mouldings for her jewellery on it . <p> While she appears completely comfortable all glammed up and wearing couture , she says she is happiest in a worn-out shirt without make-up and crouched over her workbench . Even after all the success she 's earned , her love for her craft and her drive to take her designs to the next level never wane . <p> This passion , I discover , comes in part from a desire to continue her family legacy . Cindy grew up surrounded by creativity , with an architect for a grandfather and a sculptor for a father . Her grandfather designed temples across Taiwan , many of which are now national monuments . As well as inheriting his artistic talent , Cindy also acquired his work ethic . <p> " My grandfather was a perfectionist . He taught me the importance of perseverance and attention to detail , " she says . " I remember how he did n't stop until he got the perfect shade he wanted . He was mixing paint for hours . He even got annoyed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be able to tell the difference . He persisted and , true enough , got the result he wanted . I look back to that moment and realise it was then that I learned the value of perseverance -- and , imagine , he did n't have the technology we have now . <p> " As I watched him try to solve the problem on his own , I also learned that the creative process can be a lonely one , " Cindy continues . " I came to the conclusion that this is how true art is born . The path is a rough and difficult one , and the creator is most likely on his or her own . And all one can do is to believe in oneself even when no one else will . This has been my mindset over the past decade . " <h> Ambitions And Achievements <p> I ask what is next for Cindy Chao . If she 'd been asked this question in 2016 , she responds , it would have been to participate at Tefaf , but she 's already accomplished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the next greater , more incredible thing . Something bigger , something harder to accomplish . I look back at what we have achieved as a brand -- from being a part of Christie 's New York in 2007 and the Paris Biennale in 2016 to Masterpiece London in 2018 and Tefaf Maastricht in 2019 -- and realise that at some point in my career I considered all of them my Everest . But we achieved them and just aimed higher . <p> " It 's similar to conquering mountain peaks one after another ; one 's ambition grows with experience , and one looks forward to a greater challenge . I 'm well aware that the path towards the higher peaks takes stamina -- a lot of it . And I know I have what it takes . These are important milestones for my brand but also lifetime experiences for me as an individual . " <p> As we move in the sweltering heat through the chateau and out into its expansive gardens taking the shots we have planned , I watch Cindy with astonishment and admiration . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an intensity and restlessness that I 'm sure indicates she 's planning her next big move or visualising her next big piece . <h> The Mother-Child Bond <p> I 'm curious to understand what drives such tireless zeal . Surely it 's not just fame or money ; it must be something more precious . " People know me as an artist , as a businesswoman , an entrepreneur -- and an Iron Lady even , " she says with a laugh . " But few are aware of my personal journey and the real driving force behind my dreams , and that is my son . He is by far my most prized achievement and biggest source of inspiration . <p> At the age of nine he went abroad with a teddy bear and Lego toys in his backpack . I lived in fear during those early years . Every day I dreaded losing my business and failing to pay his tuition fees , and I missed him terribly . <p> At the age of 18 , he graduated as the student body president , an honoured student and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my shoulder and said , ' Well done , Mum , you did it . This diploma is as much yours as it is mine and I could not be prouder to say that I 'm Cindy Chao 's son . ' With that , I knew everything we had gone through together to get where we are today was not in vain . He is my biggest cheerleader and continues to push me to dream big . " <p> And therein lies the true beauty of Cindy Chao 's jewels : behind the grand visions , painstaking , meticulous craftsmanship and the unrelenting desire for perfection lies the inspiration of a mother 's enduring love for her child .

@@41315238 <h> Thanks ! <p> As humans , we are all programmed with natural impulses and instincts . However , just because we have certain thoughts and impulses does n't mean that they are all healthy for us . <p> Fortunately , it is possible to identify emotions that may make us more vulnerable to making poor choices . Here are four warning signs -- collectively known as the " HALT method " -- that can help control our impulses and make better choices . <h> Hunger <p> Hunger is a sign that our body is lacking or in need of something . The majority of time hunger is associated with food , diet , and nutrition , which are undeniably important aspects of our overall health . <p> For example , many people experience feeling " hangry " ( a combination of hunger and anger ) when blood sugar levels drop , making them more emotionally unpredictable . However , be aware that this feeling could also be an emotional hunger ; a craving for connection , intimacy , validation , etc . <h> Anger <p> Thus , we may be prone to over-reacting and our responses will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better to provide alternative and healthy outlets for our anger , such as exercise or meditation . <h> Story continues below <h> Loneliness <p> Loneliness is a trigger for many negative emotions in life , and such emotions can certainly lead to unhealthy behaviours . Instead of reacting to loneliness with self-destructive actions such as drinking or binge eating , try to respond to loneliness by reaching out to your friends or family for that feeling of connection . <p> Alternatively , you can engage in self-care by fostering your own unique interests and hobbies . <h> Tiredness <p> When tired , we are extremely vulnerable to poor choices . Maintaining healthy sleep cycles and routines are essential for both physical and mental health . <p> When experiencing lack of sleep ( insomnia , jet lag , etc. ) , our brains are simply not functioning at full potential . This is not the best time for making consequential decisions as you can not be thinking clearly when such a basic need as sleep is not being met . <p> So , the next time you are facing emotions and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment , am I feeling hungry , angry , lonely , or tired ? <p> If the answer to any of these questions is yes , you could benefit from taking a deep breath and a pause in order to respond mindfully instead of reacting impulsively . <p> HALT helps identify cues that our most basic needs are not being met . This method should help increase your self-awareness and set you on the path towards a more fulfilling life . <p> Dr. Michael Eason is a psychologist and US licensed therapist practising at MindnLife in Central , Hong Kong .

@@41365239 <h> Swiss real estate for Chinese investors <p> The acquisition of Swiss real estate by non-Swiss residents is regulated by the Swiss Federal Act on the Acquisition of Real Estate by Persons Abroad , commonly referred to as Lex Koller ( Arnold Koller was the Swiss federal councillor of justice at the time of the most recent amendment of the act ) . <p> While Swiss legislation is very liberal regarding the acquisition of commercial real estate by foreign investors , Lex Koller imposes significant restrictions on acquisitions of residential real estate . This applies in essence to both asset and share deals concerning real estate . <p> Asset or share deal . Like domestic acquirers , foreign investors can purchase Swiss real estate either directly ( asset deal ) or indirectly by acquiring shares in a real estate company ( share deal ) . The asset deal agreement must be authenticated by a Swiss notary public , and be filed and -- to complete transfer of the ownership -- registered in the land register of the district or state where the real estate is located . The share transfer agreement is typically in writing ( no notarial involvement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the respective share certificates , or by the execution of a transfer deed . <p> Acquisition of commercial real estate . A foreign investor may acquire Swiss real estate , which serves a commercial purpose such as a manufacturing site , warehouse , office or retail space . The commercial activities do not need to be carried out by the foreign investor . He or she can , for instance , acquire and rent out commercial properties to tenants who carry out their commercial activities . No permit is required from Lex Koller authorities to purchase such commercial properties . In the case of an asset deal , the foreign investor only has to declare to the land register , in writing , that he or she has acquired the property for commercial use . Likewise , no Lex Koller permit is required for the acquisition of commercial real estate by means of a share deal . The foreign investor , however , has to declare to the Commercial Registry , in writing , that he or she has acquired control over the company and ( indirectly acquired ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vacant land parcels or parcels with buildings to be demolished , however , typically requires a filing with the Lex Koller authority of the district or canton where the real estate is located . Such authority will issue a declaratory order to the land register or the Commercial Registry if it is established that the zoning laws permit the commercial use , and that the lot is not over-sized for the intended commercial use and building project . <p> The order typically also includes a duty to start the commercial use and building project within a specified time , and imposes the duty to sell the property , if such development does not occur within the time limit set . <p> Acquisition of residential real estate . Investors who are neither Swiss nor EU/EFTA ( European Free Trade Association ) citizens , such as Chinese investors , are only in exceptional cases permitted to acquire Swiss residential real estate . Most notably , a Chinese citizen with residence in Switzerland is entitled to purchase real estate for his or her dwelling without the need for a permit from Lex Koller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the land register , in writing , that he or she has acquired the property for the purposes of his primary residence . Further , in some tourist areas of Switzerland , a foreign investor may be granted a permit to purchase a secondary residence . The number of such permits is limited , and since 2012 the construction of new secondary residences in many tourist areas of Switzerland is restricted . <p> The acquisition of a residential property company with shares listed on a Swiss stock exchange is not subject to a permit , however , once the foreign investors hold more than one-third of the voting or company capital no further residential property can be acquired . <p> Circumvention of Lex Koller . Circumventing Lex Koller can lead to criminal prosecution . Acquisitions of Swiss real estate are in general null and void if a circumvention of Lex Koller is established . There are notable cases where the Swiss Supreme Court has declared Swiss corporations , which were established to conceal non-permitted real estate acquisitions , null and void , and the respective real estate confiscated in favour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of perennial or otherwise unusual rental agreements , financing of real estate by unusually high loans , appointing a fiduciary with Swiss nationality , etc . ) . <p> Letting of real estate .

Usually , commercial rental agreements run for an extended period such as 10 years , and termination before the agreed period is possible only for good cause . On the contrary , the general period of notice for residential property is three to six months . <p> It is important to note that the Swiss legal provisions governing tenancy provide strong protection of the tenant 's rights and interests . For example , the tenant has the right to ask the competent authority to examine the rent or to extend the lease period because of abusive termination . <p> The general client-focus of the Swiss authorities in connection with the legal certainty in Switzerland creates an interesting business environment for investments in the Swiss real estate sector . <p> Dr Roland Mueller is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in construction and real estate law .

There is not much serious dispute on legal rights ; even rich people who lose a case would rather have had a fair hearing . The controversial rights are political . <p> The most controversial is the right to vote . This , unfortunately , distracts from the central issue , which is not democracy , but representation .

@@41423232 <h> Chinese University head calls for independent inquiry after hearing 20 student accounts of abuse in police custody <p> The head of the Chinese University of Hong Kong ( CUHK ) has said that around 20 students have reported unreasonable treatment by police after they were arrested during protests . He said he will urge Chief Executive Carrie Lam to order an independent investigation because of " mistrust " in existing complaint mechanisms . <p> CUHK Vice-Chancellor Rocky Tuan penned a 2,000-word open letter after a dialogue with students last week , where a student publicly accused the police of " sexual violence " when she was arrested and detained at a police station . After the session ended , Tuan stayed for another closed-door session to listen to students . <p> " I fully recognised that in the face of such unprecedented challenges to our community , the University might not have done enough for our students , even though we owe our responsibilities to many different stakeholders , " Tuan said .

Of those , around 20 said they had received unreasonable treatment of varying degrees of severity . <p> Access to lawyers <p> Tuan said most students reported that their requests for timely communication with their lawyers or families were refused .

Other students said they were not given the medication they needed , including a student with asthma who waited for six hours to be treated , Tuan added . <p> Photo : CUHK . <p> One student who had suffered a head injury was only sent to a hospital after 18 hours in detention , Tuan said . More than one student said they were slapped in the face while giving a statement or during detention , and two said they were forced to strip naked by a police officer of the same sex in the search room , despite having been told of no reason why this was needed , Tuan added . <p> " These are not isolated incidents but serious allegations from a human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unacceptable if bodily harm was inflicted , " Tuan wrote .

@@41423233 <h> In defence of the freedom not to speak on Hong Kong 's protests <p> An ominous new tune has appeared in the repertoire of the Hong Kong government 's chorus of approval . <p> Organisations of all kinds are being told that it is not enough to be silent on Hong Kong 's current problems . They have an obligation to speak out against violence . This is a polite way of saying they should speak out against rioters . The other form of violence is acceptable . <p> This started , I think , with a Mr Edwin Choy , who tried to get the Bar Association to issue a formal condemnation of violence and , having failed , resigned as Vice Chairman of the Association to take his complaint to the general public . <p> This idea has now been taken up by less learned pens and directed in an increasing number of directions . <p> I must say that Mr Choy , though I respect his willingness to stand up publicly for his views , seems to have some odd ideas . The Bar Association is a fine body of men and women , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people in Hong Kong who regard it as a persuasive source of ethical advice . <p> Will the average rioter , on hearing that the Bar Association disapproves of his activities , feel compelled to drop his plastic pole and go home ? Will the proverbial man on the Shau Kei Wan tram be swayed from his sympathy for the water people by the thought that his views are not shared by some of Hong Kong 's most expensive lawyers ? <p> Edwin Choy . Photo : Apple Daily . <p> I realise the Bar Association is near the beginning of the alphabet , so we may be seeing the mere tip of an iceberg , as the forces of obedience work their way from the Automobile Association to the Zoological Gardens Fan Club in search of societies they can persuade to take a stand for law and order . <p> The consensus among contributors to the pro-Carrie press seems to be that the disorders are subsiding gradually , and this process can be sped up if the general population is persuaded to be turned off by violence . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state newspaper China Daily under the name of Ms Christine Loh . It was quite persuasive , until you got to the authority for the theory that things were quietening down , which turned out to be none other than that model of sanity and sagacity Mr Donald Trump . <p> Well , I have two misgivings about the latest trend , one concerning the Bar Association and one concerning societies generally . <p> Photo : Studio Incendo . <p> As far as the Bar Association is concerned it is , as Mr Choy would presumably argue , a buttress and supporter of the Rule of Law , and should be against activities which break the law . <p> As no doubt it is . We have not , though , been treated to regular , or even occasional , comments from the Bar Association on the iniquities of whichever felonies are currently fashionable , and I do not think we should . <p> As officers of the court , it behoves barristers to observe the polite fiction that anyone arrested by the police is innocent until found guilty in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ completed trials for violent offences committed in the course of the current disturbances Mr Choy seems to be asking for a mass jump to conclusions on the strength of media reports . <p> I am not personally in favour of violence and I am too old for that shit anyway , but if I was an alleged rioter I would prefer not to be told in advance of the hearing that the Bar had arrived at a joint view that I and people like me were guilty . <p> Photo : May James/HKFP . <p> As far as societies , in general , are concerned , no doubt some of them lean one way politically and some of them lean the other . But quite a lot , I am sure , would rather be allowed not to explore their members ' views on such matters . <p> If people join your club to explore shared interests then it is a good idea to avoid divisive topics not relevant to those interests .

The suggestion that people must speak out on a particular topic in a particular way is reminiscent of one of the many depressing periods in China 's history when the Party demanded not only obedience but adulation . <p> A victim at the time observed that he was not only not free to speak ; he was also not free not to speak . Let 's not go there . <p> Photo : Tom Grundy/HKFP . <p> Personally , I hate violence .

But decades after the collapse of the communist regime , some East German brands are once again thriving . <p> To see what life was like as a consumer in the former East Germany , the best place to start is at a museum . At Berlin 's DDR Museum , Stefan Wolle points to a cabinet filled with packages of coffee and sugar covered with simple labeling . <p> " We did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ historian for the museum , said . " But the quality was generally better than people said later after reunification . " <p> In the years immediately following German reunification in 1990 , over 14,000 East German companies were privatized and as many as four million East German workers lost their jobs . Even companies that made well-respected products were swallowed up by the tide of Western goods that soon flooded into what are now known as the " new federal states " in eastern Germany . <p> " The good items from quality East German brands sat on the shelves and were n't sold , " Nils Busch-Petersen , the head of Berlin 's retail association said . " People 's consumer preferences changed literally overnight . " <p> East Germans , who had long had access to West German television and could see , but not sample , Western consumer goods , associated those products with a standard of living that had been denied to them behind the Berlin Wall . <p> There were plenty of products that consumers had good reason to shun , from the cramped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dozen or more years to buy or the polyester clothes that were a staple of East German fashion due to a shortage of cotton . <p> " I would n't really want to have any of the old East German chocolate again , " laughed Busch-Petersen , a lifelong East Berliner . <p> But at some point in the mid-1990s , things began to change and East Germans rediscovered their love of the products they had grown up with . Although some critics called the trend " Ostalgie " and accused East Germans of wanting to turn back the clock and return to Communism , Busch-Petersen said the charges were unfounded . <p> " First , they recognized , that emperor has no clothes , that we also cook with water and that many products really were comparable , " Busch-Petersen told Deutsche Welle . <p> " Second , people realized there was a relationship between the quality of their lives and their consumer preferences , " he continued . " They 'd go buy a different washing powder and suddenly the wash powder factory around the corner was about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ German stuff anymore . " <p> Indeed , East German washing powder is still available and can be found in an entire store full of other goods with East German origins in a store just a few meters from Alexanderplatz in central Berlin . <p> Known as Ostpaket , the store 's name is a play on words and recalls the days when Germany was divided . Families living in the West could send their eastern relatives so-called Westpaket , care packages filled with clothes , western foods and other items -- with the East German government collecting a share of the sale of each box . <p> T <p> he store is one of dozens across the former East Germany that caters to East Germans who are looking for the goods they grew up with . Inside Ostpaket , owner Bianca Schaeler said the East German goods were competitive with western rivals on both price and quality . <p> Pointing to a shelf full of various flavors of the East German coffee brand Rondo , she said product development has n't stopped since the Wall fell and the company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Many Germans from the " new states , " as East Germany is now known , make Rondo and fellow East German coffee brand Mocha Fix Gold their brew of choice , Schaeler said the brands have become popular in western Germany , too , thanks to discount chains which aggressively push the labels as a cheap , quality substitute for Jacobs and other big German coffees . <p> Perhaps the most successful brand to have survived communism and thrive since then is Germany 's biggest sparkling wine brand , Rotk ? ppchen , which means Red Riding Hood . The winery , based in the state of Saxony-Anhalt , dates back to 1856 and was expropriated by the East German regime after World War Two . <p> After reunification , the company was privatized and has thrived since then , selling hundreds of millions of bottles of bubbly annually . In 2002 , Rotk ? ppchen even managed to buy one of its biggest rivals , the West German Mumm winery , which has given Rotk ? ppchen a lock on about 40 percent of the German @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ppchen access to more premium markets for its wares , a strategy other East German brands have tried as well , running in the face of long-held stereotypes of poor quality . <p> Another company that successfully tried that tactic is Zeha , a shoe company that was once the Adidas of East Germany . Founded in 1897 in the eastcentral state of Thuringia , it become the only sport shoe maker in East Germany after World War Two and supplied most of the country 's sports teams and also the Soviet national soccer team but after reunification , Zeha foundered . <p> " All the people were keen to wear Western brands , Adidas and Nike , and on the other hand they lost their sport market as well , so all of a sudden they lost everything they had and needed to close down , " said Torsten Heine , who , along with a friend , bought the rights to the name and re-founded the brand a few years ago . <p> The shoes are modeled on old Zeha models , including soccer boots and track shoes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as hand-stitched Italian leather . Prices start around ? 200 ( $222 ) and climb much higher . <p> Although Zehas are no longer a shoe for the masses -- or for athletes -- Heine says that 's beside the point and that the brand captures the mystique of the era . <p> " I always had a pair , and it was forbidden to wear them in your spare time because it was difficult to get a pair , but we did anyway because it was cool , " Heine told Deutsche Welle . <p> The brand has taken off in fashion circles and hip shoe stores worldwide now stock Zehas , including boutiques in New York and Tokyo . But what is perhaps even more symbolic is that the brand is available across Berlin in its own stores and other high-end boutiques across the capital . Decades after the fall of the Berlin Wall , an East German brand is being treated as a luxury item. -DW

Efforts are underway to get the last of the demonstrators still within the premises to leave safely even as a police siege continues . Photo : Reuters <h> PolyU siege must end , allowing remaining students to leave <p> On Nov. 17 , fierce clashes erupted between police and protesters who had gathered at the Hong Kong Polytechnic University ( PolyU ) and adjacent areas . <p> By nightfall , over a thousand people , including students and others , were encircled and trapped inside the campus by police . <p> The siege of the PolyU raised widespread concerns among society , with citizens wondering if a tragedy of immense proportions was in the making . <p> Fortunately , through the untiring efforts of many people -- including some secondary school principals and a group of lawyers -- in mediation and negotiating between the law enforcement personnel and the students , the standoff saw a major de-escalation , with hundreds of people allowed to leave the besieged campus peacefully . <p> After having earlier fired dozens of tear gas canisters into the PolyU compound and deployed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the police eventually agreed to open up a designated exit for students and others trapped inside the university to leave . <p> Yet as it turned out , whoever attempted to escape through that exit was immediately arrested by the police , an action that prompted the rest of the crowd to retreat back into the campus . <p> Worse still , while the police deployed a large number of officers to lay siege to the PolyU , it also declared that all those who were inside the university compound would be charged with rioting . As one can imagine , the atmosphere both inside and outside the PolyU was extremely tense . <p> Here , we feel compelled to point out that many of those who were trapped inside the PolyU last Monday night were not protesters , but rather , teaching staff and students of the university , as well as some unsuspecting secondary school students who were visiting the campus the day before . <p> After the failed bid of Joseph Ha Chi-shing , the Auxiliary Bishop of the Catholic Diocese of Hong Kong , a number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the scene .

Yet it was n't until March 2005 that Tung finally resigned , citing health issues . <p> Likewise , in 2014 , then chief executive Leung Chun-ying saw his popularity hit rock-bottom following the Occupy Movement .

When the guarantor reviews the documents presented by the beneficiary , if the documents are totally consistent with the provisions of the guarantee and superficially consistent with one another , the guarantor must undertake the payment obligation without the need to review the performance of the underlying contract , pursuant to the Uniform Rules for Demand Guarantees . <p> Blake YangSenior AssociateMartin Hu &amp; Partners <p> The performance of the underlying contract is not an item the guarantor must review when making the payment , but in practice the court will usually examine this factor once a guarantee fraud occurs . A typical case in this regard is of guarantee fraud under dispute involving Eastern Property , Anhui Foreign Economic Construction Group ( AFECC ) , a bank in Costa Rica , and Anhui Branch of China Construction Bank Corporation ( CCB Anhui ) . As the developer , Eastern signed a construction contract with the contractor , AFECC , and the actual construction company , AFECC Central America @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eastern applied for payment of the amount under the guarantee to the guarantor bank on account of AFECC Central America 's default . <p> Considering that China had not explicitly stipulated independent guarantee or guarantee fraud when the case was heard , the People 's High Court of Anhui province drew the principle of fraud exception set out under international general practice and international treaties , and judged the conduct of the beneficiary Eastern to constitute a guarantee fraud . Under this case , the Anhui court asserted that it was necessary to perform a review of the performance of the underlying contract during the trial of a dispute pertaining to guarantee fraud . <p> After AFECC had submitted an effective overseas arbitration award acknowledging that AFECC Central America had not incurred a default event , the court thought that AFECC had performed its obligations under the underlying contract , and therefore Eastern had no right to claim payment . <p> In November 2016 , the Supreme People 's Court ( SPC ) issued a judicial interpretation entitled the Provisions Regarding Several Issues during the Trial of Cases Involving Independent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ independent guarantee in China . Apart from specifying the definition of independent guarantee , the provisions also stipulate the events that must constitute a guarantee fraud under article 12 : ( 1 ) The beneficiary and the guarantee applicant or other persons collude to fabricate an underlying transaction ; ( 2 ) Third-party documents submitted by the beneficiary are counterfeit or untrue in content ; ( 3 ) The court judgment or arbitration award asserts that the debtor under the underlying transaction bears no liability of payment or compensation ; ( 4 ) The beneficiary confirms the full performance of the debt under the underlying contract or confirms the mature payment event indicated on the independent guarantee has not occurred ; ( 5 ) Other situations where the beneficiary is clearly aware of no claim for payment but still abuses such right . <p> At the same time , the provisions specifically mention that when trying a dispute involving the guarantee fraud , the court must review the above-mentioned events to determine facts pertaining to the underlying transaction . Notwithstanding the provisions , even if the guarantee applicant can prove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it does not necessarily mean that the beneficiary 's claim constitutes a guarantee fraud , and the court will still need to judge the correlation between the claim for payment under the guarantee and the debt under the independent guarantee . <p> Franz LiAssociateMartin Hu &amp; Partners <p> Pursuant to the provisions , the Nanjing Intermediate People 's Court tried a tort dispute between CSUN , a Nanjing-based photovoltaic subsidiary of China Electric Equipment Group , and Alpha Company , and it is to date the only guarantee fraud case that can be searched through public channels following the issuance of the provisions . The guarantee under the case indicated that where CSUN fails to issue a new guarantee 15 days before the expiration of the current guarantee , the beneficiary , Alpha Company , can claim compensation form the bank . The expiry date of the guarantee under the case was 31 December 2013 , and the new guarantee CSUN had applied for was issued on 25 December 2013 , so Alpha Company decided to claim compensation . <p> After Alpha Company submitted the claim application , CSUN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the guarantee specified that the guarantee must remain in effect for another two months upon expiration , so the expiry date must be 28 February 2014 , and that Alpha Company did not have reason for a claim , but had committed a guarantee fraud . CSUN asserted that Alpha Company had committed a guarantee fraud on the grounds that Alpha Company had violated a catch-all clause ( article 12 ) specified in the provisions , that is , " other situations where the beneficiary is clearly aware of no claim for payment but still abuses such right " . <p> The court confirmed that CSUN had performed the debt under the underlying contract , but Alpha Company had claimed the payment based on a different understanding of the effective period of the guarantee than that of CSUN , instead of the performance of the debt under the underlying contract , and judged Alpha Company did not abuse a right while clearly aware of no right to claim the payment . Therefore , the court rejected CSUN 's claim . <p> From these two cases and the contents of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the court or arbitration commission to confirm a guarantee fraud , the guarantee applicant must bear the burden to prove the events listed by article 12 , and in particular prove the debt under the underlying contract has been fully performed ( unless the debt under the underlying contract does not relate to the right to claim the payment under the guarantee ) . For this reason , if the court judgment or arbitration award asserts that the guarantee applicant has not committed a default under the underlying contract , the judgment or award will be strong evidence supporting the guarantee applicant under the litigation or arbitration involving the guarantee fraud . <p> Blake Yang is a senior associate and Franz Li is an associate at Martin Hu &amp; Partners <p> Cross-border settlement can be directly enforced in the courts of signatories <p> 18 December 2019 <p> Established in 2006 , Vantage Asia is an independent business-to-business publisher based in Hong Kong .

@@50321233 <h> Brexit does not matter <p> The contours of the nineteenth and early twentieth century were defined in part by a series of consequential British foreign policy and economic decisions . As recently as 2007-2009 , British policy affected global outcomes : whereas deregulation of the City of London contributed to the severity of the global financial crisis , British leadership at the London G20 summit in April 2009 ultimately proved a stabilizing influence . Today , however , despite all the political theater and dramatic rhetoric , Britain 's impending exit from the European Union -- Brexit -- really does not matter for the world . <p> The global economy may have hit a patch of uncertainty , but this is more due to the mercurial actions of US President Donald Trump , self-proclaimed " Tariff Man , " who seems intent on undermining the credibility of the Federal Reserve , disrupting supply chains , and negotiating through random pronouncements . <p> The eurozone is struggling to break out of its prolonged agonies , but the fundamental problem remains bad banking practices and potentially unsustainable public finances in some member countries . While Brexit may well prove an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the likely impact is lower British growth , not a significant disruption of regional , let alone global , trade . <p> It is hard to overstate British influence over global affairs after it became the cradle of the Industrial Revolution . From about 1750 , British inventions created a wave of technological innovation that transformed how power was generated and how metal was worked . Railways and steam ships revolutionized transportation . Even when the center of innovation shifted across the Atlantic , British capital and emigration supported industrialization around the world . <p> Not all British contributions were positive , of course . Britain 's rise as a global power was accompanied by the horrors of the Atlantic slave trade and the many abuses of colonial rule . But there is no question that British actions -- good and bad -- were consequential for many people , some of whom lived far away . British alliances and willingness to intervene militarily shaped European wars , from Napoleon through the German invasions of France in 1870 , 1914 , and 1940 . Neville Chamberlain 's policy of appeasement -- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conference with Adolf Hitler -- had a major impact on the timing , nature , and perhaps even the eventual outcome of World War II . <p> The UK 's peak global influence was probably in 1940-1941 , when it stood essentially alone against the seemingly unstoppable might of Nazi Germany . Ironically , America 's entry into the war both tipped the balance decisively against Hitler and soon led to a complete makeover of the world economy . <p> The 1944 Bretton Woods conference made it clear that the era of European empire was over . Also gone was privileged trade within economic zones established by previous waves of imperial expansion . Post-World War II trading arrangements were determined by American preferences . With US business , labor , and politicians unanimous in wanting access to all markets , successive rounds of trade liberalization followed . <p> In 1945 , the British Empire contained more than 600 million people , about one-quarter of everyone alive , making it ( briefly ) the most populous political entity ever on the planet . In subsequent decades , the UK 's global @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , including the spectacular humiliation suffered during the Suez Crisis of 1956 , and gross macroeconomic mismanagement . In 1976 , Britain became the only country issuing an international reserve currency that has been forced to borrow from the International Monetary Fund during the ( post-1973 ) era of floating exchange rates . <p> Nothing about this loss of global influence can be attributed to Britain 's membership of the EU . Overall , Britain has done well from post-war trade , about half of which is currently with Europe . The UK 's total trade ( exports plus imports ) was around 40 percent of GDP during the 1950s ; it currently runs closer to 60 percent , with most of that increase occurring after the country joined the European Economic Community in 1973 . More broadly , active participation in the global economy over the past four decades has helped close the gap ( in terms of GDP per capita ) with the United States . <p> Perhaps there is a mad version of Brexit that could have ramifications beyond British shores , but that seems far-fetched . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wants to restore protectionist tariffs to the level of the 1930s . Also unlike the US , no prominent official in Britain is keen to gamble again with the country 's future by weakening financial regulation . <p> Most of the British political elite seem just as out of touch with global reality as their predecessors were in 1938 , 1944 , and 1956 . The world has moved on , again . A chaotic Brexit could do great damage to ordinary people -- as was the case with Britain 's self-ejection from the Exchange Rate Mechanism of the European Monetary System in 1992 . <p> But those ordinary people will be overwhelmingly British .

" <p> Leong said he initially chose to share the article because the 1MDB scandal was of public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so much reporting on Singapore 's involvement in 1MDB , people should get more detailed answers . " <p> Three days later , Leong removed the post after receiving a notice from Singapore 's Info-communications Media Development Authority ( IMDA ) . <p> Leong conceded that , by the time the IMDA asked him to take down the post , he had already realised that some of the article 's claims were in dispute . <p> Nevertheless , Leong said he was " quite surprised " that Lee chose to only target him for the lawsuit , instead of the article 's author , publisher or other readers who shared it . <p> Leong added that Lee and the IMDA sent mixed signals : " I thought , oh maybe it was a crossed wire in communication -- the left hand does n't know what the right hand is doing .

@@50331239 <h> #MeToo in 2018 : As long as we keep sympathising with abusers , there will be no justice <p> Dictionary Merriam-Webster chose " justice " as the word of the year 2018 , saying it was the website 's top lookup of the year . With this news , we should reflect on how justice has materialized for women in Asia , especially those who experience gender-based violence . The answer is unfortunately not encouraging . Recent court cases , from Malaysia to Indonesia , from Hong Kong to China , highlight that the legal system not only fails to protect but also is very hostile and punitive toward women survivors . <p> Photo : Wikicommons . <p> Take for example , the case of Indonesian sexual harassment victim Baiq Nuril Maknun . In November , the Indonesian Supreme Court sentenced Nuril to six months in jail , and fined her 500 million rupiah ( US$34,000 ) , for spreading " indecent content " of the phone conversation between her and her boss , school principal Haji Muslim , who she said was sexually harassing her . In the ruling , which was available online in mid-December , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Murwahyuni , laid out the reason : " Because of the defendant 's action , the career of the witness Haji Muslim as school principal ended . His extended family was shamed , and his dignity was violated . " In contrast to Nuril 's fate , Haji Muslim not only walked free -- he also got promoted . <p> In neighbouring Malaysia , a single mother was caught soliciting sex and brought to the Terengganu Sharia High Court . She pleaded guilty and asked for leniency , saying that she had to resort to prostitution to support her family because her former husband did n't give her alimony or financial support since their divorce . The court was unmoved and sentenced her in September to six months in jail and ordered six strokes of caning . Her client was reportedly released without charge , while her deadbeat ex-husband faced no consequences for inflicting financial abuse on the family . <p> China finally got its anti-domestic violence law two years ago , but treatment toward survivors is still appalling . In a recent court case , a judge in Chengdu @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " is a traditional value " and " to give the man the husband a chance . " He also said the beating the woman endured was not domestic violence because it was not " chronic " . <p> As Human Rights Watch pointed out , the judge 's decision did n't have any legal basis . Not only the new law does n't require the assault to be " chronic " to be considered domestic violence , but also , according to the country 's marriage law , domestic violence is a ground for divorce . <p> Even in Hong Kong , which prides itself as a rare place in Asia with a robust legal system , hostility toward survivors remains common . In the city 's first #MeToo trial in November , the magistrate not only acquitted the 77-year-old coach who an athlete accused of sexually assaulting her years before . He also questioned why the athlete did n't stop the alleged assault and pointed out she remained close to the coach afterwards . <p> In a much less known case , the city 's Court of Appeal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appeal the decision of the family court that gave her less parenting time . The higher court said in August that they agreed with the family court judge that the mother had tried to " undermine " the relationship between the abusive father and the child , calling her efforts to raise the issue of domestic violence in the custody proceedings " a campaign against the father " . The Court of Appeal judges not only refused her a chance to redress justice , but also punished the survivor , a mother who tried to protect her child from abuse , with paying her abuser 's legal costs of HK$50,000 ( US$6,400 ) . <p> These cases highlight how courts and judges are still steeped in gender biases and myths . They fail to understand that it 's normal for a person to freeze during an attack -- it is , in fact , one of the three most common reactions to danger , along with fight and flight . Moreover , research has shown that survivors often take time to process the trauma , come forward and report the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the victim . <p> File photo : Tam Wai . <p> Domestic abuse is one of the most common reasons for divorce , and according to common sense , it is better for children not to be raised by abusive parents . Yet , an abused mother who seeks a divorce from her abusive husband and tries to protect her children from him runs the risk of being seen as a vindictive woman . After all , as the misogynist saying goes , " hell hath no fury as women scorned . " <p> The illogical reasoning behind the Hong Kong ruling that accused a mother who had concerns about domestic abuse of trying to " undermine " the father-child relationship , seems to be based on a pseudo-scientific theory called parental alienation . Concocted by American psychologist Richard Gardner , who condoned paedophilia ( and defended Woody Allen in his child abuse allegation ) , parental alienation accuses parents , usually mothers , who try to protect their children from domestic abuse , including child sexual abuse , of trying to " estrange " the children from the abusive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against women . Two separate studies carried out in the US and the UK show that judges tend to disbelieve mothers who bring up domestic violence , label them as being " difficult " or " manipulative " , and may even punish them by transferring child custody to abusive fathers . The Court of Appeal 's ruling is likely creating a legal precedent to punish abuse survivors in the city 's family court proceedings . <p> Justice delayed is justice denied . But very often , survivors are denied justice , period . The human rights and dignity of survivors are frequently trampled by the legal system . Feminist psychiatrist Judith Herman made an astute observation : " The legal system is designed to protect men from the superior power of the state but not to protect women and children from the superior power of men . " Instead of getting justice -- and protection from their perpetrators -- they are victim-blamed , and worse , punished the very system that is supposed to protect them . <p> Contrast this to the treatment given to violent and abusive men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gain sympathy . This year , in her book " Down Girl : The Logic of Misogyny " , Professor Kate Manne gave us the term " himpathy " , defined as " the inappropriate and disproportionate sympathy powerful men often enjoy in cases of sexual assault , intimate partner violence , homicide and other misogynistic behaviour . " Sounds familiar ? <p> Judge Kavanaugh and Dr. Ford . Photo : C-Span screenshot . <p> Himpathy was bestowed to Brett Kavanaugh , who was confirmed by the US Senate in October to be the newest Supreme Court Justice despite multiple sexual misconduct allegations . Himpathy is also bestowed to men who harass , assault and abuse women in Asia . As long as there is himpathy , there wo n't be justice .

He asked me to sample some to taste the difference . <p> Unlike other vertical farmers who focus on locally produced vegetables , Swan said he is focused on " high-margin " crops to break even on the cost . " We are paying real estate here , electricity , a lot of manpower . So we need to make sure that we can grow products that will break even . " <p> Swan made a breakthrough last year when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time the fruit has been produced locally in Singapore . It took him four months to get it right and involved the introduction of bees into the space to help with pollination . <p> " Pollination to date has been done by hand with a forensic brush . It 's very laborious and you 'll never get it as perfect as a bee can , " he said . " So we 're expecting the yield to increase a further 40 to 50 percent just by bringing the bees into the space . " <p> That is something , I am told , has never been done before and I saw the bees myself . He said he rotates the insects so they have a lifestyle of both outdoors and indoors . <p> Sustenir now grows kale , lettuce , arugula , strawberries and tomatoes .

But , he prefers products with a shorter lifecycle because they are more feasible from a business perspective . <p> After five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sustenir broke even in 2018 with year-on-year revenue growth of about 83 percent and margins of around 40 to 45 percent EBITDA figures . And Swan aims to expand further . He plans to add another 50,000 square feet to the current 10,000 square feet already in operation in Singapore , and , on top of that , a new 50,000-square-foot facility in Hong Kong . <p> When I talked to Swan in January , Sustenir had just completed a series A funding round . <p> " Given it 's a sunrise industry , a lot of investors were a bit hesitant about investing in this space . They want more proven cases in order to invest , " he said , adding that it was n't easy . It took seven months and a lot of road shows before finding investors . <p> When I pressed Swan to reveal who the cornerstone investors were , he said they " potentially " included a sovereign wealth fund investor . <p> Swan said he is in the process of developing his own artificial intelligence system called " SARA " -- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monitor the lifecycle of the plants and how they are doing . As he integrates robotics in the growing process , Swan said he sees vertical farming existing alongside traditional farming and that he wants to work with outdoor farmers to help them use smart technology to help optimize their farming . <p> After five years building up Sustenir , Swan said his entrepreneurial instincts came naturally to him : " I definitely surprised myself and never in my wildest dreams thought I 'd be an entrepreneur . " <p> He still faces challenges finding good people because farming does not resonate well with many in the younger generation of workers . <p> " When people think of farming , they think of it in the soil , in the sun . It 's not until we bring them into this environment that they actually go ' wow , this is pretty cool . ' We like to think of ourselves as more of a tech company . We 're actually using technology to create great products . " <p> Looking ahead , Swan said he wants Sustenir to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tall ambitions for a vertical farmer , but he 's confident he will get consumers buying into the vision .

From pbs.org <p> One of America 's most celebrated poets , who spent his later years as a Zen Buddhist practitioner and environmental conservationist in Hawaii , died in his sleep on 15 March . William Stanley Merwin was honored twice as US Poet Laureate , won one National Book Award , two Pulitzer Prizes , and further praise over a span of seven decades . <p> Born in New York City in 1927 , Merwin studied poetry at Princeton under acclaimed writers Richard Blackmur ( 1904 -- 65 ) and John Berryman ( 1914 -- 72 ) , and later tutored for the rebellious and freethinking Robert Graves ( 1895 -- 1985 ) . Merwin 's work grappled with his observation of humanity in a steady state of conflict and self-destruction . <p> The poet and critic Reginald Shepherd described his early work , written during the American war in Vietnam : " These are poems not written to an agenda but that create an agenda .

Poet Edward Hirsch wrote that Merwin " is one of the greatest poets of our age . He is a rare spiritual presence in American life and letters ( the Thoreau of our era ) .

@@50518237 <h> Behind Narendra Modi 's media phobia <p> During his five-year tenure as prime minister of India , Narendra Modi has never addressed an open press conference , or even engaged with a select group of journalists . He has instead relied on directly reaching out to people through social media . His reign has marked a hostile , antagonistic flare-up between the treasury benches and the media without a thaw or pause . <p> Ever since the day in 2007 when he walked out of a television interview with Karan Thapar , one of India 's leading TV interviewers , Modi let an inner view rigidify that the media , especially the national English-language media based in Delhi , were viscerally antagonistic to him . It seems that he thought that since the media would always be unfair to him , he was not answerable to them . <p> Within minutes of the interview being recorded for CNN-IBN , in which Thapar began his questions with phrases like " members of the Muslim community call you a mass murderer on your face , " " you are like a modern-day Nero , " and " justice has not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out . Before leaving he said , " I thought we were friends . But your continued hostility towards me tells me it is best to let you continue your tirade . " <p> In the run-up to the general election of 2014 , he called such journalists " news traders . " Modi and several of his Bharatiya Janata Party 's senior leaders , besides millions of his diehard followers , are convinced that if most , if not all , journalists , certainly those dubbed " Lutyens media , " have been co-opted into echoing the Congress party narrative and are brazenly corrupt . <p> " Keep your anti-Modi narrative going , Rajdeep. " he told Rajdeep Sardesai , a prominent TV journalist , in an interview long before he became prime minister . When Sardesai mentioned the phrase " merchant of death " ( Maut ka saudagar ) , an invective hurled at Modi first by Congress leader Sonia Gandhi , Modi retorted with barely masked disgust , " For years , your only job has been to abuse Modi . I am told journalists like you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upper house of Parliament or a Padma Shri one of the highest civilian awards . " <p> Those were among the last instances of when Modi , as the chief minister of Gujarat , tried to mend fences with the English or Delhi media . The relationship between the two went sour after the fateful Gujarat riots of 2002 . <h> Bypassing the media <p> Since he never trusted the media , Modi focused on developing an alternative space to reach out to the people directly . By 2013 , he had built one of the most impressive social-media presences . He chose to address and interact with people directly online . Meanwhile , the traditional media passively gazed and reported from a show millions had already seen or had perhaps even directly participated in , and thus reduced their importance . <p> Like most leaders in the right-wing Hindutva space , Modi had always been distrustful of the media because it was dominated by " decadent liberals " and " leftists .

They joined Facebook , Twitter and YouTube , besides creating their own websites and Instagram and LinkedIn accounts , among others . With social media becoming a crucial part of the armory of rich politicians , along came professional account managers . And trolls . <h> Trolls and politics <p> By strategy or accident , these five years have marked , simultaneously , both the decline of the Indian media , firmly defenestrated from their heyday no longer perceived as an important connection between leaders and the public , and the rise of paid trolls .

In turn , anti-Modi persons were called the following : " Sickularists , " a twist on the word secular ; " Prestitutes , " a juxtaposition of press and prostitutes ; " Libtards , " meaning liberal retards ; and so on . <p> Then came the designation " anti-national . " Once the BJP and Modi brought nationalism to the center through a posse of issues , underlying which was the principle of " you ca n't question me or you are an ' anti-national .

Today , one section of the media has lost credibility , and ironically , the other has lost its audience and advertising revenues . <p> The only media interactions Modi has had since his term began have been a few exclusive interviews granted to obsequious scribes . Rather than ask the prime minister questions , they provided prompts for him to continue to pontificate as in his public speeches on such occasions as completing three or four years of his term . <p> Prime Minister Modi did not even address the media after a terror attack in Kashmir 's Pulwama took the lives of more than 40 police personnel and shook the nation .

@@50540240 <h> Review of draft Patent Rules finds faults <p> India is again in the process of amending its Patent Rules to bring them in line with the spirit of national intellectual property rights ( IPR ) policy and the government 's initiatives of " Make in India " and " Start-up India " . <p> Vidisha GargPartnerAnand and Anand <p> The Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion ( DIPP ) unveiled the IPR policy on 13 May 2016 with the objective of nurturing IP culture in the country , and guiding and enabling creators and inventors to realize their potential for generating , protecting and utilizing IP , which would contribute to wealth creation , employment opportunities and business development . <p> In view of the policy , the Patent Rules , 2003 , were extensively amended in 2016 to include new provisions of expedited examination , inclusion of definition of start-ups , and having shorter and stricter timelines . Furthering this , the DIPP on 4 December 2018 published the draft Patent ( Amendment ) Rules , 2018 . The key highlights of the proposed draft are : <p> All documents for international applications to be submitted online @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave , mark , or give all the documents only by electronic transmission . Original documents such as power of attorney , priority documents , proof of rights , etc. , are to be submitted in original within a period of 15 days , failing which they will be deemed not to have been filed . <p> Expansion of beneficiary list to expedite examination . The 2016 amendment had brought in rule 24C for expediting the examination of patent applications . Applications can be examined faster if an application to this effect is made by the applicant on two grounds , namely : ( i ) that India has been indicated as the competent international searching authority or international preliminary examining authority in the corresponding international application ; and ( ii ) that the applicant is a startup . <p> The proposed rules , 2018 , aim to expand this coverage to : ( i ) small entities ; ( ii ) female applicants ; ( iii ) government undertakings ; and ( iv ) an applicant who is eligible under an arrangement for processing an international application pursuant to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patent office . <p> This amendment particularly aims to ratify the recent agreement between the DIPP and the Japan Patent Office ( JPO ) . Both sides have agreed in principle to start a bilateral patent prosecution highway ( PPH ) programme on a pilot basis in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 . <p> Although the amendment has been appreciated by the public , there is a serious omission in terms of implementation . For example , no proper information is provided as to by whom and how the PPH facility can be used . There is also no provision for refund of expedited examination fees in cases where the applicant 's request for expedited examination is rejected . <p> Opposition board constituted in case of pre-grant opposition . Rule 55 of the Patents Rule , 2003 , which provides the procedure of dealing with pre-grant opposition under section 25(1) of the act , has been amended . <p> With the objective of expediting the disposal of pre-grant opposition and bringing transparency , the amendment rules propose to insert sub-rule 2A in the principle rule 55 to constitute an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The opposition bench has to be constituted by the controller and shall comprise two members who shall dispose of the application and the representation jointly . In case members of the opposition bench differ on any issue , the controller shall nominate a third member to the bench and the majority decision will be treated as final . <p> This amendment was criticized for not clearly providing details on the members of the opposition board , whether it will include the same controller and examiner who had examined the application , or if there will be a different controller and examiner . <p> It will also lead to two parallel procedures , one involving the controller to examine the patent application , and the other involving an opposition bench to provide its findings . These parallel procedures will prolong disposal time , particularly in cases where multiple oppositions are filed . <p> Additional amendments . The draft Patent ( Amendment ) Rules , 2018 propose to do away with the transmission fee for filing the PCT International application filed through the e-PCT system . Also , there is a proposal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ priority document and e-transmission through WIPO DAS . <p> The draft rules clearly reflect the ideology of the DIPP to facilitate the IP creators and owners to boost the " Make in India " initiative . <p> At the same time it fails to take into consideration the practical aspects of implementation of the proposed amendments . Stakeholders have already submitted comments in respect of the draft rules and very soon the author hopes to receive notification of the final amendment rules .

@@50567234 <p> Sitting on concrete steps in a persistent drizzle , a doughty curiosity of local rugby fans were watching Hawaii play Bahrain in the Plate semi-final .

Play was suspended as the fire brigade were called in to pump water from the pitch , to little avail . With a blistering wade down the wing , the Fijian , Taniela Ralumu , scored the clinching try in the final .

The embracement and sanction of sevens as a stand-alone sport by the International Rugby Board ( IRB ) and the support of HSBC is a large factor in modern expansion . Yet Hong Kong was undoubtedly the incubator of international sevens through an amalgam of first-rate organisation and chance . <p> In 1982 , the Sevens moved to the Hong Kong Stadium , then a tin-roofed relic of a venue , but with a capacity of 16,000 .

And , again , Hong Kong was the progenitor . Post-coup unrest in the Fijian Islands caused the national rugby coach to take up a similar role in Hong Kong . George Simpkin was to live here for 16 years and found , from the beginning , our city to be an ideal place to broadcast his innovative rugby thinking about how the sevens game is played . <p> Twenty years ago , we 'd watch Saturday pool games ( no Friday afternoons then ) where a score of 69-0 , would not be unusual .

" They are quicker and cheaper than the bridge to Hong Kong and you do not have to go through customs or immigration . " <p> So who is using the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau ( HZM ) bridge ?

" The tourists are using the buses on the bridge . We are retaining regular passengers going to Hong Kong and Zhuhai to work . We have no plans to cut frequency of service . " <p> Use of the bridge by cargo companies has been small . This is not only because of the limited licenses available but also because of the need for insurance and other paperwork needed to travel in three jurisdictions , each with its own rules , procedures and tariff rules . <p> George Yeo , chairman of Kerry Logistics Network , said his company would wait for clarification before it decides whether to use the bridge . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because the rules are not clearly settled with the customs authorities .

" Our investigation revealed that approximately 40 different organizations across 13 different countries were compromised during this campaign , " Talos stated . " We assess with high confidence that this activity is being carried out by an advanced , state-sponsored actor that seeks to obtain persistent access to sensitive networks and systems . " <p> Talos says the attackers directing the Sea Turtle campaign show signs of being highly sophisticated and have continued their attacks despite public reports of their activities . In most cases , threat actors typically stop or slow down their activities once their campaigns are publicly revealed , suggesting the Sea Turtle actors are unusually brazen and may be difficult @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ January the Department of Homeland Security ( DHS ) issued an alert about this activity , warning that an attacker could redirect user traffic and obtain valid encryption certificates for an organization 's domain names . <p> At that time the DHS 's Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency said in its Emergency Directive that it was tracking a series of incidents targeting DNS infrastructure . CISA wrote that it " is aware of multiple executive branch agency domains that were impacted by the tampering campaign and has notified the agencies that maintain them . " <h> DNS hijacking <p> CISA said that attackers have managed to intercept and redirect web and mail traffic and could target other networked services . The agency said the attacks start with compromising user credentials of an account that can make changes to DNS records . Then the attacker alters DNS records , like Address , Mail Exchanger , or Name Server records , replacing the legitimate address of the services with an address the attacker controls . <p> Are aggressive in their pursuit targeting DNS registries and a number of registrars , including those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Use Let 's Encrypts , Comodo , Sectigo , and self-signed certificates in their man-in-the-middle ( MitM ) servers to gain the initial round of credentials . <p> Steal victim organization 's legitimate SSL certificate and use it on actor-controlled servers . <p> Such actions also distinguish Sea Turtle from an earlier DNS exploit known as DNSpionage , which Talos ? reported ? on in November 2018 . <p> Talos noted " with high confidence " that these operations are distinctly different and independent from the operations performed by DNSpionage . <p> In that report , Talos said a DNSpionage campaign utilized two fake , malicious websites containing job postings that were used to compromise targets via malicious Microsoft Office documents with embedded macros . The malware supported HTTP and DNS communication with the attackers . <p> In a separate DNSpionage campaign , the attackers used the same IP address to redirect the DNS of legitimate . gov and private company domains . During each DNS compromise , the actor carefully generated Let 's Encrypt certificates for the redirected domains . These certificates provide X.509 certificates for Transport Layer Security @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Talos said . <p> The Sea Turtle campaign gained initial access either by exploiting known vulnerabilities or by sending spear-phishing emails . Talos said it believes the attackers have exploited multiple known common vulnerabilities and exposures ( CVEs ) to either gain initial access or to move laterally within an affected organization . Talos research further shows the following known exploits of Sea Turtle include : <p> CVE-2009-1151 ? : PHP code injection vulnerability affecting phpMyAdmin <p> CVE-2014-6271 ? : RCE affecting GNU bash system , specifically the SMTP ( this was part of the ? Shellshock ? CVEs ) <p> " As with any initial access involving a sophisticated actor , we believe this list of CVEs to be incomplete , " Talos stated . " The actor in question can leverage known vulnerabilities as they encounter a new threat surface . This list only represents the observed behavior of the actor , not their complete capabilities . " <p> Talos says that the Sea Turtle campaign continues to be highly successful for several reasons . " First , the actors employ a unique approach to gain access to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IDS and IPS systems are not designed to monitor and log DNS requests , " Talos stated . " The threat actors were able to achieve this level of success because the DNS domain space system added security into the equation as an afterthought . Had more ccTLDs implemented security features such as registrar locks , attackers would be unable to redirect the targeted domains . " <p> Talos said the attackers also used previously undisclosed techniques such as certificate impersonation . " This technique was successful in part because the SSL certificates were created to provide confidentiality , not integrity . The attackers stole organizations ' SSL certificates associated with security appliances such as Cisco 's Adaptive Security Appliance to obtain VPN credentials , allowing the actors to gain access to the targeted network , and have long-term persistent access , Talos stated . <h> Cisco Talos DNS attack mitigation strategy <p> To protect against Sea Turtle , Cisco recommends : <p> Use a registry lock service , which will require an out-of-band message before any changes can occur to an organization 's DNS record . <p> If your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ implementing multi-factor authentication , such as ?

Network administrators can monitor passive DNS records on their domains to check for abnormalities. 
@@50604234 <h> OPINION : How to deal with backup when you switch to hyperconverged infrastructure <p> Companies migrating to hyperconverged infrastructure ( HCI ) systems are usually doing so to simplify their virtualization environment . Since backup is one of the most complicated parts of virtualization , they are often looking to simplify it as well via their migration to HCI . <p> Other customers have chosen to use HCI to simplify their hardware complexity , while using a traditional backup approach for operational and disaster recovery . Here 's a look at cover both scenarios . <p> Different types of HCI <p> Sometimes an HCI system is a collection of hardware on which you run your favorite hypervisor . This is the most common type of HCI vendor and includes products like Nutanix , Simplivity , Datrium and VxRail . <p> Each HCI vendor offers a hardware configuration using components supported by the virtualization vendors it wishes to support . Since the system comes pre-built you can be assured that all the hardware components will work together and will work with any supported hypervisors . Any incompatibilities between the various components will be handled by the HCI vendor . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The best example of this would be Nutanix with their Acropolis hypervisor . Typically such a hypervisor will offer tighter integration with the HCI hardware and integrated data-protection features . Often , the built-in hypervisor is also less expensive than traditional hypervisors , especially if you take advantage of the native data-protection features . <p> The final type of HCI vendor supports neither VMware nor Hyper-V , nor do they use their own hypervisor . Scale Computing uses the KVM hypervisor , which is open source . Like Nutanix , they do this to reduce their customers ' TCO while offering much of the same functionality that VMware offers . In addition , they also offer integrated data protection . <p> Integrated data protection <p> All three types of HCI vendors mentioned above offer integrated data protection . These companies recognize that backup and recovery of traditional servers is complicated enough ; virtual servers can be even worse due to the scarcity of I/O resources . So one of the problems that HCI vendors attempt to solve for their customers is the simplification of backup and recovery . <p> Traditionally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the HCI product . The snapshots are done at the storage level , with some type of integration into the hypervisor so that the correct thing happens in the operating system when an HCI snapshot is taken . <p> For example , most hypervisors integrate with the Windows Volume Shadow Service ( VSS ) . When it 's time for an HCI snapshot , the hypervisor first tells each VM to create a VSS snapshot . This creates an application-consistent view of the operating system to the hypervisor or HCI data protection system that will then take a snapshot of that snapshot . Once the hypervisor or HCI snapshot has been created , it can release the VSS snapshot . <p> The entire snapshot-creation process may take only a few seconds from end to end , since it is n't moving much data , but it is important to understand that at this point it is only a virtual copy of the data . The snapshot needs to be replicated to another system in order to be an actual backup , and all HCIs vendors do just that . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to another system , you have a complete backup of the latest version of all VMs in the snapshot . <p> Some customers replicate their secondary copy to another HCI system inside their data center , and others send it to the cloud . Customers who store their secondary copy on a local HCI system may also replicate that copy to the cloud . That way they have an onsite and an offsite copy of all systems . <p> Some HCI vendors with integrated data protection can then replicate the VM 's into the cloud and spin them up for DR purposes . If they are able to do that , customers have a local recovery option and a cloud recovery option without spending any money with a third-party data-protection system . <p> Integrated data protection is not new <p> The most well-known vendor that started saying that data stored on their systems did n't need to be backed up in the traditional way is NetApp . ( Many other storage vendors have since followed NetApp 's example , but they were clearly the early leaders in this space . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more modern style of recovery , which was much faster and easier to use than anything else that was offered at the time . The key to their story was snapshots ; every volume on a NetApp filer can create up to 255 snapshots without a performance impact . <p> This offers their customers way more restore points than were typically possible via normal backup means , and also offers restores much faster than any typical restore . Snapshots are a virtual copy of the file system that relies on the original volume for a complete restore , so they need to be replicated to another system to provide complete backup and recovery . <p> Many NetApp customers go " all in " with a NetApp-only data-protection solution . They replicate their primary filer to a secondary filer on-site and a tertiary filer off-site , thus providing both on-site and off-site recovery without ever using a traditional backup product -- and certainly without using any tapes . <p> Others are critical of this solution , as they wonder if there could ever be some sort of bug in the software @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ customers prefer to have at least one copy of their data on some system other than NetApp . They might hope they never need to use that copy , but they have it just in case . <p> This customer response is similar to the response to the integrated data-protection features of HCI vendors . Some see it as a way to offer quicker recovery for most recovery scenarios , while others do not like the " all their eggs in one basket " approach . These customers prefer to supplement the integrated data protection features with a more traditional backup approach . <p> There are many backup solutions that are hypervisor-friendly . Such solutions need to integrate with the data protection features of the hypervisor , such as VADP from VMware . <p> They also need to do everything they can to minimize the I/O impact of backups , as this is the Achilles heel of any traditional backup solution that is simply going to pretend that the VMs are actually physical servers . If a backup product does that and wants to continue doing occasional full backups , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ support things like block-level incremental backups forever and changed block tracking to be welcome in a hypervisor world . <p> It 's your choice <p> You can choose an HCI product with integrated data protection and eliminate traditional backup approaches as long as you make sure you replicate those snapshots to another system and/or to a system offsite . You can ignore your HCI product 's native data-protection features and simply use a virtualization-friendly backup product . Or you can use both in a belt-and-suspenders approach . Just make sure to understand the benefits and drawbacks of each before . <p> W. Curtis Preston is an expert in backup , storage and recovery , having worked in the space since 1993 . He has been an end-user , consultant , and analyst , and has recently joined the team at Druva , a cloud-based data protection company . 
@@50604235 <h> Coming soon : A token taxonomy to define the world of blockchain <p> The Enterprise Ethereum Alliance ( EEA ) is working with Microsoft and more than a dozen businesses , research organizations and industry consortiums to create a blockchain-neutral business-focused Token Taxonomy Framework . <p> In essence , the group is working to universally define in non-technical terms what a token is -- regardless of the blockchain platform involved -- and create a common set of terms and definitions for cross-industry business use . Creating a single set of definitions and terms will help enable blockchain platform interoperability . <p> The group hopes to turn out the first iteration of its Token Taxonomy Framework ( TTF ) later this year ; afterward it plans work to educate the blockchain community and collaborate through structured Token Definition Workshops ( TDW ) to define new or existing tokens . <p> Once defined , the taxonomy can be used by businesses as a baseline to create blockchain-based applications using digital representations of everything from supply chain goods to non-fungible items such as invoices . <p> " We 'll do some workshops ... to validate and make sure we have the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gray , Microsoft 's principal architect for Azure blockchain engineering and a member of the EEA 's Board of Directors . " As we go through workshops , we will probably find we should add this attribute or this clarification or this example that helps someone understand it . " <h> Bringing order to the market <p> The move comes as tokenization and blockchain face increasingly face regulatory oversight . While the blockchain marketplace remains a bit of a Wild West at the moment , that is n't expected to last ; government and non-governmental organizations such as the SEC in the US continue to scrutinize blockchain and the digital currency that flows through it . <p> EEA Executive Director Ron Resnick said while his organization supports a specific form of blockchain -- Ethereum -- it is hosting a blockchain-agnostic initiative because it has the infrastructure with program management and other resources . Any company that wants to participate in the initiative can do so without becoming a member of the EEA , Resnick said . <p> " Standardizing tokens to work anywhere could hold the key to one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " Just like standards that led to the rise of e-commerce on the internet , applying standards to tokenization will enable the enterprise to use tokens to serve as , or provide access to , a set of goods , financial assets , securities , services , value or content through enterprise blockchain applications . " <p> Gray said a token can represent anything from a bitcoin to real estate . <p> " We live in a reality where customers are faced with having a foot not only in public blockchains but also a foot in multiple consortia , each of which might be different blockchain platforms , " Gray said . " So , the framework is built around the presumption that we want to be able to define these things in a neutral way ... using real-world terms and analogies , like fiat money , an airline ticket or a concert ticket .

Other tokens could be non-fungible and represent unique assets , such as art @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hybrid " token , fungible and non-fungible tokens could open new avenues for digital commerce , Gray said . A hybrid token could be purchased and held by a consumer as a non-transferable asset . <p> For example , such a token could represent a specific airline flight or concert venue ( a fungible thing ) and a non-fungible asset , such as a specific seat on that flight or at the concert , Gray explained . <p> Another example of a hybrid could be a non-fungible token representing a pool of real estate mortgages and a fungible one representing a fraction of that mortgage pool that can be purchased by corporations or consumers as securities . <p> Blockchain-based apps for real estate now include start-ups that handle foreign investments , property title record keeping , property rentals and tokenization . Blockchain networks that tokenize real estate allow traditional investors and consumers to buy shares of a property and receive a return on rents or mortgages . The money paid for the shares allows property owners to make additional investments . <p> For example , Polymath , Securitize and Harbor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assets -- such as commercial buildings -- to be tokenized and turned into tradable securities . <p> One start-up , Jointer.io , is focused exclusively on real estate tokenization . But unlike other services , it does n't offer just one property as shares that can be purchased . It combines a number of buildings in an index , and participants can then buy tokens from that index . The result is less risk and more profit , according to Jude Regev , founder and CEO of Jointer . <p> " The framework will be agnostic . At Microsoft , we do n't have a blockchain . We do n't compete , but we want to host and listen to our customers who want to use Ethereum ... , Hyperledger Fabric , Corda or anything else that comes along , " Gray said . " How do we begin to think about building multi-party applications on top of those things as you have different languages from different platforms , different definitions and no consistency in being able to describe them . " <p> Along with creating a taxonomy to describe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ develop a method for attaching metadata -- transactional descriptive information -- to a specific token using the token taxonomy framework 's syntax and grammar . <h> Could tokens lead to a cashless economy ? <p> Behind the initiative is a growing cottage industry made up of start-ups that turn real-world assets into tokens to be sold or traded on blockchain networks . <p> A former Federal Reserve executive believes it 's only a matter of time before central banks adopt a form of digital currency that could look like bitcoin and will offer a more convenient and anonymous way for businesses and consumers to buy and sell goods and store wealth . <p> For example , earlier this year , JP Morgan Chase announced it would launch a US dollar-backed cryptocurrency -- a token that would allow it to client to send money to another over a blockchain ledger . <p> The advent of a government-backed , peer-to-peer ( P2P ) digital currency could signal the beginning of a cashless economy , not unlike what 's occurring today in Sweden . It also may simply complement the modern-day current cash-based @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Sweden . It 's not accepted at many businesses and many banks wo n't deal with cash anymore , " said Rod Garrett , an economics professor at the University of California at Santa Barbara and a former vice president with the Federal Reserve Bank . <p> John Whelan , chairman of the EEA Board and and head of Digital Investment Banking at Banco Santander , said it appears that in the coming years many different asset classes will be tokenized . <p> " As such , the Token Taxonomy Initiative will be key to ensuring that this next wave of financial innovation will start with cross-platform standards in mind , " Whelan said .

DNS tunneling is a popular method of exfiltration for some actors and recent examples of DNSpionage show that we must ensure DNS is monitored as closely as an organization 's normal proxy or weblogs , " Talos wrote . " DNS is essentially the phonebook of the internet , and when it is tampered with , it becomes difficult for anyone to discern whether what they are seeing online is legitimate . " <p> In Talos ' initial report , researchers said a DNSpionage campaign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United Arab Emirates government domains . It also utilized two malicious websites containing job postings that were used to compromise targets via crafted Microsoft Office documents with embedded macros .

During each DNS compromise , the actor carefully generated " Let 's Encrypt " certificates for the redirected domains . These certificates provide X.509 certificates for Transport Layer Security ( TLS ) free of charge to the user , Talos said . <p> This week Cisco said DNSpionage actors have created a new remote administrative tool that supports HTTP and DNS communication with the attackers ' command and control ( C2 ) . <p> " In our previous post concerning DNSpionage , we showed that the malware author used malicious macros embedded in a Microsoft Word document . In the new sample from Lebanon identified at the end of February , the attacker used an Excel document with a similar macro . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and DNS communication to the C2 server . The HTTP communication is hidden in the comments in the HTML code . This time , however , the C2 server mimics the GitHub platform instead of Wikipedia .

However , this newer version uses the domain ' coldfart. com , ' which would be easier to spot than other APT campaigns which generally try to blend in with traffic more suitable to enterprise environments .

Many young refugees suffering from anxiety , trauma , post traumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) , and depression have become easy targets for fake counselors . <p> Dalal , a 27-year old Syrian who has been living in Istanbul since 2016 , says she was shocked to discover that her psychiatrist , who posed as a mental health professional , was an untrained impostor . <p> " It was the first time in my life to see a psychiatrist , because I was so depressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt major relief , " she told Asia Times . <p> Over weeks of sessions , the man convinced Dalal to leave her fianc ? , whom he blamed for her psychological problems . Dalal was so convinced by his counseling that she later accepted an offer of a job at his office . <p> Then , the harassment began . <p> She recounts : " Immediately after I left my fianc ? , his behavior changed . He started making sexual innuendos and using vulgar language , and sometimes he jokingly put his hand on my leg . " <p> Dalal decided to put up with her therapist 's bizarre shift until one day , when a friend of his brought alcohol into the clinic and the conversation shifted to his training . <p> He began bragging about how he became a psychiatrist with no formal education , and how he had trained himself by reading books on the topic . <p> " I was shocked , " Dalal said . " He even gave me a book to read so I could become a doctor like him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investigate her employer by befriending his patients and chatting with them . She discovered that he prescribed the same antidepressant , Lustral , to nearly all of them .

He knows how to talk to women , and most of his patients are women , " she said . <p> To verify Dalal 's account , this reporter and two others , including one woman , visited the self-professed psychiatrist individually , each describing different symptoms . After each of the separate 45-minute sessions , which cost 100 Turkish Lira ( $17 ) , the " doctor " prescribed the same medication : Lustral . And the woman walked away with several packs of cigarettes that he gave her as a gift .

" She told Asia Times that there are a number of fake doctors who have been making money through unlicensed practices in Istanbul , as well as in the city of Gaziantep in the east and the city of Kas in the southwest . <p> Often , she says , they prescribe the same medicine to all patients , regardless of their symptoms or diagnosis , which aggravates the problem . <p> " The biggest problem that we 're facing is that most psychiatrists diagnose all Syrian patients with PTSD , although some could be suffering from other ailments , " she said . <p> Mehana , who offers basic training to Syrian youth on how to help individuals suffering from PTSD , says she once discovered that two of her trainees , despite having no formal education on the subject , had turned that limited knowledge into a business , opening a self-described psychiatric center @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Facebook page . <p> " They even started offering training to mental health care volunteers , " she said . <p> Badr al-Din al-Ahmar , a psychological counselor with a volunteer social services team in Istanbul , says he knows of several practicing fake psychiatrists in Istanbul . <p> " One of these people opened two mental health centers , with no experience in the field . He seems to have a great capacity for manipulation , " Ahmar said . <p> Until now , these alleged clinics have managed to operate under the radar within the refugee community . <p> " The Turkish government is not taking any measures against these people , which is causing their numbers to increase , " Ahmar said . <p> Other than the damage caused by unsuitable treatment , the counselor says that women often suffer doubly , when they face sexual harassment at the hands of fake psychiatrists.

@@50713240 <p> US President Donald Trump will need to compromise if he has another summit with Kim Jong Un . Photo : Wikimedia Commons <h> Kim and Trump derailed by deep states and dire legacies <p> With the denuclearization process stalled , both leaders may be undermined by poor counsel and decades of mistrust , say experts <p> ByAndrew Salmon <p> North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and US President Donald Trump may both sincerely want to strike a deal on North Korean denuclearization , but both are being undercut by bad counsel from below , and are further undermined by years of failed precedents and resultant distrust . <p> These were among the points raised by a trio of experts speaking at the East Asian Foundation in Seoul on Tuesday who are -- unlike many North Korea watchers -- upbeat on the Kim-Trump engagement progress . In the long aftermath of the failure to reach a deal at the February North Korea-US summit in Hanoi , Vietnam , all were cautiously optimistic on the potential of the process . <p> They stated that the Hanoi summit offered both sides clarity on stances and a solid starting point for future @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pass . However , they warned that there are multiple precedents for both parties derailing deals that took years to reach . <h> Leader synchronicity <p> In a world where diplomats and pundits routinely deride Trump , who had said even before entering office that he favored direct talks with North Korean leaders , the experts in Seoul were favorable and upbeat on his high-risk engagement with Kim . <p> " I spend most of my time engaged in efforts to constrain President Trump , but on Korea , Trump is right , " said Morton Halperin , a former director of the Policy Planning Staff at the US State Depatment under the Clinton administration , and now a senior advisor to George Soros ' Open Society Foundation . <p> While previous US presidents would not countenance meeting a North Korean leader , Halperin asserted that the first summit in Singapore last year " was a spectacular success ... this process needed to start from the top down . " <p> Moreover , Trump -- who is frequently accused of breaking previously negotiated deals -- can likely be trusted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nuclear deal and agreements with North Korea is that someone else made those agreements , and Donald Trump made the agreements with North Korea , " Halperin said . <p> Trump 's counter-party , who has publicaly stated on multiple occasions his desire for economic growth , has also invested massive credibility in diplomatic engagement . <p> " I do n't think Kim Jong Un has come this far to let this become dormant and then die on the vine , " added Ambassador Joe DeTrani , a former US Special Envoy to the Six-Party Talks and an ex-CIA officer with two decades of experience in intelligence . <p> DeTrani noted that while North Korea customarily portrayed itself as an enviable nation with nothing to learn from elsewhere , Kim 's visit to the vastly more prosperous Singapore was widely disseminated in North Korean media . This makes him " a different leader " to his father and grandfather , DeTrani asserted . <p> " With the market system and the economic development , North Korea is looking very similar to China in the 1970s , " DeTrani said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think Kim said , ' I do n't want to live with another 50 years of deprivation ' . " <p> Kim Jong Un has made clear he will only wait until the end of this year to resume negotiations . Much now hangs on the advice both leaders are receiving . <h> Bolton the Peacekiller <p> " To make a guess about the future of the process you have to understand how Donald Trump operates in relation to John Bolton , " Halperin said . " If John Bolton has his way , we will never go back to the table . If Donald Trump has his way , we will go back . " <p> Halperin was not the only expert suspicious of Bolton 's counsel . Regarding the stumbling blocks between Pyongyang and Washington , Moon Chung-in , one of the architects of South Korea 's engagement with North Korea and a high-profile advisor to President Moon Jae-in ( no relation ) on unification , diplomacy and national security said : " One issue is sanctions , the second is John Bolton . If Donald Trump removes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ step . If not , resumed negotiations would be a non-starter . " <p> Regarding the failure of the Hanoi summit , one stumbling block was the US delegation 's insistence on packaging chemical and biological weapons with nuclear arms and strategic missiles . <p> " In my view , chemical and biological weapons were a ' John Bolton special ' to make negotiations much harder , " said Halperin . " To suddenly say ' denuclearization means de-weaponization of weapons of mass destruction ' " is a shift from the process agreed in the first summit in Singapore . <p> And Bolton is not the only stumbling block . Virtually the entire Washington policy establishment is disbelieving . " Ninety percent of those who are interested in North Korea are cynics , skeptics or pessimists -- I would say about 10% are optimistic , " said Moon . " And out of that 10% , 9% are guarded or cautiously optimistic . Just 1% is optimistic . " <h> Deep state Pyongyang <p> Meanwhile , an apparently frustrated North Korea has recently resumed its old tricks . As well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Democratic wannabe presidential nominee Joe Biden . <p> " I am disappointed seeing this coming out of Pyongyang at this juncture , " said DeTrani . " But this young leader has to work with people who have been working in these issues for decades . " He advised North Korea to cool it , suggesting : " You are playing to the critics who say you will never have a deal with North Korea . " <p> There is also a risk of Kim facing being pushed by hardliners in his regime . " There is great danger of catastrophe , which is why we should try and avoid any kind of ICBM test , which could screw up the entire process , " Moon added . " Trump will lose ground in Washington , so I urge North Korea to be prudent in its behavior . " <h> Broken deals : A long legacy <p> A complicating issue is decades of distrust , generated by broken deals . <p> The Beijing-sponsored Six-Party Talks imploded in 2008 over issues of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The 1994 " Agreed Framework , " under which the international community provided North Korea with light-water reactors in return for a freeze of its plutonium processing , was already troubled , with recriminations on both sides , when it finally collapsed in 2002 after Washington accused North Korea of having a secret uranium-based nuclear arms program . <p> And the 2012 " Leap Day " agreement on a missile test moratorium collapsed the same year after North Korea launched a satellite , which the US claimed was a de facto ICBM test . <p> " It takes years to come up with agreements , " lamented DeTrani . " It is easy walking away , hard renegotiating and getting traction and trust . " <p> And yet , it is critical to keep talking . " If you look at the history of the North Korea nuclear program , it is created when we are not talking and when we go to sanctions , " said Halperin . " When we had agreements , they agreed to slow down . " <h> Hanoi retrospective <p> The Hanoi summit broke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statement by Trump -- to shut two key nuclear facilities , while the United States demanded the closure of five . While there was no further detail in Trump 's pronouncement , it is known that Kim offered to close down his key nuclear facility at Yongbyon . <p> The experts lauded North Korea 's offer as a reasonable starting point for future talks . <p> " I believe that the proposal the North Koreans put on the table , which they reiterated after the summit , should be the basis of negotiations moving forward , " said Halperin , who believes Yongbyon represents 50-70% of North Koreas nuclear facilities . " A reasonable first step is the dismantlement of the Yongbyon facility with an appropriate lessening of sanctions , though clearly not all sanctions . " <p> " We know Yongbyon . Yongbyon was always on the table . We took down a cooling tower and we had two US officials working with North Korean officials " during the Agreed Framework period , DeTrani said . " There are more facilities than Yonbgyon ... but Yongbyon should be the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ process must include discussion of security guarantees for North Korea , diplomatic liaison offices and economic assistance , both DeTrani and Halperin said . <h> How to re-boot <p> Even so , a third North Korea-US summit should be not rushed into without due preparation . <p> " If we hasten to a third summit , that is putting the cart way before the horse , our negotiators have to meet and come up with a road map , " said DeTrani . And with Kim having shuffled his top brain trust in recent months , it is not entirely clear who will be leading working-level talks . <p> " We need to get our lead negotiators back to the North , but we are not sure who their lead negotiator is -- that is an internal issue . " <p> Now the two sides are divided , not only by which nuclear sites to put on the table , but also the timing of sanctions relief . " There is a fundamental difference between the US and North Korea , " said Moon . While the US demands denuclearization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sanctions relief as a starting point . " <p> For all these reasons , it is critical to offer North Korea a realistic model which is not the one named by Bolton , based on the unilateral denuclearization of Libya . <p> " The model we want to press on the North Koreans is not Libya but Vietnam , " said Halperin . " Having been in the US government at the time of the Vietnam War , I find the relations we have now are unbelievable , and this is exactly the transformation North Koreans say they want while no American sees Vietnam posing a security threat to the US . " <p> For multiple reasons , it is critical to keep the process alive . <p> " This young man who studied in Switzerland , he showed he is pretty smart and flexible and has reached out , " said DeTrani . " What Moon Jae-in and Donald Trump are saying is , ' Let 's keep this process going . ' It would be tragic if we talked away from the table . "

@@50766231 <h> The American Century 's Last Man <p> By Christopher R. Hill <p> George Packer 's biography of Richard Holbrooke manages to capture the great American diplomat 's complex character and long career in a single volume . In reflecting on Holbrook 's accomplishments in the service of diplomacy and human rights , one encounters a man whose character was in perfect step with that of his country . <p> KABUL , AFGHANISTAN -- JULY 26 : US special envoy to Afghanistan and Pakistan Richard Holbrooke is seen during a dinner held at the US embassy for the Afghan civilian society on July 26 , 2009 in Kabul , Afghanistan . Ambassador Holbrooke spent four days in the country ahead of next Presidential elections . ( Photo by Marco Di Lauro/Getty Images ) <p> For those of us who were blessed -- some might say cursed -- to have spent important parts of our careers with Richard Holbrooke , the journalist George Packer 's masterful biography of the American diplomat had to clear a high bar . I , for one , opened Our Man with a sense of dread as to what Packer would choose to say about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundreds of people interviewed for the book , many have been harshly critical of Holbrooke . <p> One could imagine an opening like that of Charles Dickens 's ATale of Two Cities : Holbrooke was the best of friends and often the most difficult of friends . He was both a mentor and a tormentor . On that , I think most of my colleagues who knew him would agree . <p> Holbrooke 's career extended from John F. Kennedy 's presidency to Barack Obama 's , a span rarely matched in the annals of diplomacy . More important than his longevity was the fact that he traveled the globe to take on some of the toughest challenges facing the United States -- from the Paris peace talks that sought to end the US role in Vietnam , normalization of relations with China , and his signature accomplishments in ending the wars in Bosnia and Kosovo to his stewardship of US policy in Afghanistan , America 's longest war . <p> Living and working within Holbrooke 's orbit , one would suffer his odd personal habits , mood swings , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But one would also witness his brilliance and clarity of thought , his warmth and , especially , his humor , which always left one wanting more . This duality comes out clearly in Packer 's description of Holbrooke all the way up until he is lying on his deathbed . Those who understand who the man was -- and Packer is certainly one of them -- recognize that you did n't get the good without the bad . It was a single package . <p> GOOD MORNING , WASHINGTON Those of us who ascended the United States ' diplomatic ranks during the Balkan Wars of the 1990s , or during Holbrooke 's stewardship of the Afghanistan/Pakistan policy ( the AfPak brief , in bureaucratic-speak ) in 2009-10 , heard his stories about Vietnam . We all learned to hate that place , and not just because it was the site of one of America 's most painful wars . Whenever Holbrooke started in on the topic , it could be an hour before we got back to discussing the matter at hand . <p> Packer chronicles Holbrooke 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foreign-service officer living on his own in the Mekong Delta . Here , we learn of Holbrooke 's early doubts about the entire venture , which he committed to writing in letters at the time , demonstrating a degree of sophistication well beyond his years . <p> In fact , some of the most interesting parts of Packer 's biography are in Holbrooke 's own words . We learn that during the Vietnam years , he fought constantly with just about everybody . On display in his letters are clear antecedents of his skepticism toward know-it-all members of the military brass . That skepticism would be further reinforced much later in his life , during the infighting over AfPak policy in the Obama administration . Packer 's account captures , early on , Holbrooke 's brilliance and analytical capacities , but also his ambition and unquenchable neediness . We learn at the outset that he was not someone who liked to spend time by himself . <p> Later , as the book picks up speed , Holbrooke makes his way to Washington , DC , where the reader gets a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ endless efforts to ingratiate himself with important people . His encounters with the rich and famous , animated by his shameless self-promotion , are often cringeworthy . But those who knew Holbrooke will immediately recognize the character Packer describes . <p> For example , Holbrooke absolutely did have an annoying habit of looking over the shoulder of whomever he was speaking with to find someone more important . Phone calls with him were disquieting experiences of rushing to say what you wanted to say before hearing a couple of clicks and then , " Just a second , Chris , just a second ... , " followed by silence and , predictably , " I 'll have to let you go ... I 'll call you back . " I always wondered who was calling him on the other line ( or , more likely , calling him back ) ; he never told me , and I never asked . This was merely a part of the Holbrooke we knew -- irritating , to be sure , but a minor exasperation compared to the exhilaration of working with him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ egomaniac ( " malignant narcissist " not yet having made it into the common parlance ) , Holbrooke certainly had his vulnerabilities , and Packer misses none of them . At one point in the book , a young Holbrooke is told -- in writing -- that he can not simply jump into the secretary of state 's car , and must instead ask permission first . In Packer 's telling , this story has a happy ending : Holbrooke later frames the memo and hangs it on his wall . <p> But it is worth noting that the man 's capacity for self-deprecation was fleeting . On another occasion in the book , Holbrooke 's friends throw him a 50th birthday party that turns into a boisterous roast . Packer describes this episode in detail , and it is clear that it left Holbrook deeply hurt . <p> And then there were the girlfriends , as well as a series of unsuccessful sexual conquests ( the two often overlapped ) , which were driven not so much by ego as by his deep-seated neediness . One of Holbrooke 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relationship quite unemotionally , telling him to clear out his belongings that day , as if he was a boarder who had fallen behind on his rent . <p> But the love of Holbrooke 's life was Kati Marton , his third and last wife ( and also a journalist ) . This comes out clearly in Packer 's account , and it was obvious to all of us who knew Holbrooke . Sometimes , he would be sitting in his office presiding over an impromptu staff meeting , only to glance at his watch , realize he was late , and dash out to meet Kati . On one of the rare occasions when Holbrooke showed some self-awareness , he told me , " I 'm not going to blow this one . " <p> In the event , all of us who wanted to see Holbrooke happy welcomed Kati , even though we had to refer to him as Richard instead of Dick when she was around . Take it from me , Holbrooke was definitely not a " Richard . " And yet , in Our Man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's relationship than I had ever guessed at . There were affairs and fights and sometimes dueling ambitions ; but , more often than not , there was synergy . Kati , Packer writes , was Holbrooke 's " climbing partner . " <p> The details of Holbrooke 's uxoriousness are all there . Packer recounts with brutal accuracy Kati 's presence at the Dayton peace talks , when she would sit on Holbrooke 's lap during staff meetings -- yes , staff meetings . He would often instruct her , lovingly , to take a walk with this or that Balkan warlord to convince him to agree to the terms on offer . Kati was Holbrooke 's Yoko Ono , and the rest of us were just members of the band , trying to avert our eyes from the awkward display . <p> THE AUDACITY OF NOPE Packer 's narrative concludes by chronicling Holbrooke 's Mozart-like demise . His fall from grace was painful , and helped along by many Salieri-like rivals who were envious or just plain sick of him . They conspired to push him down , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the imagination in describing Holbrooke 's inability to connect with President Barack Obama , despite his best efforts . <p> Obama 's youthful team just could n't see the value of this extraordinary figure . Holbrooke 's accomplishments were known around the world , but not necessarily in the political-staffer echo chamber of Washington , DC . At any rate , many in the Obama administration saw his approach to foreign policy as dated , and they were rankled by his efforts to ingratiate himself with people such as National Security Adviser Susan Rice ( who never seemed particularly enthusiastic about him ) . Most important , Obama himself was not a fan , and was n't going to become one . <p> One of Packer 's keenest insights lies in his description of the cascading disrespect Holbrooke suffered in the Obama years . Once the president had soured on him , so did everyone else . White House aides , bereft of any personal accomplishments of their own , lived solely off the president 's trust in them . They had no reason to care what anyone else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't want to have around . One top aide , having been instructed by Obama to talk to Holbrooke , subjected the senior diplomat to a finger-wagging rebuke . <p> In Packer 's telling , Hillary Clinton , then the secretary of state , comes across as one of Holbrooke 's only supporters in the administration . But their relationship does not seem to have been particularly close . As Holbrooke once told me , " You never really know what she is thinking . " Still , on one occasion when Obama 's aides were going in for the kill , Clinton stepped in to save Holbrooke 's job . Yet , even here , one gathers that she was more worried about protecting her own policy flanks than about showing loyalty to Holbrooke . <p> OUR MAN IN THE WORLD By plumbing the depths of Holbrooke 's character , Packer has helped readers understand the person behind the name . But what is even more riveting about Our Man is how he situates Holbrooke in history . Holbrooke 's story , he suggests , is also the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personal idiosyncrasies mirror both the achievements and the foibles of the country . Unlike Graham Greene 's Our Man in Havana , Packer 's man is one whose character was in perfect step with that of his country . <p> Packer describes Holbrooke 's substantive contributions to US foreign policy , and the complexity and subtlety of his judgment , in clear , accessible language . This part of the narrative leaves the reader wanting more , because it shows that Holbrooke was not put on this Earth just to amuse , confound , or annoy the rest of us . He got stuff done . He was not " almost great , " as Packer writes , adopting that backhanded compliment often uttered by Holbrooke 's admirers . He was , in fact , great -- the greatest American diplomat of his time . <p> Consider the Dayton Accords , which did not just result in an obscure peace agreement to end an obscure war , but saved Bosnia and created the basis for transatlantic relations after the Cold War . Among his many contributions , Holbrooke made human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as an inconvenient afterthought , but as something that gives meaning to American values . <p> In a world consumed by chaos , where US diplomacy no longer offers solutions and has become part of the problem , Packer asks whether we should have any regrets . It is a rhetorical question : anyone who makes their way through this extraordinary biography will know the answer . Holbrooke never achieved his life 's ambition of becoming secretary of state , but when he set his mind to something , one got the impression that things were going to get better . At the very least , the world -- which was always his stage -- respected American diplomacy more by virtue of his involvement in shaping it . <p> The contrast between his era and the present could n't be more striking , whether in Trump 's tariff wars -- a blunt and inaccurate weapon wielded by a blunt and uninformed president -- or Holbrooke 's direct diplomacy . One can only imagine a North Korea negotiation with Holbrooke . He read not only his briefing papers , but also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insisted that his staff do the same . He had an integrated mind that brought to bear all the elements of a possible solution , and he would not have forgotten , as this administration seems to have done , that other countries have an interest in a solution . Given North Korean behavior , the results may have been the same , but no one would question the US side 's seriousness of purpose or attention to detail . <p> Holbrooke believed in human rights not just because he believed in humanity in some abstract sense . Despite all his quirks and flaws , he sincerely liked people , which is why he always wanted some around . He took an interest in peoples ' families , remembered their children 's names , and always made time for them , even time that he did n't have . Packer shows that those working with Holbrooke in AfPak were extremely loyal to him , and I can certainly say the same for those who worked with him in the Balkans . <p> Holbrooke may have been guilty of looking over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a seemingly endless supply of empathy and loyalty toward his colleagues and friends . In my case , I suffered the death of a parent while working with him in Kosovo , and he gave me and my family his attention and support .

@@50766232 <h> After the Hong Kong extradition bill row , will a national security law be next on the cards ? <p> Will a national security law be next on the cards , following the extradition bill row ? Perhaps not , although probably that sequence was the original intention . This line of thinking follows from two events . <p> The first was a comment made by Hong Kong 's Chief Executive during a question-and-answer session in the Legislative Council on May 22 . The second , on June 9 , was the largest protest demonstration Hong Kong has seen since the return to Chinese rule in 1997 . <p> The implications of one follow from the other . Together they suggest that Hong Kong may at least have succeeded in delaying , yet again , the imposition of mainland-style national security strictures on its political way of life . <p> Photo : Todd Darling/HKFP . <p> Chief Executive Carrie Lam figured prominently in both events , along with her insistence on seeing a fugitive extradition bill passed into law by the Legislative Council before the end of this month . The law would permit extradition of criminal suspects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kong has not yet concluded such formal agreements . Most controversial of those destinations is the Chinese mainland itself , plus Taiwan and Macau . <p> Hovering over all this was the dreaded national security legislation mandated by Hong Kong 's post-1997 Basic Law constitution . Article 23 stipulates that Hong Kong must pass legislation prohibiting acts of treason against the Central People 's Government , as well as , secession , sedition , subversion , and theft of state secrets . Foreign interference in Hong Kong 's political affairs is also included among the Article 23 prohibitions . Hong Kong is constantly being reminded of its " constitutional duty " to stop procrastinating and pass the legislation . <p> Laying the groundwork <p> During the question-and-answer session in the Legislative Council on May 22 , Carrie Lam was asked by pro-government legislator Junius Ho Kwan-yiu why her administration was suddenly so keen to pass the fugitive extradition bill , when the matter had been allowed to drift untended for over 20 years , since 1997 . <p> Successive administrations had kept their heads in the sand " ostrich-like , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more important matter had also been left pending since 1997 .

She is an a-political civil servant , trained in pre-1997 colonial days to obey orders from above and see to it that they are carried out by those below . <p> The entire range of political debate on the merits of dictatorship and democracy seem to be outside the realm of her interest or experience . Hence her determination to carry out the tasks assigned to her by Beijing , regardless of the political consequences here . <p> She answered the question by saying , as she had many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Article 23 mandate can be addressed .

" <p> Of course , like everyone else in Hong Kong , her questioner knows very well why the Article 23 mandate has been left to languish . An attempt to push through the legislation in 2003 , similar to Carrie Lam 's current effort over the fugitive rendition bill , led to a massive public backlash . <p> It was estimated at the time that half-a-million angry people turned out on July 1 , 2003 to protest the national security bill , causing James Tien 's Liberal Party legislators to have second thoughts and withdraw their support . Without the votes needed to pass , the bill had to be put on the shelf where it remains to this day , for fear of provoking another upsurge of dissent . <p> Protest against Article 23 on July 1 , 2003 .

But when she said that despite her best efforts , the favourable conditions were slipping further and further away , she was speaking within the immediate context of the uproar she herself has caused with the drive she launched last February to fast-track the fugitive extradition bill . <p> So , the obvious question is how could Lam have reasoned that she was doing everything possible to create " favourable conditions , " even as she went about tirelessly promoting an extradition bill that encountered widespread resistance from the start ? <p> Evidently , she and those she has appointed to advise her were oblivious to the endemic fears the new law would provoke .

The aim then had been to diminish the strength and credibility of Hong Kong 's democracy movement . Her a-political style seemed better suited to the task than his transparent antagonism . <p> Together with her Justice Department , exercising its powers of prosecutorial discretion , and judicial deference , Lam 's administration had succeeded in fulfilling Beijing 's mandates with selectively targeted precision . <p> The 2016 election of six Legislative Councilors was nullified via the oath-taking saga .

Four are now serving prison sentences including two university professors and a Legislative Councilor . <p> So effective has this official strategy been , in further fragmenting and demoralising Hong Kong 's democracy movement , that its candidates actually lost two of the special elections held to replace their disqualified Legislative Councillors . <p> It followed that these losses strengthened pro-government forces in the Legislative Council , allowing them to revise its rules of procedure and further reduce democrats ' ability to obstruct , thereby making it that much easier to pass the government 's contentious legislative agenda . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been a regular on the commuter flights to Beijing where officials have spent most of the past year on a major publicity drive advertising their latest cross-border integration plan . <p> This aims to further coordinate economic development in the Greater Bay Area Pearl River Delta cities of which Hong Kong is one .

Under the circumstances , and with Beijing 's well-publicised encouragement at every step , she might well have concluded , before introduced her new extradition bill , that the way ahead was clearing and she was on course for more victories to come . <p> The fugitive extradition project followed in direct succession from all that had gone before .

@@50785235 <h> Istanbul vote not just about electing a mayor <p> Given the stakes , the debate was surprisingly cordial . Against a backdrop of images of Istanbul , the two candidates for this Sunday 's rerun of the city 's mayoral election held a three-hour televised debate last Sunday , a rare occurrence in an electoral system more used to bombastic speeches . <p> On one side was Ekrem Imamoglu , the opposition Republican People 's Party ( CHP ) candidate who won the March election . On the other , former prime minister Binali Yildirim for the ruling Justice and Development Party ( AKP ) . Not onstage , and indeed largely absent from campaigning for some days , was Recep Tayyip Erdogan , the president and the driving force behind the whole mayoral rerun . <p> Yet this election is largely about his future . It could decide whether his time has passed and perhaps even hand a platform to someone who could challenge him for the presidency in four years . This crucial vote , then , is not merely about electing a mayor , but about removing a presidential rival . <p> Sunday 's rerun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Turkey 's Electoral Council to strip Imamoglu of his post over electoral irregularities just two weeks after taking office was widely condemned . Guy Verhofstadt , former prime minister of Belgium and now one of the European Union 's most senior figures , said it demonstrated Turkey was " drifting towards a dictatorship . " There were widespread protests across Istanbul . <p> If Imamoglu is returned as mayor and the AKP does not try another way to cancel the result , it may soothe some of the international concerns about Turkey 's democracy . Yet the machinery of the state is against him . <p> The local elections in March were a significant blow to Erdogan and his party . Although their alliance won a majority -- only just , at 51% -- of the seats , they lost in crucial areas , including the capital Ankara and Turkey 's biggest city , Istanbul . Erdogan is not a man to take losing lightly and after Imamoglu 's narrow victory , the AKP used its considerable clout to raise questions about the vote , culminating in the decision to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the AKP ; one of the party 's founders and former presidents Abdullah Gul may well leave the party over the issue .

But then , in a sign of how unpopular he may have become with swing voters , most of the rallies did not take place . Erdogan has not addressed a rally in the city for nearly two weeks and the vote is only days away . <p> If the president has decided to step aside , he has also thrust another divisive figure forward .

But the election has divided Kurds as much as it has divided other Istanbulites . On Tuesday , another jailed Kurdish politician , Selahattin Demirtas , the former leader of the pro-Kurdish People 's Democratic Party ( HDP ) , threw his backing behind Imamoglu . <p> Whatever happens on Sunday , the election has already proved enormously divisive .

If Imamoglu wins , such a divisive campaign will have boosted him and given the opposition a powerful narrative of an election that was almost stolen but ultimately reclaimed by " the people .

He has run it more like a national election campaign , pushing an optimistic vision of the future and visiting mosques in AKP-supporting areas . <p> That is the sort of message that could rival Erdogan 's at the next presidential election in 2023 -- and the mayoralty of Istanbul is precisely the sort of platform to help a politician gain national recognition , which is precisely what it did for Erdogan himself in the 1990s .

Amid the US-China trade war , this approach would only cause the mainland to lose more international sympathy and support .

@@50791240 <h> When death comes , it 's hard to say goodbye Faith <p> Bestselling author , Haruki Murikami , once said , " Death is not the opposite of life , but a part of it , " and in my opinion , this is true . For those of us in the Christian faith , we know that the Lord says in Job 14:1-2 ( KJV ) : " Man that is born of a woman is of few days and full of trouble . He cometh forth like a flower , and is cut down : he fleeth also as a shadow , and continueth not . " Therefore , death is inevitable , and it can be looked upon as a part of life . We can not hide or run from it because , just as others before us have paid this debt , the rest of us must do the same . Even so , it is the flesh in us that makes death so painful and emotional . It is so hard to say goodbye to someone we love . However , if the loved one who passes lived a life in Christ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that we will see each other again in a better place . I Thessalonians 4:13-18 ( ESV ) confirms this : But we do not want you to be uninformed , brothers , about those who are asleep , that you may not grieve as others do who have no hope . For since we believe that Jesus died and rose again , even so , through Jesus , God will bring with him those who have fallen asleep . For this we declare to you by a word from the Lord , that we who are alive , who are left until the coming of the Lord , will not precede those who have fallen asleep . For the Lord himself will descend from heaven with a cry of command , with the voice of an archangel , and with the sound of the trumpet of God . And the dead in Christ will rise first . Then we who are alive , who are left , will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air , and so we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death comes , we are sorrowful and heartbroken about losing someone so close to us . However , we should be joyful that he or she is free of this sinful world , pain , sorrows , heartaches , illnesses , etc . God knows , that is so much easier said than done ! But , as we continue to grow in Christ , we should eventually get there . Just recently , we lost the only surviving uncle , Deacon Robert C. Gerald Jr. , remaining on my mother 's side of the family . Although we had been expecting it , we continued to pray for a miracle because God works miracles every day . However , my uncle accepted his impending death so gracefully , saying , " I am ready . " He told his wife , Juanita Gelzer Gerald , " God has been good to me . " What a powerful testimony about his readiness to meet Jesus ... how grateful to God my uncle was ! In the words of a very popular gospel song , " I pray we 'll all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our business straight/So we can all meet at the gate/I pray we 'll all be ready for His return . " Given the turnouts at my uncle 's Wake/Omega Psi Phi Fraternity Inc . Memorial Service and his funeral Mass , it was clearly obvious that he was well-loved and was remembered as " a servant to all mankind " : a devout church worker , a community service advocate , an educator and a social worker . His oldest sister , Mrs. Levian Gerald Raiford , so pensively , yet realistically said , " He was ready , but we were n't . " The day before my uncle Gerald passed , we received a call from New York that my cousin Rena Mae Aiken Murray had lost her husband , Alvin Murray . Yes , " when it rains , it pours , " but we have to accept and remember that God is too just to do wrong and too wise to make a mistake . He was an awesome singer of the gospel , and his renditions could " set a church on fire . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cousins , Juanita and Rena , lost their husbands within one day of each other ! When death comes , it can take such a toll , but there is nothing we can do to change it except , " Trust in the Lord with all thine heart ; and lean not unto thine own understanding , " ( Proverbs 3:5 KJV ) . In this message , I have shared several verses of Scriptures and two recent experiences I have had with death . However , I am closing with some quotes about death that may serve as solace to some of you who are going through as well : " It is not length of life , but depth of life . " ( Ralph Waldo Emerson ) " Death is a challenge . It tells us not to waste time ... It tells us to tell each other right now that we love each other .

But since there are not enough renewables to completely replace nuclear power , the German utilities have to switch to coal in the meantime . <p> " There 's still a strong reliance on coal which endangers the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Paris Climate Agreement . This is a very fluid development so it is difficult to foresee how these developments will evolve during the next 12 to 24 months . But by the time Germany becomes CO2 neutral , which is expected to be by 2050 , it will be too expensive to burn any coal and most likely this will happen much earlier than that , " says Fridtjof Gerstein , portfolio manager for ESG fixed income at DWS . <p> But despite the continuing reliance on coal , utility companies who own coal power plants have the risk of ending up with " stranded assets " which are subject to unanticipated or premature write-downs , devaluations , or conversion to liabilities . Coal power plants have the potential to become stranded assets as the utility companies attempt to phase them out in favour of renewables . <p> The risk from " stranded assets " is also faced by investors who are invested in the utility companies ' stocks or bonds including institutions , investors , banks , pension funds , and insurance companies . <p> " Therefore when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to face stranded assets and nobody knows how they are going to get subsidies for that in return . So I definitely think it 's a vital or real risk , " says Gerstein . <p> DWS has reduced its investment in traditional utility companies that still own coal power plants and is focusing on utilities with renewable energy reliant business models . <p> DWS ' biggest ESG-focused fixed income strategy invests in European short duration sovereign bonds with a three-year maturity . This strategy currently has 1.7 billion euros in AUM . They have also recently launched an ESG strategy focused on green bonds which currently has 15.1 million euros in AUM. 
@@50797239 <h> Erdogan 's fumble puts presidential election in play <p> One thing worse than losing an election is losing the same vote twice -- and the second time around with an even wider margin . This is what Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan 's Justice and Development Party ( AKP ) succeeded in doing on Sunday night , as results confirmed that the opposition candidate and new darling of Turkish democrats , Ekrem Imamoglu , had won the " redo " Istanbul municipal election in a landslide . <p> The ruling-party candidate , Binali Yildirim , a former prime minister and close ally of Erdogan , conceded the race shortly after returns showed his opponent had garnered 54% of the votes , against 45% for Yildirim 's incumbent party . But this was not only Yildirim 's loss ; it also puts Erdogan 's 2023 presidential re-election bid in serious jeopardy . <p> By canceling the original election , Erdogan was playing with fire .

In reality , the mayoral vote was canceled because the narrow loss was simply unacceptable to Erdogan . <p> The ruling in favor of repeating the election came from the Supreme Electoral Council , in the latest of a series of strikingly autocratic moves by the Erdogan government . No one was surprised , of course , by the decision -- not in a country where the most popular opposition leader is in jail , 1,400 civil-society organizations have been closed and 140,000 civil servants have been fired .

But instead of turning this into an aggressive attack against Erdogan , Imamoglu once again ran a campaign based on bread-and-butter issues , and with a message of empathy for the poor and in support of national reconciliation . In a society tired of Erdogan 's angry and polarizing tactics , Imamoglu 's strategy proved refreshingly kinder and much welcomed . <p> The AKP , for its part , ran a confused race .

Then came the ultimate contradiction , when the AKP tried to persuade Istanbul 's large Kurdish community to stay home on election day . It did so by apparently asking Abdullah Ocalan -- the leader of the militant Kurdistan Workers ' Party , better known by its PKK abbreviation -- who is serving a life sentence , to write a letter telling them to stay neutral .

@@50810239 <h> On Everest to set up world 's highest weather station <p> Perched at almost 8,500 meters on Everest , we paced back-and-forth , attempting to stave off frostbite as temperatures hovered close to -30 degrees Celsius and our drill batteries became too cold to work . Our ambition to install the highest automatic weather station in history looked destined for failure . <p> We were at the end of an almost two-month expedition to conduct a hugely ambitious scientific survey of the 8,848-metre Mount Everest . I am a climate scientist who specializes in extreme environments , and together with Baker Perry ( a geographer at Appalachian State University ) , I was trying to install the highest weather station in the world . <p> Weeks of sickness had plagued the expedition ( from diarrhea to full-on Influenza-A ) , but we had so far succeeded . Four stations were under our belt , including at Everest Basecamp ( 5,315 meters ) , and Camp II ( 6,464 meters ) -- perched high above the infamous Khumbu Icefall . <p> The day before we had celebrated installing the highest operating weather station in the world , near Camp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Italian scientists had deployed equipment this high before . <p> Any celebrations , however , were short-lived . <p> We filled the rest of that day eating , melting snow and sleeping , squeezing in about two hours of sleep before climbing out of Camp IV as midnight approached . We were determined to get our final station as close to the summit as possible , capturing the first continuous measurements of the weather in the thin air of the " death zone " above 8,000 meters . <p> Such data increases our understanding of the climates possible on Earth . Were we going to find the strongest near-surface winds on the planet ? Just how cold and oxygen deprived is it up there during a winter storm ? Could a human theoretically survive these conditions ? Beyond this frontier meteorology and insight into life at the extremes , the station data could help improve weather forecasts on the mountain , hopefully making Everest climbers less susceptible to deadly surprises from extreme events . <p> Led by a superhuman Sherpa team from the nearby village of Phortse -- carrying the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ climbing paraphernalia -- we made good progress from Camp IV , climbing faster than we had all expedition . The atmosphere , however , was tense . <p> Above 8,000 meters there is little room for failure , and the 2019 Spring climbing season provided too many reminders of our vulnerability . Unfavorable weather concentrated a record number of climbers into just a few days for summit attempts , making parts of the mountain unusually crowded . Tragically , many more climbers than normal would never make it back down alive . <p> These crowds also impacted our expedition . <p> After around three hours of good progress towards the summit , we hit the back of a queue of climbers all clipped to the rope above . Our pace was cut by more than half . Hands and feet began to cool . The fear of frostbite grew . After hours more of shuffling , collective frustration was palpable . Our lead Sherpa ( Panuru ) -- a charismatic veteran of 14 successful Everest summit -- declared that we must reassess our options . So it was there , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that we peeled off from the back of the pack and found a spot for the weather station . <p> A weather station at 3,810 meters in Phortse installed on the same National Geographic and Rolex expedition . Photo:Eric Daft , National Geographic , Author provided ( No reuse ) <p> Continuing any higher would have been a dangerous gamble against the odds . Ours was not a typical climbing expedition : we needed to perform hours of work on the summit and , given the slow progress , it was extremely unlikely our oxygen supplies would have lasted the round trip . <p> Our Sherpa team leapt into action at the Balcony . They had trained with us over the past two months for this very moment . For Baker and I this represented the climax of almost eight months ' preparation . <p> We were desperate when the drill ( that was needed to help bolt the station to the rock ) refused to be coaxed to life . <p> It was only with the sustained body heat from our warmest Sherpa that the batteries eventually warmed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Sherpa were immense : a lifetime spent at high altitude meant they were quicker witted in the low oxygen environment , stronger , with hands more tolerant of the cold . It was thanks to their efforts that we successfully broke new ground with the installation of this weather station -- nearly half a vertical kilometer higher than anything that had gone before . <p> Now safely back at sea-level , Baker and I have been watching the near-real-time , satellite-streamed weather data with interest . We have already seen winds near Camp IV equivalent to a category 2 hurricane -- and this is the period normally known for its settled weather . <p> These stations owe their severe winds to the subtropical jetstream -- a high-altitude ribbon of fast-moving air which influences weather across large swathes of the Northern Hemisphere . Placing a weather station at such height means scientists can now monitor the jet directly and learn more about it . And the fact it is on the relatively well-trodden Mount Everest means passing climbers and Sherpas may be able to help with maintenance . <p> If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough , we hope that they will also give us a more complete picture of the high-altitude Himalayan climate , including how it may be changing . This is urgent because it is here that glaciers -- the source of freshwater to hundreds of millions of people -- are retreating , and as we improve our understanding of the climate , we increase our ability to outline the changes ( and challenges ) that may be ahead . <p> There is of course much to do , with far more monitoring needed to understand the spatial diversity in climate and its rate of change across the Earth 's mountains . It is difficult and risky to install weather stations in high-altitude locations , but the stakes are now very high . As scientists we must therefore accept the challenge and continue venturing upward . <p> This story appeared first on The Conversation ; it can be accessed here

Each day in the month of June , we will be highlighting a different member of the LGBTQ+ community who we think is a great example of representation and dynamic characterization . We will focus on fictional characters , celebrities , and activists alike -- the positive voices within the LGBTQ+ community and in mainstream media . <p> Today 's spotlight is on author , professor , and activist Jenny Boylan . <p> I first saw Jenny Boylan on The Oprah Winfrey Show in the early 2000s .

Jenny was different -- she was a teacher , a wife , a mom . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with buying a car , the salesman tried to convince her to purchase , based solely on the number of cup holders the car had . <p> In other words , Jenny was different , because she was just like you and me . <p> Even though members of the trans community still struggle to be seen and represented appropriately in media today , Jenny 's appearance on Oprah ( and Oprah 's respectful treatment of Jenny and Deedie , it should be noted ) helped start a shift in the public discourse and perception around the transgender community . <p> Jenny 's 2003 memoir , She 's Not There : A Life in Two Genders , became a national bestseller ( the first by a transgender American ) , thanks in large part to her appearance on that show .

And she has accomplished this feat primarily by the revolutionary act of existing . Guided by her mother 's advice -- " It 's impossible to hate anyone whose story you know " -- Jenny lives her life in the public eye , because she knows that the very act of existing and being visible can help refute others ' bigoted beliefs about trans persons . <p> I 'm seeing lots of trans peeps bravely and calmly having difficult convos here today .

" The hand starts out as a closed , upside-down flower over the heart , and then the hand turns itself right side up as the fingers open , symbolizing a flower opening in the light , and the hand is then brought back to the heart . <p> Image courtesy of ' Science Goes To The Movies !

The days in which we need to constantly explain ourselves and justify ourselves and wind up in these crazy conversations in which we have to defend our own humanity -- I 'm hoping that that is a moment in time that we are now passing through , and that , in the future , whether you 're trans or anything else , you can be human and still be loved . <p> Jenny and Deedie live in New York City and Belgrade Lakes , Maine , and have a daughter and a son . <p> Stay tuned for the conclusion to our 2019 Pride Month Series tomorrow .
