@@4580234 <h> Low Carbon Approach <h> Ensuring environment friendly economic growth <p> Low carbon approach would lead to green economy and sustainable development Dr Mohammad Sakhawat H Bhuiyan <p> DR Atiar Rahman of Bangladesh Bank , widely acclaimed as ' green ' governor , has been working relentlessly yet silently for green banking . Along with inclusion of environment protection clause as a condition of loan sanction , he has been taking various measures to make the Bangladesh Bank itself ' green ' by installing more energy-efficient LED lighting , solar panel on the roof of the bank building , and so on . Charity begins at home and that more likely encourages others as it happens in case of banks like BRAC and Mutual Trust . These initiatives and many more were discussed at a seminar on green banking , organised by the Institute of Livelihood Studies , recently . <p> I would like to say that there are ample avenues to explore in favour of green banking , even more broadly , green economy , and want to share some of my humble understanding that I have got from ' Sustainability in Crisis ' conference organised by the University of Cambridge . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ environmental growth is in direct conflict with economic growth unless these two are synchronised . The logic is simple more economic growth consumes more natural resources that hinder environmental protection , greater economic growth demands more production that emits more carbon and eventually exacerbates global warming . Likewise , more production as a result of higher economic growth induces more consumption which at one point exceeds the limit of necessity and causes wastage . Thus , in simple logic , the urge of more economic growth ends with the further deterioration of the environment . <p> But this simple logic does not remain simple when we consider the value of money interest . Profit making organisations always have a target to achieve the profit rate at least more than the interest rate of the economy . More interest rate induces entrepreneurs to make more profit and thus they go for more production and consumers end with a considerable amount of unnecessary consumption . If I say this alternatively , then it will be like less consumption and less production delaying the deterioration of the environment . Less production will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company may have less profit target if the interest rate in banks is lower . Therefore , a true environmental growth can have a strong boost by a simple yet too sensitive decision to lessen the interest rate . A single decision like this will minimise many problems related to environment . <p> As an alternative , without drastic interference to the traditional financial policies , environmental growth can be achieved through apparently contradictory economic growth when environmental issues are infused with economic issues in a balanced synchronisation . This idea is not too challenging to implement and found , theoretically , possible by many world renowned scholars . The prime concern of the environmental growth currently is to mitigate climate change . The three possible suggestions for this are radical application of environmental pricing , investment to innovate environmentally viable technology , and at the end , behaviour change of mass population . <p> In favour of environmental growth , the government and its financial institutions may consider working on the first two . For the application of environmental pricing , it can formulate and implement Environmental Tax Reforms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Denmark , Finland , Germany , Netherlands , Sweden , and the UK . ETR is about shifting of taxation from ' goods ' ( like income , profits ) to ' bads ' ( like resource used , pollution added , waste produced ) . Similar kind of reform was done before in Bangladesh when VAT was introduced . So , the formulation and implementation of ETR would not appear as an unachievable challenge . <p> In this case , Bangladesh may be the pioneer among developing countries as no countries other than developed ones have so far implemented ETR . While the third suggestion , i.e behaviour change of mass population , is beyond the scope of financial institutions , the second suggestion , that is the investment to innovate environmentally viable technology , is certainly within their scope to promote . The way the leading parts of the world have been shifting towards ' fair trade ' policy , ' organic ' consumption , ' responsible ' fishing , and ' child labour ' free production for fairer society and protected environment , the same way they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' less carbon ' in production as well as create ' less carbon ' in consumption . Consumers of mainly developed countries might look for products with ' less carbon ' tag , as many of them are now looking for products with ' organic ' or ' fair trade ' tags And for that they are found willing to pay more which I observed while I was in Europe . For quality production at low cost , Bangladesh has got a large market in developed countries and , for the ' low-carbon ' production , Bangladesh could have even larger market if it is well promoted and mobilised . <p> Full-fledged ' low carbon ' production is yet to begin and therefore requires innovative technology for low-carbon production of every possible product . Like agro-investment , the Bangladesh Bank may introduce interest-free finance for low carbon production projects . If it gets success , then it will not only contribute to the environmental growth but also to the country 's economic growth by creating export opportunities for ' less-carbon ' products to the developed countries . <p> A plant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , instead of watering on only one or two of its branches . The environment can be protected better and faster if its problems are resolved from roots , rather than just one or two superficial greening initiatives , while I agree that these initiatives altogether significantly contribute to a cleaner environment . <p> However , the urge is to address the issue at its root for a more effective and efficient environmental growth . Instead of waiting for initiatives from the West , we have to take immediate initiatives because , for the current global warming , Bangladesh will be immediate sufferer for its geographical location .

Prince Charming <p> Dear Charming , Since you have identified the problem it should not be very difficult to solve it . There is nothing very wrong with light flirtation . However , there should not be doubt in any one 's mind where this is leading to . You can not give women the impression that this will develop into something serious .

I do not encourage this and treat is as a breach of trust besides the age factor . When parents invite you to teach their girls or boys they entrust you with a responsibility which is to impart knowledge and also values . Please also be reminded that the relationship between teacher and student is sacred and can not be confused with any other relationship . Developing any other feelings is morally wrong especially when the student is so young . I request you to stay away and let her be a carefree girl whose present preoccupation should be related to studies and having fun with family and peers .

I do n't think the Mita column with its limitation of space , time etc. can do justice to this topic however , I will try . A satisfying and fulfilling physical relation is a very important element in marriage . It is natural and most couples have no problems with it especially couples as young as you both . There is something serious happening in your marriage and you can not just say you are happy with your husband but have no physical relations .

@@4594237 <h> BASIC Bank <h> Staff Correspondent <p> A BASIC Bank board member has recently raised questions about the managerial style of the government-appointed chairman at the organisation and his handling of allegations of financial irregularities . This is the first time a board member has come forward to expose imprudence in the running of the state-owned bank . The bank has been under the spotlight ever since scams by some of the bank 's branches of Tk 4,000 crore were made public . " The chairman Sheikh Abdul Hye Bacchu regards himself as all-in-all of the bank , " AKM Rezaur Rahman , a board member and also a former secretary , said in a letter to the banking division of the finance ministry last week . Bacchu conducts board meetings for only 20 to 30 minutes , during which he flips over more than 100 memos containing 500-600 pages each and gives decisions , said Rezaur , adding the chairman was always in a rush to wrap up the meetings . Rezaur also wrote about how Bacchu had responded to a letter from the central bank enquiring about the board 's approval to 13 loans . The letter from Bangladesh Bank was presented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " But the chairman said , ' There is no need to discuss it the issue and moved on to the next agenda ' , " Rezaur said . He said he had insisted on an elaborate discussion of the matter since he deemed it to be a " very important issue and not a mere piece of information " . The board took the decision on the 13 loans at a meeting in October last year , in which he was not present , Rezaur said , adding the loans got approved because of Bacchu 's apathetic management style . " Although disbursement of the loans had been put on hold following instructions from the Bangladesh Bank , I still expressed surprise at how the board could approve loans without following due procedures . " In response , the chairman asked the managing director of the bank to be careful to avoid recurrences of such events . As is the practice in the banking sector , at the beginning of every board meeting the chairman is supposed to give a brief of the discussion of the previous meeting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " As a result , there remains no scope to check what decisions have been taken in the previous meeting and what steps are being taken to act on them . " Moreover , the agenda of the meeting along with bundles of papers are distributed only on the eve of a board meeting , leaving the members with inadequate time to properly go through them . " Consequently , the board members do n't get the scope to play an active role in the running of the bank . " Bacchu , although involved with the HM Ershad-led Jatiya Party , is said to be always boasting of his rapport with the prime minister . " He says he does not care about anybody other than the prime minister . " Rezaur said the chairman uses the bank 's budget for corporate social activities at his own discretion , not by following the guidelines . Regarding BB 's demand that a memorandum of understanding ( MoU ) be signed to improve transparency and accountability at BASIC Bank , he said , " The bank 's managing director is against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the running of the bank . " " The chairman spoke of consensus , and proposed that the bank seek time from the central bank to analyse the MoU . " Rezaur in his letter , however , said most of the board members did not have objections to the managerial style of the chairman . Irregularities at BASIC Bank , said to be one of the best state-run banks , were exposed by media reports in recent months , which prompted discussions in parliament . A central bank inspection last year detected scams involving over Tk 4,000 crore in some of the bank 's branches . In another separate event , the commercial audit department of the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General found 17 instances of financial irregularities at the bank 's headquarters in 2012 . " Following reports in the media and letter from the central bank , it seemed to me that there is authenticity in the allegations , " Rezaur wrote .

This comfortable belief is however an injustice . Bangladesh emerged under unique circumstances , which even today are influencing our national politics . <p> While many leaders and activists played a part in the long struggle for the emergence of Bangladesh , Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman 's role was critical . <p> National vs religious identities <p> Before we became Bangladeshis , we were Indians and then Pakistanis . Our Indian identity was the byproduct of conquest when rulers from Northern India incorporated the peoples of Bengal into a succession of empires , which culminated in British India for two centuries from 1757 to 1947 . <p> When the British departed , the Muslims of India had become persuaded that they were a nation who needed autonomy to rule themselves . The Lahore Resolution of 1940 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ North West India and Eastern India . It proposed substantial provincial autonomy but did not actually demand a separate Pakistani state . <p> The emergence of Pakistan as an independent state in 1947 was the outcome of breakdowns in negotiations for independence from the British . Hence , India was partitioned and Bengal and Punjab divided to accommodate the logic of religion as the basis for nationality . <p> Communal violence let loose by partition unleashed what today is termed ethnic cleansing , where minorities on both sides of the border were massacred . Far exceeding what was witnessed in Bosnia , this virtually depopulated West Pakistan of sizeable Hindu and Sikh populations whilst East Punjab was " cleansed " of its Muslims . <p> Nonetheless , a sizeable segment of Muslims in India and many Hindus stayed behind in Bangladesh . The Hindus and Sikhs of West Pakistan were given no such choice . <p> The quest for national identity in Bangladesh <p> Within Pakistan , the people of Bangladesh faced a peculiar dilemma . They had proclaimed their Muslim identity to become part of Pakistan but close to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recognised by Jinnah in his famous speech upon independence , when he proclaimed a secular character for Pakistan and defined religion as a personal affair having nothing to do with the affairs of state . <p> While West Pakistan had solved its own dilemma by " cleansing " itself of its own religious minorities , it was inevitable the Bangladesh polity would seek to recreate itself as a secular state where religion was not the basis of national identity . <p> Bangalis soon found the commitment for regional self-rule , made by the Lahore Resolution , usurped by the central government . Had Pakistan 's central government remained democratic , the lack of provincial autonomy may have proved more tolerable . <p> However , the exercise of power by a non-Bangali dominated elite from the feudal classes of West Pakistan , allied with a military and bureaucracy from which Bangalis were virtually excluded , violated from the start the notion of shared nationhood with Pakistan . <p> The fallacious association of Urdu with a Pakistani identity also helped recreate a sense of Bangali identity for the inhabitants of Bangladesh . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subordinated the Bangalis by denying economic opportunities . It used its monopoly of power to manipulate policy to accelerate the development of West Pakistan over Bangladesh . <p> Thus , Bangladesh 's export earnings from jute were channelled to finance the industrialisation of West Pakistan with Bangladesh serving as a protected market for Pakistani goods . Within Bangladesh , administrative powers were monopolised by non-Bangali bureaucrats who promoted the growth of a non-Bangali business elite . <p> To mask this usurpation of the spirit of the Lahore Resolution , the Pakistani ruling elite revived the notion of Pakistan 's religious identity . From the time of the 1952 Language Movement , it argued that the assertion of a Bangali identity was un-Islamic as well as anti-Pakistan . <p> The reality of Pakistan 's politics however was that religion was used as a convenient instrument to deny democracy to its people . The struggles of the 1960s in Bangladesh were thus driven by the goals of autonomy , democracy , and cultural recognition . <p> Bangabandhu and the emergence of Bangladesh <p> The emerging sense of distinctiveness between the peoples of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense of national identity because the Bangalis of Pakistan still thought of themselves as Pakistani . It needed a major political effort to weave together notions of separateness within the consciousness of Bangalis into a sense of nationhood . <p> Whilst historic political figures such as HS Suhrawardy , Sher-e-Bangla Fazlul Haq and Moulana Bhashani all played a vanguard role in the political struggles of the people of Bangladesh , the catalytic act of political entrepreneurship to forge a sense of nationhood was provided by Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman . <p> From the launch of the Six Point Programme in 1966 to the defining two-year period from March 1969 to 1971 , Bangabandhu played a dominant role in the struggle for self-rule . He was aided by the dedication of colleagues in the Awami League , as well as by other secular political forces , not to mention individuals outside politics . <p> All these forces were brought and kept together by Bangabandhu to ensure that any division amongst the Bangalis could not be used to deflect from demands for self-rule for Bangladesh . <p> Bangabandhu played the critical role @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ West Pakistan by presenting the historic Six Point Programme in 1966 . The six points reflected a formal recognition that only through devolution of political power and authority over economic resources could the two provinces of Pakistan hope to survive within a single nation state . <p> A crucial limitation was the reluctance of Pakistan 's ruling elite to relinquish their power . Thus , the six points were rejected not just by the autocratic regime of Field Marshall Ayub Khan but also by the political opposition of West Pakistan who were part of its ruling class . Hence attempts to suppress mobilisation associated with the six points were directed largely at Bangalis . <p> Bangabandhu and most of the Awami League high command were arrested and kept in jail for two years . It took a mass uprising in both wings of Pakistan , culminating in the downfall of Ayub Khan in March 1969 , to obtain the release of Bangabandhu and his colleagues . <p> Ayub Khan 's resignation forced him to hand power to General Yahya Khan . Yahya Khan ostensibly sought accommodation by promising national elections @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bangabandhu was confident he could win an overwhelming mandate to frame a new constitution . <p> He believed that electoral support would persuade the military junta that suppressing the universal demand of the people would jeopardise the very foundations of the Pakistan state . This turned out to be a prophetic assumption by Bangabandhu . <p> The role of the 1969-70 election campaign in forging a national identity <p> Building an overwhelming mandate for the six points demanded total support from the people of Bangladesh . To build this unity , Bangabandhu 's core message to persuade Bangalis became that not only were they separate in their social , political and economic life from Pakistan , but they were one people who should vote together to proclaim the right to live separately . <p> Mass unity demanded a focus on identity politics and a capacity to project this into the consciousness of every villager in Bangladesh . It was not enough to rely on the urban , educated middle class . <p> The key message , encapsulated in a political poster put up by Awami League workers in every village @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eastern Bangal oppressed ) , itemised in simple language the statistics of disparity between East and West Pakistan . <p> The role of the Awami League as a party in delivering Bangabandhu 's message into every household of Bangladesh should not be underemphasised . Tajuddin Ahmad , General Secretary of the Awami League , and other key figures and dedicated workers provided large scale party organisation and dedicated work which should be recognised . <p> Bangabandhu ensured overwhelming support from voters for Awami League candidates by transcending his party to become a national icon who represented the aspirations of all Bangalis . The election of December 1970 resulted in the Awami League winning 167 out of 169 seats contested from Bangladesh with 75% of the vote . <p> The implications of the election of December 1970 <p> In December 1970 the people of Bangladesh empowered their representatives to the National Assembly of Pakistan to frame a constitution that recognised plural identities and devolved power to the regions . <p> The ruling elite in West Pakistan , including Zulfiquar Ali Bhutto , did not appreciate the election outcome . Neither Bhutto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comprehensively misinformed by Pakistan 's intelligence agencies , but both registered a threat to the bastions of power that dominated the Pakistan state . Deluding themselves about the decisiveness of the election , Yahya and Bhutto began conspiring to prevent Mujib taking power and put in motion forces , which culminated in the emergence of Bangladesh . <p> Yahya 's decision of March 1 , 1971 to postpone the inaugural National Assembly session scheduled to meet in Dhaka on March 3 , 1971 was an open reflection of his and Bhutto 's choice to deny the democratic mandate . <p> Non-cooperation to self-rule : March 1971 <p> Despite such manoeuvrings , by March 1971 , Bangabandhu had the entire machinery of administration in Bangladesh behind him . Between March 1 and March 15 , Bangladesh 's de facto independence emerged as it assumed all the correlates of an independent state . <p> So total was the non-cooperation movement that the economy came near to collapse and Bangabandhu had to escalate the movement from non-cooperation towards self-rule . <p> A rudimentary policymaking apparatus was established to reestablish the economy and administrative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to discuss operational ways to collect public revenues , revive banking and exports , pay salaries of public employees , resume fertiliser distribution , operate tube wells and keep transport functional . <p> Tajuddin Ahmad and Kamal Hossain communicated with Bangali bureaucrats who had been elected by their colleagues to act as conduits for transmitting the orders of Bangabandhu to the administration . <p> Bangabandhu 's private residence on Road 32 in Dhanmondi , in effect , became the seat of authority in Bangladesh during March 1971 . Delegations met there to seek decisions . Whilst there were instances of persecution for some non-Bangalis , the machinery of law and order was restored as the police began to take orders from Bangabandhu and even non-Bangalis were extended protection . <p> The emergence of a sovereign Bangladesh <p> By March 15 , for all practical purposes , a functioning de facto administration was projected to the world through a large contingent of the international press who were present to cover what appeared to all as the emergence of a new state in Bangladesh . <p> During March 1971 , Sheikh Mujibur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the most globally visible personalities of the Third World . Not only were Bangalis ruling themselves for the first time since the Battle of Plassey , but they were also doing so through freely elected representatives . <p> At the same time Bangabandhu was trying to persuade Yahya to accept the democratic process . If Yahya had conducted negotiations on the basis of political realities a peaceful solution might have been conceivable via a loose confederation , which may have eventually led to a peaceful parting of Bangladesh from Pakistan . <p> It was not to be as Yahya , goaded by Bhutto and hawks in his junta , persisted with his delusion that a show of force would bring Bangali leaders to their knees . He did not believe that the Bangalis had the cohesion , courage , or capacity to sustain a liberation war . <p> Both Yahya and Bhutto believed that West Pakistan could scorch the earth and make the Bangalis pay in fire and blood for their presumptions of sovereignty . Bhutto more cynically also believed that Yahya could not survive the loss of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would emerge as leader of the rump Pakistan . <p> Yahya used the cover of negotiations to move troops into Bangladesh . By the time Yahya gave his final orders to General Tikka Khan to launch his genocide on the Bangalis on the night of March 25 , it was Pakistan which was the usurper of authority from the democratically established sovereign state of Bangladesh . <p> Bangladesh 's declaration of independence <p> By March 25 , 1971 , Bangladesh was a sovereign state in the minds of its citizens . Bangabandhu 's proclamation of independence on March 26 , in response to the military assaults ordered by Yahya Khan , was a juridical act recognising a de facto and legitimate authority . <p> The post-liberation debate over who declared independence of Bangladesh is largely irrelevant . It is self-evident that Bangladeshis asserted their independence during March 1971 . At that time , the one person with the credibility to declare independence in the legal sense was Bangabandhu . <p> Any local declarations of independence can only be accepted as surrogate acts on his behalf . It is only in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ debate could persist over who declared independence . <p> The unique basis of Bangladesh 's nationhood <p> When independence was formally declared on March 26 , 1971 , Bangabandhu had a freely given and overwhelming electoral mandate to speak for Bangladesh . Such a mandate was not available to Gandhi , Nehru , or even Mandela , all of whom only obtained electoral legitimacy after independence . <p> It was Bangabandhu 's universally recognised authority which persuaded Bangali judges , bureaucrats and diplomats to extend their support and allowed Bangali members of the armed forces of Pakistan to break their oaths of service and pledge allegiance to the liberation of Bangladesh . <p> Only in Bangladesh were servants of colonial rule able to repudiate colonial rule so actively because they had a leader with the legitimate authority to speak for the people . <p> Hence , Bangladeshis were able to command worldwide support even when governments of the day remained lukewarm . It was this popular groundswell of support for the Bangladesh liberation struggle and against the genocide of the Pakistan army , which compelled some national governments to demand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unleashed by Yahya and the Pakistan Army would result in even more of a global outcry for the trial of Yahya and Tikka Khan as war criminals . <p> That ordinary people around the world took notice of the atrocities inflicted on the people of Bangladesh is due in no small part to the global visibility and stature of Bangabandhu . Without his efforts , our liberation struggle could have turned out to be much more protracted . <p> When the Pakistani army launched its aggression , the entire population of Bangladesh rose up to resist . Two years of mobilisation by Bangabandhu had made them conscious of their identity and March 1971 made them a nation . <p> More than most nations , Bangladesh owes a blood debt to the people who died for liberation . It owes much to the leader who played a critical role in inculcating nationhood within the hearts of the people . <p> The tragedy of post-liberation Bangladesh lies not only in Bangabandhu 's brutal assassination but also in the way he was marginalised for 21 years . We have paid an incalculable price @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ethos of the liberation struggle to condemn us to divisiveness and social unrest , which compromises the democratic process . <p> We have forgotten the ability of Bangabandhu to involve the people in a way that made mass participation a distinctive feature of Bangladesh 's liberation struggle . <p> For this same reason it remains essential to build a society where common people are given a sufficient material stake in the rewards of independence and a commensurate democratic stake in shaping a modern Bangladesh .

Is n't it discrimination ? Even If a patient is not well and his T.B is active or harmful , still on humanitarian basis , they should never put a ban on T.B patient . <p> On the contrary , government should open T.B treatment centers across U.A.E to fight this disease . In worst case they may deport the expatriate for 6 to 9 months to his/her country to get their T.B treated so that they may return and work like normal human beings . <p> Early T.B detection and " complete treatment " would help reduce its spread by providing free medicines as India is helping to its patients irrespective of any location he/she belongs to . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to avoid diagnosis , increasing the risk of spreading the disease . <p> I was shocked to know that I will be permanently banned to enter this country .

The young entrepreneur was still finishing up undergrads , so the biggest hurdle was to get people to take him seriously enough to back him , but slowly , and surely , he managed to win over prospective partners , find a place , jump the hurdles , and Dhaka 's first sport cafe was born on February 25 , 2010 . <p> With such young partners running the show , the story could have been very different , had it not been for the FIFA World Cup 2010 which began within 3 months of the launch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people into the place every night for the duration of the tournament , firmly cementing the Bench in the psyche of the city 's sport fanatics .

Adding to the cafe 's memorable events , the Euro 2012 match nights were definitely some of the best times for the Bench crowd ; pre-match live concerts , delicious food and a lively crowd of music and football fanatics , roaring and jeering through the night- could n't get any better than that ! <p> However , it was in 2012 , only two years after its inception , and quite possibly at the peak of its success , that the Bench owners ' decided to call it quits for a number of reasons .

But the company 's comeback attempt in their much-anticipated Blackberry 10 platform and their recently launched smartphone BlackBerry Z10 is out to prove it . At least that 's what they said . We actually beg to differ . Though it features a slab-like but premium quality design that does n't stand out from the likes of iPhone 5S , the defining factor here is that there are no physical buttons on the device . The OS , Blackberry 10 , uses a gesture based interface that 's intuitive . Frankly speaking , it makes you wonder when other phones will adopt it . A bit warning though because the learning curve is pretty steep . Featuring a 4-inch , 1280 ? 768-pixel screen that boasts a very impressive 355 ppi , there 's high quality glass here that makes reading and media viewing a joy to experience . A 1.5GHZ dual-core that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with every application without any sort of lag . Its something I could n't say about previous BlackBerry phones . It 's clear that BlackBerry has been forced to step up their game and have actually delivered what the current market demands while offering things unheard of in the smartphone arena.The Blackberry 10 OS is powered by some key new features that stand out . The Hub , for example , is a consolidated inbox that 's powerful enough to bring all your social feeds , text messaging , email and notifications into one well-organized feed . The Peek &amp; Flow allows you to peek and look at a new notification message you 're receiving while being inside an application and never actually leaving it . Multitasking is also a key focus here with Active Frames where every running application can be swiped up to make it fluidly run in the background . It 's a really intuitive way of navigation , although one that will require a modest learning curve for the first few days . But once you 're used to it , nothing will match up . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ physical QWERTY phones , the Z10 features by far the best touch keyboard in any phone in the market . While nothing can replace the tactile feedback of a physical keyboard , the keyboard here allows you to actually type faster with some excellent prediction tools and a dictionary that learns the way you write and gradually becomes even smarter . There are departments in which the phone , or rather the OS lags behind is applications . For someone coming from iPhone or Android , you 'll have to know that Blackberry 10 lacks some of the big name apps like Instagram , Google Maps and more . Thankfully , the tech savvy user can sideload any Android app into the phone thanks to the phone supporting an Android runtime environment . There are more than 70,000 apps in the store that work well as alternatives , but it 'll be a while before some big name apps make the jump to the platform . The camera has some excellent new features like Time Shift which allows you to select aspects of multiple pictures into one perfect photo , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flagship devices . <p> The Verdict <p> Overall , the Blackberry Z10 is the phone to look at if you 're bold enough to break away from the shackles of iOS and Android . It 's a promising new platform with everything that some people loved about BlackBerry and all sorts of improvements to cater to a modern market . But like all other non-mainstream OS 's out there , it has many limitations . The touch gesture while is innovative , still needs some time to get use to . Moreover get ready for occasional crashes that many users reported in many forums . The BB map does not support BD streets yet . And even if it did it 's likely to be worse than Apple maps . The apps support is growing but several key apps are still missing . While it was expected to be a resounding success provided it had a new operating system and some tweaks . Sadly , it was n't .

@@4604234 <p> It was not long ago that a visitor to Yangon would have to navigate the city 's largest market , weighing up which whispering street banker one trusted the most , just to change money . The currency , the kyat , was pegged by the then government to the ludicrous rate of 6.4 Kyat to the dollar , when in actual fact , the market rate fluctuated around 1,000 . <p> The government , which is now nominally civilian , accepted the folly in this charade and floated the currency . This move , economically at least , breaks with a half century of destructive denial . The International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) attributed Myanmar 's progress to an " ambitious reform programme " that is now " bearing fruit . " Despite Myanmar 's new-player status , its economy bears significant resemblances to that of Bangladesh , though there are important differences that give Bangladesh Plc. reason for concern . <p> Both countries have GDP growth rates of around 6% , which is generally healthy in a global context . Myanmar 's , however , appears to be rising while Bangladesh 's has fallen in the short term . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and constitutes for a while , a more attractive narrative to sell to shareholders " according to Professor Sean Turnell of Australia 's Macquarie University . Bangladesh is currently plagued by what Turnell describes as an , " increasingly insufferable ' governing ' apparatus . " <p> The 5-year cycle Bangladesh has weathered storms before , or , as Shadab Sajid of W&amp;W commodities traders describes , " We weather them every five years . " It is a cycle whereby every time there is an election , political instability causes Bangladeshi economy to slow in growth as investors take fright at the sight of our leaders ' attempts to grab power for whatever financial or political gain it can offer . <p> Garments Bangladesh , of course , has a trump card : the garments sector . The tragedies of Rana Plaza and Tazreen fashions , however , raise fears that investors may be wary of the image that brand Bangladesh'gives to their products . This is especially so as Bangladesh labours with implementation of regulations and basic legal cases ; there have been no arrests made in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aminul Islam , or in the case of the owner of Tazreen Fashions , Delwar Hossain . While orders for garments were , according to the Financial Express , down by 30-35% for the spring/summer season , the EU has awarded Myanmar GSP status . The EU is Bangladesh 's single biggest export destination for RMG . Myanmar also possesses extremely low labour costs , which is possibly the single biggest consideration for the international trade . Moreover , there is concern that with expected wage rises and new compliance obligations , prices in Bangladesh will soon start to rise , as savings are not added as wages go up . <p> Infrastructure The garment sector can not set up in Myanmar over night , and many of the challenges that plague Bangladeshi manufacturers similarly plague Myanmar , namely , as Turnell states , " infrastructure ( the world having decided it can live with the country 's politics ) . Electricity is the big issue here , of course . The cost of generating it privately ( very necessary to maintain the production lines required ) fast erodes labour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ countries now have a challenge : to provide their countries with electricity and transport . As a result , the Padma Bridge experience is worrying . Corruption is a major issue in Myanmar too , but foreign stakeholders have not had their fingers burnt yet , since the Myanmar government stopped servicing loans from the Asian Development Bank ( ADB ) in the late 1980s ( which resulted in a freeze in lending from the major multinational financiers such as the World Bank and the ADB ) . <p> The enthusiasm for Myanmar has meant that a slew of foreign governments and corporations have stepped in to look at infrastructure , a move that could see Myanmar not only possessing similarly cheap labour costs , but also working systems and services . It is early days yet for Myanmar , but a comparison between a proposed Tata industrial estate in Bangladesh , which was shelved in 2008 , and projects such as the Thilawa port near Yangon , are worth making . <p> The Tata project would have been one of Bangladesh 's largest foreign direct investments , with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was shelved , allegedly , because of an anti-India bias here . The Thilawa port and the proposed Dawei project are two foreign-led port and industrial estate projects that aim to produce transport hubs in Myanmar . Thilawa is Japanese-led and Dawei Thai-led , with potential Japanese funding . While Myanmar and Thailand share neighbourly rivalries and a troubled history , Dawei is not being stifled by such animosities , but rather the over ambition of its Thai creators . <p> Good neighbours ? Myanmar has a large advantage here . Her neighbourhood , while far from being a bed of roses , is far more functional than Bangladesh 's . Myanmar , for all its political problems , does not have political parties that are defined by their animosity to its neighbours . There is a common suspicion of China , but Myanmar can play that huge power in the north off against countries within the ASEAN bloc . Thailand , Malaysia , and Singapore , for instance , offer huge potential for FDI , not least because the ASEAN free trade area will take root in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ internal deficiencies , in the medium term , this will provide steady and potentially decisive investment . Myanmar planners confide that it will be a race against time to equip the country 's businesses to be ready for this transition ; Myanmar companies are hungry to absorb skills and capacity ready for this new-found exposure to one of the largest single markets on earth . <p> India , for its part , is not an ideal neighbour to either country . However , Bangladesh is much more wedded to it by geography and history . Indicative of it being a poor neighbour is the relative speed with which Indian hydro projects have progressed in Myanmar compared to their Chinese counterparts , and India 's flip flopping with regards to their Myanmar stance . In the 1990s India supported Myanmar 's democracy movement , but over night , in 1998 , became accustomed to working at the behest of the Myanmar military intelligence to ruthlessly suppress opposition . Regressive trade policies between ASEAN and Myanmar , and India and Bangladesh also stand in stark contrast . While Bangladeshi politicians block Indian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barriers on Bangladesh , which sees a huge trade deficit in favour of India ; the World Bank estimating that much bilateral trade may be illegal . <p> Tourism Tourism is another sector where Myanmar will likely see double-digit growth while Bangladesh will lag . Myanmar 's tourism sector has boomed since the country had its apparent opening to the world . The country is far less densely populated than Bangladesh , and so has more of the rural idyll to offer . Though Myanmar has bigoted politicians , it does not have parties or mass movements that call for men and women not to mingle in public : which would be an obvious joy kill for any family holiday . The country 's acceptance meanwhile of leisure activities such as drinking or peacefulness , also gives it an edge over Bangladesh . Tourism may not seem like a decisive industry but can be extremely potent for developing economies , offering it , mass , low-skilled employment and export earnings with little complex planning needed . <p> Remittances Bangladesh , of course , has an answer in the form of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as we experience capital flight equivalent to about double yearly FDI inflows , partly a result of our five-year cycle of political instability . Remittances also help Myanmar , but are , until now , largely off the books , partly as a result of the lack of financial institutions which say the IMF is another sector in which Myanmar will experience double-digit growth . However , the Bangladeshi tradition of exporting labour will take some catching up to , particularly given the strong and organised links that the country has to the Middle Eastern petro states ; relationships that Myanmar has still to foster . <p> Natural resources : curse or cure ? Myanmar has been kept afloat by an enviable natural endowment in the form of natural gas , timber , gems , and other minerals . Much of this has been wasted already . The Yadana pipeline carries gas to Thailand , yet much of the profits have been spent on building the new capital , Naypyidaw , and the military , which numbers around half a million men . Profits were allegedly pilfered via a scam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ books , the gas profits were accounted for at the rate of 6.4 Kyat to the dollar , when in reality it was sold for the more realistic market exchange rate of around 1,000 . <p> However , this exchange rate scam has now ended and according to the US Energy Information Agency , Myanmar has 10 trillion cubic feet of proven gas reserves whilst Bangladesh has 6.49 . This has meant an in-rush of foreign multinationals into Myanmar , eager to exploit the reserves , contrasting with a slowing of enthusiasm toward Bangladesh . This will only be decisive if Myanmar can now equitably spend those profits , by no means a given , even in a democracy . <p> The example of the UK and Norway is salient . While they split the same hydrocarbon bounty in the North Sea , the UK has suffered growing inequality , de-industrialisation , and two recessions since striking oil . Norway , by comparison , has attained the highest living standards on earth , and its state pension fund is the largest owner of equity in the EU . The challenge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ natural bounty . This could be decisive and , in this respect , Bangladesh could learn from the mistakes Myanmar has already made : spending money on infrastructure for the gas or electricity industries , as opposed to a submarine for the vanity industry , for instance . <p> Reality check The picture for Bangladesh can at times appear gloomy , but there are bright spots . Arguably , Bangladesh has been through the worst of its troubled birth . The World Bank notes , for instance , " remarkable progress , " in eliminating extreme poverty . The same apolitical efforts must now be applied to attaining middle-income status . There are green shoots in this respect ; in the diversification in manufacturing , ships have quietly left Bangladeshi shipyards , heading to foreign buyers , while the pharmaceutical sector shows growing promise , and the prospect of electronics assembly also rears its head . Success in manufacturing is a tribute to the country and its workers , and this must be built on to move up the ' food chain ' and has been the classic route that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be the best way to face stiff competition from our neighbours , but it will take a shift in political leadership to move beyond the bargain basement . <p> The IMF predicts that Bangladesh 's GDP growth rate will slip below 6% , while the ministry of finance predicts it will reach over 7% . If there was n't the scent of a power struggle in the air , Finance Minister Muhith 's prediction could be plausible . This is perhaps indicative of the problem : in the same way the Burmese generals pulled up their boots and admitted that their currency was n't worth 6.4 to the dollar , it is time for Bangladesh 's politicians to sell economic reality , as opposed to vindictive squabble.
