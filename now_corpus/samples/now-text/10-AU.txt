The car is powered by a 556-horsepower ( 415kW ) 551 lb. -ft. of torque ( 747 Nm ) supercharged V8 engine which comes from the CTS-V sedan . Combining the CTS Coupe 's design and the power results in a luxury sports coupe for the driving enthusiasts . <p> " The CTS-V Coupe marries our most potent and sophisticated technology with our most dramatic production design , " said Bryan Nesbitt , Cadillac general manager . " This combination of visual and technical attributes is designed to create a very compelling choice for luxury sports car consumers . " <p> Set to begin production in the middle of the year the CTS Coupe includes technologies such as Magnetic Ride Control , Brembo brakes and an automatic transmission with paddle shift control . The V series Coupe has a unique grill which doubles the air intake volume , important for the cars high performance requirements . The bonnet also has a raised centre section to provide clearance for the supercharger . Similar to the CTS Coupe the exhaust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outlets . 19 inch cast aluminium wheels can be painted or polished and are fitted with Michelin Pilot Sport 2 performance tires . <p> The rear track of the Coupe is almost one inch wider than the sedan it is based on , which gives the car an aggressive stance and also helps with improved handling . The CTS-V Sport Sedan established itself as one of the world 's highest performing luxury sedans , it was the first production car fitted with street tires to break the eight minute barrier at Germany 's Nurburgring track . With the V series Coupe 's sleeker shape and lower weight its performance should be similar to the sedan if not better . Sharing the same wheelbase as the CTS-V Sport Sedan the Coupe is 51 mm lower and 51 mm shorter , sharing only the instrument panel , console , headlamps , front guards and grille . <p> Key design features consist of the classic hardtop styling with no conventional B pillar . The doors have touch-pad operation with no door handles . The windshield is at a 62.3 degree angle with an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vertical lighting with LED highlights and a high mounted stop lamp which functions as a rear spoiler . Recaro driving seats are an option in the CTS-V Coupe , providing good support for enthusiastic driving . The seats are 14-way adjustable and have pneumatic side bolsters in the cushion and backrest . <p> A new and exclusive Saffron colour is an option for the interior with accents carried on the seat inserts and stitching . Microfiber covers the steering wheel , seat inserts and shifter , offering the luxurious character of suede without the negatives of difficult care .

@@1354231 <h> Could thorium help nuclear power clean up its act ? <p> It may not bode well for Australia 's massive uranium mining industry but growing worldwide interest in the use of an alternative nuclear fuel promises a cleaner more efficient method of producing electricity without the toxic waste legacy of today 's nuclear power plants . <p> The fuel in question is thorium a mildly radioactive metal that is number 90 on the periodic table and estimated to be several times more common in nature than uranium . ( That 's it on the right in metal foil form -- the terrific image is Copyright ( c ) 2010 Theodore Gray periodictable.com ) <p> Thanks to similar radioactive properties to the uranium used to power the world 's nuclear reactors ? ? ? and its byproduct plutonium used in nuclear weapons ? ? ? thorium can also be used to power a controlled nuclear reaction that heats water producing steam to power turbines that produce large quantities of electricity . <p> From an environmental perspective the good news about thorium is that it 's far less radioactively damaging than uranium : its naturally occurring form monazite is said to be reasonably safe for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a nuclear reactor decay remain dangerous for only a fraction as long ? ? ? decades instead of thousands of years by some accounts . <p> Thorium is also apparently far less likely to result in Chernobyl-sized explosions : because it 's relatively stable compared with reactor-grade uranium thorium-fueled chain reactions are unlikely to spiral out of control . This also means the reactors are somewhat more straightforward to design sidestepping the massively complex system of controls and failsafes that sustains reactions within uranium reactors . <p> So why have n't you heard more about thorium power ? After all thorium is already widely used for industrial applications such as welding and lending physical strength to magnesium . And its potential use as a fuel for nuclear reactors has been understood for half a century as Wired reports : in 1958 nuclear scientist Alvin Weinberg then-director of the US military 's Oak Ridge National Lab published a nearly 1000-page summary of research into thorium-fueled power . <p> Despite its theoretical advantages over uranium however Weinberg 's advocacy of thorium for nuclear reactors fell onto deaf ears as Cold War-era governments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us is that politicians were just as interested in the weapons-grade plutonium-239 that the process produced . By the time Weinberg left Oak Ridge in 1973 research into thorium-powered nuclear reactors had all but disappeared . <p> Fast-forward through the 30-year Cold War and 20 years of nuclear detente and thorium is slowly creeping back into the limelight . As countries like India and China race to find new ways to provide energy to their massive populations over their creaking infrastructures governments are leading a change in thought that is paving the way for the potential commercial-grade use of thorium in a new breed of reactor . <p> France which is known worldwide for its massive reliance on nuclear power has returned to Weinberg 's original designs to see if they could n't inform a more environmentally-friendly nuclear reactor design . China is stockpiling thorium India 's government has expressed interest in the technology and US legislators are lobbying to give the US Department of Energy $US250m in seed funding under the auspices of the Thorium Energy Independence and Security Act . <p> The potential for a thorium rebirth bodes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we are sitting on the world 's largest reserves of thorium ? ? ? 340000 Imperial tons compared with 300000 tons each in the US and India 180000 tons in Norway and 100000 tons in Canada . Reserves here and abroad are largely untapped with mining of thorium-containing monazite ceased in 1994 and stockpiles produced then continuing to support what small volumes are necessary for industrial use ( USGS figures suggest just $US155000 of thorium was used in the US in 2008 ) . <p> This puts Australia in something of a quandary . With only one nuclear reactor a major uranium exporting business and an electricity infrastructure built around 19th-century coal-powered energy production there is a strong financial case to support the status quo . Building a thorium production infrastructure is expensive and there is currently no market for its products ? ? ? not to mention the cost of the reactors themselves . <p> However should other world powers ramp up thorium production to support a fledgling new power infrastructure Australia will need to revisit its position on clean energy generation ? ? ? and specifically where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much of a role this wonder-metal plays will remain to be seen but growing interest makes it as much an opportunity for Australia as a threat . <p> The image of thorium metal foil above is from periodictable.com where you can see many interesting photos of what thorium looks like . 
@@1354232 <h> Search in : <h> The next GFC : our ageing population <h> Peter Promnitz <p> The rapidly ageing population is looming as a bigger financial crisis than the last global meltdown . Photo : Jessica Shapiro <p> Australia is facing a financial crisis that in years to come will dwarf the global financial crisis : the cost of an ageing population . <p> When Treasurer Wayne Swan launched the Australian Institute for Population Ageing Research last year , he commented that the ageing population was among Australia 's most important long-term economic and social challenges . In fact , we believe in coming years age-related spending around the world , primarily driven by increased pension and health-care costs , will outstrip the costs of the GFC . <p> Population growth statistics illustrate the severity of the issue . The proportion of people aged 65 and over within the general population is projected to almost double in the next 40 years , rising to 22 per cent in 2049 , compared with about 13 per cent today , and 8 per cent in 1969 . <p> Advertisement <p> These are scary statistics . But the challenges are not insurmountable , especially if employers step @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Transforming Pensions and Healthcare in a Rapidly Ageing World : Opportunities and Collaboration Strategies published by The World Economic Forum , with the support of Mercer and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development , the burden of ensuring the productivity and retirement security of the world 's workforce is increasing , and the responsibility for it is shifting . <p> The report makes a compelling case for immediate and collaborative action by the private and public sectors . Employers and governments will need to collaborate in new ways to meet the challenges we face of financing pensions and health care because of our unprecedented ageing population . <p> Financial constraints have seen many governments and employers reduce their role in retirement and health provision , shifting the responsibility to employees . In fact , Australia has been ahead of most of the rest of the world in many regards , such as retirement plans , with this shift of responsibility . Employers , who will be challenged by these demographic changes in the labour force , need to potentially realign some of this responsibility and play a role in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> By influencing public policy in the areas of retirement savings and products , health care , wellbeing , workplaces and workforce planning , employers can anticipate and respond to the challenges presented by an ageing population . However , it is not enough to promote such policies in the public sphere ; employers must lead by example and show how they can succeed in their own organisation . <p> It is important employers take action across their employees ' lifespan , not just towards the end . There are three phases during which employers should take action : recruitment , retention and retirement . <p> The first , promoting work for and attracting older employees , should be a key element of any organisation 's workforce planning . Some Australian companies have adopted initiatives in this regard . Many more need to , but have not . <p> The GFC has only brought these issues into sharper focus as those employers who lose sight of long-term workforce trends may find themselves without the skills and workers necessary to survive and grow in the medium and long-term . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particular segments of the workforce with customer needs -- ie. training older workers to address the concerns of older customers that younger staff may be too inexperienced to appreciate . Successful businesses will also retain the experience and knowledge of older workers by being creative and flexible in their work practices with a willingness to redefine the job where necessary and effectively manage retirement transitions . <p> The second stage is retention . A focus on recruiting older workers is worthwhile , but if they do n't stay long the focus may have been in vain . Employers are understandably cautious about whether an older workforce carries health-care cost consequences . However , research demonstrates the probability of disability and absenteeism is indeed greater with age , however , in the oldest age groups the chances of disability among those still working declines . <p> Initiatives are likely to be more successful where the design of the job -- working arrangements , environment , nature of activity and training -- are considered alongside health issues . Providing practical incentives to enable employees to adopt healthier diets and increase their exercise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more innovative wellness initiatives can be built . <p> Employers also need to focus on preparing employees for eventual retirement . Communicating with older staff about retirement and transition plans will assist with workforce planning and the individual 's transition out of the workforce . <p> Encouraged by or in partnership with governments , employers should provide financial education , to improve Australians ' preparation for retirement . Accumulation of retirement savings needs to be viewed as a whole-of-life goal by individuals , not just as something that occurs in one 's working life . More education and information is needed in the workplace to help this happen . <p> For many employees , especially younger ones , planning for retirement seems a complex and far-away concern . Even if they are aware and informed about the need to save more , people tend to remain passive . For this reason there is a need for early intervention to get younger people into high-growth investment strategies within their superannuation , not just with those nearing retirement , and both superannuation funds and employer can play a role in this push @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , employers should encourage employees to seek the advice of their superannuation fund or financial adviser . Far too few employees understand their objectives and needs when it comes to their superannuation , so many fail to correctly choose , and update , their investment options . <p> The financing of long-term benefits presents many very specific challenges for a major business -- the timescale alone is longer and more daunting compared with most business planning activities . The area is highly technical , with volumes of localised legislation to challenge the multinational organisation . While employers play particularly important roles in economic and social development , their reactions to the economic and social implications of an ageing population are likely to vary considerably . However , all employers are likely to agree wholeheartedly that concerted action is needed right now if long-term retirement and health care financing is to be sustainable . <p> Many Australian businesses have taken steps to fulfilling this potential . Many more must do so . <p> Peter Promnitz is region head of Mercer Asia Pacific . <h> 10 comments <p> I note the Prime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to dramatically increase productivity to deal with the ageing population . <p> The PM and the Deputy PM need to answer some serious questions about how the winding back of the Workplace Relations system to the 1970 's is going to assist to achieve this policy objective . <p> The ALP Government had a mandate to get rid of AWAs ( notwithstanding that individual contracts are still part of the new national system ) and to provide an adequate safety net . <p> The DPM 's reforms go well beyond this and Australian employers now face a system where virtually nothing can be done without union involvement even where there is no or little union membership in a workplace . <p> I expect that this is the price the economy must pay for the massive union movement contribution to the ALP election coffers . <p> It is going to be a very high price and will seriously impede Australia 's recovery from the GFC let alone any further productivity improvement . <p> Commenter <p> Stephen <p> Location <p> Sydney <p> Date and time <p> January 20 , 2010 , 6:28AM @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closet .

The problem is always stated as one which focusses only on the older proportion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other age segments of the population . <p> It is true that the proportion of the polulation composed of those over 65 will continue to increase for the next forty years . It is equally true that the numbers under 15 will continue to decline for that same period unless we substantially alter current re-production and or immigration rates . That means the financial burdens likely to be imposed on our society by the aged will be substantially , if not totally , offset by the reduction in costs to sustain the young . <p> What will also happen is that the retirement age of 65 , which was set at the end of the nineteenth century , when most people did n't actually reach that age , will be shifted substantially upwards towards 75 as more and more people reach their nineties . <p> All of this is not to suggest that there will not be substantial adjustments to be made by all of us .

I personally am sick and tired of hearing about the Aging Population . Older people make great contributions to society : they are the dispensers of wisdom , they mind the grandchildren ( their own and others of similar age ) , their assist their children in general and quite often also financially , they staff as volunteers ( no pay ! ) NGOs of all sorts , they support each other by looking out for each other - and so the list goes on . <p> But they are seen as a burden , especially a financial burden .. They would not be a burden on the health and pension scheme if governments would have the foresight to introduce universal health and superannuation systems that , fully implemented , would ensure financial independence in retirement , NOT paid for by the younger generation . <p> Yes , it would mean some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be borne by the wealthy , but in the end it would benefit the whole community . <p> But , as Ya Ya Ya says , it 's all about immigration . Politicians know fulwell that immigration does not fix " Aging " , so it is just an excuse to get more consumers into the country to acquiese the property developers and big business .

Rudd Swan and Tanner are obsessed with GDP economic growth and that is easy to achieve via consumpotion with more people in Australa.In reasltiy per cpaita GDP has dropped , but they do not mention that . High immigration is completely unsustainable , and raising the retirement age and other measures msut be examined in lieu of more people

But , how serious is this danger ? <p> The FAA says that their airworthiness tests " do not contain adequate or appropriate safety standards for these design features " . So basically , it seems that there 's a grey area for now , leaving the responsibility in the aeroplane manufacturers . Still , they gave these guidelines to Boeing : <p> 1 . Boeing must ensure electronic system security protection for the aircraft control domain and airline information domain from access by unauthorized sources external to the aeroplane , including those possibly caused by maintenance activity . <p> 2 . Boeing must ensure that electronic system security threats from external sources are identified and assessed , and that effective electronic system security protection strategies are implemented to protect the aeroplane from all adverse impacts on safety , functionality , and continued airworthiness . <p> In theory , the flight systems and passenger networks on the Boeing 747-8 and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ VP for Security for Exostar , says that " there is some crossover and the industryis trying very hard to make sure the number of crossover points are very limited " . <p> What does Takanti mean with " crossovers points " ? And why do n't just keep both network separated ? That would fix any potential security breaches , right ? Not the case , which is what the FAA is hinting in their guidelines : The mere existence of two networks in a plane -- one accessible by the passengers -- is a security hole in itself . The FAA says that Boeing should find a way to prevent " access by unauthorised sources external to the aeroplane , including those possibly caused by maintenance activity " . That 's the key . While it 's difficult , tampering with the networking systems inside the plane is a possibility at the maintenance stage . And if history has taught us something is that any security system can be broken , no matter how well engineered it is . <p> On top of that , the fact that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me a bit nervous . It is not that their regulations or tests could make things hacker-proof , but the idea of leaving this responsibility to private companies is not good , as demonstrated in recent times . <p> The only 100 per cent secure option : Fly without any kind of passenger networking . But then again , would you live without your newly acquired habit of viewing YouTube cat videos during flights ? Would you sacrifice that , like you already sacrificed your dignity at the security checkpoint ? <h> Tags <h> Discuss <p> So , even if the two networks are completely separate , and someone manages to hack the passenger network , and brings the passenger network down , it 's a security issue ?

Some people may wonder why I would come on a Bali holiday to be locked up in a cheap hotel for 24 hours , eating an overpriced excuse for mie goreng ( fried noodles ) . <p> Thankfully , there 's more to the celebration than that . <p> In the three or four days leading up to Nyepi , community groups travel to the sea or river for the Melasti ritual , a colourful purification ceremony .

The scary giant craft projects , which are often amazingly detailed , are noisily paraded down streets and through the main intersections in towns and villages . The ogoh-ogoh , depicting either full scenes from the Hindu Ramayana epic or more contemporary scary creatures , are later burned . <p> click to enlarge <p> One of the theories goes that the ogoh-ogoh parades and the burning of the effigies scares away the demons and bad spirits from the island .

But Nyepi determinedly seems to escape all this . <p> It would be all too easy for the Balinese to relent to the whinging of tourists and let them bask in the island sun for another day , taking their rupiah in exchange for sarongs , massages and Bintang beers . <p> But tradition stands firm and on Nyepi , tourism and capitalism and everything else must sit still for once , just like everyone else on the island . <p> And in a 24-hour global economy in our networked hyperlinked world , that stillness and respect for tradition is something that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worth the journey . <h> One Trackback <h> About this blog <p> Pack your suitcases for Crikey 's blog on all things travel , brought together by tour leader Amber Jamieson .

@@1419240 <h> Overview <p> A recent decision of the Federal Court of Australia in the case of ACCC v Ozdirect Online Brands Pty Ltd1 illustrates how a seller of goods over the Internet using " drop shipping " may fall foul of the consumer protection provisions of the Trade Practices Act ( TPA ) .2 In this case , the seller , Ozdirect , and its director were banned from engaging in certain online selling practices for 5 years . <h> What is drop shipping ? <p> " Drop shipping " is the practice where a customer places an order with an online seller of goods and pays for the goods , following which the seller orders the goods from a third party supplier with instructions to the supplier to ship the goods directly to the seller 's customer . <p> The practice of drop shipping is legal and there is nothing inherent in the practice itself that offends the consumer protection provisions of the TPA . <h> The facts in Ozdirect <p> Ozdirect offered a range of electronic products for sale on two websites . Prospective customers were required to create an account on the website before ordering products , then to make payment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any products ordered before the products would be dispatched . <p> Ozdirect used the drop shipping practice described above , but with an important proviso that was not known to its customers -- namely , that the suppliers from whom Ozdirect ordered the products were under no obligation to ship the products to the customers if , at the time the order was placed , Ozdirect 's credit limit with the relevant supplier had been exceeded by other orders placed previously . The situation developed where , on numerous occasions , Ozdirect exceeded its credit limit and as a result the suppliers did not ship products immediately ( or within a reasonable time ) to customers of Ozdirect who had paid for them in advance . Coupled with certain information Ozdirect was in the habit of giving to its customers ( see below ) , this resulted in customers being misled and deceived . <p> Prior to the final hearing , the ACCC3 had received in the order of 600 complaints from customers who , having paid Ozdirect for products , had not received goods either at all or within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Federal Court for interlocutory and permanent injunctions against Ozdirect and its director to prevent them from using the drop shipping technique described above in the Ozdirect business or any similar business . <h> Ozdirect 's contraventions of the TPA <p> The Court found that Ozdirect had contravened the TPA in numerous ways , including : <p> Ozdirect submitted over 900 orders to three major suppliers while it was on credit hold ; it submitted over 1700 orders to a fourth supplier while it was on credit hold , resulting in delays of up to five months in orders being filled . Ozdirect was aware of the need to keep its lines of credit current to ensure that the legitimate expectations of its customers could be met and products could be supplied within a reasonable time after payment . Ozdirect failed to do so and as a result , contravened section 58(b) of the TPA . <p> The act of taking payment for goods when Ozdirect was on credit hold , or likely to go into that position , was misleading or deceptive as it created an untrue expectation in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after payment . This contravened section 52 of the TPA . <p> Ozdirect falsely represented to certain customers that products were in stock and available for purchase when , in fact , Ozdirect had exceeded its credit limit with the relevant supplier and the products could not be supplied . This contravened section 52 of the TPA . <p> In response to certain customers ' complaints about its failure to deliver products in a timely manner , Ozdirect informed the customers that it had been experiencing an influx of orders causing a backlog in order processing , or that it was waiting for information from a supplier . This was false and misleading as the real reason for the delays was the credit hold on Ozdirect , and contravened section 52 of the TPA . <p> Ozdirect had an internal policy in relation to refunds that a customer was not to be provided with a refund for a product until they had requested the refund for a second time and until the relevant supplier had given Ozdirect a refund for the product . Contrary to this policy , Ozdirect informed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible and that money would be paid back into their accounts . This contravened section 52 of the TPA . <p> Ozdirect informed one customer , in writing , that Ozdirect 's " refund time is within 30 days , which the ACCC allows all businesses " . The ACCC had no such policy or practice . This representation contravened section 52 of the TPA . <p> Also , the Court found that the sole director , secretary and managing director of Ozdirect , the Second Respondent , must have been aware of Ozdirect 's financial position at all times and set its policies and practices . The Court inferred that the director was aware of almost all of the contravening conduct of Ozdirect and was in some way directly or indirectly party to the contraventions . <h> Conclusion <p> Ozdirect 's conduct demonstrated flagrant and extreme examples of bad online selling practice and it is not surprising that multiple contraventions of the TPA were found . It should also be noted that Ozdirect and its director did not appear , participate or give evidence in the final hearing of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practice of drop shipping is on the ACCC 's radar and serves as a reminder to online sellers of the potential pitfalls involved in drop shipping and , more generally , to ensure that promises to customers can be honoured . <p> 2 . In the Ozdirect case , the provisions considered included section 52(1) which provides a " corporation shall not , in trade or commerce , engage in conduct that is misleading or deceptive or is likely to mislead or deceive " and section 58 which provides a " corporation shall not , in trade or commerce , accept payment or other consideration for goods ... where , at the time of the acceptance ... ( b ) there are reasonable grounds , of which the corporation is aware or ought reasonably to be aware , for believing that the corporation will not be able to supply the goods ... within the period specified by the corporation or , if no period is specified , within a reasonable time " . <p> The new crowd-funding regime will bring Australia into line with New Zealand , the United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ readers ? ?

The qualifier of believability is not a high priority in sculpture -- what 's a marble head to you , or a steel cantilever ? -- but with Mueck ( also Patricia Piccinini ) it is crucial . We need to see the figures as ... people . ( Hyper-real is the term du jour , but can a figure be realer than real people ? ) The scale is the other crucial element .

We do recall mainstream journalists thinking the joke was hilarious at the time . <p> But the sad thing is , all this focus on trying to control the population is just more grist to the mill that confirms Western nations -- including Australia -- are heading head first towards totalitarian Socialism . <p> It was n't so long ago that the Chinese were lambasted and even ridiculed for their one-child policy . " It 's not natural to restrict family sizes " was the general theme of those arguing against the policy . <p> But now , Australia is following the same path . <p> We 're not sure what plans Australia 's " Population Sinister " or " Population Tsar " will have for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3-Child policy ?

And if his plans are to increase the population it will doubtless lead to a decrease . <p> But whatever happens , as is the case with all attempts at manipulation , it will have many unintended consequences elsewhere in the economy . <p> The next thing we know they 'll try to manipulate the price of money . Oh that 's right , they 've already stuffed that one up . Does n't stop them trying though . As we 'll see yet again with today 's Reserve Bank of Australia ( RBA ) interest rate decision . <p> But before we get on that , a quick note on the " good " news about the US job numbers from Friday night . <p> According to dailyfinance.com " it was the biggest U.S. employment rise since March 2007 , when the economy added 239,000 jobs . " <p> For your information , if you have n't read the news already , the US economy added 162,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a good sign does n't it ? I mean , the best job numbers in three years . Although it should be pointed out that March 2007 was just seven months before the stock market topped out in October 2007 . <p> But the other more important point worth noting about the job numbers is the composition . Again , as you may have already read , " the number of nonfarm jobs added during March was skewed upward by the 48,000 jobs added by the U.S. Census ... " <p> In other words , the only reason the jobs number is the best since March 2007 is because the US government hired 48,000 people to , erm , er , count a bunch of other people . <p> If that is n't a perfect example of manipulating the numbers then I do n't know what is . <p> We 're not quite sure how anyone can claim that the government employing people to count other people can be considered as a positive sign for any economy . Quite the opposite we 'd have thought . <p> By our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the economy has gone mad . When commentators and analysts whoop and holler about job growth when one-third of those jobs are for temporary government number counters , then you know something is seriously wrong . <p> You can see how wrong things are just by reading this article in The Age which it sourced from Bloomberg News : <p> " ... Non-manufacturing businesses that make up almost 90 per cent of the economy rose to 55.4 , higher than anticipated ... Readings above 50 signal expansion ... Sustained job gains on the heels of the biggest payroll increase in three years would lift incomes , giving households the wherewithal to keep spending , which accounts for about 70 per cent of the economy . " <p> We 've always been troubled by that number . That US consumer spending accounts for 70% of the US economy . To our way of thinking -- backed up by the economic numbers -- it means US consumers are spending way more than they earn . <p> But here 's the really scary quote from the article . It 's made by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York : <p> " The recovery is looking increasingly self-sustaining . " <p> We 'd argue that it 's anything but self-sustaining . Surely a self-sustaining economy is an economy where you produce a bunch of stuff , sell it , and then use the proceeds to buy or invest in other stuff . <p> A self-sustaining economy is n't one where you earn $100 , ask for a loan of $100 from someone , and then buy $200 worth of goods from the person you borrowed the money from . <p> That of course is exactly how the US relationship with China works right now . <p> As Peter Schiff pointed out in a video blog recently , it 's similar to the vendor finance deals that swept through the economy during the dot-com boom . In hindsight -- and even at the time -- it was seen as funny money . <p> We remember some of those stories . Maybe some were apocryphal such as the online companies that would buy $10 million worth of advertising space from each other without a single dollar changing hands , yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> That ' works ' fine until they have to pay real bills . <p> There were more gems such as , what 's the solution to the problem where your customers ca n't afford to buy from you ? You lend them money . It 's ingenious . It 's also high risk and unsustainable . <p> If your only why of selling stuff is to buy your own goods on behalf of your customers something is seriously wrong . The vendor financing terminology is a perfect illustration of how the US and China relationship has developed . And as you can imagine , the outcome is sure to end in tears . <p> But , enough of that for now , quickly back to manipulation of the price of money . <p> " But getting back closer to home we now have the perfect example of the impossible task a central bank has of trying to manipulate interest rates . It 's the old problem of it not knowing whether to put the foot on the gas or on the breaks ... or to just coast . On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( RBA ) governor Glenn Stevens appearing on TV warning about speculating on housing -- even though it 's the RBA 's artificially low interest rate that 's causing the speculation -- on another side you 've got economic indicators telling you the economy is slowing and could be harmed by further interest rate rises . And then on the final side there 's a pick-up in price inflation . Price inflation which we 're told is n't possible while there 's an ' Output Gap ' . " <p> So , what does the RBA do ? Whichever way it moves -- or does n't move -- the RBA is picking winners . If it increases interest rates then it 's giving a slap across the chops to anyone that 's in debt . <p> If it does n't increase interest rates then it 's giving a knee in the groin to savers , whilst allowing the debt bubble to expand further . <p> We 've pointed this out many times before , but it 's worth continuing to express it . It 's impossible for a central bank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which mainstream commentators and economists believe it can . <p> Take two economic numbers from last week as an example . The TD Securities-Melbourne Institute inflation gauge showed an increase of 0.5% in March ( even though the ' Output Gap ' theory says that price inflation is impossible right now ! ) , yet the **26;299;TOOLONG manufacturing index fell 3.6 points in March . <p> For a start you 've got two separate indicators giving you two different signals on the state of the economy . One tells you that inflation is a threat , the other tells you it possibly is n't . <p> At what point does the RBA do something about these numbers ? And when they decide when to do something , what does it do ? <p> We all know the RBA has a range for price inflation of 2-3% over the course of an economic cycle . But what does that mean ? Why 2-3% ? Why not 1.9% to 2.9% ? Why not 2.1% to 3.1% ? <p> Does the 2-3% really mean anything or is it just useful because they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the average over the cycle is 3.1% ? Or is it OK because it 's only 0.1% higher than the target ? <p> But if 3.1% is OK then why not make the range 2% to 3.1% ? Or will the RBA compensate for that by keeping the price inflation number below 2.9% over the next cycle so everything evens out ? <p> As you can see , it 's all just a complete nonsense . It 's smoke and mirrors that hides the real role of the RBA , and that is to devalue the money in your pocket . <p> Contrary to mainstream belief , the RBA does n't have a panel of fancy buttons at its disposal where it can perfectly and precisely direct the pace and the direction of the economy at its whim . <p> Every action the RBA takes does have some impact on the economy . But it is n't an impact which it can accurately direct or predict . If it could then the RBA would n't be in the position right now of talking up the prospects of the economy while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of the property bubble . <p> Today 's interest rate decision will excite the market , whatever the RBA decides .

@@1440240 <h> Packing the perfect suitcase <p> I am heading overseas for a holiday at the end of this week and I ca n't wait . <p> I ca n't wait to recharge the batteries , see new things and come back home inspired and enthusiastic . But first , I have to pack . <p> Most of us know we only ever wear a small percentage of what we pack . But if you ask my girlfriend , who incidentally has already started packing , that makes absolutely no difference . She has clothes in there just in case we get invited to morning tea with the Queen . And just in case it 's not morning tea , it 's supper , there 's an outfit for that too . Along the way , my bag somehow gets involved and I 'm left wondering ' how did it happen ? ' <p> My biggest packing concerns are about efficiency , lightness and ease . I know that for most occasions , a pair of jeans will get me through . Black jeans are better because they 'll generally get you in anywhere that indigo denim might not . I 'm taking a suit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ties and I can now go to a royal lunch AND supper . The shoes I 'm wearing plus another pair is plenty adequate . <p> Also on my packing list is a soft coat which I can roll up and not worry about creasing . Plus some casual pieces that wo n't feel out of place on the street or in a gallery , a flannel shirt and knit should do the job . With limited choices , accessories become increasingly important and are easier to pack than whole outfits . <p> I want my bag nearly full so I have options for any occasion but also some room for new acquisitions . <p> Those of you who bundle your fitness aspirations up with your holiday plans ask yourself this : will you really be running more than you do at home ? Now remove the running gear from your bag - that was a pipedream . <p> Lately I have been getting really excited about luggage . Sure the idea of a Louis Vuitton ( vintage trunk pictured above ) or Goyard trunk , with desk and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better sense , both practically and financially , are decent , strong , mid-sized bags suited to our modern needs . Still , a little nostalgia and class are nice things to travel with . <p> Here are some of my top picks : <p> WANT Les Essentials de la Vie : 48 and 72 hour bags . Pretty self-explanatory really , going away for a weekend or perhaps a little longer , these extraordinarily beautiful bags for men feature amazing leather , subtle and simple detailing with a retro nod and high quality hardware from the best in the world . Sharp looking bags for the inner Bobby Kennedy in us all . **31;151;TOOLONG <p> Porter and Porter x Monocle : I have been a long time fan of Porter luggage , but this venerable Japanese company is rarely seen outside of its homeland . Now Monocle magazine has collaborated on a range of travel bags that will appeal to the modern , aspirational hipster we all try to deny . Trainspotter stuff . **42;184;TOOLONG <p> Valextra : Wanting to spend more ? A lot more ? The Frers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cases that fit perfectly to the size and shape of the sports inspired outer . If you love Tetris and the most amazing leather and finishes available check out this bag . valextra.it/maineng.html <p> Globetrotter Luggage : Want to feel like John Steed ? This is the ye olde school luggage maker of London . Try a custom suitcase made from their Vulcan fibre . Or if you want to differentiate yourself from the other sartorially focused spies check out the Safari Collection in orange or red . This is super-cool English eccentricity just waiting to be filled with Savile Row and Jermyn Street bespoke. **30;228;TOOLONG <p> This is by no means a definitive list , just a selection of great bags that covers a range of styles , tastes and wallets . <p> Your luggage says a lot about who you are as a person .

It might sound like a cliche but you do n't want to be that guy at the airport scooping up loose clothes and toiletries from the floor . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are your travel essentials ?

Normally I work on 18 kilograms for a two week or so trip to the northern hemisphere , or 20 kgs if I am doing north and south . You should work on 4 good shirts , three casual , 1 jeans one trousers and be ruthless with shoes . One pair on and one in the bag .

Best advice on clothes is to only take one of each - you can always wash or rinse in the hotel . Let 's be real , if you are meeting the queen - rent a tux . I have yet to do it , but would n't it be more liberating to not take luggage , what would you wear then ? <p> In a heavy winter add an overcoat , scarf and maybe even a hat and gloves ( only under 0 degrees ) . <p> I 've been living like this for almost 2 years ; and the above advice tells you nothing of where I am or what I do ; translation this rule is flexible in outcome . <p> James This is great advice Elmer , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

But then you 're not at the behest of luggage handlers and loaded for misery when toing and froing . <p> I 'm somewhat disappointed with this entry , James . I was hoping to get some advice on how to pack , in particular how to pack suits so that they are n't damaged while travelling . Perhaps you could touch on that in the future ? <p> James Will do Frank . Just quickly , if I am only taking the one suit I will have a suit bag that I can bring on board with me . If I have more than one and I have to pack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then fold them up once or twice . Of course you want to fold as little as you can and you want to make each fold as soft as possible .

And there are some pretty good suit/jacket luggage available too if all else fails Jc <p> Zybaxos <p> April 07 , 2010 <p> 11:14 AM <p> The oldest advice on packing is still the best ... <p> Pack a case , throw half of it out , and take twice as much money . <p> Cheers <p> Franky <p> April 07 , 2010 <p> 01:01 PM <p> Who takes suits with them on holidays . Get 10 t shirts lay it on the bed get your socks and undies and chuck them in the middle - then roll up . That way when you reach for your shirt you pull out everything and do nt have to dig for that missing sock . Couple of shirts and and extra pair of trousers if you are going somewhere where you need to dress up . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There 's some good suggestions here . Moving around airports and railway stations always reminds me to keep the weight right down . For socks , underwear and shirts take just enough to get you between the likely washing opportunities . Choose fairly conservative clothes that can be worn just about anywhere without looking out of place . Shoes take up far too much room in a bag , so never take more than two pairs . In 2008 I did an eight week tour of Europe with just one pair of black Rockport shoes ; no problem . In European winters you do need a good quality jacket or coat , plus something for your head . A scarf is worth taking . If your kit proves just a little too limited you can always buy something if you allow for that cost . The idea of discarding old clothes as you go is good too , so you can bring home a few special souvenirs instead of clothes . <p> jay <p> April 07 , 2010 <p> 01:32 PM <p> We 've changed tack with luggage , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have such small space limits , it sharpens your view about what you really " need " to take . The one interesting thing is the weight of the luggage . Must airlines limit carry on to 7kg , but I 've found the carry on bag can weigh up to 3kg , which really puts the pressure on to keep the weight down . <p> LAWilson <p> April 08 , 2010 <p> 09:54 AM <p> I travel a fair bit and always take a good three piece suit , as you never know where you 'll be invited too , some tan brogues , as they go with anything and a decent leather jacket . For a short trip I take a holdall , my current favourite is the Token range from NYC and for a long haul you really ca n't beat a case from Goyard , which have to be the best in the world . <p> James They are beautiful I 'll give you that and I also believe that taking a suit is a pretty important thing .

The plan is pretty simple , two pairs of jeans ( one indigo , one black ) , a pair of trousers , three t-shirts and maybe a polo and a couple of proper shirts . <p> Shoe-wise will be a pair of Skechers for generally bumming around and some simple polished black shoes if I need something a little dressier . <p> The extra luggage space I 'd have for clothes will be happily taken up by my better half and our four year old . <p> singal66 <p> May 10 , 2010 <p> 09:24 PM <p> a general rule .. 4 of every thing plus what you are wearing after that time to wash or come home .. rule applies for a 3 day or two week holiday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PM <p> and how you pack changes as your travel goals change as well .

Further details here . <p> -- -- <p> A recent article in the Sydney Morning Herald concerning pensioners who install solar power systems having any earnings through feed in tariffs* or credit counted as income affecting pension payments has met with some strong reactions . <p> According to Max Sylvester , co-founder of national solar power solutions provider Energy Matters , " We looked into this situation a while back and were advised that payments from feed in tariffs would be counted as income for social security purposes -- but that does n't mean to say pensioners would have their benefits cut or even reduced . " <p> " For a person 's pension to be affected their total assessable income would have to exceed the relevant income test free areas .

" says Mr. Sylvester . <p> " Whether it is generally assessable income depends on the income producing nature of the activity . If it can be demonstrated that the system was installed with a view to making a profit , then receipts under the feed in tariff would be considered assessable income , but all expenses associated with the income generating activity would also be deductible , such as depreciation .

" <p> Mr. Sylvester advises that people who may be affected should consult with their local Centrelink Office , the ATO or accountant for clarification . <p> * Feed in tariffs are an incentive whereby owners of solar power systems are paid a premium rate for electricity produced . Under a gross feed in tariff model such as that exists in the ACT and NSW , all electricity generated is eligible for a premium payment . In other states with feed in tariffs , a net model is used where the premium rate paid is only applied to surplus electricity exported to the mains grid .

@@1464240 <h> Toyota Camry Hybrid Safety Rating ANCAP <p> Australian New Car Assessment Program ( ANCAP ) is set to release crash test results of the Toyota Camry Hybrid today with the safety rating expected to be only four out of five stars . <p> ANCAP chairman Lauchlan McIntosh told Fairfax media in mid-April that he was hoping Toyota would 've made structural changes to improve the Camry Hybrid 's safety given its significance to the industry . <p> Hitting back today , Toyota released a statement outlining its disappointment with ANCAP 's testing methodology . Here is the statement in full : <p> Toyota Australia acknowledges ANCAP as one measure that can help consumers identify cars that are safe . <p> However , ANCAP does not test the life-saving benefits of features such as vehicle stability control , traction control and anti-skid brakes -- all of which are standard on every Camry . <p> Toyota Australia rejects as a distortion any suggestion that Camry models provide a level of safety that is the same as cars that do not offer such vital life-saving technology or have fewer than Camry 's standard six airbags . <p> Toyota conducts an extensive range of tests on all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or exceeds safety standards in every country in which they are sold . <p> The Camry range of vehicles offers a comprehensive package of active and passive safety . Customers can drive these cars with confidence , knowing they have advanced safety features that have been shown to save lives . <p> Toyota supports the development of long-term policies that enhance vehicle safety through a wide range of measures including the overall integration of vehicles , road infrastructure and driver ability . <p> The Toyota Hybrid Camry also includes a reversing camera as standard equipment . <p> The ANCAP result does n't seem to do the Toyota Camry Hybrid any justice , rating it the same as the Chinese built Great Wall Motor X240 Sports Utility Vehicle . <p> ANCAP 's decision to criticise and rate the Hybrid Camry the same as the Chinese built X240 ( which lacks many of the basic safety features found in the locally built car ) seems somewhat out of character for the organisation . <h> SOCIAL SHARE <p> ANCAP is in my opinion a bit of a joke . They test only one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the crash . I think we give too much credit to them . In this case I agree with Toyota . Great Wall must be rubbing their hands with glee at this result . Its the best they have had anywhere in the world and is probably better than their own in house results ... <p> Minnow <p> I think ANCAP and EuroNCAP are an excellent guide . So what if they chose one single example , that stops manufactures putting forward their best model . ANCAP will actually randomly chose a car from any dealership so its a good representative sample . Think of this way . All those safety backups are not important when 2 cars have a head on collision or when the car actually hits a tree . In my opinion those preventative features should be rated separately as everyone knows they perform differently between every car . One measure for crash prevention , and this rating for when you do crash . Almost all cars in the Hybrid Camrys segment and price range have exactly the same safety features so that rules out that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cars get scored under the same criteria . If ANCAP had found the car was 5 star Toyota would be Praising ANCAP , but because they did nt , what can Toyota do ? Say the test is rubbish . <p> Mad Max <p> EuroNcap is run differently , but I can see your point . But I still think Ancap is a of a waste of time . I would have far more respect if than ran multiple tests but I can understand the cost issue . This is the problem the manufacturers have with it as well . <p> tekkyy <p> EuroNCAP has moved forward ANCAP is no longer comparable <p> cost issue ... nothing in the scale of things I think manufacturers can easily afford to add a rear-end crash test making it 4 tests <p> I would love to see the rear-end results of hatchs <p> http : //ancap.com.au ancap <p> ANCAP and EURONCAP use the same suite of tests . ANCAP even re-publishes some EURONCAP results . It is nonsense to suggest that one is better or different than the other . As for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Monash University Accident Research Centre that shows a strong correlation between the performance of ANCAP rated vehicles and the same vehicles in real world crashes . To achieve a 5 star ANCAP rating ANCAP undertakes 3 tests ( using 3 new vehicles ) . The 64 km/h frontal offset test , the 50 km/h side impact test , the 29 km/h side pole test ( there are also 40 km/h pedestrian tests with a separate star rating ) . A vehicle must perform extremely well in all tests in order to achieve a 4 or 5 star result . These are very demanding tests . Please go to http : //www.ancap.com.au to read more about the testing process <p> Valet Dabess <p> i saw crash test fotage of a swift and i thought it did an ok job yet it 's rated at 4 <p> Cupid Stunt <p> Toyota winging . If it only gets 4 stars that your count despite other additions that may make it safer . Level plying fields methinks . <p> Reckless1 <p> I 'd rather buy the GW240 -- it 's a 4 star @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ....... <p> Reckless1 <p> having said that , though , I 'm about as likely to buy either as I am to live to 150 .... <p> I would rather be in this car on a head on crash then a Yaris , Mazda2 , Jazz , and all the other 4 star rated small cars in the market ... If you just watch the Youtube US head on crash tests you will see what i mean ! the small cars are death traps in a head on and the large cars come out way ahead , the fact is that the bigger the car the better off you are in a head on crash with another car . <p> tekkyy <p> true , but only for cars of similar age ( strength ) <p> youtube has a video of a modern small Peugeot hatch against an old large Volvo wagon <p> or , think of a bigger fat guy colliding with a smaller trainer <p> also , if the shape of the bonnet of your large sedan just begs to be mounted ( not mentioning any models ) than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Sumodog <p> This rating is a joke . Hybrid Camry has potentially life-saving curtain airbags as standard for its rear passengers , while the five-star Ford Falcon does n't have them on most of its models and the five-star Ford Fiesta does n't have them on any of its models . The Great Wall X240 has just two airbags and lacks stability control , which can prevent a skid . Judge for yourself . <p> Reality <p> " ANCAP 's decision to criticise and rate the Hybrid Camry the same as the Chinese built X240 ( which lacks many of the basic safety features found in the locally built car ) seems somewhat out of character for the organisation . " <p> Maybe ANCAP thinks that going after Toyota will give ANCAP more publicity and raise their position in the public 's eyes . Never mind the inconsistency in their approach . <p> Valboy <p> " Toyota conducts ... extensive tests ... on all its vehicles ... meets or exceeds safety standards in every country ... sold . ... offers a comprehensive package of active and passive safety . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can they come out with these statements ? ? What about the latest model Toyota-Lexus 460 stability control , so unsorted as to have it slapped with a " do n't buy " from US safety authorities ? Doubts exist over Toyota Prado for the same reason AND all Toyotas safety in general . Toyota drivers have died due to Toyota 's dubious engineering . Nobody 's forgotten their recent and disastrous **29;316;TOOLONG , for a variety of reasons in US and around the world . Massive doubts remain over Toyota 's reputation and business model . <p> Joober@Work <p> Yeah i 'm a bit appalled by that comment , given the recent worldwide recall problems . If they have blinded confidence to say as it is like that , it shows they have no humility/no sorry whatsoever . <p> SSV <p> How the hell could one of those Chinese death traps get a 4 star rating ? Anyone who puts themselves or their family in one of those Chinese cars is an idiot . Why do you think they are so cheap ? Its a disgrace on our Government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> So you 've never been in an early Toyota , obviously . FJ Holdens were better than early Toyotas by a long way . <p> 4 star is 4 star , whether it 's slapped together by the Toyota Marketing Company , or the GW newcomer . <p> The GW also looks far better than any of Toyota 's current models . Ugly is in at the big T , and so is dangerous . <p> Susan Notaro <p> My concern is on rear impact due to the battery pack .... how safe is it . Does anyone have any info on this issue ? I heard from someone today that it is extremely serious ( if you are rear ended ) to the passengers in the rear .

@@1496230 <h> Better outcome for mental health care ? Get your hand off it . <p> When the recent Budget threatened to cut social workers and occupational therapists provision of services to clients under the Better Outcomes in Mental Health Care ( BOiMHC ) from July 1 , there was a huge outcry from health professionals and clients . The cuts occurred without any consultation , discussion , or input from the social work body , the Australian Association of Social Workers ( AASW ) . <p> Thanks to a passionate and concerted campaign , the government has since deferred its decision until April 1 next year and committed to give the AASW an equal role with other health professions in the shaping of federal policy on mental health . However , the government has not changed its view that social workers and occupational therapists will no longer work under the BOiMHC program . <p> With the recent focus on social workers and the Medicare rebate , it is timely to promote greater awareness , and understanding of , what social workers ( and specifically social workers in private practice -- mental health social workers ) , provide in terms of psychological and emotional assistance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government in 2006 . Under this program , any individual GP could refer a client , diagnosed with a mental disorder under Medicare , to a psychologist , social worker , or occupational therapist , for 12 sessions of mental health treatment . It was widely recognised that current mental health services were unable to meet the demand , were crisis driven in nature , and therefore unable to provide early intervention . <p> BOiMHC was designed as an early intervention measure , where people were encouraged to seek help for mental health issues in the early to mid stages of illness . The aim was to reduce the high ongoing and cyclical cost and burden on resources ( such as hospitals and GP 's ) while increasing the effectiveness of treatment . <p> It is still unclear why the decision was made to discontinue the Medicare rebate for social workers . <p> There have been several criticisms of BOiMHC . There was a huge blowout of costs : this occurred within the first four months of the scheme 's introduction . It was thought that BOiMHC was not reaching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in remote communities ) , and the Medicare co-payment excluded the poor . <p> Social workers account for 4% of the costs of BOiMHC . Excluding social workers from the scheme is not an effective means of reducing costs . Ironically , a major client group of mental health social workers are disadvantaged , poor , and remote clients . Therefore there was no logical reason for the cessation of the BOiMHC for mental health social workers . <p> Mental Health social workers are highly specialised therapists . Each social worker has their own way of working , dependent upon their area of specialisation , postgraduate training , personal style and work experience . Social workers may conduct individual , group or family therapy to people experiencing a range of psychological problems , to resolve associated psychosocial issues and improve quality of life . <p> However , mental health social work is underpinned by social work values of social justice , respect , importance of human relationships , integrity and competency are the key focus of mental health social workers as distinct to other professionals providing therapeutic services . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have at least two years of experience working with clients with mental health issues . They are all accountable through the profession 's complaints management process , and all complete mandatory professional development each year . <p> The majority of mental health social workers have undertaken extensive specialised postgraduate training , including counselling , psychotherapy and family therapy ; while nearly 75% have more than 10 years ' experience in public mental health services . <p> There are presently more than 1100 social workers offering Medicare rebate for mental health treatments , and in 2008-2009 they provided 121,540 occasions of service <p> More than one-third are based in regional , rural and remote parts of Australia <p> Many work in outer suburban areas <p> More than 60% of them offer bulk-billing to at least some clients <p> More than two-thirds ( 68% ) of clients say they would be unable to access their services without Medicare funding . <p> The AASW and the government have stated they are working together to " shape and develop the new funding arrangements delivered through the GP networks , to ensure that social workers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with mental health issues , especially those from disadvantaged and low income backgrounds , indigenous people , those with multiple needs and those in rural and regional areas " . <p> To what extent this collaboration will address social work concerns about mental health service delivery is still to be determined . <p> You are confusing two entirely different programmes . The current Medicare arrangement is the Better Access to Mental Health Care ( est 2006 ) . <p> Referral to Better Outcomes in Mental Health Care ( est 2002 ) and its current offshoot Access to Allied Psychological Services ( ATAPS ) is restricted to GPs who had done the appropriate mental health training , and was to registered and accredited psychologists only . <p> In some areas this was also extended to social workers and OTs . <p> Patients did not have to pay anything . This programme ( which still continues in a limited way ) is a far better process than the Better Access programme , because it did reach the patients who could n't afford a co-payment , and GPs tended only to refer patients @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the Australian Psychological Society , Abbot and Pyne delivered the current dog 's breakfast , with its divisive two-tier payments for psychology and its total lack of targeting . <p> It would have been far better to extend the funding and the reach of BOiMHC , perhaps with some incentives for GPs to undertake the ( quite moderate ) training . <p> As Little Eric says , we are talking here about Better Access ( 2006 ) , rather than Better Outcomes ( 2001 ) . <p> The federal government has decided to exclude the clients of social workers and occupational therapists from claiming Medicare rebates under Better Access . This effects aroung 25,000 clients currently being seen by by social workers . <p> Why the federal government would do this escapes me . <p> It wo n't save them much money , given that rebates to clients of social workers amount to some seven million per annum , while rebates to other professions are approaching three hundred and fifty million per annum ( plus another two hundred million for clients of psychiatrists ) . <p> It wo n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Bottom line : it removes the choice of people who want to see a social worker for mental health problems , and removes the choice for GP 's who think a social worker is the best person to help their patient . <p> According to the ATAPS Review - Discussion Paper , the better outcomes program was established in July 2001 . There is currently no restriction under ATAPS to referr to psychologists ( clinical or not ) . " ATAPS enables GPs to refer consumers with high prevelence mental health disorders to allied health professionals for 6 sessions of evidence based mental health care " - this includes psychologists , social workers and OT 's . " BOIMHC originally held components to support education and training for GP 's and GP renumeration . These components are superseded by the Better Access MBS items and education/training . " Under ATAPS , " approximately 10% of sessions delivered involved a patient incurred co-payment ranging from $5 - $30 .

Was this a referral to a lawyer ? <p> ATAPS is the better system . Chuck out the expensive baby and make room for the effective one to grow and deliver service to the people who really need it - not the affluent worried well . <p> If you think Better Access is just for for the " affluent worried well " , talk to a social worker in the outer suburbs of Sydney or Melbourne , or to one in a rural area . <p> Better Access is designed as a preventative mental health program . Surely you are not against that ? <p> The initial review of Better Access @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is clearly providing help to people who could not otherwise afford the service . <p> Sure , some people will use Better Access in the more affluent suburbs even though they could pay a full rate . The solution to this , I would suggest , is not to kick social workers out of Better Access ( their rebates are lower and they save Medicare money ! ) . <p> There are far more effective strategies to target Better Access , I would suggest , such as to limit the number of sessions claimable ( it was supposed , in the Departmnent 's terms to be a " short and sharp " intervention , or restrict to people who are in genuine need . <p> I do n't agree that the people who need services are just those with low incidence but severe mental health issues .

I know the hundreds of clients I have seen over the years would certainly not agree with you , as this would mean they would be without treatment for their mental health disorders , and had no choice as to what mental health clinician provided them with appropriate treatment , not to mention the fact that they will not qualify under ATAPS as " low income earners " . I work in both programs - ATAPS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stumbled into a hornet 's nest of which , Little Eric 's argument , implicitly favouring psychologists in the programs he mentions , is but one expression . <p> It is a pity , too , that Little Eric does not state his interests in this matter .

He certainly seems to favour psychologists ... ? <p> He is also arguing for an ' either ' or situation whereas clearly the take up rate of the two programs suggests that there is a need in the community . <p> And , reading the comments of social work colleagues in this forum , it is clear that we are arguing for parity . The advent of Medicare rebates for social workers has both altered the nature of the AASW , as well as introduced new players into the medicare field . dare I suggest that social workers themselves have only just begun to recognise the full meaning of their inclusion in the medicare system . It is too late to try to turn the clock back as Roxon appears to be doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turf war over who is or should be qualified to provide mental health services under Medicare . Under Medicare mental health services provision is a domain not exclusive to medical practitioners . At present Medicare manages the system through rebates determined by ' base qualification ' - the higher rebates for psychiatrists and then down the line through Clinical Psychologists , Psychologists then Social Workers and Occupational Therapists . <p> Therein , I think , lies the problem . It does not follow that because one has completed a degree of qualification in one discipline or another that one is clinically competent . Nor does it follow that that one discipline group is superior to another . <p> Clinical competence will be decided by the Australian Psychological Society . The government outsourced this to them a long time ago . <p> I do n't want either - or . I want the best aspects of both to be combined in one scheme that recognises the skill and experience of the practitioner , but ensures that the people who have first access to help are those that most need it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even less when the APS controls the new National Registration Scheme , which divides psychology into even more bizarre and irrelevant categories . <p> I have n't declared an interest because that 's irrelevant , and I 'm not going to give you buggers the chance to play ad hominem . <p> I do n't " favour " psychologists ; I think that the cobbler should stick to his last , and social workers to social work . <p> Hmmmmm Little Eric thinks that social workers should ' stick to social work ... ' I guess that there is much to be said for that view ... although I suspect Little Eric and I differ as to its meaning . Social Work has long been a presence , if not involved in the establishment of fields of clinical practice that psychologists are claiming as their own . <p> I will provide some examples from my career . <p> The now Relationships Australia was begun essentially as the Marriage Guidance Council of Victoria ( and other states , I suspect ) by social workers following the model established in Britian by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bureau which became the Tavistock Institute of Marital Studies and Human Rights . Lily Pincus who wrote on death , bereavement and mourning and family relationships was one of them . In Victoria , Social Workers at the Citizens Welfare Service ( an organisation begun in 1889 ) played a huge role in the establishment of the Victorian Association of Psychoanalytic Psychotherapists . Of course Social Work colleagues in other organisations and private practice were involved in the establishment of the Family Therapy Field both as practitioners and writers ... Marital/ relationship therapy which enables couples to explore and develop their relationships remains a significant area of practice within social work . And indeed , the first Clinical Master of Social Work program developed in Australia by the University of Melbourne , was conduced in partnership with Drummond Street Relationship Centre ( ex Citizens Welfare Service ) , an organisation approved to to provide relationship counselling under the Family Law Act 1975 . ( I developed and co-ordinated that program ) <p> I originally came online as a professional in the early 1980s , at a time when developments in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were senior clinicians in social work who were making significant contributions to the field of medical social work/health social work . Many were also training to become psychotherapists or family therapists . IVF was new , and AID still meant Artificial Insemination by donor . Social workers had initiated the first three adoption conferences which led to the review of legislation and practice and the change of the law in each of the states . Social workers used their clinical practice - as counsellors and therapists with the parties to adoption to articulate the problematic aspects of adoption as the basis for this initiative . Social workers were also instrumental in beginning and developing the field of ' infertiliy counselling ' - now another widely accepted field of clinical practice ... <p> Then in the health field there is the arena of Infant Mental health - an important area of work for new families who are having difficulties establishing themselbes . You may have seen the recent two part series on the ABC - ' Help me Love My Baby ' . You will have seen some of the work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ involved , as well as the social and emotional circumstances .... some of the best clinical social work I have seen . This work is also being undertaken at the Royal Children 's Hospital in Melbourne by a team in which social workers have played a long and significant role in developing -alongside professionals from other discipline groups . <p> There are more- trauma , sexual assault , child psychotherapy , - incredibly complex areas in which social workers are making their mark . <p> It is entirely unsurprising that social workers have moved onto into private practice and equally unsurprising that the advent of the Medicare rebate signalled recognition of the professional contribution made by social workers . Furthermore it has enabled clients to access high quality services with clinicians of thier choice rather than tryingtheir luck with waiting lists and the vagaries of organisations . 
@@1496231 <h> A how-to guide for haggling in China <p> For a nation accustomed to receiving blank looks when bargaining , and whose only haggling technique consists of asking " What 's your best on that ? " , buying toothpaste in China can be a shock to the Australian system . <p> Before I landed in Beijing , I had been warned , but no mere warning could have prepared me for the blood sport that is haggling in China . My first bargaining experience , in an antique market , had me massively overestimating the value of a small clock . Having completed my purchase with the seller -- who had a remarkable poker face -- twenty or thirty other sellers descended on me , shoving similar items in my face . I was forced to cut short my browsing , and ended up running out of the place with my hands over my head . <p> If you have n't experienced it , here 's a guide to how the transaction should go : <p> You , the shopper , look over the items with a callous eye , trying not to pause or look at any one item with more interest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the item , once your eye slides onwards , to be picked up and thrust into your field of vision . ) Once you have decided ( covertly ) which item or items you are interested in , you may pick them up . The game is now on . <p> Ask the price . It 's safer to let the vendor go first , since if you accidentally overestimate the item 's worth , game over . The price offered by the vendor will be grossly overinflated to a couple of orders of magnitude : if they say a thousand , you 're looking at around fifty . It 's about five yuan to the dollar ; a good rule of thumb is to imagine the price of your item if it were gathering a layer of dust in a Hot Potatoe 's Everything 's Not Quite $2 shop , and then quarter that . <p> If your vendor speaks English , you will be subjected to stories of how you 're taking food out of their children 's mouths , and killing their sick grandmothers , and why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to try to rip them off , and it costs more than that to make it . Note : for an English-speaking vendor , you may be up another order of magnitude on overinflated price . English speakers do n't work for peanuts , and any market where English is commonly spoken is a tourist trap . I found a pair of $3 sunglasses -- the same model as in a small shop near my hostel -- being shilled for $120 as ' designer ' in an English-speaking market . <p> If no English is spoken , the gestures will get correspondingly more dramatic . Waved arms , pantomimed woe , upturned palms of impossibility , enthusiastic scribblings-out of written figures . <p> Remember , your job here is to remain stoic until you 're sure at least one person will be materially injured by your outrageous demands on price . You may want to consider gently drifting towards the next stall ; this should bring material reductions in price , and can be repeated two or three times with the appropriate umming and ahhing . <p> Pointing out the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quality ; just saying you 're not really sure you like it is harder to counter . Having a critic with you -- clearly bored , impatient or unimpressed by the goods on offer -- can also help . <p> There are fixed price shops in China , if you ( like me ) prefer a short , uncomplicated transaction , but these may also be over-inflated and open to negotiation . A bit of delicate moaning about how you like something , but ca n't possibly afford it , should reveal what kind of shop you 're in . You can also refuse to bargain entirely ; naming a price and sticking to it will also leave you feeling like you 're starving someone 's child , but at least it takes out the uncertainty . <p> In Australia , one of my favourite techniques is to ask about the price of decoy items , and then reject them with contempt at the obviously outrageous prices . Once my chosen item comes up , prices have drifted pleasantly downward . Do not attempt this in China . I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was forced to buy . <p> I remember one time I was wandering around a market with an American I had met in Shanghai .

Of course he never had any intention of buying the painting in the first place , he just wanted to see how low he could go . I was never able to get the hang of it and rarely bought anything . <p> The best tactic to get rid of the enthusiastic sellers shoving stuff into your face is to try and sell them something for a higher price -- they 'll soon lose interest in this insane foreigner who has gotten things completely around the wrong way . <p> I once sold Postcards of Egypt to the Egyptian merchants who paddled over &amp; swamped our Nile cruise boat everytime we slowed down .

@@1522230 <h> Can You Use an iPad While Driving ? <p> It 's been said before , but the law 's an ass . Take Rule 300 from the Australian Road Rules , which you can download as a PDF . It 's the one about using mobile telephones in cars . The kindest thing you can say about it is that it 's crafted with the best of outdated intentions . <p> Basically , rule 300 says the driver 's not allowed to use a mobile phone while the car 's moving , or while stationary but not parked ( such as when you 're stopped at a red light ) . <p> There 's a page-and-a-half of caveats that go with this rule . One such caveat is that you 're allowed to use your mobile -- for voice calls only -- if it 's fitted to a commercial cradle or handsfree kit that holds the body of the phone . It has to be commercial -- you ca n't just gaffer-tape it to the steering wheel . But you 're not allowed to make or receive a video call , send or receive a text message or email ( you can receive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't look at it and as long as it does n't display automatically ) at any time . <p> According to the rules , ' use ' of the phone includes touching it or holding it -- regardless of whether it 's actually being used to communicate . ( You are allowed to pass it to a passenger . ) Use includes entering or placing anything into the phone , or sending or looking at anything in the phone , or turning it on or off , or using " any other function " in the phone . <p> Hold that last thought -- any other function . Let 's say your iPhone is also your portable music player . Newsflash : playing music , perhaps by streaming it to a Bluetooth receiver in the car ( or just plugging it in via USB or 1/8-inch audio jack ) and them pumping out those fat beats through the car 's audio system almost certainly comprises the use of " any other function " of the phone . <p> However , using an iPod to do exactly the same thing is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have to be diligently in control and aware of what 's going on around you as you drive . In other words , the use of portable music players is n't specifically prohibited under the rules . <p> If that sounds crazy , it 's also illegal to open up a web page on your smartphone , invoke ( say ) Google Maps and then interrogate the web to get the navigation instructions that will take you from your designated A to your designated B du jour . However , if you were to perform this identical operation on your laptop or iPad via the 3G network , there 's no specific provision in the rules barring such insane on-the-move behaviour . <p> It goes without saying that using a laptop while driving is madness ; off the Richter in terms of negligence . However , please take the time to perform a Google search of the words ' steering wheel laptop holder ' and prepare to be truly , appallingly amazed . <p> Another insane activity not specifically proscribed under the rules is programming your Tom Tom or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you take your eyes off the road for four seconds on the freeway , you cover the length of a football field , essentially blind to what 's happening outside the virtual domain . <p> Talking on a hand-held speaker-phone built into your mobile is also illegal . So is holding the phone in one hand and talking via a Bluetooth headset ( it 's the holding that 's illegal ; not the Bluetooth ) , or picking up the phone while wearing an earpiece to navigate to the desired number stored in your phone 's contacts list . Even punching in a number you know off by heart is illegal . Even if you 're stopped at the traffic lights . It 's also illegal to hold the handset and talk with a plug-in earpiece connected by wire to the body of the phone . <p> ( For the record , I reckon it 's a great idea to have both hands on the wheel at every available opportunity .

You could probably even defend this behaviour in court if charged ( I guess ; I 'm no lawyer ) even though in the court of common sense you 'd be guilty of extreme stupidity . E-mails and web browsing ? Certainly not prohibited . <p> Existing mobile telephone law is riddled with extreme contradiction .

( That 's not advice . ) It includes an 18-page dictionary of key terms , which at first glance seems quite comprehensive . ' Portable warning triangle ' , for example , is defined . So are ' high beam ' and ' police officer ' and even ' green traffic light ' . As if these things were open to misinterpretation .

@@1522232 <h> Price <p> There are very few hexa-core processors in the wild . Intel has one , in the form of its expensive enthusiast ' Gulftown ' Core i7-980X Extreme Edition . AMD uses two hexa-core dies in its latest generation of Opteron server processors , and has become the first manufacturer to produce mainstream hexa-core CPUs in the form of the Phenom II X6 processors . <p> These Phenom II X6 CPUs are the latest iteration of AMD 's now venerable K10 architecture that first appeared on the desktop with the launch of Phenom in late 2007 . The Phenom II X6 CPUs are based upon the design codenamed ' Thuban ' ; they resemble the recently released ' Instanbul ' Opteron processor , which slaps two hexa-core dies onto a single package . <p> Built using 45nm technology , these cores each have 128KB of L1 and 512KB of L2 cache . They all share access to 6MB of L3 cache . <p> The Phenom II X6 is designed to work with DDR3 1600 and supports faster speeds for some combinations of memory , thanks to AMD 's Black memory profiles . AMD has so far released two mainstream Phenom X6 processors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and plans to launch more in the coming months . <p> As with the Dragon before it , AMD provides further scope and tools for overclocking if the CPU is used as part of a Platform that combines them with new AMD 890 chipsets and the ATI Radeon HD 5000 series graphics cards . <p> The top of the range Phenom II X6 1090T has six cores running at 3.2GHz - the T at the end of the name stands for Turbo-Core , an update of AMD Overdrive . Turbo-Core attempts to make the most of the processor for single-threaded applications and occasions where all six cores would be overkill . <p> AMD uses software to turn off three cores , and overclock the remaining three : in the case of the 1090T to 3.6GHz . This is similar to Intel 's Turbo-boost technology but not as elegant . Whereas Intel can adjust how much how much the cores are overclocked in increments , AMD simply turns up three cores to a single higher speed when it detects that fewer than three are being used . <p> Turbo core @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Because the majority of work performed by the processor in your average desktop is single threaded , the CPU will likely spend most of its time as an effective tri-core processor running at 3.6GHz . This is n't necessarily a bad thing ; the processor offers the flexibility of adapting to its load in a crude but effective way . <p> AMD 's literature about the Phenom II X6 suggests it is designed for ' extreme megatasking ' situations . Maybe a little hyperbolic , but it does indicate where the Phenom shines , which is when all six cores are working away . <p> It was noticeable in our testing that single threaded and light multitasking tests show performance improvements in line with those expected from a faster version of the K10 core . In our real world benchmarks the Phenom II X6 1090T scored 1.74 overall , which is in line with similarly clocked Phenom II processors tested in the past . <p> However when we used Maxxon 's Cinebench to load up all six cores with rendering tasks there was a huge improvement over quad core @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1.07 points in the single core rendering test and 5.65 points in the multicore one . <p> That six cores perform more than five times better than one core is impressive , especially when you consider that the single core was running at 3.6GHz , thanks to Turbo-Core , while the multi-core tests had six cores each running at 3.2GHz . <p> While you can pair the X6 with 890FX , 890GX and 870 chipsets , the 890FX is the one AMD suggests for partnering the Phenom II X6 . It offers some nice additional features , such as native support for SATA 6Gbps , support for two 16x PCI Express lanes ( or four lanes running at 8x ) to allow for multiple graphics cards , and improved PCI-Express connectivity for other onboard devices . <p> But , chipset decisions aside , the major advantage for the Phenom II X6 is that it offers six cores for the price of four Intel cores . Intel 's processors still beat AMD 's in single-core performance , but if your workload involves rendering or other tasks that can take advantage of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Phenom II X6 stands out . <p> We 'll have to wait until AMD lifts the lid on its Fusion platform next year to see the next generation of the AMD vs Intel war . What AMD has done with the Phenom II X6 , however , is play to the architecture 's strengths . <p> It is a capable CPU , has more cores than its competitors and is relatively cheap . When paired with the 890FX chipset it brings technologies like SATA 6GB/s that do not yet appear on Intel 's chipsets , and the motherboards available for the platform are similarly cheap . <p> This Review appeared in the July , 2010 issue of PC &amp; Tech Authority Magazine <p> Join our site to get stuck in with comments and discussions with other passionate readers and tech fans , and stay up to date with the latest news and reviews through our range of newsletters . <p> Email* <p> * Email address required <p> * Invalid Email address <p> I have read and accept the privacy policy and terms and conditions and by submitting my email address @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ newsletter and receive special offers on behalf of PC &amp; Tech Authority , nextmedia and its valued partners .

@@1563230 <p> It was the part of Muslim detective Zane Malik in SBS 's East West 101 that thrust Don Hany into the limelight . He scored two AFI nominations and gained plaudits for playing a strong , multifaceted Muslim character . But Hany ( pronounced " Hunny " ) is not Muslim . He is not even religious , describing himself as " halfway between atheist and agnostic " . For the role of Malik he grew a beard because , despite his Iraqi-Hungarian heritage , he was n't " Arab-looking enough " . <p> Adopting the traits of different ethnicities is part and parcel of Hany 's work in Australia . He 's been cast as a Bulgarian drug dealer ( Underbelly ) , a Russian mafioso ( False Witness ) and now , by producer John Edwards ( Love My Way ) , as a Czech playwright in Ten 's drama Offspring and a Greek political adviser in the second season of Foxtel 's Tangle . <p> I 've not really seen a lot of stuff that really deals with a middle class , well-to-do , suburban group of people and does n't depict them as squeaky clean or heroic or glorifies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on television , I look like a white guy , a ' normal ' Aussie , " Hany says during a break from filming a steamy Tangle scene . " In LA , the Americans never even thought of me as an Aussie , once I lost the accent . They do n't have those sorts of filters that we have on our casting here . " <p> What a tangled web ... Don Hany plays Spiros . <p> Hany auditioned for the role of philandering husband Vince in season one of Tangle , which explored the web of deceit , lust and intrigue revolving around a loosely knit group of family and friends in affluent Melbourne suburbia . <p> Advertisement <p> The role of Vince eventually went to Ben Mendelsohn but Edwards and co-producer Imogen Banks were so impressed with Hany 's " breathtaking " audition that they looked for a way to get him on the show . <p> Edwards lured him back to Australia with the promise that Tangle and Offspring would keep him in work for a year . <p> Don Hany and Susie Porter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tough decision , " Hany says . " In the end , I thought , ' I can stay in LA and work on stuff that my heart may at times not be in or I can come back and work on something that is where I stand personally ' . I think everything that I 'm doing this year speaks to an audience that 's more important to me . " <p> As Tangle resumes , season one 's cliffhanger is quickly resolved but this only brings a new set of complications to the tangled lives of the show 's protaganists . Smooth-talking Spiros enters the scene as an adviser to ambitious politician Tim Williams ( Joel Tobeck ) , complicating Tim 's already strained relationship with wife , Christine ( Catherine McClements ) . <p> " This is a show about dysfunctional families , " Hany says . " But it 's smart enough to avoid that being a gimmick of the show . Everybody 's life is completely three-dimensional and fun and interesting -- not because of the drama in their life , not because of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writing and the performances , they 're so identifiable . " <p> Hany is fiercely critical of mainstream television drama in Australia , much of which he says " medicates us to forget about the reality of life " . He believes Tangle stands apart because it does n't play to stereotypes . <p> " I 've not really seen a lot of stuff that really deals with a middle class , well-to-do , suburban group of people and does n't depict them as squeaky clean or heroic or glorifies them , " Hany says . " Tangle 's completely believable because there 's nothing remarkable about these people . The politicians is actually not a great politician . The builder , Vince , is n't a great builder and he 's a womaniser . They 're people you see every day . <p> " But what they do is riveting to watch because they 're honest to an Australian way of life that we do n't necessarily feel like watching all the time but it 's the truth . And that 's beautiful and sad at the same time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a constant challenge of the filmmaking process , Edwards says . He cites an argument with one of several guest directors over what could have been a too-neat ending to an episode .

It 'll be the acidic scene , the surprising scene . . . Tangle is prepared to go into less-sentimental areas of family life . It 's about that web that grows out of relationships and what happens when your teenagers are about to become adults . . . do the sins of the parents go on to the next generation and the one after ? The answer is yes , " Edwards says . <p> " The show started from the idea of , ' Let 's do modern divorce ' .

" They just chuck a name out there . It 's not particularly conscious . Spiros needs to be Mediterranean-looking because Don 's Mediterranean-looking but that 's about it .

She lacks the very distinctive , and often distinctly irritating , call of the male of this species . <p> What she does share with the male is the propensity for being mobbed by other small birds -- particularly small aggressive birds that are common around my place like Magpie LarksGrallina cyanoleuca , Yellow-throated MinersManorina flavigula and Butcher Birds Cracticus nigrogularis . <p> Anyway she sat still enough -- though she was very watchful for the five or so minutes that I observed her -- for me to bang off a few shots ate close range before she flew off . <p> On Saturday I was up at just after 5am to travel the 50 or so kilometres out of town to join a bunch of other members of the Alice Springs Field Naturalists in a trip to Kunoth Well , a renowned birding site that is one of the few close to Alice Springs where you can regularly see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

So I reckon that many of the birds around may be doing it tough . This will of course begin to change once the weather warms up and the insect population increases and the plants start flowering .

Jason di Rosso thinks " the film 's beauty is compelling . But it 's also distracting . At times it seems director Guadagnino is so enamoured with the world he depicts , he loses sight of his critique .

Eduardo Sr. , the family patriarch , has decided to name a successor to the reins of his massive industrial company , surprising everyone by splitting power between his son Tancredi , and grandson Edo .

And if we do n't want to be set up for disappointment by " silly " " cloying " melodrama with " irritating " " crashing " music like the ABC crowd above , what to do ? I suspect we need to let go ... because , well , because unless we let go , we 're not going anywhere . <p> If , as Kafka famously put it , " A book must be an ice axe to break the sea frozen inside us , " Swinton and her director 's tool of choice is a prawn in sweet and sour sauce .

The selections ( youtube link ) sounded something like Philip Glass in a sweaty passion -- this was the excited accompaniment heightening the drama of various scenes , the music swelling -- indeed -- to a rare pitch of emotionalism . <p> And that is why we see early on , Emma , Swinton 's character , watching on TV the celebrated ( and overwrought ) scene in Philadelphia where Tom Hank 's character -- dying of AIDS -- does the opera queen thing as he hangs on to his drip stand and mimes to Callas singing Tosca .

Yet the scene falls short for another and happier reason . We do n't need it . " <p> Here again we are reminded to just go with the artists ' offerings .

But rest assured , the wait will have been worth every second after what we saw today , which should get pretty much every racing/driving game fan more than buckling at the knees . <p> Yamauchi started things off at New Courses , of which he announced Lacuna Seca , Trial Mountain ( for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ la Sarthe ( which we also saw at night , and it looks incredible ) , while in the next category , " New Cars " we saw VW kicking it old-school with the likes of the Kubelwagen , the Schimmwagen and the classic Samba Bus along with the Isuzu 4200R which we were told was actually a concept car unveiled at the 1989 Tokyo Motorshow , and finally the Citroen GT by Citroen Race Car ( Polyphony apparently designed the car 's interior ) . <p> Next up Yamauchi jumped right into the game 's social community features , which are robust to say the least .

Rally mMode is also a neat feature that will generate a brand new rally track for you every single time you start a new race . The idea here is you ca n't get to ' know ' a rally circuit ; it 's about being a quick thinker in the driver 's seat and this mode comes replete with virtual co-pilot warning of your twists and turns , even before you 've gone through them ( this mode , because it 's randomly generated though , it must be said , did n't look quite as good as the stationary , more polished areas of the game .

As the tape is guided in the encoder by two pairs of high-density polyethylene tape guides , the tape can not move incorrectly and therefore can not lose step , as can be the case with other measuring systems . <p> Unlike conventional linear encoders however , the Meterdrive allows the user to stretch the stainless steel tape between two fixed points and does not need to be fixed accurately to a flat base , making it mobile . <p> It is also possible to use the tape with a pulley and counterweight , as a belt between two pulleys , or to move the tape through the fixed encoder , a solution that can be very beneficial for short distances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Meterdrive linear incremental tape encoder is particularly useful as a replacement for conventional chain arrangements and pulleys where roller slip or wear can cause loss of positioning when using rotary encoders . Inside the Meterdrive 's encoder are four light-emitting diodes opposite four light receiving diodes .

Uhm ... who cares . First off , Groot , you 're right that wiping down the record could damage it further . If you really wanted to clean it , we 'd suggest running it under water to rinse the glass out . After that , some enthusiasts recommend attaching it to a drill bit and spinning it dry . Seriously ! <p> But dude , it 's a record , and you live in Europe . You have Spotify ! Let go of the past and wise up : You have a golden opportunity here .

The Atlantic 's Alexis Madrigal tells one revenge story of a conman duped into carving wooden sculptures . <p> When anti-spam hero Mike Berry received an obviously false email promise of African millions , he resisted the urge to roll his eyes and delete -- and instead strung the criminal into an unwitting career in art .

Not until now though has there been a more sporty model made . <p> The Brabus team has never really shown interest in any other car maker except for Mercedes-Benz since it was established in 1977 , but now it seems the tuning house is expanding into the depths of other mass-produced cars , even Hyundai . <p> Enhancements fitted to the Hyundai i20 shown at the Paris show are mainly cosmetic , with larger and fatter wheels , a discreet bodykit and a completely refurbished -- and very German -- interior . Inside features include huge hip-hugging Recaro seats , a reupholstered dash in tan leather , and a 7 inch touch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bodykit has been added including a more aggressive front bumper bar design with the increasingly-fashionable LED daytime running lights . The rear bumper also presents a racier look utilising a rear diffuser blended in with new exhaust tips . <p> Other enhancements include tinted tail lights , a glossy radiator grille , smoked windows , and a classy chrome kick panel with ' Hyundai ' illuminated in blue along the length of it , as well as 17 inch Brabus wheels . <p> The Hyundai i20 Sport Edition is said to go into production during the first half of next year . It 'll only be available in limited numbers and to limited markets . <h> SOCIAL SHARE <p> Hideous . That interior is possible the single worst thing i 've seen on this website . <p> Bob <p> Yep . The interior reminds me too much of when teenagers paint the plastic bits on their Commodore dash . -- puke -- <p> But that exterior design is what the car should have been all along . its nice . <p> http : **30;529;TOOLONG ? id=100000019885375 Taki Yamauchi <p> I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they put more powerful engine than original donor car . However , not this time .... This time Brabus proof , they can do a good plastic surgery for Hyundai . <p> Andrew M <p> This is like what happened when they threw a body kit on the Yaris . It was still just a boring Yaris , only with try hard flares . <p> This is still just a boring i20 , just with try hard flares . <p> Whats really funny is it took the germans to sport it up . Just goes to show where the urge to at least try and style things up comes from ..... and its not Korea <p> http : **30;561;TOOLONG ? id=100000019885375 Taki Yamauchi <p> Agreed . Shame on Brabus ? No , this is a good example of " Money can buy most things . " Capitalism and Worship of money ... The Mammon is smiling for Hyundai . <p> Well , Hyundai has no history of motor sports whatsoever . This is the best and probably effective way for Hyundai . People laughing about sports car from Hyundai or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , suddenly this car sounds stunning ! ! ! <p> Hyundai should release more Brabus version for all their products , Especially ix35 , i40(Sonata) and all V8 model . <p> Robin Graves <p> I agree that Brabus have sold out here , they are not afraid of beefing up big dollar Mercedes drivetrains but do nt want to touch a relatively simple i20 . <p> As for Hyundai 's motorsport history -- yes its limited but they were involved in WRC for a few years with Alistair McRae as their No 1 driver . Also Rhys Millen held the pikes peak record until recently in a Hyundai Genesis which he also uses in the American drift championship . <p> http : **30;593;TOOLONG ? id=100000019885375 Taki Yamauchi <p> OK I was wrong . Hyundai did WRC for 3 and half years from 2000 . However they never achieved winning . So they stopped activity . And about Pikes Peak Hillclimb , Hyundai have entryed since 2009 . This year big mouth Rhys Millen 's Genesis PM580 was third . So Hyundau did something in motor sports world . But Hyundai @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sports . They threw billions at the soccer world cups and european cups each year . <p> I am not the only one feeling maybe Hyundai is better off advertising their products through a sport that has no connection to cars . They seem better off in a sport that does n't proof the quality and performance of their products . <p> Robin Graves <p> Millen held the 2WD time attack record in his Genesis and lost the record this year to a Porsche . A lot of manufacturers cancelled their motorsport programs in the last two years and Hyundai have only started in the big league in the last 5 years . Give them time and they will start to ante up . The same was said in the ' 60s about the Japanese manufacturers -- it took the R32 GT-R for people to take jap cars seriously -- even though George Fury 's lap time around Bathurst in a Datsun Bluebird was n't beaten until the Cosworth Sierra . As it was a qualifying lap it wasnt official and the rednecks just pretended it did nt happen . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Bluebird was a bit of a hand grenade over long distances . <p> jj <p> I loved it <p> until its orange gave my retinas cancer ! <p> john <p> I like the bodykit . The orange interior has been done before . Loose the stuff on the dash and put ostrich leather on the seats instead . <p> Shak <p> If they could change the colour of the interior , they could offer this as an option on their regular models , and i guarantee it would sell . Maybe tune the engine for a bit more oomph . <p> HSV650BHP <p> Wow your guarantee means sooooooooo much <p> http : //Daewoo140bhp Igomi Watabi <p> What did you ever do to this guy , Shak ? <p> Jabba the Hutt <p> A flawed experiment with the youth market .

My time with them has been brief , but they 've quickly become the most entertaining thing about Final Fantasy XIV .

Luckily I am an excellent runner . <p> At the urging of my linkshell-mate Dai I wander into some caves called Mistbeard Cove , where enemies far above my level lurked around every corner .

Photo : Reuters <p> Fidel Castro 's revelation to a US journalist that the communist model does n't work any more shows it is in everyone 's interests , including ours , for the US embargo of Cuba to end . <p> On the morning of February 7 , 1962 , president John F. Kennedy leant back in his chair in the Oval Office and smoked a Cuban cigar . He then signed an Executive Order , which put into effect an embargo of the Caribbean country . <p> The story goes that JFK ordered his press secretary the night before signing the order to obtain 1200 cigars . When he returned in the morning , Kennedy somewhat begrudgingly signed the order . JFK had originally wanted cigars excluded , but bowed to protests from Florida 's tobacco farmers . <p> While Cuba today is not much different to the Cuba of 1962 , the world has moved on from these sort of political obstacles embedded in history . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the US . Despite the end of the Cold War more than two decades ago , the fulcrum upon which Washington policy towards Havana sits remains one of confrontation . In fact , president Bill Clinton in 1996 signed the Helms-Burton Act , which extended the embargo to include foreign companies trading with Cuba after the Cuban government shot down two US civilian aircraft killing four people . Even the election of President Barack Obama , who opposed the embargo as a senator , did not soften America 's hardline attitude to Cuba . Although Obama did relax some family travel restrictions , they remain tightly controlled , leading Florida University professor Marifeli Perez-Stable to say : " Keeping families apart -- as Washington has done in the Cuban case -- is unmistakably un-American . " <p> The Cuban government has not helped itself . Apart from the actual actions such as the shooting down of the plane , it 's attitude towards the US remains as hardline as it was after the revolution . Yet on the romantic streets of Havana , it is clear the people have moved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Australia has a significant role to play and a lot to gain in helping bring about an end to the embargo .

These were sure signs of the strength of our formal relationship over the past 21 years . <p> In the past two years , Australia has worked more closely in international organisations with Cuba . This includes the UN , where Australia supported the annual resolution against the embargo and supported Cuba 's bid to train doctors for Pacific nations such as East Timor . As Smith has said : " It continues to be our view that the blockade should be lifted , that 's been Australia 's position for a long period of time .

Oil companies are keen to drill offshore , construction firms want to bid for infrastructure projects , and farmers want to export more rice , vegetables and meat . The perplexing reality is that ending the embargo would bring about significant economic benefits for the US . <p> As one commentator has remarked " even a small step like rescinding the 2004 Bush restrictions would earn the Obama administration international goodwill regarding Cuba " . Such goodwill would not be unnoticed by those in the Arab world or leftist governments who view the US as a labyrinth of hawkish politicians .

The reality is that the embargo has not allowed the US to form connections with a whole generation of Cuban officials who will become leaders in government or the opposition . <p> But any easing of the embargo would need to get past the hardline Republican caucus in Florida . Representing a large Cuban immigrant population in the Sunshine State , they are not eager to support any measure they feel indirectly legitimises the Castro leadership . <p> Ultimately , the world must realise that democracy can only come to Cuba from within its own borders . But ending the embargo is more likely to help than not .

" <p> Magnetic reversals are part of the cycles scientists have determined existed over the 4.5 billion years of the Earth 's existence .

" At least twelve ( magnetic ) reversals can be linked to extinctions and climatic deterioration during the last three million years alone , " says Felix . <p> Significantly , the aftermath of magnetic reversals are linked to the emergence of new species in ways that Charles Darwin never knew or dreamed of .

The Awards were presented at a gala event in Sydney this week . Moreland Council in Melbourne 's inner north , took out the government award for a project which uses illustrations to communicate to the area 's residents who speak 132 different languages . Lambros Tapinos was mayor when the storyboards were designed and was instrumental in developing the storyboards . The councillor says the series of illustrations communicate to residents the role of local council as well as council information such as how to use the library and sort recycling . " The project started off as an idea of how can we improve communication , and it 's grown and grown and grown and it 's great to get that recognition , " he said , adding that he hopes to expand the project further , with ideas to develop a DVD .

@@1729236 <p> The 1937-1941 period was the high point of the science fiction pulps . There were nine science fiction pulps published in 1937 , and 26 in 1941 , the apex for the genre . 1941 was the high point for the pulps as a whole , with more pulps being published in that year than at any time before or since , and it was the high point for the content of the science fiction pulps . <p> This was largely due to John W. Campbell taking over as the editor of Astounding in 1937 , beginning what is often called " the Golden Age of Science Fiction . " Campbell was editor of Astounding until 1960 , and of Analog , Astounding 's successor , from 1960 to 1971 . His personality and eccentric beliefs alienated writers and made Astounding a third-rate magazine after the mid-1950s , but for the first 10 years of his editorship he was the most influential figure in the history of science fiction . He insisted on clear prose and reasonable characterisation , he disallowed what he called " mysticism " , and he demanded that his writers take a far more rigorous approach to both a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ result was a set of stories which have aged less and remain more readable than the stories of any other science fiction pulp of this era . Among Campbell 's discoveries were Robert Heinlein , Isaac Asimov , Theodore Sturgeon , and A.E . Van Vogt . <p> The boom in science fiction was somewhat delayed . There were no new science fiction pulps in 1937 , and in 1938 only two appeared : Captain Hazzard ( 1 issue , 1938 ) , a mediocre hero pulp about a telepathy-wielding copy of Doc Savage and Marvel Science Stories ( 15 issues , four title changes , 1938-1941 , 1950-1952 ) , whose usually trite material was occasionally leavened by stories of sex and cruelty unusually erotic for the science fiction pulps . This down period in science fiction pulps is peculiar ; during these years the other major genres ( with the exception of the spicy pulps ) either held steady or grew . <p> The boom begins <p> In 1939 nine new science fiction pulps appeared , and the boom had begun .

Only six of the pulps which appeared in 1939 , 1940 , and 1941 are worth singling out . <p> Astonishing Stories ( 16 issues , 1940-1943 ) , the companion pulp to Super Science Stories ( see below ) , had an unusually high number of stories by writers who would later become famous in other venues . Astonishing ran works -- some lesser-known , and some merely lesser -- by Isaac Asimov , Clifford Simak , Alfred Bester , Manly Wade Wellman , and E.E . Doc Smith , among others . <p> Captain Future ( 17 issues , 1940-1944 ) , while bearing the same subpar writing as most other hero pulps , is notable as the most aggressively science fictional of the science fiction hero @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the titular hero 's assistants are a sentient robot and a brain-in-a-jar , and the plots are pure space opera . <p> Fantastic Adventures ( 129 issues , 1939-1953 ) came into its own much later in life , after 1950 , when Howard Browne became editor . In the early years , much of its content was trash , but it did also publish stories by Edgar Rice Burroughs , Nelson Bond , Robert Bloch and Manly Wade Wellman . <p> The Octopus ( 1 issue , 1939 ) and The Scorpion ( 1 issue , 1939 ) The Scorpion was the sequel to The Octopus in all but name -- are wonderfully excessive in their Mad Scientist Tries To Conquer The World stories , with the added bonus of a " hideously malformed " , tentacled protagonist . <p> Planet Stories ( 71 issues , 1939-1955 ) is in many ways the quintessential science fiction pulp . The issues were hodgepodges of planetary romances , space operas , and offbeat stories that might not have found a place anywhere else . Stories with titles like " Asteroid of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " appeared alongside Carl Jacobi 's " Grannie Annie " stories ( about a septuagenarian writer of science fiction novels in the future ) and Fredric Brown 's " Mitkey " stories ( about a mouse sent into space and altered by a race of mouse-like aliens ) . Quality was uneven , of course , but at its best Planet Stories could be both entertaining and literate . <p> The content of Super Science Stories ( 16 issues , 1940-1943 ) is generally unremarkable , but the pulp did serve as an early market for material by members of the New York science fiction writers group the Futurians , whose members included Asimov , James Blish , C.M. Kornbluth , Robert Lowndes , Frederik Pohl , and Donald A. Wollheim . <p> World War II and the Post-War Boom <p> As might be expected , the United States ' entrance into World War II had a deleterious effect on the science fiction pulps , as it did on the pulps in general , and the 1942-1945 period is one of contraction and cancellation .

Like Cosmic Stories , Stirring is best-known for the stories from various Futurians , although it published equal numbers of science fiction and fantasy , and its best stories were Clark Ashton Smith 's fantasies . <p> The Shadow Annual ( 3 issues , 1942 , 1943 , 1947 ) reprinted the " best " stories from The Shadow which had appeared the previous years . A significant proportion of these stories was fantastic , though of course badly written . <p> The 1946-1949 period was the time when the death of the science fiction pulp become apparent as a phenomenon of the near-future rather than the distant future . <p> As a medium , the pulps rebounded quickly from the war , and most genres held steady during these years . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ genres . No new science fiction pulps appeared in 1945 or 1946 . In 1947 , Fantasy Book ( 8 issues , 1947-1950 ) appeared , but it was an amateurish production of bad quality during this time period . In 1948 , Fantastic Novels ( 20 issues , 3 issues ) appeared . It was a new edition of the 1940 pulps but only contained reprints . And in 1949 Captain Zero and Super Science Stories appeared . Captain Zero ( 3 issues , 1949 ) was the last of the hero pulps , featuring a protagonist who turned invisible at night , but its stories were primarily detective with an overlay of the fantastic , rather than primarily fantastic as Doc Savage ' s and The Spider 's had been . Super Science Stories ( 15 issues , 1949-1951 ) was a new version of the Super Science Stories published from 1940-1943 and featured entertaining and occasionally excellent material . <p> The situation in the mainstay science fiction pulps was somewhat better . Amazing Stories was in the hands of editor Raymond Palmer , who had begun stressing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1938 but who in 1945 began regularly publishing gibberish by Richard Shaver , which increased the pulp 's circulation at the cost of making the venerable pulp a laughingstock among professional science fiction writers . Astounding was the undisputed leader among science fiction pulps and was at its height under John W. Campbell . Fantastic Adventures remained of decent quality , and Planet Stories continued to regularly publish good work . <p> The biggest change among the pulps was in Startling Stories , which changed editors in late 1945 . New editor Sam Merwin , Jr . changed the magazine 's slant from juvenile material to more adult fare , and by 1949 Startling was regularly challenging Astounding and was publishing stories from the top writers in the field . <p> Rise of the Digests <p> A much bigger change for the pulps took place outside the pulps entirely . The minutiae of magazine publishing during the 1920s , 1930s , 1940s and 1950s are of little interest to non-specialists , and for the purposes of these columns the differences between " bedsheets " ( 8.5 ? x 11.75 ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 10 ? or 6.75 ? x 9.75 ) and " small " pulps ( 6.5 ? x 9 ? ) are unimportant . They were all pulps , despite their varying sizes . ( Again , " pulp " is about magazine size and paper quality and story content and amount of advertising ) . <p> The shift from the pulps to the digest ( roughly 5.25 ? x 7.5 ? ) is important because the digests would ultimately become the next stage in the history of science fiction magazines -- the digests were the Cro Magnons to the pulps ' Neanderthals . <p> The digest was hardly new in the 1946-1949 period . It had been introduced to the mass market with Readers ' Digest , which began in 1922 , and the first science fiction pulp to switch to digest size was Astounding , in 1943 . But in 1949 The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction debuted , in digest format , and it was aimed from the beginning at the adult market which had until then been the province of Astounding and more recently Startling . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's market share . <p> Decline of the Science Fiction Pulps <p> 1950-1953 was the last efflorescence of the pulps . The number of pulps published hit a five-year-high in 1950 -- 162 titles were published that year -- and then began a slow decline , so that , although new pulps appeared in every genre over the next three years , especially in romance and westerns , the pulps were obviously dying . This death was a gradual rather than sudden thing , however : in 1955 there were 48 pulps published , and as late as 1960 there were still 11 pulps being published . As with the dime novels , the transition between forms took place over the course of several years rather than abruptly . <p> This would seem , despite the poor quality of the content , to indicate a medium in good health . However , all of these new pulps were canceled by 1954 . Amazing made the switch to digest form in 1953 , as did Weird Tales . Fantastic Adventures was canceled in 1953 .

@@1729237 <h> The full story ... <h> Australia 's media election coverage under the microscope <p> MARK COLVIN : One of the big talking points of this year 's federal election campaign was the alleged inadequacy of the media coverage . <p> There was a lot of criticism of newspapers , radio and television for treating it like a horse race instead of concentrating on policy . <p> That was n't helped by the small target strategy of both parties , which were n't keen to stray outside the relatively small number of topics they 'd picked to campaign on . <p> Now political scientist Sally Young has done an in-depth analysis of newspapers , television news , current affairs programs , talkback radio , breakfast TV , Internet websites and blogs in recent Australian elections . <p> Her book , How Australia Decides : Election Reporting and the Media , looks at the criticisms but also goes back to 2001 to see how the media have changed in a decade . <p> SALLY YOUNG : It 's changed vastly . I mean when we look at the 2001 election , online media was nowhere near at the capacity that it is now . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from 2001 , you look at online newspapers , they 're only updating a couple of times a day and most of the content is taken straight out of the printed newspaper . They were just vastly different . <p> Media control was different , audiences were very different . Television was still very big . Now we 've seen over the last sort of 10 or 11 years television audiences , particularly for news and current affairs , drop off in record sorts of numbers so there is a sort of retreat away from traditional journalism news forms , particularly in media like newspapers , which we know are struggling with circulation problems . <p> MARK COLVIN : And you 've got Twitter and Facebook and bloggers all talking back to those media . I suppose that 's another big difference . <p> SALLY YOUNG : Exactly . And that environment just was n't there 10 , 20 years ago , so we 're talking about a vastly different media audience , one that 's really fragmenting . And I talk about in the book how I think it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in sort of what we might call public interest news - political news junkies , political tragics , whatever you want to call them - who have information needs that are vast , who are going online and selecting from a lot of different content , who might be watching Sky news or the ABC News 24 now - that sort of news coverage where they 're watching live press conferences and so on . <p> And then you 've got another bulk of the Australian media audience which is n't particularly interested in politics news , says that it 's probably the last sort of news that they 'd want to watch , really . So you 're trying to engage and report for two very different groups . And we can see that split going on . <p> MARK COLVIN : What percentage would you allocate to either group ? <p> SALLY YOUNG : I 've got some figures in the book where I try to map this quite specifically because I do n't think it 's been done in Australia before , that we talk about who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? And I 've got quite a few chapters devoted to this and in one of them I chart it and I say , basically the people who are really political news tragics - people who watch Parliament Question Time or subscribe to Crikey , for example , or watch Sky News press conferences and so on live - that 's about 0.5 per cent of the Australian population . So they 're your real political tragics and it 's a very small percentage . <p> MARK COLVIN : And so politicians have a real dilemma there . I mean , they 're speaking on two levels and if they engage too much with the Twitterarti etc , then they 're in danger of ignoring the vast majority of the population . <p> SALLY YOUNG : Mm , that 's right and I mean , even just broadening it out . When I looked at the percentage of people who buy a broadsheet in Australia , it 's about 2 per cent of the adult population . So , you know , it broadens out to things like , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ current affairs that 's about 10 per cent , or 12 per cent might listen to ABC Local Radio . So it 's somewhere between 0.5 to 12 per cent . That 's the core audience you think are interested in detailed information about politics , that sort of public affairs . <p> MARK COLVIN : So you 're left with 80 to 90 per cent who get everything they know about politics from the first couple of minutes of one of the commercial channels ' news bulletins . <p> SALLY YOUNG : Exactly . That 's right . And one of the findings I was looking at in the book as well is that those people who are reliant , as you say , particularly on commercial television news programs , those news programs will devote possibly two minutes a night to the election ? <p> SALLY YOUNG : And that 's the problem . I mean , you can see at the same time that that 's going on , television news programs , you can see that they 're diminishing their politics coverage and that 's partly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which is that they know that the people who are really interested in politics news have probably already got it by the time they get home at 6 o'clock and turn on the news . <p> They 've probably been getting updates throughout the day online if they 're especially interested . So they 're realising that that part of their audience that they used to try to cater for in one product - putting everything in there , a mix of politics and sports , news and entertainment to try to cater for a mass audience - that audience is fragmenting away . <p> But at the same time , what they would say probably in their defence is that they 're giving more politics news in other formats , that politics news has bled out of the main news bulletin and it 's covered in things like breakfast programs , like politicians appearing on Sunrise , or it 's covered in topical comedy programs or news programs of different sorts throughout the day . <p> MARK COLVIN : Alright so put yourself in a politician 's shoes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the major parties . How do you deal with this ? <p> SALLY YOUNG : Well you can see one of the ways they deal with it is that they try to , if they 're brave enough , that the politicians will go on some of the more popular news programs as with Kevin Rudd going on Rove , for example . You know , that they 'll try and engage that audience and reach that audience that is n't the hardcore political news junkies . They 'll try and get to them through the media they actually use . So that 's one of the ways . <p> MARK COLVIN : As a professional journalist , we tend to see that as " Oh , they 're trying to avoid the hard questioning " . But you 're saying that it 's just a logical reaction to what 's going on . <p> SALLY YOUNG : And it would be anti-democratic if they did n't try to engage those people who do n't access that sort of hard news media , really . I mean , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ media , if you want to call them that - do n't like it when politicians avoid them to go on popular media like FM radio or comedy shows or whatever it is . <p> I mean , we just saw Obama , for example , go on the Daily Show in the US . I mean , that 's quite a hard interview . It 's quite a difficult interview and it 's not necessarily avoiding scrutiny but it is trying to reach a different audience I think . <p> MARK COLVIN : Sure but another extension of the same idea is what a lot of Sarah Palin 's proteges are doing , which is to avoid the hard media altogether and thereby avoid any hard questioning . <p> SALLY YOUNG : Yeah . And obviously that 's not acceptable or desirable in a democracy either . I mean , there needs to be a balance both for politicians and for news audiences . Even if news audiences are n't particularly interested in politics and do n't want to see a full interview with the Prime Minister , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those interviews are being done and that information is being circulated , and there is a sort of , if you want to call it a trickle down affect as well . <p> Even if politicians do interviews on the 7:30 Report or on AM , you know , those often trickle down to other media and have a sort of agenda-setting effect as well , so they 're still important and do sometimes filter through to an audience who 'd rather not access those media . <p> MARK COLVIN : Dr Sally Young , senior lecturer in the School of Social and Political Sciences at the University of Melbourne . You can hear a longer version of that interview later on our website. 
@@1729238 <p> Of course , this person who shall remain unnamed ( that 's you , John ) says to me at the opening , She is being very unfashionable , it 's not about politics and it 's not conceptually based ; this is just about painting . The " it " is the knockout show " Inventory , " a group of nine large paintings , sprinkled with a bunch of smaller pieces ; " she " is Katherine Hattam , the artist who made the works . <p> A small town proviso <p> I have known Katherine for a while -- it 's a small town , circling circles -- but we 're acquaintancy friends , not " mates " ; I like her , she 's a straight talker . I 've looked at her work over the last 15ish years -- I even bought a paper/collage painting some years ago , on impulse -- I walked into a gallery , saw it on the end wall and said to the girl , Red dot , that one . Which was very annoying for S who had given me a lift to the show , as that was the one she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what there is to disclose -- it 's simply unavoidable talking about the work of people you know , and I 'm not going to try . Thus these grains of salt , sprinkle it over what follows , as you will . <p> Willem de Kooning : Content is a glimpse of something , an encounter like a flash . It 's very tiny -- very tiny , content . <p> No politics , no conceptual attack . Is it possible to be a relevant artist today , to only be interested in aesthetics , to merely paint ? That is a question that institutions and their curators might ask , but I ca n't see that any of the people I know who collect would bother , and certainly not insist on . However , people do still ask what a piece of art means . You see a lot of that kind of work at state galleries , particularly in the contemporary sections . What does it mean , mummy ? That 's the easy stuff , of course , you do n't need to look too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how cool it is . You can read the wall labels for satisfaction and move on to the next puzzle piece . All these meaningful works . <p> In most modern instances , interpretation amounts to the philistine refusal to leave the work of art alone . Real art has the capacity to make us nervous . By reducing the work of art to its content and then interpreting that , one tames the work of art . Interpretation makes art manageable , comfortable . <p> A couple of pages before that she frames the idea of content : <p> What the overemphasis on the idea of content entails is the perennial , never-consummated project of interpretation . And conversely , it is the habit of approaching works of art in order to interpret them that sustains the fancy that there really is such a thing as the content of a work of art . <p> Yes yes , I know that she wrote in times charged with a particular current of politics , and that she may well have written in pre ? mptive defense of provocative works in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ casual censorship . But this is Sontag , so we can be sure that there are wider and more general readings to her essay . <p> All the messy details reduced to sudden shapes <p> In this group of Katherine 's works , we see her continuing use of the motifs gifted to her by daily life , all the mod cons and debris of home , enriched by grafting certain views taken from a visit to her sister in Brooklyn : the crazy paving mutated rhomboids are inspired by a stained glass window panel there ; the pylons are in the view out that window . We do n't need to know this of course , but it is a charming detail -- in the way that each detail in Katherine 's paintings inform us of the simplest kind of content , where a cigar is a cigar ; so , the recurring Rodchenko pot , the spotty spectacle frames , the mask on the wall , the chairs and cords et al . <p> And we see the spaces , the scenery that she sees . Merri Creek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and white dogs snuffling at the base of a tree . Pylons and treetops . The bridge . And all the effects that inflect them -- shadows on branches and trunks reduced to the morse code of staccato black and white . <p> And that pinpoints her painting project : reduction to graphic simplicity ; a graphic flattening then recomplicated by suggestive differences in distances ; planes and angles that have their own rules of perspective . <p> Let 's look . . . <p> This is Inventory , the title piece in the show . It has mappish qualities , but is n't so much a map as an illustrated list of contents . <p> It 's a room with view through an open door . On the wall -- snakes and ladders , a mask , a dilly bag . And reproductions , I think , of Colin McCahon 's Six days in Nelson and Canterbury and Sidney Nolan 's Boy and the Moon . On the table : book , scissors , paintbrushes and tubes , drink cans and teapot and hairbrush . A laptop . Stained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crazy pavers at the bottom , and under the table and outside , a pair of chooks . <p> Above : Inventory I , 2010 , gouache and pencil on board , 165 x 125 cm <p> So much , so simple . But ... what we immediately recognise as scenery outside is really a fauve-smacked picture of hot pinks and oranges with black and white interventions -- as abstract as any Willem de Kooning . Along with the lightbulb coil , the Rodchenko teapot is part of that picture too , its geometric figuration embedded into the flat beyond . To speak of picture is to realise that this painting could be cropped into four or five separate , self-contained pictures : one is the square formed by the table legs , featuring the bejewelled Klimt chickens ; and we note the table legs are real wood ! -- which is the plywood of the painting surface . The view above the tabletop is another picture ; as is the the tabletop itself . And the whole vertical strip of white wall on the right , from Nolan to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of perspective . As different as the perspective looking out the door , which is itself is only another view , to add to that of six views punched through the right wall by the 60-year-old inheritance of Colin McCahon 's kiwi imagination . <p> And yet , it holds together -- a wild jangle and pop of bright colours and flat planes . All those primaries clashing against each other : ching ! ching ! ching ! It reminds me of John Berger 's remark about Matisse 's saturated palette : he clashes colours together like cymbals , but makes the soothing sounds of a lullaby . I do n't think the Hattam effect here is of a lullaby , but maybe of a brilliant pop song with bars of Philip Glass and Steve Reich coded within it . <p> I could enjoyably blather on about any of Katherine 's works in this show , then again , why not look at them yourself at the gallery page , here . <p> But just a couple more then . Above , is Fed Square , perhaps the most challenging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Walking Track at the top of the blog ( though I think there are only a handful of pictures in the show I do n't find completely sexy ) . Fed Square is a large square picture , 150cm or five feet a side , that is nearly wholly abstract . <p> What are not abstract are the recognisable renderings of other people 's paintings on the right side -- I think , from top : Rover Thomas ; a Fred Williams landscape , of course ; another McCahon ? ; what is this -- makes me think of Robertson-Swann 's Vault aka " Yellow Peril " ; and a sliver of a Nolan Ned Kelly . There is also a little bicycle , lower middle left , and in the lime green the words TODAY AT , in the middle . <p> If you know , as any art lover would , that Federation Square is the in/famous art gallery of many facets and angles -- all the zing and zap begin to reconfigurate into the idea of a picture of a building and its surrounds -- the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ geometric shapes indicate the Fed 's facade , the white walls the galleries within , the paintings on the right are ... the paintings . So , this is a picture about pictures , and insists on its own pictureness , an entity not like any others it might reference , but then referencing any number of aspects about art making , from Australian art heritage to the building material of marine ply on which it is painted . <p> One might view it as an abstraction but it is the tension of its call back to life 's actualness that 's so exciting for the optical consciousness . <p> ... is the use of exposed pencil marks -- the pylons and powerlines especially glory in their naked structure -- the confidence ! ( Katherine 's is a practised , unique hand , making fateful lines of a stylised simpleness . ) <p> ... the humming vibes from close , abutting tones , like the browns and reds of Powerlines , Merri Creek , or Walking Track , top . It 's a Japanese zone , the zen of emptied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all those colour circles and party confetti ; I think of Peter Max and Martin Sharp in the days of Oz . <p> ... the colour palette that snaps and bangs , like a Jamaican steel drum player in your kitchen making a joyous racket with your pans . Blue rings against the rub of pinks and oranges , peels of lime and lemon chime , blacks and whites punctuate -- so elemental , so sophisticated . Mondrian in a blender . <p> " No idea but in things . " -- William Carlos Williams <p> There is no politics in these pictures , no conceptual drag cloaking the images . This is art about art , art about a life in art . They are the best things I 've ever seen from Katherine .

@@1729239 <p> Annie Leibovitz 's career reads like one long cautionary tale on the fickleness of fame -- a condition the poet Rilke famously described as " the sum of all misunderstandings " . As the world 's leading photographer of celebrities , she has become a celebrity in her own right . This is the main reason her exhibition at the Museum of Contemporary Art is drawing big audiences . Not only is our curiosity engaged by the people she has photographed , we are equally curious about the woman behind the camera . <p> Leibovitz , recognised as the most famous and highly paid photographer in the world , made the news last year for having run up a debt of $US24 million ( $24.2 million ) . No one seems to know exactly how she did it , although poor real estate investments may be the most likely explanation . In some ways , it only seems to confirm her status as a celebrity , as spectacular financial crashes are included in the job description nowadays . <p> The most disappointing aspect of this glittering tale is the work itself , which hardly justifies Leibovitz 's exalted reputation . I 'm not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honest reaction to this show . Put Leibovitz 's pictures alongside those of any great photographer of the 20th century -- from Cartier-Bresson to Robert Frank , from Diane Arbus to Josef Koudelka -- and they rate no better than average . To be frank , there are more talented photographers working for the Fairfax press . <p> Leibovitz is chiefly known for a handful of iconic images , especially the nude , pregnant Demi Moore on the cover of Vanity Fair of August 1991 ; and the shot of a naked John Lennon crouching over a fully clothed Yoko Ono , which appeared on a Rolling Stone cover in January 1981 . The image gained force from the fact that Lennon was murdered only a few hours after the photo session . <p> Advertisement <p> As a " rock'n'roll photographer " , she toured with the Rolling Stones and took a series of pictures that have become forever identified with the band . In her work for Vanity Fair , she has had the privilege of photographing actors , models , politicians and every other life form that flourishes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say that being photographed by Leibovitz is one of the defining features of being a celebrity today . <p> Leibovitz 's name conjures up thoughts of Whoopi Goldberg in a bath of milk ; Sylvester Stallone in the pose of Rodin 's Thinker ; the March 2006 Vanity Fair cover shot of Tom Ford with a nude Keira Knightley and Scarlett Johansson ; a stern portrait of Queen Elizabeth ; and a controversial one of a semi-clothed Miley Cyrus . <p> Do n't expect to find these in the MCA show , which focuses on Leibovitz 's work from 1990 to 2005 . This period roughly coincides with her relationship with the legendary American public intellectual Susan Sontag . Leibovitz met Sontag on a photo shoot in 1989 and they soon became one of New York 's power couples . Whatever the nature of their relationship , it was a loving one , perhaps tinged with a little hero worship on Leibovitz 's behalf . <p> During these years , Sontag fought successive battles with cancer , finally succumbing in December 2004 . Six weeks later , Leibovitz 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grief . When she had to select works for this exhibition , which debuted at the Brooklyn Museum in October 2006 , she decided to include a mass of personal material , treating the show as an extension of the mourning process . Consequently , there are numerous photos of Sontag , in sickness and in health , naked and clothed , and finally laid out on her death bed . There are a lot of family snapshots , hardly different from the pictures in anybody else 's family album . There is even a self-portrait -- echoing the Demi Moore image -- that shows Leibovitz naked and heavily pregnant . She would give birth to a daughter at the age of 51 and then have twins through a surrogate mother . <p> If it sounds highly unprofessional for an artist to include all this material , it is also the show 's saving grace . For although we may come to peer at the celebrities , we gradually become immersed in Leibovitz 's private world . Most people will be able to identify with the feelings she has for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every aspect of her life . What could so easily appear self-indulgent manages to retain a sense of intimacy . The exhibition feels like a private diary that we have been invited to read , knowing the contents were not originally meant for publication . <p> One begins to see Leibovitz not as a hard-nosed professional but as a vulnerable and fallible person . This feeling extends to the way we look at the celebrity portraits and other images . There are very few pictures that qualify as major works , possibly none . When one casts an eye over her career , the repetitious nature of Leibovitz 's approach is only too obvious . The John and Yoko photo is echoed by a picture of a clothed Johnny Depp and a naked Kate Moss and was also restaged with Sean Lennon and Charlotte Muhl . <p> She photographed Goldberg in the bath but also Angelina Jolie and , in this show , Sontag . There are just as many variations on a figure on a bed . For Vanity Fair , there is a series of group portraits that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compositions have been borrowed from famous works of art . The Ford , Knight-ley and Johansson shot , for instance , playfully puns on Manet 's Dejeuner sur l'herbe . There are also numerous echoes of other photographers -- so many that I fear my imagination is working too hard . <p> There is no suggestion of plagiarism in these works but they are strongly formulaic -- an occupational hazard for a sought-after portraitist who has to keep coming up with one killer image after another for a magazine cover . This goes beyond the call of art and takes us onto the assembly line . With many of her portraits she falls back on the simple expedient of a black-and-white image of a figure in a bare room . This is the way we meet Robert De Niro , Al Pacino , Brice Marden , Chuck Close , Tony Kushner and many another actor , artist or writer . <p> Her portraits may gain impact simply because of an intense focus on the subject 's face . William S. Burroughs , the author of cult novels such as Naked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Burroughs 's gaunt , bony features , his spots and wrinkles , and the few wisps of hair clinging to his bald dome . The profile view is virtually a death mask . This is not very different from a profile shot of the elderly artist Louise Bourgeois with her eyes shut tight and her face cobwebbed with wrinkles . <p> A face -- any face -- has an intrinsic fascination for the viewer . Even the plainest mug can not fail to be interesting in a photo , while the ugliest are most interesting of all . This is not the case with landscape , represented by a series of over-stretched , black-and-white prints that show grainy images of locations such as Monument Valley and Mount Vesuvius . These pictures , mostly taken from a helicopter , are notable only for their scale . Shots of Vita Sackville-West 's garden at Sissinghurst are included because of their sentimental association with Sontag , who loved this place . <p> In the catalogue , Leibovitz tells us these landscape pictures were never a success with the magazines that commissioned them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a personal whim -- signalling her relief not to be shooting a portrait but showing no special affinity with the landscape genre . She 's no Ansel Adams and , when it comes to aerial photography , no Richard Woldendorp . <p> With a retrospective by any well-known photographer , one expects that it will have been subject to the most rigorous editing , with many hair-splitting decisions as to what images are included and excluded . What is most remarkable about this show is that its true interest lies in the looseness of the editing . Without the personal material that makes up roughly half the exhibition , we would see only a monotonous parade of faces , with the imaginative limitations of the photos cruelly exposed . The inclusion of the family snaps and the chronicle of Sontag 's last years takes us into a different dimension . We are not looking at celebrities or works of art but records of human life . It is as though Leibovitz had to reassert her identity as flesh and blood , not simply an appendage to the fame game . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place in this parade of artifice that gives this exhibition its distinction .

Approaching the city of Palma from the airport one of the first sights is the huge cathedral building sitting proud on the ridge over the port . Even from a distance it is clear that its rose windows are enormous , and the warm stone glows in the sunlight . The building stretches 121 metres in length , and is unusually wide , with the nave and aisles measuring 55 metres across . Which seems appropriate , since Catalan Gothic is notable for the scale and openness of its interior spaces . <p> Unlike other Catalan Gothic structures , Palma 's La Seu cathedral may be pleasing to the eye but it is not exactly an engineering triumph . <p> With amazing engineering and construction innovativeness , most Catalan churches minimise reliance on buttresses , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' s Sagrada Fam ? lia did away with them altogether , channelling the force fields of the superstructure down what are often perilous thin interior columns . <p> In the case of Palma , however , there seems to have been a crisis of nerve or construction ingenuity because the building is almost buttressed to the point of threatening the entry of light . There are signs that more and more buttresses , including two tiers of flying buttress , were added in what gives the impression of nervousness about the stability of the structure . <p> Between 1902 and 1914 Gaud ? rearranged the interior of the cathedral , opened up more windows , introduced electric lighting and created the most unusual pulpits .

@@1759230 <h> Giz Explains : Where Dust Bunnies Come From <p> I first met my terrible dust bunny , cowering under a soon-to-be replaced video card . It was 2003 . Since then , he has puffed around in my periphery , a dusty daemon on my figurative shoulder . And in my literal apartments . <p> I threw him out with the fritzy Radeon , and vowed to properly clean my computer case from then on . So he migrated . <p> From the left rear corner of my gaming computer , he hitched to the corner of my college dorm , behind the TV and out of sight . In my first apartment , he grew bolder and more proudly disgusting ; I caught him twice next to the bathroom door . In apartments with strict cleaning rotas , he went into hiding , but could usually find the foot of a bedpost , or a closet corner , or a heavy appliance to hide near . Just last month , I found him in the middle of the hall , sitting static at the hardwood nexus of filth . It was n't clear if he 'd come from a bedroom , from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few more feet , tumbleweed-style , from the bathroom . Did n't matter . He was back , he was gross , and nearly a decade later , I still had no idea where he had come from , or how he had formed . <h> What is Dust ? <p> Let 's set aside the bunny for a second , and focus on the filth . Dust is everywhere . Fine sand is rock dust . Rubber , brakepad and pavement particles are road dust . Fine ash can be volcanic dust . Hell , Carl Sagan famously and repeatedly referred to Earth as a " mote of dust , " albeit in a cosmic sense . But the dust we 're talking about , dust bunny dust , is a specific thing , with a specific recipe . And a studied one ! According to David W. Layton and Paloma I. Beamer , who coauthored a report called ' Migration of Contaminated Soil and Airborne Particulates to Indoor Dust , ' typical household dust in a midwestern home is comprised of the following : <p> Indoor dust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particulate matter derived from ambient outdoor air , and importantly , organic matter inputs from various sources . A prominent feature of indoor dust is its organic material content , with levels of about 40 wt % in residential housing . <p> Soil , pollen and airborne dirt particles were to be expected and account for over half of dust 's weight . Makes sense ! Outside is full of dirt , and every time we return to our homes , we bring some of that back . <p> So , doctors Layton and Beamer , what about that other 40 per cent . The " organic matter " , as you call it : <p> The closer you look , the worse it gets . For a feature in a 1986 issue of Discover Magazine ( via the Straight Dish ) , Penny Moser took samples of dust from her home to a lab , where she took a look at a couple of them through a microscope : <p> Pathologist Charles McLeod moved his eye over the prepared slide containing my dust ball ... " Heres part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chitinous shield or a body fragment . Here 's a human hair . " It was mine . I could tell because I periodically give myself a henna rinse , and under the microscope the hair showed bursts of Raging Raspberry or Autumn Copper slapped onto mouse brown . <p> We came across an Alternaria mold spore , which looked like a segmented sweet potato , and a roundworm egg , which I did n't want to know much more about . On this slide , as on all the slides , there were many tiny blue and pink fibers . " They 're natural fibers , " McLeod said . " You can tell by the flat , irregular shape . In your neighbor 's radiator dust we have a synthetic blue fibre . Probably from something like a pair of blue pantyhose . " The radiator dust also had a ghastly looking thing that resembled chicken feet , but was just a tiny hair cluster from the bottom of a leaf .

And that was the least worrying of the samples . From under her bed : <p> The tiny toenail fragment did n't bother me and the mold spores I could live with -- but not the horrible hairy thing that looked like a lobster claw . " That 's the limb of something that 's been dismembered , " McLeod said matter-of-factly . It was n't a minute before he found a whole one . " I 've never seen anything quite like this , " he said . " It seems to have mouth parts on its feet and gill-like devices . " It was to me , without a doubt , the ugliest thing I had ever seen . It looked like an angry rhinoceros with crustacean appendages . <p> This turned out to be a dust mite , an exceedingly common , **26;211;TOOLONG creature that lives in most of our homes , feeding off the skin that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , is dead . Whether it 's an insect corpse , a disembodied hair , or flakes of epidermis , it 's all dead . Dead dust has no will , no intentions . So why does it clump as if it does ? <h> The origin of dust bunnies , the universe and everything <p> Dust is just dust . It 's not readily evident why little tiny particles of one thing or another would clump together , and even less obvious how all these flecks and specks and grains come to behave in seemingly consistent ways : forming in corners , or edges ; appearing in clusters ; preferring life indoors instead of out . Albeit a crude and basic one , dust bunnies are a system , and systems have to emerge from somewhere , by some mechanism . <p> Make that mechanisms , plural . Dust begins to bunnify by doing what dust does best : settling . But because dust is made of so many different materials , it settles in lots of different ways . Hair , large skin scales and visible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a vent ( particles may settle in the small eddie , or vortex , near a vent opening ) or my physical movement ( which is why dust bunnies often appear behind doors -- they 've been swept there ) . Smaller particles tend to remain airborne for long periods of time , dropping at rates of just a foot an hour for sub-micron dust particles . <p> These smaller particles can be led to surprising locales , propelled by unnoticeable , super-subtle airflows . As still as your house 's atmosphere may feel , it 's in constant movement . Your breathing , your appliance 's exhaust , and your heating and cooling systems are sources of flow , the direction and patterns of which are rarely observed , except through the dust bunnies they help create . <p> But airflows and walking paths and the like can only tell us where dust bunnies will be ; they do n't tell us why they form . For that , we turn to cosmology . <p> A popular theory about the formation of our solar system , and others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early bodies of the galaxy just sort of ... clumped up . Says Richard Cowen , in his book , ' History of Life ' : <p> Dust particles collide softly and tend to stick together by electrostatic and gravitational attraction in a process called accretion . Around a new star , the dust bunnies can build up and compact into substantial solid masses a kilometer or so in diameter . Computer models show that in only a few million years , several thousand bodies the size of large asteroids will coalesce into larger units that we now see as planets . <p> This same principle is generally applicable to household dust , says Cowen , whose theory is echoed by astrophysicist luminary Neil deGrasse Tyson : " Accretionexplains the origin of dust bunnies under your couch . " <p> With much respect for our astrophysical inclined friends , in the gravity-bound context of a home , the tiny amounts of static electricity present in motes of dust are only useful for explaining why fine particles stick together . It takes a stronger bond to hold one of those mouse-like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Matthews toldEsquire last year , " The forces that hold the dust bunnies together can be the entangled fibers themselves . They get matted , much like lint or felt . " <p> Once all those larger skin , hair and insect particles meet , in other words , they just get their hooks into one another , and do n't let go .

@@1759232 <h> Labor row looms over life after Bushmaster <p> The government faces a damaging row over defence procurement , amid claims the Defence Material Organisation is reflexively opposed to Australian defence industries . <p> The row centres on defence equipment manufacturer Thales Australia . Thales produces the Bushmaster armoured vehicle , one of the clear successes of the Afghanistan conflict , at its Bendigo plant , which employs over 200 people . <p> As the Bushmaster production contract nears an end , Thales has bid for a component of the Army 's Land 21 program to source 2300 medium and heavy trucks , just over half of which will need to be fitted with protection for operational deployment . Thales is offering a single cab variant of the Bushmaster , which was initially rejected by the DMO before the Rudd Government overhauled the contracting process on entering office . Thales 's vehicle is up against civilian vehicles from Mercedes-Benz and M.A.N , which will be fitted with armour . <p> Despite a troubled development phase , the Bushmaster is credited with savings dozens of Australian lives in Afghanistan -- Defence sources say between 40 and 50 -- as well as those of a number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ armoured versions of civilian transports , which have proven ineffective at resisting blasts from roadside bombs compared to the Bushmaster 's v-hull . Over 100 have been sold to the UK and the Netherlands . Over 30 of the vehicles have been destroyed in Afghanistan . <p> The Land 121 Phase 3 decision was due by the end of the year , but was recently delayed until March . Bendigo MP Steve Gibbons has started campaigning within the government and publicly for the Bushmaster variant . <p> Gibbons is an assiduous local member who has turned Bendigo from a marginal seat -- John Brumby lost it in 1990 -- into one with a nearly 10% margin for Labor . But he was also one of the few Caucus members to openly rebel under Kevin Rudd , leading the successful fight against the removal of Parallel Import Restrictions on books . The Australian printing company McPhersons is a major employer in the Victorian town of Maryborough , in Gibbons 's electorate . <p> He appears to have an even stronger hand with Thales , given the Bushmaster 's excellent record of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ armoured-up civilian transport equipment like the Mercedes and M.A.N competitors .

" However , we do have significant industrial capabilities in ship building and repair , ordnance and armoured vehicles . The Bushmaster is arguably the best in the world for its combination of mobility and protection . It has saved scores of Australian lives in Afghanistan . <p> " Despite this , there remains a strong bias against Australian armoured vehicle manufacturers from sections of the DMO . " <p> The left-wing AMWU has also been lobbying for Thales within the Government . <p> The Phase 3 project is considered a crucial bridging project for Thales to the Land 121 Phase 4 , which is a light protected vehicle to replace the ADF 's Land Rovers .

If the alternatives to the Bushmaster have no redeming features , as the article suggests , then the argument will be easily won . <p> There is more at stake here .

Do we only want value for money when it suits us ? What utter crap . <p> And you 're right Jeremy , Thales is hardly a small concern . They 're the second largest Defence company in Australia in their own right . <p> But they 've had a run of bad contracts with Defence over the past few years . They phaffed the FFG upgrade , know they 've lost the upcoming munition contract and recent maritime efforts ( sonars on AWD for eg ) . <p> They need vehicles to keep the business viable and are using every trick in the book to make sure they get Ph 3 of Land 121 and have high hopes for Ph 4 .

Jobs in Bendigo mean nothing compared to that . <p> Hopefully politicians will not be swayed by short term job arguments . But I wo n't hold my breath on it . <p> You 're wrong Anongirl , the single cab ute is basically the same protected V-hulled monocoque construct that the Bushmaster is , except with a tray on the back and doors on the side - where on earth did you get the idea that it was otherwise ? ?
