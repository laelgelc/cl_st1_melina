Placing a strong emphasis on skills development is critical to support the competitiveness of existing firms by enhancing their capabilities and increasing productivity growth . It is also essential to keep unemployed workers close to the labour market and help prevent the drift to long term unemployment . <p> The main policy priorities are : <p> Targeting education and training funding to meet the future skills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ identified skills deficits in key areas .

While recent increases in the number of activation and training places are welcome , the nature and quality of the retraining options available remain an issue ; and <p> Fostering innovation at all levels of economic activity and prioritising publicly funded R&amp;D programmes which have strong industry relevance and participation as well as sustaining Ireland 's increasingly good reputation for research quality . <p> Reduce the Costs of Doing Business : The costs of doing business in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ priority actions include : <p> Limited competition in locally traded sectors of the economy , particularly in the professions , has serious implications for the costs of doing business in Ireland .

In addition , the State should use its purchasing power to exert downward pressure on professional fees ; <p> The price of land and property in Ireland needs to adjust to the levels justified by their underlying potential for adding value or earning rent . The tax treatment of property should also be changed to limit future housing boom and bust cycles , in particular , the proposal to introduce an annual value based property tax should be advanced quickly .

However , clear prioritisation and lower cost delivery can offset some of the impact of reduced budgets . The priorities include the following : <p> It is vital that the infrastructure projects likely to have greatest impact in terms of attracting overseas investment and supporting firms in Ireland to compete successfully are front-loaded . Given the central role that Dublin and our other main cities play in driving national competitiveness , the re-prioritisation of capital expenditure should focus resources on their development ; <p> In particular , access to high quality , resilient and competitively priced advanced broadband in key regional centres is required to support the smart economy and to enable our main exporting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , tourism , international education services ) to retain current levels of trading and to enable them to exploit future growth opportunities .

Addressing specific policy and regulatory barriers can promote more efficient State investment ( e.g. the establishment of a national water authority ) and greater private sector investment ( e.g. greater regulatory certainty in the waste market ) . <p> Tackle the Macro Issues : Continued action is required to ensure credit is channelled to viable businesses and to restore the sustainability of the public finances . The NCC believes that broadening the tax base is central to repairing the public finances .

Professionally trained inspectors pay their way , book under aliases and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , service and ambience . <p> " They are trained to notice every detail and to go unnoticed doing it , " Michelin says . A single star indicates a " very good restaurant in its cate- gory " . Two stars denote " excellent cooking , worth a detour " . Three stars signal " exceptional cuisine , worth a journey " . <p> While Michelin 's elitism ( it favours French haute cuisine ) may not appeal to Joe Public in a recession , its stars still matter hugely to chefs . <p> Simply put , these are the culinary Oscars . Winning a star is a triumph , losing one a humiliation . Famously , in 2003 , French chef Bernard Loiseau committed suicide when his restaurant , Le C ? te d'Or , looked in danger of losing its three-star rating . <p> " There are a lot of people that come and inspect you for various awards , " says Cliff House general manager , Adriaan Bartels . " But ( Michelin ) are the ones we take most seriously because a ) you do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and b ) they ask you not to broadcast or advertise the fact that you have a Michelin star . . . in our world , they mean business . " <p> While a star brings publicity , it can not guarantee success . Fine dining is costly to produce , consumers view Michelin establishments as expensive , and these are hellish times for an industry the Irish Hotels Federation itself describes as " insolvent " . <p> Mint in Ranelagh closed shortly after winning Dylan McGrath his first Michelin star . On the hotels front , the Park in Kenmare , Co Kerry , was stripped of its star in 2000 , and Sheen Falls Lodge in Kerry -- which Bartels previously managed -- won and lost a Michelin star in the 1990s . <p> " I know exactly what ( losing a star ) is like , " Bartels said . " It 's awful . Look , every January 20 we 're going to have a nervous time finding out whether we kept it or lost it , but if we believe in ourselves . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Currently , the table d'h ? te menu at the House Restaurant costs ? 65 .

Prices are similar across Ireland 's other one-star restaurants ( with the exception of Bon App ? tit in Malahide , which does a table d'h ? te menu for ? 55 , and Deane 's in Belfast , where the sterling exchange benefits euro customers ) . <p> A market remains for high-end hospitality , Bartels insists . Taken in its totality , he says , the Cliff House represents good value . <p> " We 're trying to stand out a bit , and the star helps that , particularly because we 're the only hotel in Ireland to have one , and the only establishment outside Dublin . " <p> The star also comes as a boost for the hotel 's owner , Barry O'Callaghan , who last week said he lost " hundreds of millions " after financial restructuring at his Education and Media Publishing Group ( EPMG ) reduced his 21pc shareholding to zero . <p> Asked whether any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a spokesperson for the O'Callaghan family confirmed there was " no connection between the restructuring of EMPG and the Cliff House , which is owned by the family " . <p> As for Kajuiter -- the 35-year-old Dutchman who worked with the likes of Marco Pierre White before bringing the Michelin magic to Waterford -- he is in little doubt as to the mix of opportunities and challenges ahead . <p> " I always say that there is only one professional measurement which counts and that is Michelin ; they have respect for chefs and restaurants in a way that they do n't want to push you in a box , nor do they want to dictate the product . They keep it simple -- you either have it or you do n't , nothing in-between -- I like that approach . "

Eibhear Walshe , although an academic , is a natural storyteller , but his book is also a record of his profound love for his grandmother Cissie , a woman of colourful theatricality . Dr Walshe says that she " performed " her life , enjoying in an almost Wildean way the personal and financial risks she took and demonstrating that even in the grim 1950s in provincial Ireland " survival through style " was a possibility . <p> The author has a very sharp eye for social situations . He displays a ruthless honesty in detailing even unsavoury aspects of life such as the gory reality of the abbattoir of the title . He has an ear for telling sayings such as Cissie 's description of her own mother 's stinginess : " She could peel an orange in her pocket " . <p> It is clear that Eibhear Walshe adored his grandmother but his is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the contrivance of the mask .

Not only the inmates but also their keepers were double-locked in at night . That was before health and safety guidelines . <p> The atmosphere of the madhouse is wonderfully caught , with a poignancy that is almost painful in the description of the infliction of a performance of Chekhov 's Cherry Orchard upon the inmates . They regarded the play with disinterest until the old servant Firs is accidentally locked away in the empty house . At this , a suspiration of misery was emitted in empathy with the fate of their brother victim .

He said Celine " accused me of being a bad father to ( their daughter ) and that really annoyed me " .

His shoulders heaving with emotion , he struggled for breath as the painful words continued to wash over him . <p> Lillis said they agreed they would explain their injuries to their daughter by telling her a story about an intruder , so he immediately went to set the scene to make it look as if a burglar had been there .

Even after he dialled 999 , administered CPR and saw Celine being rushed off in an ambulance , he always believed her injuries were n't serious and that she would be " okay " . <p> PANIC <p> Later , in cross-examination , Lillis was asked to explain his lies about the incident . <p> " I felt completely and utterly trapped " , he said . " I 'm truly , truly sorry , but I felt trapped by it . I could n't see any way out of it .

The second began in 1997 . <p> While Ministers are happy to see bankers take the heat for bringing ruin to the economy , through use of the legal process , it would be bizarre if for the second time in a generation , political leaders will not face judgment day on monumental mismanagement . However , could the Irish public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Director of Public Prosecutions ) ? <p> In 1978 , a public spending fuelled boom in Ireland resulted in a budget deficit of 17.6 per cent of GDP ( gross domestic product ) - - a record for developed countries according to the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) , for the period 1970-2008 . Between 1977 and 1982 , the combination of tax cuts and huge spending increases ( in the single year of 1979 , the public service pay bill was increased by 34 per cent ) , resulted in a trebling of the National Debt . The debt has more than doubled since 2007 and we are on course for a treble again . <p> Political leaders could plead good intentions , incompetence or over-optimism on many issues but the issue of benchmarking had a direct cash cost and the public body that recommended an average special increase of 8.9% for ministers , TDs , other public staff and all public service pensioners , " strongly " recommended that 75 per cent of the payment be withheld until agreement was reached on how " real outputs " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appropriate validation process " be established to ensure that agreements on issues such as adaptability , change , flexibility and modernisation were implemented in accordance with their terms . <p> Eight years ago , the cost was estimated at ? 1 billion annually and in recent years rose to about ? 2 billion . So the money was paid and discussion continues with trade unions on how talks could begin on delivering the " real outputs , " a decade late . <p> The unions have launched a campaign of public service disruption to reverse the public pay cuts in last December 's Budget but apart from the original basis of linking the payment to reform , the alternative argument that payment was made to close a claimed gap between public and private sector pay , has been shown to have no validity . <p> The Public Service Benchmarking Body ( PSBB ) was established in July 2000 to undertake a fundamental examination of the pay of public service employees vis- ? -vis the private sector . It recommended what it termed " a range of pay increases , linked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The benchmarking report pdf was published in June 2002 and while the services of nine " major " Irish and international consultancies were used to advise and carry out research , the Minister for Finance , Charlie Mc McCreevy , did not allow publication of data used . <p> The Minister said on publication that : " An initial assessment suggests that full implementation of the recommendations in the report would give rise to a full year cost of over ? 1 billion in current terms . The budgetary implications of this would be significant and are a factor to which regard will have to be had in any discussions with the public service unions on the implementation of the report . " <p> In November 2003 , McCreevy said in a speech : " while the Government is committed to honouring benchmarking , I would like to stress that the payments are dependent on compliance with the terms of the agreement .

Instead , it provided a generalised rationale for its corpus of recommendations that echoed its terms of reference and cited a number of broad considerations . At no stage therefore did the PSBB indicate that its pay recommendations , either in general or in particular , arose because of a pay gap between the public and private sectors and the perceived need to bridge such a gap .

" <p> Also in the ESRI paper , the NUI Maynooth economists , including Jim O'Leary who had resigned from the PSBB before publication of its report , provided the results of research on public-private sector pay differentials in Ireland during the 1994-2001 period and a comparison with international experience . <p> In the year 2001 the public pay premium was 46 per cent when measured in terms of average gross monthly earnings . <p> Using ESRI data , when differences in productivity-related personal attributes and job characteristics were controlled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not significantly changed from 1994 . <p> The 13 per cent premium for 2001 , compared with corresponding estimates in the range 4-6 per cent for France , Italy and the UK , using 1998 data ( the Irish estimate for 1998 was also around 13 per cent ) . <p> The attitude of " do n't confuse us with the facts " is often common in Irish public discourse . <p> In The Irish Times last October , journalist Kathy Sheridan recounts how former Taoiseach Bertie Ahern produced a Central Statistics Office ( CSO ) study , which he claimed shows that national pay agreements between 1997 and 2009 left the private sector ahead by 10 per cent . " So the 9 per cent from benchmarking simply bridged the gap . That 's all . ' So I do n't know what they 're talking about , ' he says , mystified .

It is about the reckless use of public funds and the inability of the Government today to make a case that it should n't have paid for what it did n't get . <p> The Budget public sector pay cuts were only a partial clawback of the billions of euros of payments that should n't have been made . <p> The PSBB said its conclusions on withholding 75 per cent of the payment until " real outputs " were determined and a system for " validation " had been put in place , were to be taken as " integral parts of the recommendations on pay .

@@1427237 <h> David McWilliams : Hometown fightback : it 's time to get the ball rolling <p> I walked by the barbers in Dalkey yesterday and for a split second I was back in the mid-1970s . I was once again the little boy with the flaming red hair , short pants and freckles looking up at the kind barber . The boy had a dilemma and the barber was the only person in the whole world who could solve it . <p> Most importantly , everyone in Dalkey knew that Dom McClure understood hair and his magic hair oil could turn my red hair black so that no one in school would ever call me rusty , redser or jaffahead again . Dom was not just a barber , he was my saviour and through Dom I would be redeemed . He promised that by the time I was 10 , I 'd be jet black . I believed him . <p> As usual , when I peeked into the shop on a Saturday morning , Dom put on his best Scottish accent which he called " Scotch " , gently mocking my grandfather who came from Scotland to Dalkey in the 1920s . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scotch accents " . <p> Back then , Dom had a plank that he 'd place carefully across the arms of the barber 's chair so a young fella could sit up and see himself in the yellowed mirror . I loved the barber , the smell of the hair oil , the wireless in the corner , the copies of the Irish Independent and the football talk . I felt like this was my entree into the world of men . And Dom conferred status on me by handing over the huge brush to sweep up the hair . <p> The barber , like the grocer , the draper and pub were part of the community and this was where people came to chat and keep up-to-date with what was going on in the town . A few doors up from the barber -- which is still thriving -- my grandfather had a sign-writing shop but he had one fatal flaw as a businessman : he did n't like asking people for money . He went bust in the 1950s , bequeathing me a life-long affinity with struggling traders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ haunting the businesses of the town . If any small town loses its shops and businesses , it loses what makes the place special . Over the years , people have moved into Dalkey because of its special atmosphere , because it is a living and working town with a community at its core . This could be lost in this recession . <p> To see how one closure leads to another , you only have to look at the many English villages and towns where there are actually no shops with the exception of one or two chainstores on the outskirts . It is essential to a town 's life , atmosphere and community that it survives as a trading hub with its own ecosystem . And for that ecosystem to survive , it needs cobblers and chippers as much as it does boutiques and bars . <p> The ' Dalkey dilemma ' is valid in any town in Ireland . If the heart of the town is thriving or at least surviving , the community can flourish . But , like many towns in Ireland now , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In fact , many are barely staying open . In the past 12 months , 10 local businesses have closed down and some traders are saying they are only months away from closure . In fact , the post office on dole day is the only shop with a queue in it . Last Tuesday , the queue was out the door . <p> This is what the credit crunch means in reality . Small businesses which are the backbone of our economy are being hammered by the banks tightening credit while costs remain stubbornly high . All the while , we the customers -- aware of the dole queues -- are keeping our hands in our pockets and postponing spending because , as prices fall , there are better bargains to be had . <p> But when a small business closes it does n't open again in a hurry and something is lost . The lifeblood of any town -- whether it is Dalkey or Drogheda , Listowel or Lahinch -- is the vibrancy of the local shops . If this goes , the town dies . And towns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as follows . One or two businesses go bust and then their premises come up for rent . The empty premises decline , become shoddy and this puts off new players who are worried about passing trade . Rents might n't move because the landlords are in trouble and do n't want to admit that they have to mark down the value of their portfolio . The banks get worried and cut back credit . People sense this and a little bit of the town 's spark ebbs away . Unless someone shouts stop , this process can become self-fulfilling . <p> Last night the traders of Dalkey shouted stop and they held an extraordinary meeting in the town hall of small businesses , shopkeepers , hairdressers , pub owners , restaur- ateurs , butchers , the local guards , the hotelier and even the local bank manager . The organisers expected about a dozen people to turn up -- close to a hundred came . <p> The local traders have decided that there is little point waiting for the recovery ; you have to make it happen . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have to do something for yourself . <p> The most exciting aspect of last night 's meeting was the pride everyone had in the place and the absolute intention of not letting one more business go to the wall . <p> The first part of the local fightback is to try to get a few more locals to spend a bit more in the town rather than spend it elsewhere . It is not about huge gestures , just small things -- like maybe a loyalty card for shopping locally . The traders told me that the town was packed during the January snow when local people could n't drive to the bigger shops out of the town . <p> If every day we could get one of these local people who normally head out to one of the big supermarkets to stay and shop locally , the difference would be incremental but enormous . All over Ireland , traders are facing the same problem . How do they stay open first and secondly how do they expand ? Most of us realise these dilemmas exist but usually we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then a shop closes and we comment on its passing but do nothing and do n't see that it is our spending power , however modest , that is the key . Then the next goes to the wall but we do n't act and on it goes until one day the knock comes to your door , the reality comes home to you and you are made redundant and guess what , no one comes to your aid . <p> To prevent this from happening , it is essential that communities in Ireland come together in the recession . So many towns in our country have so much to offer in terms of festivals , tourism or one-off events . This is the way communities are re-built . I saw the energy in my own home town last night . This can be repeated everywhere all over the country . This is the opportunity in this crisis , the opportunity to come together .

Let me use that sentence again . <p> They are doing just that over the thatched roof as I write . And they are reminding me that they have been tweeting for far longer than this digital generation has been at it . <p> The sight of them over my life always touches me more deeply than anything else in nature , nowayears a small bit more poignantly since I know I 've seen them return to this Emerald Isle far more often than I will see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinking . <p> The important point is that they are back , flitting across the faces of brighter and warmer suns . And I will surely hear the cuckoo any day now.I met him today actually . I 'm talking about Cuckoo Noonan the mechanic . <p> I know him now for about the decade I 've been in Clare and I have not an idea what his proper Christian name is . It does not matter at all either because Cuckoo is among the minority of nicknamed Irishmen to whom you can use the nickname directly . <p> Ironically given the paragraph above I know one man widely known as Swallow who probably does not know that is his nickname . I know how he got it too . <p> His photograph appeared in the local paper about 30 years ago when he was in his youth . He was best man at a formal wedding and had to wear a swallow-tail coat . <p> He 's a short man , the coat was not a good fit , the tail was trailing the ground all day and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind his back . When you are speaking to his face you call him Christopher . <p> But back to Cuckoo Noonan the mechanic . I admire him hugely , not because he is good at his trade and rescued me once from a raining roadside breakdown . <p> Mostly I admire his precise and colorful deployment of the Queen 's English as spoken ( and improved ) by the Irish . Nobody can use English as precisely as Cuckoo because he has his very own system for catching the qualities of men and women , accurately , in a single sentence and , often enough , in a single word . <p> That takes some doing but Cuckoo 's system is perfect . <p> What he does , in synopsis , is apply the good and bad features of motor cars and trucks and vans to human beings . It works to perfection . <p> When we were talking this afternoon , for example , I mentioned the sudden passing of a decent farmer at the other end of the parish the previous night . <p> " He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meaning that our neighbor had been reliable , dependable , quiet , nothing showy about him at all . <p> And later on in the chat , when I mentioned a young wild lad who had gotten himself into a fight on Saturday night , Cuckoo said , " He 's a Hiace , like all of them . " <p> Over here the Hiace van is often associated with the small section of the traveling people who are no strangers to trouble and petty crime . It may be an unfair and unjustified connection , but it exists in the language . <p> Cuckoo has a brand for men and women of all ages . Young lads sowing their wild oats but of respectable stock are Hondas . <p> Decent farmers , as we 've heard , are Fords , beautiful flighty young women are either Fiestas or Citreons , commercial folk are likely to be called Opels or Peugeots , doctors are BMWs or Volvos , school teachers , if he likes them , are Saabs ; if not they are Fiats , a brand for which Cuckoo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( his party ) are Mercedes Benz models . All other politicians are Renaults , and about all foreigners are Volkswagens.The list is long , and when you relate your own knowledge of the person Cuckoo speaks of to the brand he applies to them it is deadly accurate . <p> He uses the names of trucks and construction plants too where applicable . He 's a great man for following Gaelic football , for example , and still says that the mighty Kerryman Paidi O'Se was a JCB , and he describes the non-stop Tyrone player Brian Dooher as a Land Rover . <p> I think if I knew more about cars and trucks than I do then I would understand the nuances of his comments even more richly . But any chat with Cuckoo is both stimulating and enjoyable . <p> He has not been in the chapel for years , and he describes all priests and bishops as Ladas , for whatever that is worth or whatever significance it has . <p> On his unique scale Michael Collins was a Bentley but de Valera was a Rolls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is your President Obama ! <p> Since I am not a native of this parish and , furthermore , originally from the North , I rather fancy I 'm an old Volkswagen !

I 'll do that one of these fine early summer days and fervently hope that I 'm neither a Lada nor a Hiace on the scale . <p> In the meantime the swallows are back and the days are bright . <p> Can I please finish up now and head down to The Honk for a late pint with a couple of Fords and an Opel ?

@@1452237 <h> Are the Irish still white ? <p> This past St. Patrick 's Day , TV viewers were treated to a strange sight on The Colbert Report , Comedy Central 's late night satire show . <p> Host Stephen Colbert , who never misses an opportunity to remind viewers of his Irish roots , was interviewing a very professorial African American woman . Or at least she appeared to be African American . <p> But when Colbert noted , with mock seriousness , that he does n't " see race , " he asked her if she was , indeed , African American . <p> " I do n't know , " Colbert 's guest said . " I have a Ph.D . Am I white ? " <p> From there the interview got even stranger . Colbert ranted and raved about Cromwell and Northern Ireland and how the Scotch-Irish " do not have one ounce of Irish blood . " <p> In the end , Colbert and his guest arm wrestled . <p> The reason for all of this silly banter was that Colbert 's guest , Princeton professor Nell Irvin Painter , has written a new book called The History of White @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the painful process of Irish assimilation into the American mainstream in the wake of the Irish Famine . <p> " What really surprised me at first was the level of hatred that people I thought of as white directed at other people I thought of as white , " Painter said in a recently published interview . <p> " So the amount of hatred directed toward the Irish immigrants in the middle of the 19th century , I -- coming out of straight U.S. history -- I thought of those Irish people as people who beat up other people . <p> " That 's a dumb way of saying it , but that 's how poor Irish people figure into the general history of the U.S. " <p> Give Painter credit for her honesty . The basic argument she is making is that race is basically a fake category . Religion is a choice you make based on faith or birth . <p> Ethnicity generally refers to the nation you hail from . But race ? <p> Well , sure , by now we believe it is based on skin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> In fact , the Irish and their famously white skin were , for a very long time , not allowed to enter the exclusive white club in America . <p> Blacks , of course , were lowest on the racial ladder . Then Jews , Italians and Slavs began coming over in larger numbers and they faced their own discrimination . <p> Painter 's book could very well have been called " How the Irish Became White . " <p> There 's just one problem with that . A book with that exact title was published well over a decade ago . <p> It begs the question -- who knew the Irish were still " thought of as white " ? <p> Okay , so I 'm dabbling in some Colbert-level absurdity here myself . Painter 's book is much broader in scope than How the Irish Became White by Noel Ignatiev . <p> Painter 's book goes all the way back to the Greeks . And sure , as Painter and others argue , if you think about it , race is kind of a hard thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where all kinds of different people intermarry . <p> And yet , something is missing here . Painter , like Noel Ignatiev before her , acknowledges that the Irish initially had a horrible time in America . <p> But you get the sense that once they were finally allowed into the country club , they did n't just become white . That 's all they became . <p> Irish American novelist Peter Quinn dealt with these issues admirably in a 1996 essay entitled " How the Irish Stayed Irish . " <p> If the Irish essentially became cozy WASPS as the 19th century wore on , how on Earth can you explain this group 's century-long obsession with liberating the nation they left behind ? <p> How do you explain their construction of what amounts to a separate Irish Catholic nation in America , where you grow up in vast cities such as New York or Boston , and yet , from the cradle to the grave , define yourself mainly by the people and particularities of your parish . <p> Then again , Painter 's index for The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but not Quinn 's essay . <p> Oh well .

@@1452240 <p> Five years ago , 5,000 cars a year were being sold under Merlin 's hammer . This year , that figure is likely to come in at more than 62,000 . <p> The surge in activity comes as the overall motor industry languishes in brutal trading conditions which saw a record 58 dealerships go to the wall last year . <p> Ironically , the tough economic climate that forced those dealerships to pull down the shutters is a big part of what 's driving Merlin 's growth . <p> " From the start of 2007 , we 've seen a steady increase in the number of repossessions coming to us for auction , " says Merlin Car Auction boss David Byrne . <p> " Every major bank in the country is dealing with us now to dispose of their assets . " <p> The " assets " in question are everything from sporty little numbers to luxury saloons to commercial vans to the humble second family car no longer deemed a necessity . <p> The banks and finance houses bring them to Merlin for a speedy and public sale . Cars coming in on a Monday can go under the hammer that Wednesday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The cars are offered to the 1,000-plus buyers that crowd Merlin 's forecourts in Naas and the Kylemore Road in Dublin several times a week , as well as online bidders . <p> For its troubles , Merlin gets a ? 140 to ? 180 handling fee to cover engineers ' reports and pre-sale preparation , as well as 5pc of the car 's value to a maximum of ? 600 . <p> " It 's a win-win for everybody , " says Mr Byrne . " The banks get their money quickly and private individuals can come along and buy cars at trade prices . " <p> The surge in repossessions is n't the only thing which is driving Merlin 's recessionary boom , as struggling dealers in need of cash submit some of their stock to the auction house . <p> Then there is the increasingly auction-friendly public . On the buyer side , Mr Byrne says people are moving away from " going to the dealer around the corner because it 's what they always did " and are instead seeking out value . <p> Keen to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been actively pushing the value credentials of its auctions with ad campaigns , while a YouTube video demystifies the auction process by portraying it as " child 's play " . <p> Cash-strapped punters selling cars also help keep Merlin 's wheels spinning round . Last summer , the auction house began a nationwide tour of a " cash for cars " scheme that allows sellers to hand over their car to Merlin and get paid on the spot . <p> The tour began with Merlin 's van pitching up in the main urban centres like Cork and Dublin . Then , Mr Byrne 's team became more discerning . <p> " We looked at smaller towns where there were high levels of unemployment , where people needed cash flow , " he says unapologetically . <p> " We are the only avenue where you can walk in to us on a given day with your car and its papers and we 'll give you cash on the spot . " <p> The touring Merlin operation can buy " 30 , 40 , 50 " cars in a day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " building the credibility of auctions " . <p> " The idea is n't to make a profit on the car , it 's to put the car through auction at what we paid for it , " says Mr Byrne . " Our business is fees and volume . " <p> As well as helping Merlin 's top line , the recession has also given the auction division the opportunity to work on its costs . Light and heating bills are down 20pc after a recent move to Airtricity and the firm hopes to shave 40pc off its ? 250,000 transport bill this year , capitalising on the " competitiveness " in the transport market . <p> While the recessionary tide has undoubtedly lifted Merlin 's boat , the auctions ' growth has also been the result of substantial planning and investment . <p> In 2005 , when its regular motor dealership Merlin Motors was still doing a booming trade , the Merlin group decided to expand the auction operations . <p> " We distinguished that what went up had to go down , " says Mr Byrne . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we knew if the economy ever did slip we would see an influx in the level of surrenders going through public auction . " <p> With that bigger future in mind , Merlin decided its auction business needed to relocate from its modest home in Ashbourne , Co Meath , which could hold about 350 cars . A site in Naas was secured , and ? 20m was invested in a state-of-the-art , under-canopy auction centre that could hold up to 1,000 cars . Naas opened in 2007 , just as the repossessions curve began to tip upwards . Merlin then went on to launch a second auctions site on the Kylemore Road , where Merlin Motors already had a traditional dealership . <p> The two sites quickly built up to four auctions a week , offering both evening and weekend timeslots to attract maximum attendance . To heighten the buzz around auctions and secure more specialised sales , Merlin has also launched " themed " events , covering everything from prestige sales , liquidation sales , Japanese auctions , motor bike auctions and vintage auctions . <p> " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Byrne . " We had a Bentley in a prestige auction lately that cost ? 300,000 new and went for ? 60,000 . That generated a lot of attention . " <p> An online system that allows full participation in car auctions , the first of its kind in the UK and Ireland , has also helped Merlin to expand its hinterland and buyers are now coming from all over the country and the UK . <p> More recently , Merlin also diversified into the Corporate Services market , encouraging the big insolvency firms to use Merlin for auctioning more than just cars . <p> " We had a plant equipment and machinery auction a few weeks ago and that went really well , " says Mr Byrne . " We are new to that market . We would n't see ourselves as one of the main players but it is something we 're keen to grow in . " <p> A new and improved website will be launched at the end of the month . Merlin is also keen to grow its geographical footprint " in the near future @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The sum of all those efforts means Merlin believes it will sell ? 75m worth of cars this year , well up on the ? 52m worth sold in 2009 , as weekly auction rates come in around the 1,200 to 1,300 mark . The 2011 target is for 1,500 cars to be sold at auction each week , as the Irish public converts to the concept and develops a love of auctions that will endure beyond the recession .

Yep , Tara - miss " to be totally honest , at the end of the day , I 'm basically 100% " breathless ( honestly she sounds like she 's just ran from the icecream van to tell her mammy " **31;121;TOOLONG *gasps* **49;154;TOOLONG *gasps* andabottleofpopandsoon " ) - thought she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a viral was a TV ad but on the internet .

Her version of " Oh Holy Night " , a personal favorite and a real test of a vocalist was a standout . Throw in her bodhran , whistle and even washboard skills and you have to say that Cherish the Ladies received one Christmas gift early in adding Connolly to the cast . <p> When given the opportunity to perform on home turf where CTL was formed 25 years ago , Madden usually pulls out all stops for a big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Murray , Boyle , Dan Stacey and now Grainne Murphy ( from Boston ) as the new fiddler in the band replacing Roisin Dillon . Dillon was invited back for a few shows and her double fiddling with Murphy added intensity and continuity that was quadrupled when dancers Stacey and Jon Pilatzke took up their fiddles . It was one of the highlights when the entire cast of 16 including six other dancers from the Donny Golden School who made up the chorus for Madden 's Christmas Party piece " Rise up Shepherd and Follow " where she sings the lead vocals and the others followed in a rollicking Appalachian musical arrangement for the African spiritual that she and Coogan re-crafted . ( This is where the washboard came in played by Connolly who is no stranger to country music either ) . <p> Early on Cherish learned that dancing is an integral part of their stage performance and an easy alliance with the Golden School assured that the very best performing dancers tutored by the Brooklyn Dance Master would be showcased at their shows . So Madden called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Melanie Deegan , Ciara Greene and Cara Butler to join forces once again to feature Irish step dancing at its finest and liveliest in keeping with the Cherish style for this opening New York show . Even though space was very tight on stage especially when joined by the free-wheeling Ottawa Valley step stylists Stacey and Pilatzke , these seasoned dancers gave a very impressive performance all concert long . <p> Canadian artists like Stacey and Pilatzke who are also great fiddlers drawing from their own similar traditions in Ottawa , Quebec and the Maritimes , have given worthy exposure to the music and dance from our Northern neighbor . In the show the fiddle duet by Stacey and Pilatzke for the tunes " Rosebud of Allenvale ( J. Scott Skinner ) and Bird in the Bush ( a Jean Carignan fiddle classic ) jokingly referred to as being played in the " key of A " for that common Canadianism showed off their musical skills and kinship . It also readily leads into a percussive dance routine joined by Butler and Dwyer who are also part of " Step @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with some other dancers that went over very well with the Tarrytown audience . And speaking of percussion , little brother John Madden who often played with the old man , box-player Joe Madden and Joanie for the Clare dances was worked into the act on the drums . <p> Not to be overlooked in the Cherish show are the tremendous musical arrangements that the whole production is centered around . Standing out this night were Kathleen Boyle 's composition " The Homecoming " played on a grand piano that lovingly invoked the sentiment aroused by the recent return home to Donegal by Boyle 's parents who retired there . Madden also always finds a place for one of her lovely airs that usually come with a colorful and comedic preface drawn upon her own actual experiences . On this night her " Waves of Kilkee " was featured inspired by an unexpected early dawn visit to the West Clare town as the wild Atlantic surged upon the strand , not far from the Loophead roots of her producer and fellow composer Brian Keane one stormy St. Stephen 's Day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ combining the sublime and the ridiculous are what makes her such a respected artist . <p> Her reading of poet Patrick Kavanagh 's " A Christmas Childhood " while guitarist Coogan strummed the madrigal " In the Bleak Midwinter " still grabs the heartstrings when she poignantly -- and tearfully -- reads the lines " My father played the melodeon outside of our gate ; There were stars in the morning east and they danced to his music " . Even in the joys of Christmas , the heart grows sad when we think of those no longer around to share the occasion like Joanie 's dad , Joe Madden , now two years gone from us . But we are grateful for having an abundance of music and dance thanks to Cherish the Ladies in this season or anytime of the year and we wish them another 25 memorable years .

@@1744238 <h> FIFA , the U.K , Russia and the World Cup bids : $25 million does n't get you much these days <p> It has been a few days now since FIFA 's considerably shocking decision to award the 2018 World Cup to Russia over , amongst others , England and a joint Spanish/Portuguese bid . <p> With the smoke clearing and the dust settling , what stands out most is the incredible arrogance FIFA is displaying in light of the overwhelming evidence against it in terms of serious corruption . <p> First off , the below is only going to tackle the 2018 World Cup in detail , do n't even get us started on 2022 , which was awarded to Qatar . How FIFA came to the decision to award this hallowed tournament to a country that has serious questions to answer in terms of human rights abuses is a mystery ( slavery , for example , is pretty much encouraged amongst the Qatari elite ) . Their decision is also mind boggling in that the main sponsor of the World Cup is an over rated alcoholic beverage , and yet in Qatar it is against the law to drink in public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Completely illogical . However , for now , we are n't touching the whole Qatar question . <p> There is a huge amount of written material emanating from this horrible mess , however at its core it is a depressingly simple tale to tell . FIFA is incredibly corrupt , and Russia was able to key in on that in order to win the rights to host the World Cup in 2018 . <p> There are a also myriad of interesting side notes . The English media reaction , the expos ? of the complicated and completely flawed FIFA voting system , just how corrupt and racist Russia is and finally the disgusting waste of hundreds of millions of euros on the process . <p> To start , calling FIFA corrupt is like saying ' Ireland currently has some financial issues ' . FIFA may be the most relatively corrupt organisation known to man , in terms of size , number of members and levels of corruption . <p> It all starts from the top <p> Many in the UK in particular seem shocked at the sheer scale of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rung at an early stage of the whole assignment process . For example when FIFA demanded an exemption from a key element of UK money-laundering legislation as part of the government guarantees required in relation to the England 2018 bid . Um , did anybody notice this when the bid process started ? Kind of a red flag , no ? <p> According to an expert in sports administration , Mr. Mihir Bose , Sepp Blatter the vainglorious FIFA president , sees his organisation as ; ' ' the Vatican of sport and himself as a head of state " . He goes on to note that the professional staff in Zurich are competent and trustworthy ; <p> " but it 's the ( executive ) committee members that are the problem . They are treated like gods . They fly everywhere first class , stay in five-star hotels , receive $150,000 retainers just for attending meetings and $500 a day expenses . They live in another universe . " <p> Remember , that 's the executive committee members . The leaders of the pack . FIFA 's brightest and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the very top , FIFA vice-president Jack Warner . Warner is the subject of accusations that he ordered 2010 World Cup tickets costing $84,240 from the FIFA ticket office , but the deal subsequently fell through . He had previously been admonished by FIFA 's ethics committee over ticket deals for the 2006 tournament and has faced a host of other allegations of impropriety . Ladies and gentlemen , your FIFA vice-president . <p> How about executive Committee member Amos Adamu -- caught in the famous Panorama bribery sting four months after telling colleagues facing separate fraud charges how they should behave . " The public sees every football administrator as corrupt , and I can not explain why it is so . We must always be transparent to prove them wrong ! " Apparently Amos is good at giving advice , just not great at actually following it himself . <p> How about the hungriest man in world football , FIFA executive Vitaly Mutko . A couple of weeks ago Mutko launched into an angry tirade against the worlds media , saying ; " No matter what we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corruption . It is not true . " Later that same week : Russian authorities launch a criminal investigation into alleged fraud at Mutko 's ministry , including Mutko 's own expenses claim for 97 breakfasts eaten during a 20-day trip to Vancouver . Total cost for 20 days breakfasts ? $4,500 . That 's a lot of sausages . Each night in his hotel was charged at $1,499 . In total , Mutko is said to have spent twelve times his official limit <p> Mutko - a man who is keen for the occasional sausage <p> We are talking here about senior members of FIFA 's executive committee . Not some scrubs , toiling in the backwaters for pennies , people you may not completely resent scrounging out a few pennies . These fat , self serving , corrupt and incredibly arrogant bastards are globe trotting on massive expense accounts flying first class and spending $4,500 on breakfasts for a month . <p> What happens when anyone decides to try and blow the whistle on this disgraceful sham of a lifestyle being enjoyed by FIFA 's jet setting elite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light on the situation back in 2002 , accusing Blatter of mismanagement . His position on the executive was terminated immediately . Big Sepp does n't take criticism lying down . In fact , he does n't take it at all . <p> Sepp swings and misses <p> One of the more comical by products of this ungainly mess is the incredible reaction coming from the self righteous , ' patriotic ' British media ' right ' . Most of the bitter , angry reaction has been railing against the BBC show Panorama and its exposure of FIFA corruption . Surely such investigation was worthy of a pat on the back and a gold star , right ? Wrong . The Sun , that paper of such repute , wrote an open letter to Big Sepp on the eve of the voting , a sniveling , swarthy little ditty , attacking Panorama 's " sabotage " of England 's bid . " Today The Sun makes this plea to Mr Blatter and FIFA : do n't be put off by the BBC 's rehashing of ancient history . Despite BBC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> The beautiful , hilarious irony ? The Sun 's headline the day after the big vote ; " FIXED ! FIFA BUNGS RUSSIA THE WORLD CUP ... Calls for corruption probe ... " -- it would be astronomically hilarious if it was n't so pathetic . <p> Not to be outdone , the Daily Mail had its own theory as to why the English bid failed . Now this gets really nasty . The Mail says the film shown during England 's bid presentation in Zurich was " un-English " , too " multi-cultural " and relied too heavily on " a range of ethnically diverse figures " . The comments section for the same article was a cess-pit of good old fashioned right wing reactionary racism . <p> " It makes me sick when we have this ' multicultural ' rubbish rubbed in our faces " <p> " This country is dying " <p> " You could n't make it up , we Brits have to put up with this nonsense every day " <p> " Fools ! Multi cultural idiots ! ! ! " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speak up " <p> " If only Diana were here to see what this nation has become . " <p> Comments like those serve to remind us all that yes , we did originate from apes . Apparently in some cases we have n't come very far since . <p> The carpet-bombing like media coverage served to expose even the most minute details of the voting system . The over-riding question that remained was , how can a system that promotes corruption , huge financial waste , international fighting and a very dubious result be called a success ? FIFA themselves do n't seem to believe in the system . The whole event hinged on the concept of a two-event , anonymous vote . One vote for the 2018 tournament with solely European bidders , the other for 2022 for the rest of the world . Amazingly , Sepp Blatter commented pre-vote that , in regards the setup they came up with , " You can not avoid collusion . " <p> Perhaps FIFA decided that since they could n't avoid it , they may as well encourage it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arbiter , right ? This task fell to KPMG who acted as an independent " observer " to guarantee the validity and indeed honesty of the vote . The only problem there is FIFA paid KPMG $23 million last year for unspecified " other operating expenses " . Arthur Anderson , anyone ? <p> Just who benefited from all of this ? The Russians , naturally . Before the actual bid process began , Alexei Sorokin , the Russian bid leader came out with some very aggressive comments about one of their main rivals , the UK . He said , and we quote ; " We do not enter into squabbles , although we have much to say . It 's no secret , for example , that in London they have the highest crime rate compared with other European cities , and the highest level of alcohol consumption among young people . " ( Hilarious side note , Russia 's apology after the fact ; " Mr Sorokin regrets if his statements have led to such an erroneous interpretation and understanding . " -- feel better now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of <p> Just a slight hint of irony here , as Russia calling out England on socio-economic issues is something akin to Mussolini chastising Hitler for being ' a little right wing . ' <p> Have you been paying attention to any of the astonishing Wikileak cables ? How about the one regarding Russia , where it described it as " a rampantly corrupt , autocratic kleptocracy " run by a leader who has " amassed a massive secret fortune " by running a " mafia state " based on " personal enrichment , protection for gangsters , extortion and kickbacks , suitcases full of money , a parallel tax system and bribery estimated at $300bn a year " . <p> Sounds not only like a wonderful holiday destination , but also the perfect place to hold the biggest and greatest tournament in the history of the World , no ? <p> anti ( or pro , we 're not sure ) corruption poster in Moscow <p> Not convinced ? Well if Russia ca n't lure you with its toxic levels of corruption , how about its views on minorities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be Moscow and St Petersburg , where Dick Advocaat , the former Zenit manager , confessed he was too scared to sign a black footballer in case the player was rejected and abused by the crowd . UEFA official , Rafal Pankowski , who monitors racist activity at Russian football matches warns that Russia has ignored a surge in race-related incidents around the sport . <p> " Nazi slogans are common in many Russian stadiums . Matches are often interrupted with racist chants aimed at black players . I have been in Moscow this week and seen it for myself . There is racist graffiti in the streets . Major bookshops openly sell racist literature . The hate-crime rate is high . Black people are often beaten up by skinhead gangs " <p> Rafal 's comments are founded in fact ; Russia has some of the highest hate crime figures in the world . Statistics from the UN monitoring centre show that 80 people were murdered last year and another 411 wounded . Most of these attacks were racist incidents . They even admit it themselves . More than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and religious intolerance are currently active in Russia , according to the Russian interior ministry . <p> One Russian nationalist was sentenced to life in prison in October for committing 15 racist murders . Vassily Krivets , 22 , and an accomplice had organised a group in 2007 to commit racist murders in Moscow and its suburbs . <p> For a very current , and very real description of just how vile and how embedded Russian racism is , we need look no further than current West Bromwich Albion striker Peter Odemwingie , now banging in goals in the premiership . Peter made the mistake of leaving Russia for England recently , and was treated to a massive banana banner in his last match pre departure . Russian sports agent Vladimir Abramov helpfully explained why this happened ; <p> " Peter is a professional , but that 's in contrast to other Nigerians . They are very insolent , headstrong , and black nationalism is evident in them . When there are more than three Nigerians , watch out : they are n't afraid of anyone . " <p> Super @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Russian football scene . <p> Some other highlights from the same interview with Abromov , one of the biggest football agents in Russia ; * An influx of Nigerians in a city means " drugs , and ultimately Aids " . * " The French national team , in which black players play , has no relationship whatsoever to Europe " . * " Teams should n't have more than one dark-skinned footballer . When there 's more than one they are aggressive . " * Plus : " Look , I am very respectful towards blacks : among them are very good people with whom I have made friends . But Russia is n't ready for them ... That 's the way it is . " <p> Thankfully of course , there is no such thing as racism in FIFA . How about FIFA executive committee member Julio Grondona , who said : " I do not believe a Jew can ever be a referee at that level Argentinian first division because it 's hard work and , you know , Jews do n't like hard work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact , he was promoted to senior vice-president of FIFA . <p> I guess we should be happy Vassily Krivets actually went to jail . FIFA probably would have promoted him . <p> Finally , money . Five countries , or five combinations of countries made bids to host the 2018 World Cup . Each country spent about $25 million putting their bids to FIFA . Probably about $35 million in Russia 's case , if you add in the bribes . England spent their $25 million on salaries for the bid staff , the bid book itself actually cost $3 million to put together , inspection preparations and substantial travel and accommodation costs took care of the rest . We can only assume the bid book was cast in a cover of pure gold , and made coffee for you while you read it . Not that instant crap either , fancy Columbian coffee . <p> You could estimate approximately $125 million was spent simply bidding for the chance to host the 2018 World Cup . Simply unbelievable . What a gargantuan waste of cash on bidding for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mans game ' . <p> The answer ? Rip it all up and start again . FIFA itself ? No , no point tackling that , but you could start small and meaningful , by tearing down the insane voting process for assigning future World Cups , and putting something superior in place . Given a blank canvas , you could paint any kind of imaginative , fair and useful picture . Why not structure it all around youth football in impoverished nations ? Whoever comes up with the best plan to create a self sustaining and successful soccer program in an impoverished location gets the tournament . Pour all that wasted money , time and effort into youth football . <p> Barcelona are not just a wonderful team for the beautiful football they play , while most other clubs carry swarthy commercial logos on their jerseys , Barcelona proudly carry the UNICEF slogan , and give all proceeds from team jersey sales to the children 's organisation . <p> FIFA could learn so much from the greatest single club within its own organisation . <p> Will any initiative like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and unsustainable model ? Not a chance . If I was a FIFA executive and I had made a suggestion like the above , I would have already been kicked out the door , with nothing to show for my efforts bar Big Sepp 's size tens imprinted in my backside .

@@1744240 <h> Mark Wahlberg 's ' The Fighter ' delivers a KO punch - SEE VIDEO <p> Chronicling the rise of boxer Irish Micky Ward and the fall and redemption of his half-brother Dickie Ecklund , The Fighter is emerging as the film of the year . Starring Dorchester-born and raised Mark Wahlberg and a nearly unrecognizable Christian Bale , the film is a no holds barred tour through the underside of the American Dream . CAHIR O'DOHERTY reviews the film already hailed by the critics as Oscar bait of the highest order . <p> If you think The Fighter ( the brilliant new film opening on limited release on Friday starring Mark Walhberg and Christian Bale ) will just be one more retread of Rocky you have a surprise in store -- Sylvester Stallone never made a film this affecting or this raw . <p> Based on the true-life story of Lowell , Massachusetts boxing champion Irish Micky Ward , at first glance the plot looks like an all-too familiar outsider chasing the American Dream tale . But thanks to a tight script , flawless direction and some career-best performances from the cast , The Fighter actually turns out to be much better than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the true life Irish American boxing hero who keeps missing his opportunity to advance to the big leagues . There 's a good reason for that -- he 's managed by own mother , with all the conflicts that come with it . <p> And he 's completely overshadowed by his half-brother Dickie ( Bale ) , the once upon a time golden boy who went the distance against Sugar Ray Leonard before morphing into a directionless crack addict . As raw deals go , Micky 's working with one the one of the worst of them . <p> Wahlberg , who shot to fame in the early 1990s as the rapper Marky Mark , and who was born and raised in the Irish stronghold of Dorchester in Boston , has never been better in a role , but the film 's emotional center ( and its Oscar hopes ) belong to Bale and Amy Adams , both of whom are sensational throughout . <p> In particular Bale , most famous for his Batman roles , will be unrecognizable to his many fans . In The Fighter he 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned an emaciated crack addict ( his facial wasting is so pronounced that you actually worry about his health ) . It 's hard to think of another actor in recent years who has shown this kind of dedication to a role , or undergone this kind of drastic transformation . <p> And Adams more than holds her own here too . Dirtying up her good girl image ( no more scowling nuns or perky princesses ? ) she plays Charlene Fleming , a been around the block Irish American beauty who 's comfortable being an underachiever until she meets Ward and sees a bright future she never anticipated . The budding romance between the two provides what little sweetness the film offers , and Adams and Wahlberg play their parts flawlessly . <p> But in The Fighter the biggest fights of Micky 's life happen out of the ring in his own family circle . In scene after scene Ward reels from the blows to his heart and soul that are thrown by his own mother and his manipulative older brother , and he does n't find his feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the road to the championship . <p> You can see why this project appealed to Wahlberg . Set in exactly the kind of tough working class Irish American neighborhood he grew up in , The Fighter is a film about two siblings ( who are often rivals ) who have a difficult relationship with their mother . <p> In the film ( and in life ) Dickie was famous before Micky , just as Wahlberg 's older brother Donnie was a star in the pop group New Kids on the Block long before Marky Mark hit the charts . Even the brushes with the law , the trouble with drugs and lives seemingly spiraling out of control are subjects that both the boxer and the actor know intimately . <p> That kind of strong identification with a storyline can lead to an unusual degree of authenticity , and it 's what makes The Fighter so compelling from its opening reel .
