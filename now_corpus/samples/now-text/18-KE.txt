Some women tend to believe that a vagina should be odorless . <p> That is not the truth as a vagina should have a natural , mild and neutral smell . However , sometimes we may experience a strong unpleasant smell coming from down there . <p> This can be embarrassing especially if you do not know what is causing it . It is even more embarrassing opening to another person about your ' little personal problem ' . So many women stick with their smelly ' cookie-jars ' without knowing the cause for fear of judgement and isolation . Here are some of the reasons you may be having a smelly vagina : <p> Bacterial vaginosis <p> The prime culprit of vaginal smell is an infection called bacterial vaginosis .

Signs that you are having BV are a fishy odor from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a burning sensation while urinating or having intercourse . ? <p> Poor feminine hygiene : <p> It is possible that your lady smells because of poor hygiene . Mostly , lack of cleaning down there properly . We know that the groin area sweats a lot . This is because your external genitals have a special kind of gland called apocrine sweat glands which secrete an oily fluid that 's metabolized by bacteria on your skin , letting off a noticeable smell . So make sure you pay keen attention to that area when showering . <p> Foods that you eat <p> Just like the foods you eat affects your mouth 's smell , armpits smell and feet smell , it equally affects how your vagina smells . Research shows that foods with strong scents like chilies , pepper , garlic , onion , blue cheese , cabbage , fish , and broccoli tend to have the most impact . If you feel like whatever you are eating is causing you that bad smell , then you may need to drop it from your diet . <p> Hormonal changes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the period that we are 9ovulating it is highly possible to experience an unpleasant smell from there . The smell should go after a while but if it causes you distress you may need to see your doctor . Women undergoing menopause also tend to experience hormonal imbalance hence the smell . <p> Forgotten tampon <p> A forgotten tampon is something most of us can relate to . It happens . This results to a buildup of menstrual blood which in turn causes irritation , itching and a very strong unpleasant smell . Change your tampons regularly to avoid this occurrence .

@@22752231 <p> Siddharth Chatterjee is the United Nations Resident Coordinator and the UNDP Resident Representative to Kenya . <p> A prolific writer , Chatterjee is a regular contributor to Reuters and Huffington Post . <p> A Princeton University alumnus , Sid Chatterjee was decorated for gallantry by the President of India during his service in the Indian Special Forces where he rose to the rank of Major . <p> He is active on social media ; his Twitter handle is @sidchat1 <p> Wycliffe Muga : Everyone has a remarkable story from his youngest days . Something which happened that only now looking back do you realise how profoundly it influenced you for good or bad . Looking back , what would you say had a profound impact on you ? <p> Siddharth Chatterjee : Without a doubt it was being laughed at by a teacher when , aged 14 , I told him my ambition was to get into India 's prestigious National Defence Academy . He hooted with laughter and described me in words I have never forgotten : " You are the deadwood of mediocrity " . He , in fact , asked me to pursue a vocational skill and forget about advancing in academics as he did not see a future for me there . <p> I was hurt and furious , but I was not really surprised because , to be fair , it was n't completely unjustified . So comparing me to the deadwood of mediocrity , may actually have been a compliment , as mediocre is certainly better than plain bad ( Sid laughs ) . <p> Getting into the National Defence Academy is incredibly competitive and I was failing to shine both academically and at sport , so my big ideas about being a Special Forces officer in the Indian military and learning to parachute and play polo and dive sounded pretty hollow to my teacher . <p> I suspect that statement of my teacher stuck to my psyche . While it sounded cruel and insensitive then , on reflection it might have woken me up . Rather like a jolt of electricity that shook me and spurred me on . <p> By way of background , my father came to India as a refugee from East Pakistan -- now Bangladesh ? -- when India was partitioned in 1947 . My mother came from a very simple background . She came from a family of 9 siblings and her mother was married at 11 years of age . Even as a child I remember clearly noticing the massively different status in Indian society of the different genders . Gender differences in India are very pronounced . I saw deeply ingrained patriarchy , misogyny and gender inequalities within my family and the wider community . It was not easy for my mother and for countless women who were married young and had scarce opportunities to achieve their full human potential . <p> PHOTO CAPTION : Sid Chatterjee as a 6 year old with his parents Dilip Chatterjee and Gouri Chatterjee . <p> Ours was a simple household . My father 's family lost everything during the partition of India , which on all counts may have been one of the worst genocides in history . No side was innocent , except for the women and children caught up in the tragedy . <p> My paternal grandfather died and my grandmother fled East Pakistan with her two sons and a daughter . Life was hard for them , very hard . To be made indigent from a reasonably comfortable home and through no fault of their own left my father 's family deeply traumatised . <p> So when I see refugees anywhere in the world , I connect with them in many ways and feel deep empathy . <p> My father 's family basically restarted their lives from scratch . When I was born and growing up , there was no money to spare at home but , like most parents , my mother and father were very ambitious for me , and really struggled to ensure they did their very best for me . My father was the bread-winner and my mother stayed at home to raise my brother and me . They used their modest means to get me private tuition , but I was still failing . I changed schools often simply to avoid having to repeat the previous academic year . <p> I also contracted polio as a child , but was very lucky as it was detected early and corrected in time . Countless other children in India had to resign themselves to a life of handicap , pain and immobility . I was three years old , but my memory is still vivid with the painful rehabilitation process I had to go through at a military hospital . <p> My brother was born 10 years after me and in the meantime my experiences at school could at best be described as inconsequential . I tried my hand at boxing , but invariably I would be either knocked out in the first round , or even when I survived the first round , I never won any fight . <p> However , I think my childhood experiences on seeing how women were treated and my own tryst with polio , may have had something to do with my passion to fight gender inequality and my enthusiasm to advance universal health coverage . These are two issues I am deeply passionate about . <p> WM : Looking back , do you see why ? Because it was n't that you did n't have brains . What do you think was holding you back ? <p> Sid : Frankly I found the education system tyrannical . Corporal punishments and bullying was common . The pressure was intense . I must admit I hated each day , I had to wake up and go to school . <p> I also think it was because the education system involved a lot of rote learning . It was all about how much you could memorise , and did n't focus on problem-solving or creativity of any sort . This did n't play to my strengths . <p> It was obvious I was n't heading for a good university , but with the help of a tutor I managed to pass the entrance exam for the National Defence Academy ( NDA ) on my second attempt . This was a huge success for me . Out of around 100,000 applicants only about 200 were selected following difficult exams and rigorous interviews . I was overjoyed . <p> The NDA is like the West Point of the United States of America . However it is a unique military training institution where the three arms of the armed forces train together , the Army , Air Force and the Navy , as officer cadets . We join as sixteen year olds after passing an entrance exam followed by a week of personality , psychological and medical examinations . The process is exacting , it is an intense period of studies and training . You are groomed to be an officer and a gentleman . <p> PHOTO CAPTION : Sid Chatterjee ( left ) with his colleagues at the Indian Military Academy at a polo match . <p> At the end of three years we receive a Bachelor 's degree and move to the specialised service academies , the Indian Military Academy , the Air Force academy and the Naval Academy , where we spend an additional year . It is like doing a graduate programme on steroids . <p> Something about being accepted changed me . Perhaps it was my " Forrest Gump " moment . On the first day at the Academy they cut your hair , put you in a uniform , and basically start to build you as a new person . I found this liberating . It was like a formal break away from the past where I had n't known any success and had no self-confidence . Suddenly the lights came on . <p> From a childhood of academic and sporting failure , in three years at the Academy I became a top boxer , show jumper and polo player . I also finished my Bachelor 's degree by 19 years of age , and set my sights on joining the Indian Special Forces . <p> Joining the Special Forces was a crowning moment of my life . You put on that maroon beret and that uniform and you are a part of an elite unit , quite a feat given my background . I started getting top grades in the commando course , the infantry course , and the junior leaders ' course . Suddenly I was coming first in my unit in battle physical efficiency tests , and I became a parachutist , a combat underwater diver and skilled in unarmed combat . <p> In a sense , the military helped me find purpose in my life . I was decorated for gallantry by the President of India for my part in counterinsurgency operations . <p> But this intense exposure to combat unsettled me . I started to feel uneasy , a sort of " subconscious disquiet " . Something about this violence did not make sense at all . <p> WM : Let me hazard a guess here : Was it all the people being killed ? Was there an incident which crystallised the doubts in your mind ? <p> Many years ago , while out on patrol in a very hostile insurgency environment , a platoon of my Special Forces unit came under fire . Minutes later , an officer lay lifeless from gunshot wounds . I remember that day like it was yesterday . <p> Nothing can prepare a soldier for the death of a comrade -- nor for delivering the news to his family . I remember the look of pain and agony on the faces of my fallen comrade 's wife and children , and that memory still breaks my heart . <p> Every time the media reports on military deaths , I think of the families of those soldiers and wonder if a little more regard for soldiers and their families would inspire us to seek non-violent resolutions to conflicts . <p> PHOTO CAPTION : Sid Chatterjee holds up a live and deadly Russel 's Viper , teaching his students survival and living off the land at the Commando School which trains young infantry officers in commando operations . Photo : Indian Army <p> I had misgivings about the whole principle of fighting an insurgency when alternate opportunities existed for advancing peace , dialogue and diplomacy . If I could turn back the clock and if I had any position of influence , I would have encouraged dialogue and reconciliation . <p> India has the largest number of war widows , currently estimated at 25,000 , but very likely much more . I doubt there is another nation-state that has lost so many soldiers to fighting within its own borders . <p> WM : That is a large number of war widows . Surely the political leadership in India as well as the population of India must be sitting up and taking note of this ? <p> I wish that was the case . Frankly I am not sure . <p> In banal , patriotic statements , we declare these fallen soldiers martyrs and war heroes , while ignoring the shattered dreams of the spouses and children left behind . Clearly , we must find alternatives to sending young men and women to war . The cost is not only in lives lost and families shattered , but also in long-term damage to the mental health of military veterans . Many struggle to adjust to life after very traumatic and disturbing experiences in war , and some even take their own lives . <p> When I went into a counterinsurgency operation in the North East of India , I realised we were fighting in an insurgency with no real prospect of success . I had read this very interesting book by American author Barbara Tuchman called " The March of Folly : From Troy to Vietnam " . The book is compelling and brilliant and draws on a range of examples , from Montezuma 's absurd surrender of his empire in 1520 AD to Japan 's attack on Pearl Harbour- she defines folly as the pursuit by government of policies contrary to their own interests , despite the availability of feasible alternatives . She enlightens the reader with four decisive turning points in history that illustrate the heights of folly : the Trojan War , the breakup of the Holy See provoked by the Renaissance popes , the loss of the American colonies by Britain 's George III , and the United States ' own persistent mistakes in Vietnam . <p> Something started to stir in my mind when I went into this particular counter insurgency operation . <p> There was no endgame in sight , for that matter anywhere in the world in this sort of environment . That was when it became clear to me that something needed to change . <p> WM : You are saying then that military victory -- or what is generally assumed to be victory -- is really little more than an illusion . But many leaders who have taken their militaries into war have argued that there was no other choice . So what do you think should have been done ? <p> History is replete with examples that military might alone can not end such insurgencies or what is called low intensity conflicts . <p> From my own experience in India 's military , which included many years of active service in counterinsurgency operations , it is clear that unbridled violence invariably back-fires , as it tends to add fuel and sustain the insurgency , just as it has in other parts of India and the world . <p> In many parts of the world governments continue to combat insurgencies over decades . In most cases such conflicts are unwinnable , each side inflicting increasing levels of violence , creating a vitiated environment of hate and a vicious cycle of vendetta and revenge , with civilians bearing the brunt . <p> Insurgencies thrive in the parts of India have seen protracted socio-economic deprivation , intergenerational poverty , poor governance and a deep sense of injustice . For example this is particularly true given the fact that the problem of left-wing extremism and the question of social justice are essentially entwined in India . In 2009 , former Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh declared , " Left-wing extremism poses the gravest internal security threat to India . " He was right . India 's long-running Maoist insurgency has developed into one of the country 's most serious security challenge of the past 50 years . <p> Unfortunately , this form of militancy has all along been sustained by India 's wide and deep-rooted inequality with conflict over land ownership , struggles for the rights over mineral and forest wealth , poverty , and denial of justice and human dignity , which plays a pivotal role in alienating a large segment of the working class poor . It often reflects the harsh reality of the wider local region , which is typically affected by either exploitation of the peasantry , struggles over mineral wealth , or denial of rights over forest-land to the local tribal population . <p> WM : Not that I think your message would have any real chance of reaching him , but if you had an opportunity to convey a short message to India 's Prime Minister Mr Narendra Modi , what would you say to him ? <p> Ending conflicts through dialogue and diplomacy is a daunting undertaking . However , history shows that peaceful negotiation can resolve even the most obdurate conflicts . For instance , we can learn from the Good Friday Agreement that brought peace to the long-running Irish conflict or the recently-concluded peace agreement in Colombia . It needs perseverance , stamina and an abundance of optimism . <p> The road to peace in Ireland was characterized by violence , setbacks and numerous false starts , but the negotiating parties realised that military strength alone would not guarantee peace . <p> India 's Prime Minister , Honourable Mr. Narendra Modi , can change this . He is an exceptional leader much admired throughout the country , leading the world 's largest democracy . Peace with India 's neighbours and peace within , would unleash the country 's ' true economic and social potential , lift people out of poverty , make India a beacon of hope , prosperity and social cohesion . <p> WM : I understand the Indian Army enjoys great prestige in Indian society and is considered a good career option . So what prompted you to leave the Army ? <p> As Socrates once said , " The unexamined life is not worth living . " <p> I still remember that day when it was announced in the newspaper that I had been awarded a decoration for gallantry for my role in counterinsurgency operations . Suddenly the events that led to my being decorated for bravery played out like a kaleidoscope . <p> I , did n't feel the euphoria that usually accompanies this kind of recognition . That was the moment I knew that my time to move on from the military had come . <p> PHOTO CAPTION : Sid Chatterjee is decorated for gallantry . Photo : Indian Army <p> My award for gallantry in combat made me feel I was being recognised for something that was not going to bring the conflict to an end . I wished that soldiers could be rewarded for efforts to ensure peace and reconciliation , not for the number of people they had killed . I wished my own award recognised my achievements in negotiating with village elders and with belligerent groups towards resolving the conflict . <p> The primacy of politics and dialogue had failed and this was being replaced by belligerence and hate . <p> Obtaining early release from the Special Forces was not straightforward , and it took nearly 12 months of negotiation to secure my return to civilian life . I became a civilian on the 1st of January 1997 and set off for my first civilian job as a security officer in the UN mission in Sarajevo , on the 15th of January . That is where I started my career in the United Nations , from pretty much the bottom of the rung , and I am glad I did as it laid the foundations of my new work environment , which was very different from the army . <p> WM : Well , that was a long time ago . By now you have had two decades in the UN . What are some of the highlights of your UN career ? <p> After a short stint as a security officer in Sarajevo , I went to Iraq , where I got a break from security to work as a UN Coordinator in Iraqi Kurdistan in a place called Suleimaniyah . I spent more than two years with the Kurds in northern Iraq and saw first-hand the impact that the UN can make in terms of improving access to basic services like education , health , clean water and sanitation , and nutrition . This in turn had a huge impact on the Kurds ' ability to find solutions to their own developmental needs and the foundations of democracy were laid . They are a group of people that have seen so much of pain and deprivation , yet they continued with stoic determination . I have tremendous respect for them . <p> From Iraq I went to South Sudan , which was fighting with the North but where there was also an internal war between the Sudan People 's Liberation Army ( SPLA ) and the Sudan People 's Democratic Front . I set up an office in Rumbek South Sudan for UNICEF in 2000 and my boss , a highly dynamic leader called Dr Sharad Sapra , asked me , " Sid , " Why do n't we get the children out of the military ? . " <p> We began dialogue with Commander Salva Kiir , who was then chief of the SPLA , and with John Garang , the Chairman of the SPLM . In October 2000 we got a written agreement from ( now President ) Salva Kiir to the UN Children 's Fund ( UNICEF ) chief Carol Bellamy , agreeing to demobilize 3,500 child soldiers from the frontlines of the conflict . This followed months of discussions , during which we never threw the book at them on the Convention to the Rights of the Child , but instead persuaded them that their political capital would go up exponentially if they became the first rebel army to remove children from their ranks . <p> To see those children in South Sudan return to a normal childhood and to give them access to education , food , immunization , clean water and sanitation was immensely fulfilling for me . It remains one of my proudest achievements to this day . In many ways this particular event was transformational for me personally . It also filled a spiritual vacuum in my life . Here is a TEDx talk I did on it . ( Video ) <p> I was then appointed chief of the emergency section in Indonesia , working with more than a million internally displaced people due to the conflict in Aceh and the Malukus . We were at the front lines of providing assistance to displaced communities , negotiating days of peace and tranquillity to access children in order to immunize them . We established an Indonesian version of a ' school in a box ' programme that enabled us to set up and equip a makeshift tented school whenever belligerent groups burned down school buildings . <p> Unicef 's then Executive Director Carol Bellamy asked me to lead UNICEF 's response to the emergency in Darfur in 2004 . I helped scale up UNICEF 's response to the emergency and led a wide-ranging immunization campaign throughout Darfur . Ensuring we could access every child no matter where they were , which involved negotiating access with the rebel leaders who controlled wide swathes of territory in order to access these children with health , education , clean water and protection . <p> My work in Darfur was recognised by UNICEF 's senior leadership , and in November 2004 I was promoted and appointed UNICEF 's deputy representative in Somalia . This was a remarkable experience at a very challenging time for the country . I led UNICEF 's humanitarian response efforts spanning the tsunami in 2004 to immunizing children in conflict-affected parts of Southern Somalia to ensuring a back-to-school programme for children in North-eastern Somalia . My office was seen as a pivotal humanitarian and development organization and we developed good relationships with other organisations operating in the country , and with local governments . <p> WM : Now let us move to some of the more controversial stuff : I understand that you rose from a very junior IFLD 4 position in Sarajevo , in 1997 to a professional level P-5 in Somalia in 2004 . That is like seven years and I am told this rarely happens in the UN . There has been some controversy that has followed you around because you are the son-in-law of Mr Ban Ki-moon , the immediate former Secretary-General of the UN . There are those who suspect that maybe this was the reason behind your meteoric rise . <p> Mr. Ban Ki-moon joined the UN as Secretary General in 2007 , after a long and distinguished career as a diplomat . I joined the UN in 1997 , a full 10 years before Mr. Ban . <p> I met my wife Ban Hyun Hee in Darfur in July 2004 and we got married soon afterwards . By then I had already been appointed to P5 level ( a senior level of UN management ) after seven years of service in some of the world 's most difficult and dangerous places , and a full three years before Mr. Ban 's election as the UN Secretary General . <p> Yes , I progressed quickly in my career . That was because I was privileged to serve with phenomenal leaders like Ms. Carol Bellamy , Dr. Sharad Sapra and Mr. Rolf Carrier ( who was UNICEF 's Representative in Indonesia ) , who recognized and rewarded results . I am deeply grateful to them . <p> In 2007 , I turned down an offer from the UN Educational , Scientific and Cultural Organization ( UNESCO ) to head up their Nepal office and instead accepted an invitation from the UN 's special representative in Iraq to work with him . Ironically , it was at that point that the gossip about nepotism started , though it is hard to imagine that going to serve in Iraq at one of the most dangerous periods in its history could be viewed as a soft option for a family member ! <p> But soon after my father-in-law 's appointment my wife and I became a target of vicious and malicious media attacks . The period between 2007 and 2016 was difficult for both of us , because , suddenly , our private lives were thrown into the public domain . In those circumstances , it becomes not just about your family honour but protecting the name of the institution too . There was nobody who would speak out to defend you , the UN could not , so it was a complicated situation . <p> I soon realised that we were left to our own devices to protect our name and honour . The situation got so bad that our prospects for employment in the UN system were in jeopardy , because institutions were wary of bringing media attention on themselves . <p> It was a tough situation . <p> Everything that happened from January 2007 was viewed through the distorted lens of nepotism , with no regard for my 10-year career at the UN prior to that . Suddenly , it was all about being the SG 's son-in-law . It was relentless and distressing . <p> I am deeply grateful to Ms. Carol Bellamy , Dr Sharad Sapra , Mr. Rolf Carrier , Ambassador Frank Wisner ( former US Ambassador to India ) and my former boss at the Red Cross , Ms Goli Ameri . Not only are they great leaders , they also had the courage to speak out publicly in my defence . <p> WM : I recently saw an interview you did which was published in WION News India , where you were asked about the UN Deputy Secretary General , Amina Mohammed , and her role in the " rosewood scandal " when she was Minister of Environment in Nigeria . You defended her . How come ? And for those who may not know what this scandal was , maybe you could explain a little of the details . <p> Well , the question was sprung at me by WION news , and I could have easily ducked it , but decided not to . <p> The Nigerian government emphatically rejected allegations of rosewood export racketeering to China levelled against UN Deputy Secretary-General Ms Amina Mohammed , when she was the Minster of Environment . The ministry stated that all the CITES permits signed by the ex-minister were done in line with stringent guidance and procedures . <p> Having been a target of malicious and fake news myself for close to 10 years , I could empathise with her . I felt it was most unfair to target Ms. Amina Mohammed , whose professional , ethical and integrity standards are excellent and beyond reproach . I have no regret speaking up for her . In my view that was the right thing to do . <p> Wycliffe , as the famous 1855 saying by Rev Charles Haddon Spurgeon goes , " If you want truth to go around the world you must hire an express train to pull it ; but if you want a lie to go around the world , it will fly ; it is light as a feather and a breath will carry it . " <p> WM : By now you must be acquainted with the sad reality of just how polarising Kenyan elections are . International civil servants like yourself , can suddenly find that either they or their staff are viciously attacked because something they said or did -- really quite innocently -- has upset one side of the political divide or the other . I noted during the elections in Kenya in 2017 , one of your staff and also you personally were attacked by some bloggers . I took note that you came out strongly in your colleague 's defence . Are you saying people within the system should speak out in defence of their staff ? <p> Absolutely . I firmly believe that we all have a moral responsibility regardless of our rank , paygrade or station in life , to stand up for the truth without fear or favour . <p> I am the face of UNDP so it is easy to attack me . A lot of fake news got propagated after the elections . I can take the attacks but will stand in between when it comes to my staff . The safety , security and reputation of my staff is paramount . I will go to the end of the earth to defend them . <p> WM : Let 's go back a bit . You were offered the position of UN Resident Coordinator in Namibia in 2009 , how did that come about and why did you not take up that position ? <p> Every Resident Coordinator has to pass a UN Resident Coordinator Assessment . Failure rates are quite high . An independent human resources company from Canada carried out my assessment , which I passed in 2008 and was proposed by UNICEF ( the agency I served with ) to become the UN Resident Coordinator in Namibia in 2009 . A post of that seniority and responsibility has to be signed off by the UN Secretary General , and so I made the difficult decision to decline that job offer because of my personal situation . I did not want to expose myself , my wife , my father-in-law or the UN itself to any suggestions of perceived impropriety . Perceptions matter and that is what I have had to deal with since 2007 . <p> Instead I made a life-changing decision , perhaps my best decision . I decided to go back to school and spent a year studying for a Master 's in Public Policy at Princeton University . It was again a leap of faith , I took a year 's leave without pay and there was no right of return to my previous job or to any position for that matter . I would have to compete for any position . It was a big risk and I knew because of my special situation organizations in the UN were reluctant to hire me . <p> My year of study and reflection at Princeton was without doubt one of the best experiences of my life . I developed intellectually through engagement with teachers and with a fascinating mix of fellow students from all parts of the world and from all walks of life . I am deeply grateful for the opportunity I had at Princeton . <p> As Alvin Toffler said , " The illiterate of the 21st century will not be those who can not read and write , but those who can not learn , unlearn , and relearn . " <p> I would encourage everyone to take a year out of their careers to pause and go back to school . It gives you the freedom to pursue your intellectual interests , develop new capabilities , expose yourself to new approaches and methods and advance your career . <p> WM : There is one place where you have worked , which was neither the UN nor the Indian Army . I note that you went to work for the International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies . You had a fancy title of Chief Diplomat . How did that come about ? <p> While I was at Princeton , an executive search firm contacted me to check if I would be interested in this position at the Red Cross . I said yes without hesitation and went through a rigorous selection process . I had my final interview in Geneva led by the hiring manager , an absolutely spectacular leader called Ms Goli Ameri , who used to be a former Assistant Secretary of State during President Bush 's administration . She was the Under Secretary General for Humanitarian Diplomacy and Strategic partnerships . <p> The Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement is the world 's largest humanitarian network . The Movement is neutral and impartial , and provides protection and assistance to people affected by disasters and conflicts . The Movement is made up of nearly 100 million members , volunteers and supporters in 190 National Societies <p> The International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies , was led by a humanitarian hero and a champion for the most vulnerable , Mr. Bekele Geleta . It was a privilege to serve with both of them as well as develop a new network of friends and colleagues . The national societies of the Red Cross Red Crescent movement are perhaps the only organization that are primed to go the last mile and can be relied on to deliver humanitarian assistance where no one else can go . These are true volunteers who epitomize the spirit of service , humanity , compassion and trust . It was an honor to be part of this great organization for nearly three years . <p> The United Nations family in Kenya is very lucky to have a partner like the Kenyan Red Cross , to respond to Kenya 's humanitarian needs . They are a versatile and highly respected organization globally . <p> WM : So can you then trace for me the path by which you moved from the IFRC to your appointment as the UN Resident Coordinator in Kenya ? <p> I first came to Kenya in 2014 as the UN Population Fund ( UNFPA ) Representative to Kenya . <p> In 2016 , I was invited by the UNDP to apply for this role and I am deeply grateful to Ms. Helen Clark , the former UNDP Administrator , for giving me the opportunity to apply and compete . I am also grateful to my predecessor Ms. Nardos Bekele-Thomas who encouraged me to take on this position . <p> As I was working with UNFPA they first had to approve my applying for the role , which they did . I applied for the UN Resident Coordinator ( RC ) role in Kenya in 2016 . Again , I went through a selection process called the Inter-Agency Appointments Panel and was shortlisted . Regardless of the decision being taken , the final decision rests with the Government of the country where an RC is being proposed to . <p> I was honoured and deeply humbled by the support and confidence of the Government of Kenya to be the UN 's Resident Coordinator in Kenya . <p> WM : One more hypothetical : Let 's imagine you were given an opportunity to speak to a group of highly influential political leaders at the UN , what would you say to them ? <p> In his New Year 's message on Sunday 31 December 2017 , UN Secretary General Mr. Antonio Guterres issued " a red alert for our world . " He called for unity and has said that , " We can settle conflicts , overcome hatred and defend shared values . But we can only do that together . " <p> I would remind these political leaders of the words of the very controversial William Tecumseh Sherman , a Union General during the U.S. Civil War , who once said , " It is only those who have neither fired a shot nor heard the shrieks and groans of the wounded who cry aloud for blood , more vengeance , more desolation . War is hell . " <p> The damage of war goes far beyond what we once believed ; society has now reached an understanding about the kind of moral , communal and psychological toll war can have on the soldiers , their families , community and even country . <p> Perhaps the question we need to ask is if there is a need to bolster our quest for non-violence as a means to resolve disputes and differences . <p> However , today we have terms like Post Traumatic Stress Disorder ( PTSD ) , chronic depression , cognitive impairment and traumatic brain injury to help explain the symptoms suffered by active and returning soldiers . <p> Apart from PTSD , combatants also suffer from issues such as mood disorders , depression , anxiety , night terrors , and may be at increased risk for substance abuse , and be more likely to commit violent offences in civilian life . <p> For example , suicide-related deaths in the U.S. military surged to a record 349 in 2012 -- more than the 295 Americans who died fighting in Afghanistan in 2012 . Statistics show that there is one suicide death every 18 hours . <p> When we see terrifying images from across the world of professional soldiers from developed or developing countries carrying out some of the most egregious violations of human rights , we have to pause for a moment to think of the triggers that cause such reactions . Far away from families and friends , the pressure of combat brings the worst out in many . I have seen this first hand . It unleashes a savage , despite great educational , emotional , and spiritual enlightenment . <p> And I suppose societies too need to hold up a mirror to themselves . After all these soldiers do not come from Mars . They come from the very communities where they are raised , educated , groomed and nurtured . <p> The toll that war takes on a soldier is clear , but what sort of toll does it take on a community ? <p> These problems do n't just affect the returning soldiers ' parents , wives , children , siblings , friends and neighbours . What are the social consequences of millions of psychologically scarred soldiers returning to communities all over the world feeling hopeless and angry ? <p> And then there is the massive financial cost . A 2013 Harvard study notes that the Iraq and Afghanistan wars could end up costing the U.S. between 4 and 6 trillion dollars , including the medical care of veterans , leading to an enormous negative impact on the global economy . <p> No doubt wars and conflicts are hell -- but for reasons far beyond what we traditionally thought . Conflict not only tears apart the people that partake in it , emotionally as well as physically , but also their families , communities , societies and even their countries . It is extremely expensive , not only in money , but also in human capital and lost potential . These costs are simply too great to bear . <p> My key message to them would be that , if the world can not find a way out of war , then we may well be defeated as a civilisation . <p> So I would implore them to get behind the UN Secretary General 's call for peace and prevention of conflicts . <p> WM : And in your view , what is the UN leadership doing about it ? <p> Today , over 65 million people are displaced or have become refugees , the largest displacement of humanity since the second world-war , due to conflicts , natural disasters or sheer poverty . <p> There are many thorny issues facing the world , and the UN Secretary General Mr Antonio Guterres and his Deputy Ms Amina Mohamed have called on the United Nations staff and member states of the UN to stand up and unite to tackle the challenges of extreme violence , large movement of refugees , underdevelopment and poverty , and civil strife . <p> They are together driving some of the boldest reforms of the UN system at the country level , which is where the UN makes a real difference . They are leading efforts to ensure that the UN is more effective , efficient , coherent , coordinated and a better performing United Nations country presence with a strengthened role of the UN Resident Coordinator and a common management , programming and monitoring framework . <p> They must get the support of the member states of the UN as well as the UN system as a whole . All the UN funds , programmes and agencies need to get behind the SG on this . <p> WM : No doubt you have had many opportunities to address young university students . Looking back on your own journey , and at how you reached where you are now , what would you tell such a group now , by way of offering them encouragement and urging them to have great aspirations ? <p> I would say drive , determination , perseverance and belief . A belief that you can do it . Everyone needs a little bit of luck in addition to their personal drive and willingness to take risks . In my case , there were plenty of times when I had to take that leap of faith , not knowing how I would land . <p> Self-confidence , regardless of how much people doubt your ability , is crucial . That is what kept me going , because all the odds were stacked against me and there were many points when I could have failed . <p> You get attacked for your successes and your failures , and , as you rise , there are inevitably people that will be jealous and many who will dislike you . I always keep the wise words of Winston Churchill in mind , " You have enemies ? Good . That means you 've stood up for something , sometime in your life . " <p> So having a thick skin is crucial , find strength in adversity and never giving up . <p> WM : What would you say to any of them who might then ask you what you now believe -- after all these experiences -- to be the key to your style of leadership ? <p> I owe my foundations in leadership to the National Defence Academy in India and my unit , the 10th Special Forces battalion where I served . These are two institutions that were central to my all around development , my ability to withstand stress and adapt to rapidly changing situations . Above all it imbibed a sense of loyalty , courage and a " never give up attitude " . You learn about the true meaning of Espirit de corps , the sense of camaraderie , how to earn the respect of those you command and how to reward that respect by returning it . You are set some of the most difficult physical , mental and emotional tests and many strong people ca n't cope . It 's not your physical stamina that sustains you over three days in the desert on a navigation exercise with very little food and water , it 's your willpower . <p> The culture is , a leader leads from the front and knowing the right balance when to lead from behind . <p> Courage and integrity are crucial , whatever the situation . Stand up and stand by your staff , be loyal to them . <p> My principle is that when something goes wrong , I will take the hit for it and will stand by my staff . When things go well and we are successful , I will ensure the credit is passed on to individuals and the team . <p> To me real leaders are visionary in their aspirations but practical and flexible in their approach , ambitious for their staff and the organization , while being demanding , they must be sensitive and compassionate towards their teams . And when a leader is having a bad day , try not to show it . <p> I have always requested a 360-degree performance review . Getting honest and reliable feedback is necessary to test one 's own perceptions , recognize previously unseen strengths , and become aware of blind spots in one 's self-perceptions . <p> WM : I saw your article in Forbes where you threw out a challenge to President Obama and President Putin on the matter of the war in Syria . I think the title was Obama And Putin Must Stop The Appalling Slaughter Of Syria 's Children . What prompted that ? <p> Sid : I wrote that piece in 2013 following heartbreaking research from the Oxford Research Group report , ' Stolen Futures -- the Hidden Toll of Child Casualties in Syria " . It was damning in that it shows that children were specifically and deliberately targeted . 11,420 children were killed in Syria between March 2011 and August 2013 . Among them , 389 were killed by snipers , 764 executed , and 100 tortured . It highlighted the depravity on all sides of Syria 's war . <p> Nelson Mandela once said , " There can be no keener revelation of a society 's soul than the way in which it treats its children . " <p> Perhaps there 's something else that needs to happen in terms of the way we see ourselves as a species and the collective nature of humanity . How can we prevent conflict , resolve it when it happens , and protect the most vulnerable from its impact ? <p> Children continue to suffer in war , as horrifying images from gas attacks in Syria show , and President Donald Trump correctly called an " affront to humanity . " <p> The United Nations Secretary General , Mr. Antonio Guterres , has described Syria as one of the worst conflicts of our time . But every day millions of children around the world are caught up in crises and disasters , many of man 's own making . <p> Consider this . In 2016 alone , one billion children around the world experienced physical , sexual or psychological violence . Globally , one in four children suffer physical abuse , one in five girls are sexually abused at least once in their lifetime , and more than 240 million children live in countries affected by conflict . <p> A growing number of boys and girls , some as young as eight years , are being abducted and sent to the frontlines as child soldiers , or fall prey to sexual violence in times of war . These experiences sear their psyches with macabre memories and condemn them to a terrifying and hopeless future . <p> On the issue of children , values must be the guiding principle , not Realpolitik . As President John F. Kennedy once said , " Children are the world 's most valuable resource and its best hope for the future " . That future should not be jeopardised . <p> Frankly , it is difficult to find another species that treats its offspring with such cruelty . <p> WM : You came to Kenya in April 2014 as the head of UNFPA and now you have been the United Nations Resident Coordinator since 2016 . In all this you have carved out for yourself a reputation as one man who is very passionate about women 's rights . Tell us about both your roles in this and what you may have achieved ? <p> As mentioned , my firm belief in fighting gender inequality started as a young boy . <p> However , one particular incident remains etched in my memory to date . While serving in the army as a young officer , I was horrified to find out that a soldier from my unit had raped a young girl . I remember the sheer fear and trauma that girl went through , and the helplessness of her family . <p> It was a life changing moment for me . While the punishment that followed was swift and uncompromising , it was at that moment that I swore to fight all forms of misogyny , discrimination and violence . <p> So when I came to Kenya , it was as if the unseen hand of destiny brought me here . At UNFPA I had the opportunity to deal with the terrible tragedy of high maternal deaths , discrimination and violence at the centre of the country 's political , social , cultural and economic dialogue . <p> PHOTO CAPTION : The First Lady of Kenya , flanked by CS Foreign Affairs Amb Amina Mohamed , former UN Resident Coordinator to Kenya , Ms. Nardos Bekele Thomas and Sid Chatterjee . Ms Margaret Kenyatta was recognised as the UN Person of the Year 2014 for her invaluable efforts to advance maternal and child health in Kenya . Photo : UN Kenya <p> My role in Kenya has been the most exciting of my entire career . When I got here I found an incredible team of UNFPA staff determined to change the game and claim our space in matters of maternal health . I decided that the first move would be to get behind what the First Lady 's Beyond Zero Campaign aimed at ending maternal deaths in Kenya . Kenya is lucky to have a truly remarkable First Lady in Margaret Kenyatta . <p> Her passion , dedication and sheer determination is exceptional and frankly unparalleled . Her clarion call , " no woman should die giving life " resonated to every corner of the country and beyond . That became the tailwind for UNFPA 's own efforts . <p> Working with the University of Nairobi , we discovered that 98% of maternal deaths in Kenya were happening in only 15 counties . Armed with that data for my first meeting with then Health Cabinet Secretary James Macharia and the First Lady , I proposed we should get the Governors from the 15 counties to commit to ending the scourge of maternal mortality in their counties , and to support them with targeted interventions . <p> It was a success . Despite initial doubts from several quarters that we could do it , we gained the support of the Kenya Red Cross and the World Bank and ran a sustained and highly focused campaign . 15 County Governors from the counties which have the highest burden of maternal deaths signed a communique on ending preventable maternal and new born mortality in Kenya . <p> Change has been dramatic . Kenya had a maternal mortality ratio of around 488 deaths per 100,000 live births . In a matter of a few years , this dropped to 366 deaths per 100,000 live births . Our efforts were recognized by the World Economic Forum . We were invited to Kigali and then to Davos and Durban because of the gains that these counties had made . <p> Our next frontier is universal healthcare , so that no Kenyan is denied access to medical help through lack of financial means or lack of facilities . With the clear support of the government , I am confident we can achieve this . <p> Kenya is a beacon of hope in this region . A rapidly growing population offers opportunities for growth and innovation , but this demographic dividend can only be achieved through focusing concerted efforts on ensuring youth empowerment . We also need to ensure that women and girls have rights over their bodies and can plan their families . That will help unlock Kenya 's demographic dividend . <p> As the UN Resident Coordinator , I have worked with the UN country team and we have come up with five priorities in the new United Nations Development Assistance Framework , which will start in June 2018 . <p> First is to help the government to create five million jobs by 2022 . A million young people enter the labour market every year , but there are barely 100,000 new jobs , most of them in the informal sector . We need to dignify technical jobs , so the skills of a plumber , mason or carpenter are respected , encouraging young people into areas of high demand and helping them establish their own businesses . <p> Number Two is to address drought and hunger . By 2030 , agriculture will be a trillion-dollar industry in Africa , with the potential to employ most of its youth , and Kenya must seize this opportunity . Young people 's energy and ideas could transform the sector . <p> Third is universal health coverage . We must not be afraid to think creatively . We know , for example , that it will be difficult for Kenya to produce enough doctors and nurses , so why not train community health workers to do some of the mundane , non-medical tasks that currently take up much of their precious time ? We could train a million school leavers to perform immunizations , for instance . We need to think of new ways of addressing old problems . <p> Fourth is ensuring that development leaves no one behind and that is perhaps one of the best weapons to defeat the scourge of violent extremism . The principle of Vision 2030 is about making sure that it 's an inclusive process . As the UNDP Administrator , Mr. Achim Steiner , emphasizes , " let 's leave no one behind and reach the farthest behind first . " That is how you start to lead on issues of inequality and inequity . So the focus needs to be on the counties with the worst human development indicators . <p> Finally , we need to expand cross-border cooperation to encourage economic development and opportunity . The existing cross-border programme with Ethiopia , and the new road that connects Isiolo with Addis has seen the number of young people from Marsabit County joining Al-Shabaab drop exponentially . The road is a route to commerce and opportunity and economic integration . <p> President Kenyatta said he wants to turn this area in a ' Dubai ' . We will work very hard to make that happen . <p> WM : Speaking about violent extremism we are seeing this as an increasing phenomena globally , but particularly so in Africa . What is your take on this critical and highly sensitive issue ? <p> Very importantquestion Wycliffe.UNDP recently launched a ground breaking report , based on deep research and interviews with former extremists and those incarcerated . The report debunks a lot of myths and perceptions on the scourge of violent extremism . I would encourage everyone to read the report titled , " The Journey to Violent Extremism in Africa : Drivers , Incentives and the Tipping Point for Recruitment . " <p> PHOTO CAPTION : The signing of the Kenya-Ethiopia cross-border programme by the Foreign Ministers of Kenya , Amb Amina Mohamed and Ethiopia , Dr Tedros Adhanom overseen by the Heads of State of Kenya and Ethiopia . December 2015 Photo : UNDP Kenya <p> The report also finds that , many of these extremist movements erupt from borderlands and under-served areas . Large swathes of the population are extremely poor and there are chronically underemployed youth . That is why the Kenya-Ethiopia cross-border programme is particularly significant . I really applaud and commend the vision and leadership of Prime Minister Hailemariam Desalegn of Ethiopia and President Kenyatta of Kenya , for moving this forward . <p> This programme has brought two National Governments , two regional authorities , and two United Nations Country Teams together to advancing peace , development and empowerment in this area . <p> I am confident that not only can this programme be replicated , but may potentially be the key to resolving intractable border problems globally . <p> WM : Given your background in both the military and as a global technocrat , in your view what would be the best way to go about addressing this challenge ? <p> We need to address security challenges through a development lens . I would add that if we were to urgently invest in 4 E's- Education and skills , Empowerment of youth , women and girls , a Marshall plan for Employment in Africa and Equity , Africa will not only reap a demographic dividend , it would prevent irregular and forced migration and perhaps prevent and defeat violent extremism . <p> PHOTO CAPTION : Many migrants use the dangerous sea route crossing between North Africa and Italy in search of a better life . Photo : REUTERS/ MARINA MILITARE <p> I recently had the privilege of co-authoring an article with the former President of Ghana , Honourable John Mahama , titled , " Promise or Peril : Africa 's 830 million young people by 2050 " , where we discuss Africa 's youth population . Africa has a median age of 19 and has a rapidly growing youth population , which is expected to reach over 830 million by 2050 . Whether this spells promise or perildepends on how the continent manages its " youth bulge . " <p> According to the World Bank , 40% of people who join rebel movements are motivated by lack of economic opportunity . <p> In the wake of the Second World War , the Marshall Plan helped to rebuild shattered European economies in the interests of growth and stability . We need a plan of similar ambition that places youth employment in Africa at the centre of development . <p> WM : When someone has had the kind of successes you have had on the one hand and on the other hand also undergone a great deal of anguish -- we might almost say injustice - at the hands of critics , there is always this need for vindication in the long run . Here 's my question within that context : ten years from now , what would you like to look back as having happened in the next five years ? In other words , what would you look back on with the greatest satisfaction ? <p> You know Wycliffe , the difficulties my wife and I had through 2007 to 2016 , made us stronger and taught us to be resilient . As a matter of fact much of the negativity thrown at us , from within and outside the institution and those that tried to hurt us , only made us tougher and smarter . So I am grateful to them too and hold no grudges . I have learnt a great deal and developed immensely from this experience . <p> I am really grateful that I am now in Kenya . It is a time of monumental change and opportunity . <p> As you are aware , His Excellency President Uhuru Kenyatta has announced his Big Four plans , inter alia , affordable healthcare , food security , manufacturing and affordable housing as his main concerns for the next five years . These priorities align well with the outcomes of the new United Nations Development Assistance Framework ( UNDAF ) for Kenya . <p> In the next five years my hope is that we scale up our partnership with Kenya and all development partners to achieve the Big Four . I am confident Kenya can do it and serve as a model for many other countries in Africa and throughout the world . <p> In several ways , 2017 was not an easy year , first because the UN globally is facing an ongoing funding downturn to which no agency is immune , but particularly in Kenya because of the turbulence and uncertainties associated with last year 's general election . <p> Despite these challenges , I firmly believe that 2017 was a year of notable achievements , when we once again asserted the value and credibility of the UN system in Kenya to the Government and people of Kenya . <p> I thank all UN agencies that stood at the forefront of the drought response . It is the credibility and trust we enjoy that led to resources coming our way from the Flash Appeal to support the humanitarian response . The Government of Kenya sees the UN family as a partner they can trust and rely on . We must continue to remain vigilant and ready to support the Government and people of Kenya as the indications for the coming year do not look so good . <p> Despite shrinking resources , we are expected to do more . These past years , we have responded on time , effectively and coherently ; and our work is helping people feed themselves , care for the sick , empower more youth and women and promote models of development that reduce dependency . <p> For instance , the Joint Programme on Reproductive Maternal Neonatal Child and Adolescent Health ( RMNCAH ) has led to notable progress on coherence , service delivery , partnerships and key health outcomes , especially in under-served counties . This was not only recognised by Forbes " The UN and Philips Bring Hope And Health To Africa 's Most Challenging Region " , but also acknowledged by the Government of Kenya and the World Economic Forum . This became the basis for the SDG public- private partnership platform to leapfrog universal health coverage in Kenya . <p> Here is Kenya Foreign Minister 's Speech , Ambassador Amina Mohamed , at the UN General Assembly on Friday , 22 September 2017 , where she spoke specifically to the SDG platform in Kenya to leapfrog achievement of Universal Health Coverage in partnership with the United Nations in Kenya and emphasized the central importance of maternal and child healthcare . <p> The Cabinet Secretary informed the General Assembly of efforts made in her country to accelerate implementation of the SDGs as well as the Paris Agreement on Climate Change . She also spoke of Kenya 's assistance to refugees and efforts made to combat human trafficking . <p> This is a wonderful endorsement and recognition of the UN 's role in " Delivering as One " . The Government of Kenya is already planning for a similar platform in partnership with the UN on Zero Hunger , SDG 2 . <p> Partnerships with the private sector and development partners have unlocked significant resources and technical assistance to deliver significant improvements in areas previously considered little more than lost frontiers . <p> Our network of more than 25 UN agencies in Kenya has continued to offer creative programmes and campaigns on a wide-range of issues , including human rights , peace and security and sustainable development . In addition , we have put in place wider collaboration with the private and public sectors to make our programmes robust and our outreach more effective . <p> Kenya 's cross-border programme with Ethiopia , the UN Delivering as One programme , is finding great interest locally and globally and has the potential of not just unlocking more resources but can be replicated elsewhere too . <p> These are only a few examples of real progress ; changes that are not abstractions but which have been documented in terms of mothers and new-borns saved , girls retained in school and the vulnerable fed . It is work that has made a real difference in the lives of people , but which could not have happened had we not worked together . <p> But we have challenges ahead . The SDGs which the UNDAF now seeks to supportare broader and more challenging than the MDGs , because they encompass more goals such as peace , justice and strong institutions . <p> To that extent , much of the hard work lies ahead . Inequalities persist and progress has been uneven across the counties in Kenya . Our youth in Kenya remain on the periphery of development , and millions are left behind . <p> These are extraordinary challenges , but they also present extraordinary opportunities . The coming year is a chance for all our agencies to re-evaluate and to innovate . The question before us is , how can we do our work better ? How can we stretch our resources more effectively ? <p> The coming of a new year reminds us anew of the enduring value of the United Nations , as the place where citizens expect solutions to problems . I believe that each of us has a part to play in lifting up people all across Kenya , in finding solutions to today 's urgent challenges . <p> WM : Last question . Is it true that you run a half-marathon every Sunday ? If so -- and really that can not be said to be out of a need to get some exercise - what inspires you to run ? <p> Yes , as far as possible I run a half-marathon or 21km every Sunday . I also try and run to the office 2 to 3 times a week . I stand at work for at least 4 -- 5 hours a day and keep myself moving . And I also do a headstand two or three times a day . <p> PHOTO CAPTION : Sid Chatterjee does a headstand in his office . Photo : JBC <p> Running is therapeutic and it also acts as a catalyst for ideas . Most of the ideas for the opinion pieces I publish on my blog in Huffington Post and Reuters come when I am running . <p> I wake up at 3am each morning to read , write and reflect . <p> I dote on my six-year-old son . He is the centre of my existence . I suppose I also keep fit for his sake .

The severe injuries sidelined him for about two years . <p> Health experts are concerned that such motorcycle accident injuries have been on the rise since the government authorised the use of motorcycles as a means of public transport about a decade ago . <p> " The idea was well intended . It was aimed at creating economic activities for young people . But this has created a major health problem that tends to affect the youth at the early stage of their economic life , " said James Mogire , a consultant orthopaedic at Kenyatta National Hospital . <p> Unlike vehicles that have safeguards such as air bags which can cushion passengers from adverse effects of accidents , Dr Mogire noted that motorcycles are open , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ object when they collide . <p> " This leads to direct exposure to trauma for both riders and their passengers .

But now he will be unable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This can be devastating for the victim and his family . " <p> To hasten the recovery of such patients , health experts are advocating the use of an innovative technique known as negative pressure wound therapy ( NPWT ) , which is effective in tackling chronic or difficult to manage wounds . " This therapy cures such wounds faster . It halves the healing duration , thus enabling patients to get well faster than would have been the case with standard care , " said James Kigera , an orthopaedic surgeon and vice- chairman of the Kenya Orthopaedic Association . <p> Unknown to most people , the different gases in the air around us put pressure on the surface of our bodies , which adversely affects wounds . <p> The new therapy addresses this challenge by helping to decrease the amount of air pressure on the affected area . <p> Need quality care <p> The NPWT device comes with dressing material , which is put directly on the wound . <p> This is followed by an adhesive cover that is used to seal the dressing and the wound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> A pump connected to a drainage tube ( placed under the adhesive cover ) is then used to remove air pressure on the wound . <p> It also drains fluids from the affected area , thus helping to remove bacteria from the wound so as to curb infection .

Each treatment session costs about Sh35,000 . <p> The huge cost is largely driven by high-end commercial varieties of NPWT units that are often used in private healthcare facilities . <p> But a new paper published in the current issue of the Annals of African Surgery journal shows that healthcare workers can lower the cost of this technology by replacing its high priced commercial components with local low-cost products present in most hospitals such as cotton gauze swabs , adhesive film covers , naso-gastric tubes and suction machines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ procedures . <p> Dr Kigera , who is also editor-in-chief of the journal , noted that such modifications could greatly reduce the cost of the therapy to about Sh600 down from Sh35,000 thus making it accessible to most Kenyans . <p> " We have very many people with severe wounds that need quality care . So the technology should n't only be a preserve of a few people who can meet the high private hospital costs . " <p> Aside from severe motorcycle injuries , the NPWT is also ideal for treating other chronic wounds caused by second and third degree burns as well as injuries occurring among diabetic patients that are usually difficult to manage . <p> According to Dr Kigera , modification of such health technologies will enable Kenya to effectively decentralise wound care thus saving patients the agony of being transferred to large hospitals in urban centres that may not even have space to accommodate them .

@@22789237 <h> Here are some ways you can keep mosquitoes away <p> Mosquitoes are quite annoying to have in your home . Not only do they put one at risk of contracting Malaria , the bites cause redness , swelling and uncontrollable itching . Depending on the species , they are drawn to light , humidity , heat , odors , carbon dioxide and even sweat . <p> While many people turn to store bought repellents , a lot of them contain a pesticide known as DEET that is harmful to human health . Heavy use of DEET puts one at risk of memory loss , fatigue , headaches , muscle pain and shortness of breath . To avoid this , you can use natural ways to repel mosquitoes . Here are 8 safe ways to ward off mosquitoes you can try . <p> 1 . Use Lavender Body Oil <p> Take about 30 drops of lavender oil and mix it with 2 tablespoons of a vegetable oil such as olive or coconut oil . Apply this mix to your exposed skin .

The aroma will effectively ward them off . <p> 3 . Eat More Garlic <p> If you increase your garlic intake , garlic oil will eventually be released from the pores of your skin . This oil will act as a barrier between your skin and the mosquitoes . <p> 4 . Eliminate Stagnant Water <p> Standing water creates a great environment for female mosquitoes to lay their eggs . Look around your property and eliminate any stagnant water , no matter how little . Even a cup full or rainwater or a pet bowl full of water can act as a breeding place for mosquitoes so drain all water . <p> 5 . Soak ribbons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hate the smell of tea tree which makes it a great repellent . Soak some ribbons in tea tree oil and hang them around windows and doors to prevent any entry by mosquitoes . You can also use lavender oil for this . <p> 6 . Use baby oil <p> Another smell that mosquitoes hate is the smell of baby oil . In the evenings , slather your skin with baby oil . This will make it harder for mosquitoes to bite your skin as it is covered in oil . The oil also makes it difficult for the mosquitoes to alight on a spot and bite due to the barrier it creates on your skin . Apply the baby oil in the evenings as applying it during the day can cause sunburn in direct light . <p> 7 . Use fans <p> Mosquitoes are very weak flyers and even the slightest draft can keep them away . Make sure to prop fans around the area where you are sitting so as to keep the air around you moving and keep the little creatures away . <p> 8 . Plant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lemongrass , rosemary , lavender and basil contain a smell that mosquitoes hate .

Would this still be a good bargain ? <p> Every day , electronic devices continue to transform the world and make human life easier . Living in today 's society would be impossible without electricity and its benefits . We all depend on electricity and the gadgets and tools it powers .

Additionally , electronic waste ( e-waste ) is now Kenya 's fastest growing waste component , having a major impact on the environment -- a challenge that has strongly been attributed by environmentalists to the rising numbers of counterfeited products . <p> One can not turn a blind eye to shocking statistics and the danger these products pose not only financially but also to the health and well-being of consumers .

According to a report by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every month . More than 32 per cent of these electrical accidents occur in homes due to poor wiring and illegal connections . <p> The reality is the market is hungry for products that are cheaper and effective and hence consumers get easily swayed into purchasing counterfeits sometimes with or without their knowledge . The danger about these products is that the manufacturers are driven purely by profits and ignore basic safety standards . <p> Unlike genuine products , counterfeits do not go through a series of tests , inspections and certifications before reaching the market -- part of the reasons why they are usually very fairly priced -- a good bargain . <p> Trade in counterfeits leads to unfair competition in businesses , deny government revenues in unpaid tax but more importantly expose consumers to grave danger and sometimes fatalities .

@@22801239 <h> The Kenyan Constitution may be our only hope <p> Retired President Mwai Kibaki holds forth the Constitution of Kenya during its promulgation in 2010 . Photo : Courtesy <p> ' The trouble with Nigeria is simply and squarely a failure of leadership . There is nothing basically wrong with the Nigerian character . There is nothing wrong with the Nigerian land or climate or water or air or anything else ' . These were the words of Chinua Achebe , the Guru of Africa 's written literature . <p> Similar sentiments can be made of Kenya too . I would prefer to look at these failures through the eyes of our Constitution . The Constitution of Kenya 2010 is probably the most visionary document published in Kenya since independence . One needs to study it in its totality to understand how useful it is . But I can bet most Kenyans have never read , let alone understand the supreme law of the land . <p> There is a parallel semblance between our constitution and how affairs of spirituality are conducted . In churches and mosques and I believe the Hindu religion is not any different , their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bhagavada Geeta . These world religions are guided by these holy books that basically dictate how people conduct their social and sometime their political affairs . Adherents of these faiths make personal sacrifices to fulfill their obligations by consulting these books for spiritual guidance before making important decisions . <p> This probably explains why these religions are so resilient even in the face of adversity . In the Islamic religion , people are taught at an early age to memorise and study the Quran till they understand the content . <p> In the olden African tradition elders used to consult their oracles to predict the future or when to make important decisions . This was a way of avoiding to burden one individual , be it the chief or the spiritual leader to make important decisions on their own . <p> Indecisiveness <p> Not one single leader in olden Africa wanted to take a decision and take the blame later if the decision taken did n't work . In ' Things Fall Apart ' Chinua Achebe makes numerous references to how the Igbo in Nigeria resorted to consulting the soothsayers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Before going to war with their neighbouring tribes or clan 's , elders resorted to the advice of the oracles . According to Achebe , if a community disobeys an oracle that has forbidden going to war and the community gets defeated in such a battle , it is referred to as fight of blame . Let me explain why I am narrating this story . After all , in Africa we are a continent of story tellers , we are not really designed to read . But since we lack the oracles that can interpret for us , let me put this narrative in context . <p> The lack of understanding of the Constitution for most Kenyans is the very reason why governance is a challenge . Those who drafted the Constitution are people of knowledge and have thought through what is best for our country . <p> All the chapters in our ' holy book ' cover important issues such as fundamental human rights , issues of integrity , literally all the 18 chapters discuss important issues that every Kenyan needs to understand . The preamble , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very spiritual , starting with praising the supremacy of God . Therefore , the parallel with the African traditional religion and other religions for that matter is clear . <p> But things are falling apart in Kenya . Particularly , the recent development in Nairobi City County is a clear example of a mismatch between how we Africans used to conduct our affairs by consulting the oracles . In this case we lack a soothsayer who can interpret the constitution since it is an alien language . <p> The challenges of Nairobi city such as lack of water , garbage piles , potholes or dead street lights , indicates the leadership lacks acumen to consult the supreme document of the land on how to solve these problems . The solutions are there in plenty . Open governance as dictated by the constitution is panacea for most of these ills . But just like for Chinua Achebe 's main character , Okonkwo , things are falling apart . <p> There is a hidden issue our leaders do n't want to discuss on matters of governance . Okonkwo secretly abhorred the oracles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liked to be defeated . This pride led to his defeat and shame . <p> Eventually things fell apart in the whole society simply because some individuals failed to uphold the traditional mechanism of consultation and collective decisions making . In Kenya greed plays an important part in our failures . The Okonkwos of Nairobi seem to be heading in the same direction . They need someone to interpret for them the ' oracles ' -our constitution-otherwise I foresee doom . <p> The resignation of Deputy Governor Polycarp Igathe indicates the collective decision-making process has failed . In many other counties the same could be happening .

In 2013 , Mugabe withdrew his country from the Commonwealth after the organisation maintained Zimbabwe 's suspension indefinitely . <p> That suspension resulted , in part , from a flawed election in 2002 , when Mugabe retained power controversially . <p> Violence and intimidation during the presidential election campaign led the UK , Australia and New Zealand to express concern , and a critical report from the Commonwealth Observer Group proved to be the final nail in the coffin . <p> Thus , while Mnangagwa can expect a soft landing from the Commonwealth as a leader preaching reform , he would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ observers could easily backfire , especially if the president turns out to be less popular than he hopes . <p> Why democracy now ? Mnangagwa is not a democrat by instinct . <p> MASSACRES <p> Although he has sought to disassociate himself from the Gukurahundi massacres of the 1980s , few believe his protestations of innocence . <p> The deaths of around 20,000 mainly ethnic Ndebeles in Matabeleland occurred while he held prominent roles within the country 's security organs and his public statements around the time were telling . <p> According to The Chronicle newspaper , at a rally in Victoria Falls in 1983 , Mnangagwa likened the dissidents to cockroaches and bugs -- anticipating the language of the 1994 Rwandan genocide -- and said : " The menace has reached such epidemic proportion that the government has to bring ' DDT ' pesticide to get rid of the bandits " . <p> More recently , it is highly significant that the new president did not come to power through the ballot box but in a carefully orchestrated coup . <p> The lesson that this episode taught him was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your influence is on the wane and people you know are turning their backs on you is the military . <p> In other words , the new president is not going to believe the naive clich ? that the pen is mightier than the sword . <p> Given this , how are we to interpret his newfound commitment to democratic norms and values ? It is possible that President Mnangagwa has had a " road to Damascus " moment and that the leopard really has changed his spots ? <p> A more likely answer is that he is using the promise of democracy to pursue other ends . <p> ECONOMY <p> The president knows that Zimbabweans will judge him on the state of the economy , which looks like a tough task . <p> Despite all of the talk of a cleaner and efficient government , and of an open door for foreign investors , many are waiting to see if the government will come through on its promises before parting with their money . <p> This represents a significant challenge for President Mnangagwa , because while some of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reality is that the economy has been tanking for so long that it will take a while to turn it around . <p> One thing that could help to change this picture is debt relief . According to the International Monetary Fund , Zimbabwe will owe external lenders more than $10 billion . Because this represents over half the country 's annual Gross Domestic Product , the government 's capacity to invest in public service and economic recovery will be severely hampered unless the debt cancelled or heavily rescheduled . <p> And while that is said to be a purely economic decision by players such as the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank , in reality it is much easier to justify saving the economic bacon of governments that take and hold power legitimately . <p> But if the new leader is mainly talking up democratic reforms to unlock economic aid , what does that mean for the next election ? Might we actually see a good enough contest ? Is there a way Mnangagwa can have his cake and eat it ? <p> What does quick election @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nuts and bolts of how an election works . They make mistakes by failing to grasp key procedures and processes and agree to what they think are small changes , only to face consequences later . <p> Mnangagwa is not one of these presidents . <p> POLL MACHINE <p> Having played a central role in the Zanu-PF poll machine for years , he has an intimate knowledge of how to control the electoral commission , the mechanisms that the party uses to mobilise the vote , and is well aware of the fact that the government 's hegemony relies on a system of intimidation to keep opposition supporters away from the polls . <p> If he is floating the idea of an early election , it suggests that he thinks doing so would be to his advantage . <p> An early election could help Mnangagwa in three ways . <p> First , going to the polls quickly gives voters less time to be disappointed if the promised economic resurgence does not materialise . The longer the president leaves it , the more he will need to show some green @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the answer to the country 's financial difficulties . <p> Second , with Morgan Tsvangirai in poor health and the opposition split over whether or not he should be replaced by a younger leader , there may be no better time for the president to test his popularity . <p> Whether or not Tsvangirai asked Mnangagwa to postpone the election , it is clear the Movement for Democratic Change is not in great shape to contest one today . <p> RIGGING <p> Finally , the new president is aware that clever autocrats rig elections well in advance -- through the electoral roll , channelling of patronage manipulation of traditional leaders -- and that to detect and expose these abuses the international monitors need to have long-term observers on the ground months ahead of any contest . <p> If a snap election is called , it will be impossible for monitors to deploy in time -- even if the president keeps his promise to invite them -- because they would effectively need to be in place already . <p> A quick election might therefore be just what Zanu-PF needs . By @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ facing the opposition , and the massive headstart that the ruling party enjoys after decades of political manipulation , the government can retain power without needing to do anything on polling day that will create troublesome media headlines . <p> And by inviting international observers who will only be able to deploy close to an election day , missing the preparations , the president will be able to sustain the image of being a democratic reformer without actually having to hold a democratic election . <p> Nic Cheeseman ( @fromagehomme ) is Professor of Democracy at the University of Birmingham and the author of Democracy in Africa : Successes , failures , and the struggle for political reform .

AFP PHOTO GLYN KIRK <h> In Summary <p> ANC party leader Cyril Ramaphosa is heading to the World Economic Forum in Davos this week with a message that his country is open to business and is fighting corruption . <p> Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba said on Friday that there was a window of only three to four days in which to solve the problem . <p> By CHRIS ERASMUS <p> South Africa 's ruling African National Congress party leader Cyril Ramaphosa is heading to the World Economic Forum in Davos , Switzerland this week with a message that his country is open to business and is fighting corruption . <p> Ramaphosa said those were his two key messages , set against a much better picture of political stability . <p> But , almost as if to undermine his new boss , South African President and former ANC leader Jacob Zuma , announced he would challenge a court ruling last month that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appoint a new head of the National Prosecuting Authority . <p> State capture is the acknowledged -- even by Zuma , who has appointed a commission of inquiry into it , as ordered by the courts -- system of corruption , patronage and influence-peddling which has bedevilled the Zuma administration and led to losses of billions of dollars , mostly in state-owned enterprises . <p> SECLUSION <p> That ruling left the appointment of the head of the country 's prosecuting authority to Ramaphosa in his capacity as South Africa 's deputy president . <p> Ramaphosa made his pre-Davos comments ahead a crucial ANC " lekgotla " -- a Sotho and Tswana word for a village assembly or an assembly of leaders -- taking place this weekend . <p> Such retreats have been used by ANC as a traditionally-framed context within which to discuss matters of high importance . <p> They are held in seclusion to work out positions on difficult matters . <p> It was considered highly probable by senior ANC figures ahead of the " lekgotla " that Zuma 's obdurate refusal to bend to the will of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the presidency . <p> This was considered especially so as his refusal to accept the court finding on how conflicted he was with respect to the NPA appointment that the view from abroad , and particularly Davos , would likely be that Zuma still clings to power and is doing all he can to impede Ramaphosa and his clean-up drive . <p> CLINGS TO POWER <p> The Zuma move has dramatically increased tension within ANC caused by having twin centres of power . <p> Making matters trickier for Ramaphosa in " telling the good story " of what has happened , not only with his ANC election win last month but what is also now to come in terms of political stability and economic recovery and growth , is that the national power-producer , Eskom , is almost bankrupt . <p> Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba said on Friday that there was a window of only three to four days in which to solve the problem . <p> If not , and Eskom -- one of the key state-owned enterprises worst-hit by state capture 's effect -- failed , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> He added that , unlike South African Airways , another state-owned enterprise recently bailed out yet again , the government was in no position to do the same for Eskom . <p> Instead , efforts were being made to prevail upon entities such as the Development Bank of Southern Africa and private firms which lent Eskom money , not to call in their debts . <p> ROSIER PICTURE <p> None of that story is likely to go down well in Davos while Ramaphosa attempts to paint a much rosier picture of an essentially stable -- if not rapidly growing -- economy that is on an recovery path . <p> Counting in Ramaphosa 's favour are indications that , under his clear and decisive leadership , there have been developments in bringing to book those behind state capture . <p> The Asset Forfeiture Unit , a special enforcement arm of the security cluster of government , obtained a preservation order against international consultants McKinsey and Trillian , the latter a corporation with ties to the Gupta family considered to be at the heart of state capture , for an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had with Eskom . <p> The transactions and other questionable deals have combined to contribute to Eskom 's liquidity problems through misspending of funds . McKinsey said it had already set aside money received to be repaid , though it denied any wrongdoing . <p> Ramaphosa indirectly praised the effective seizure of ill-gotten assets , saying there was at last some long-overdue movement on state capture , but that more action was needed urgently . He urged NPA to move without fear or favour where state capture was involved . <p> THREATEN ECONOMY <p> Those comments were a direct reference to Zuma , who still retains the power to determine the terms of reference for the pending state capture inquiry he was made to order . <p> On Thursday , the NPA said three of 17 state capture-related cases were at an advanced stage . <p> It was the first public indication that investigators had done anything about a problem which is so advanced that its knock-on impacts threaten the country 's economy . <p> Ramaphosa emphasised the need to show Davos that South Africa was getting to the bottom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Thursday and Friday 's developments meant not only was the ANC " bush conference " likely to be seized by issues of state capture and related matters , but would be focused on Zuma and his continuation as head of state . <p> " Do n't be surprised to hear on Monday that Jacob is being recalled , " said an ANC insider ahead of the " lekgotla " . <p> Exactly how Ramaphosa could possibly spin latest developments in Davos without Zuma 's immediately removal from office was unclear to some of those going to the ANC gathering and to seasoned observers and diplomats .

@@23433240 <h> Question and answer : MP William Kassait speaks on his radical bill <p> Tiaty MP William Kassait Kamket of KANU wants President to serve for only one term and preside over ceremonial functions . Kipsang Joseph , Standard <p> Tiaty MP William Kassait Kamket has drafted a Bill that seeks to radically alter the country 's governance structure to hand Parliament the powers to elect a ceremonial one-term president . The Bill , which proposes the creation of the position of an executive prime minister as head of government , scraps that of the deputy president and establishes two deputy prime ministers . Our writer DANIEL PSIRMOI spoke to the MP about his Bill . <p> A : We have had issues with the Constitution of Kenya 2010 for a long time and we have been just skirting around them . We have not had time to seriously look at what went wrong with our Constitution and why election contests have become a matter of life and death . I think it is time we looked at the root cause of why elections have become so vicious and so bad to the extent that people are entertaining talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There is a lot of discontent with the way the country is being run . Why ? Because basically what we have is what can be described a ' Ferrari presidency ' . A Ferrari is a rally vehicle for two , without other passengers . This Bill intends to expand the dining table to cater for 10 people instead of being reserved for two , so to speak . Everybody will be happy and that is what every Kenyan wants . <p> Q : Is this an individual or party move ? <p> A : I came up with the Bill on my own . It is a private member 's Bill . But given the reception it has been accorded across the political divide it seems to be going to be a Bill of the whole House . It is as if everybody has been waiting for it and no one has fundamental issues with it . I am happy that I took the initiative to come up with the Bill . If the Jubilee Party , to which I belong , decides to take it over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at all . I am not in this for myself but for the Republic of Kenya and posterity . <p> Q : Outline the steps that led to the compilation ? <p> A : I followed the normal processes as a legislator , coming up with Bills being part of my cardinal responsibilities having been elected by the people of Tiaty as their representative in the National Assembly . Before formulating the Bill , I took a deep breath and considered many issues . I am not reinventing the wheel , though ; there has been an attempt before to introduce the changes I want effected . These things have been there and other jurisdictions have such systems that have worked . What is becoming clear is that the presidential system will not work for Kenyans well , and the sooner we change it the better . <p> Q : In your Bill you talk of a ceremonial president whose term will be seven years . Why seven and not five years ? <p> A : I am trying to create stability . If you look at the Bill , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the armed forces . The day-to-day administrative running of the government will be done by the PM . In as much as we will have the normal political bickering in the country , we will need to have a stabilising figure so that at the time of going to election , we already have a president in office . That is why it is important for the term of the president to overlap other elected leaders . Then also to try and bring harmony in the way things are done , knowing that if we do not do things right then there is somebody in charge . But we do n't have to call that person a president , because people are so obsessed with the name president . <p> Q : Your proposal is almost similar to NASA 's previous proposal of creating the office of a prime minister . Could you be working for or with the Opposition ? <p> A : That is cheap . I am first-time MP and I have come to Parliament with clean hands . I am a Kenyan who is alive to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only trying to do is to make an attempt to make life easier for many Kenyans and avert a political crisis in the future . The Bill , to my surprise , seems to be liked by everybody , regardless of their political affiliation . <p> Q : Some of your colleagues claim the Bill is meant to clip the wings of a senior politician from your region who is eyeing the presidency , in case he is elected to office ... <p> A : It is unfair to look at this Bill with some personalities in mind . It should be viewed as a forward-looking Bill , because that is what it is . What the Bill aspires to do is restructure the Executive and the Legislature to find a way that makes Kenya tick . Eventually those who are thinking I am targeting anyone will be overwhelmed by the massive support it will receive from the public . Along the way , they will understand that Kenya is bigger than an individual and the Bill is not meant to curtail the ambitions of anyone . We do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as it means civil war . <p> Q : How do you propose to get the numbers in the National Assembly ? <p> A : I do n't think I will have issues with numbers , everyone seems to like it . If nobody comes up with malicious reasons to block it , I see the Bill sailing through . <p> Q : Why do you want MCA 's to vote for senators ? <p> A : It is a cost-cutting measure and one that is meant to reduce confusion during elections . Having members of the public choose six representatives on election day is a daunting task . MCA 's represent various wards . Let them become an electoral college and elect the senators . It is cheaper , smarter , and trending all over the world .

It is a poignant theme as we see how difficult it was to exist as a gay man in the early 1980s even in Europe , but the story is unveiled too slowly and is boring and laborious to follow . There is nothing transformational about it ; it offers no food for thought . This one gets a 3 out of 10 . Seriously . <h> Related Content <p> Christopher Nolan fans who watch this film will be left disappointed .

It deviates from the principles of film especially in regard to character . Who is the story about ? What is their personal conflict ? Why should we invest in them ? Jumping from character to character , it fails to develop or do justice to any and this simply plods in the most boring way .

Second , the entire set up of the plot was ludicrous and in bad taste . If we are to be frank , it was a racist movie and does nothing for race relations globally . It gets a 1.5 out of 10 , and that is very generous . <p> The Darkest Hour <p> Set in May 1940 , the very same time as Dunkirk , Hitler 's invasion of Europe has the British parliament in a twist . Neville Chamberlain is kicked out as Prime Minister as his party members believe he is incapable of facing the Nazi incursion . Winston Churchill is put in his place .

Eliza befriends the strange creature in the lab , which looks like a cross of a human being and a fish .

Well the three strongest contenders are The Post , The Darkest Hour , and Three Billboardsout of Ebbing Missouri , each with more than 8 out of 10 scores . If merit is the sole factor , one of these gets to take the Best Picture award home . We could nevertheless see a decision taken to award an atrocity such as Get Out simply to assuage the racial rages that have plagued Hollywood recently .

The first and more obvious one is to persuade you of my lifelong intimate involvement in and with these educational experiments .

A useful education has to be adaptable and adaptive to the changing world . <p> My Educational Psychology professor in Dar-es-Salaam , Dr Klinghoffer , used to say that all education is a continuous experiment . The challenge is that we are actually experimenting with human beings . We must thus endeavour to ensure that the experiments do not go haywire and fatally affect the lives of those whom we are trying to educate . That is the justification for continuous adjustments . <p> Proposing a new system does not necessarily imply that the old or existing system is faulty or that it has failed . I , for example , do not believe that the 8-4-4 system was an unmitigated " disaster " , as some detractors want to portray it . My own children and many of my students were brought up in it , and they are successful national and international leaders and professionals . Their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 8-4-4 . I also insist that its making our national language , Kiswahili , a core subject through the school system was a precious gift to our national identity . <p> It is obvious , however , that in a rapidly technologising world , dominated by smartphones , social media and WhatsApp , the teaching of language , for example , has to be drastically revised . The same is true of any subject you may name . Demonstrable , hands-on skills have to be emphasised in all our content and methods . These are challenges to both teachers and learners , but therein lies the joy of our profession .

Capital gains attract tax at the rate of five per cent while trading gains attract corporate tax at a higher rate of 30 per cent . <p> Due to the higher tax yield resulting from corporate tax , the KRA is often inclined towards making corporation tax assessments whenever a tax payer , especially a company , has sold property . <p> In the recent past , the KRA has made numerous erroneous assessments relating to sale of real estate property by companies . However , most of these have been successfully challenged at the Tax Appeals Tribunal by the aggrieved tax payers . <h> Also Read <p> The line between capital gains and trading gains is thin .

This criteria , dubbed badges of trade , can be traced back to the Common Law and its application has gained universal acceptance in many jurisdictions . <p> The badges of trade provide a multifaceted approach based on the inherent characteristics of the transaction and the circumstances surrounding it . <p> The first issue to look at is whether there was a profit motive in disposing the property . If the intention of the sale was to make a profit , then the gains realised are considered to be trading gains as opposed to capital gains . <p> The motive can be inferred from the reasons for the sale . A proper reason for sale , save for profits can negate corporation tax assessment . <p> Secondly , the frequency of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If the person has made other similar transactions in the past then the trend is perceived to be of a trading nature , hence a trading gain . <p> Thirdly , the nature of financing in acquisition of the property helps in determining the intention of the tax payer . The general assumption is that if the asset was acquired though long-term financing , then the intention was not to resale it for profit . However , short-term financing connotes intention to dispose the property due to the associated costs . <p> Fourthly , modification of tangible property before the sale indicates a trading motive . If modification is done to the asset with the intention to make the asset salable or fetch better value in the market , then it is deemed to be a trading gain . <p> Fifthly , the length of ownership of the property is also considered .

@@23594239 <h> By Lucien Rajakarunanayake Courtesy The Island <p> March 10 , 2018 , 12:05 pm <p> The violent clashes in the Kandy District come more than three years after the election of a government that said much about peacebuilding , accountability , and reconciliation . In fact , reconciliation was the keyword in the Yahapalanaya or good governance propaganda . But what do we have of reconciliation today ? <p> We are caught in a wave of extremism , largely Sinhala Buddhist , as well as Tamil and Muslim , which contributes to a system of continued confrontation in politics and the wider areas of society . A land that saw the vast tragedy of Black July in 1983 , and moved on to a 30-year war against the forces of terror , moved on both sides by the impact of communal differences , is now fooling itself about the myth of reconciliation , which no political leader has any commitment to . <p> The end of the war against the terrorism of the LTTE in May 2009 was a great opportunity for those who gave the political leadership for that defeat and victory , to think in terms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not the reality . The end of that war was seen as the victory of the Sinhalese -- more particularly , Sinhala-Buddhists , and the losers saw it as the defeat of the Tamils . The victors were happy singing paeans about the glories of victory , saw the opportunities for the restoration of a feudal monarchy , and ignored the many recommendations by its own lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission ( LLRC ) on the building of genuine peace and harmony , true reconciliation in the country . <p> Military parades celebrated the anniversary of victory with hardly any action taken to build the true foundations for peace , understanding , and reconciliation . <p> It did not take very long for an ethno-religious confrontation to take place in the South , at Aluthnuwara , where the communal differences had been building up over the years , on the halal controversy , and rising voices of hatred directed at the Muslim community by the forces of disunity . The forces ready to wrongfully use the message of Buddhism , into a message of ethnic dominance , and bring about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ communal relations . And the leadership for this did come from those who paraded as the defenders of Sinhala-Buddhism , with the larger echo of Buddhism . The Bodu Bala Sena -- the Buddhist Power Army ; so much for its relevance to the core values of Buddhism -- tolerance and understanding . <p> We did have Gintota a few months ago , and more recently there was Ampara . The perceived enemy is the same . At Ampara , it was the threat of sterilization pills that could prevent reproduction among the Sinhala-Buddhist majority , to benefit a minority . This story is not new ; it has spread over some years . There are people who ask friends not to eat chocolates from the Middle East , which would make them sterile ! That is the bunkum of those against national unity , and for a majoritarian rule . <p> And now it is Kandy and its environs , where there are many areas with large Muslim populations , coming down from the days of the Kandyan kings , and very much part of the Kandyan community for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sinhala ' gey ' or family names , is of no value to those who spread ethno-religious hatred today , and will encourage violence for their cause . <p> But , what of reconciliation today ? The past three years have seen both leaders of the government -- President and Prime Minister -- move away from the core values of reconciliation . It is significant that the violence in Kandy takes place as the UNHRC is meeting in Geneva , where Sri Lanka 's record of reconciliation and accountability would be seriously considered . Having co-sponsored a resolution that has key factors of reconciliation included , they have both moved away from that resolution , and its various clauses that can cause political problems here ; whether it is foreign judges and aspects of ' war crimes ' by members of the security forces . What we hear so often is a denial of questionable clauses in the co-sponsored resolution , or the inability to enforce them . It is never a rejection of the Resolution . <p> This is the farce of reconciliation . The absence of guts or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ co-sponsored or declare that we do not accept that anymore . It is shameless to say they were not aware of the contents of the resolution . That is the humbug the country and people are treated to every day . It is the very mockery of reconciliation , and the impact of such mockery is seen in the violence in Kandy and its outskirts . The mockery of not having the strength to work towards genuine national unity , with the promised reconciliation ; it is the rejection of the promises the two leaders of the Common Candidate campaign gave to the people . <p> But it is time for those who have made a farce of reconciliation to look at the trend of popular feelings in democracies abroad . Populism is on the rise . We have seen it with the rise of Donald Trump in the USA . Of the huge rise of the extreme right-wing Alternate for Deutschland in Germany , and now the huge rise in populism in Italy , against immigration and the socialist and left-wing thinking . <p> It is good to realize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ electoral success of the SLPP . <p> That rise was certainly caused by the failure to pursue reconciliation in Sri Lanka , and the overall moves to fool the people about the pledges given about the fight against corruption and building communal harmony . <p> The events in Kandy show that communal harmony will take many more years , and will need a much better political leadership than we have in any party or colour today . We must be aware of the political leaders , with hopes for tomorrow , who say the crisis today is due to attempts to alter our constitution , to bring in federalism and alter the position of Buddhism in the Constitution . <p> Is it not time to have a more serious look at our Constitution , and whether the place that Buddhism has in it , is in any way practiced in the aspects of communal understanding or trust building .

@@23598234 <p> This strike has totally shut down learning in public universities . CS Amina Mohammed should be meeting lecturers instead of appearing to be inciting students File , Standard <p> For the third time in less than a year , university lecturers are on strike . <p> On March 1 , a seven-day notice given by the Universities Academic Staff and Union ( UASU ) expired , ushering in another bout of a strike that could have been avoided . The costs , time , resources and opportunities these regular disputes cause to stakeholders are unimaginable . <p> We have a complex situation where state institutions find no problem disregarding court anchored agreements and court orders . <p> This is unsurprising . In the last few weeks , court directives have been contemptuously ignored . Moreover , there seems to be determined efforts at trivialising legitimate expressions of labour grievances . The presser convened by Education Cabinet Secretary Amina Mohammed and university students ' leaders was in bad taste . <p> The most apparent preliminary truth is that the period between 2009 and 2013 produced the most tranquil epoch in recent history , insofar as labour disputes between UASU @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the national government then , its style of governance and universities ' labour relations then . <p> In 2013 , UASU signed a Collective Bargaining Agreement ( CBA ) that was to be implemented until 2017 . The newly minted Jubilee government , smarting from an improbable electoral win , scorned at the agreement . Mercifully , the possibility of losing to a united opposition in 2017 forced it to hurriedly and belatedly implement the CBA , which ran into arrears of billions of shillings . <p> Contempt of court <p> The government did not bother to comprehensively implement the CBA ; it literally threw money at the problem . The 2017 CBA settlement just days before the elections had all the hallmarks of vote buying . It was a gesture not too dissimilar with how long suffering uncompensated internally displaced persons ( IDPs ) were treated before the elections . The lecturers overlooked the obvious tokenism and dutifully returned to work . <p> The second hard truth is that the government is in contempt of court with regard to the current CBA . Before the elections last year , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Inter Public Universities Council Consultative Forum ( IPUCCF ) , a more or less dysfunctional outfit , signed the document which marked the end of that strike . <p> In the agreement , it was agreed that all internal 2013-17 CBAs for individual universities be completed by February 2 , 2018 . Further , it was also agreed that all outstanding employers ' contributions to pensions running into billions of shillings , and unpaid since 2010 , be factored into the next budget cycle . More crucially , it was mutually agreed that the negotiations for the 2017-21 CBA start on December 18 , 2017 and be concluded by January 31 . The document was deposited in court . This means it constitutes a legally binding agreement . <p> On December 18 , IPUCCF failed to table the governments ' response to the CBA as agreed . They asked for more time to consult and get back the next day . Nothing happened . Ten days later , the IPUCCF took UASU on a three-day dizzying maze under scorching city sun , promising to show up , but constantly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up for February 12 , nothing happened . A final one was set up on the February 21 and yet again , IPUCFF had nothing to say . <p> This leads to the third hard truth ; the government failed at the simplest and fundamental step ; to show up and dialogue . It was ironic to hear Labour CS Ukur Yattani asking the striking dons to give dialogue a chance . He went further to appoint a mediator when none was actually needed since there is no stalemate . A stalemate occurs when dialogue fails . In the case of UASU , that dialogue has not even started . <p> Lecturers are on strike because they want dialogue . This strike is a moral fight to compel the government open its ' mouth ' and talk . IPCUFF is not talking . They are talking to themselves and the press . This strike is the most needless since the collapse of white settler rule . <p> A counter offer from IPCUFF is the only legitimate entry point for dialogue . This has not happened . This strike is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fair , equitable payment structure for the dignity of dons . This strike is a plea for a functional health scheme for university lecturers . It is also a campaign to improve the welfare of doctors working in university teaching hospitals . <p> That is why the press conference called by Amina in which students purported to give lecturers 48 hours to return to work easily wins the comedy act of the year award . First , it is a vain act whose only achievement was to grant publicity to imbecility . <p> Honest talk <p> Rather than make noise on TV in rented suits , students ' leaders should instead pile pressure on government to honor the law and to show up for dialogue . What happened to students ' activism that was historically anchored on social justice ? <p> The fourth hard truth is that this strike has totally shut down learning in public universities . Last year , a few universities in Jubilee leaning areas appeared to sympathise with the beleaguered government , assuming that such poise was politically expedient in the context of a presidential election @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this strike will bite further . An attempt to use the courts to illegalise it has failed . <p> This is a polite message to parents . There is no learning happening in universities . If you truly care about the welfare of your child , allow them to come home . The idleness in campuses is fomenting unprintable experimentation . <p> The final hard truth is that if the government simply negotiated , and signed the 2017-21 CBA as legally agreed , the higher education sector will be uninterrupted with disputes for many years . But for this to happen , the government must meaningfully show up at the negotiating table .

What was happening was a total manipulation of the trading figures to generate a trading deficit , and as a justification for the bank to inject additional funds , at the expense of the plaintiffs herein , who were not party to the said trading activities , " Karuturi owners have argued . <p> Justice Tuiyot however directed that the whole amount to be settled , noting that the owners -- Surya Holdings Limited and RHEA Holdings Limited -- had admitted the pre-receivership debt and the post-receivership debt had been assessed by an audit firm selected by their consent . <p> Owners of Karuturi have disputed the Sh1.3 billion debt accrued during the receivership , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ owners prove their case at the end of the trial which is pending in the commercial division of the High Court . <p> Justice Tuiyott declined to delve into the merits of Karuturi owners ' claims of impropriety during the receivership noting that although the report had given the bank and receivers a clean bill of health , a decision on the allegations could only be made after full hearing and upon hearing the auditor 's defence of the report . <p> " The court will grant the plaintiffs an opportunity to disprove the findings of the auditor . For that reason the court restrains itself from making a holding that the findings of the auditor constitutes a final ascertainment of the post receivership debt , " said Justice Tuiyott . <p> Karuturi owners have argued that the report failed to point out instances of mismanagement by the receivers and ignored the facts made available to them.Audit firm Deloitte , has compiled a report showing that Karuturi accumulated $6.7 million ( Sh676 million ) debt during receivership , which has accrued a $2.7 million ( 272 million ) interest , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ million ) . <p> Owners of Karuturi have asked the court not to hold them liable for the new debt , because it was disbursed without their consent . <p> Productions of stem <p> Karuturi owners have challenged the alleged discrepancies in the volume of flower stems produced , and the sales as contained in Deloitte report . <p> The flower firm has maintained that there was no justification for classifying about 86 million flower stems out of the total 474 million flower stems graded as rejects . <p> The Deloitte report had indicated that only 9 million flower stems were unaccounted for and that total production peaked at 403 million out of which the receivers reported that only 373 million stems were sold . <p> The audit firm is accused of producing an erroneous report that excluded re-bunched and mixed flowers . <p> Karuturi owners claim that at the rate of 0.09 Euros per stem and using exchange rate of 1.05 of Euros to the dollar , the 86 million stems allegedly unaccounted for translates to $8.1 million ( Sh818 million ) . <p> The owners further claim that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 305 million flowers , leaving about 70 million flowers worth $9 million ( Sh909 million ) unaccounted for . <p> The Deloitte report indicates that in October 2014 the Karuturi receiver incorporated a company called Twiga BV in the Netherlands to help it handle marketing , sales and invoicing and that most of the sales were thereafter channeled through Twiga BV 's bank accounts . <p> Stanbic , through the receiver managers , is further accused of using suppressed exchange rates when converting from Euro to the dollar leading to loss of $4 million ( Sh404 million ) . <p> Stanbic has in response argued that the alleged discrepancies are erroneously derived and meant to divert the attention from the findings of the audit report . The bank has asked the court to dismiss the allegations . <p> Owners Karuturi this week announced they had reached an agreement with Phoenix Group for a " blend of debt and equity " that will help them meet current debt obligations and restart operations .

PHOTO DIANA NGILA NATION MEDIA GROUP <p> The counties of Turkana , Mandera , Samburu , Garissa , Busia and West Pokot are some of the poorest in the country , with majority of residents starving due to an inability to pay for basic food commodities . <p> The residents of these regions live on less than Sh3,252 monthly , translating to below Sh100 every day for food and basic commodities , according to the latest data by the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics . <p> Nationally , the overall rate of poverty declined by about 10 per cent in the 10 year period that the report covered , a drop similar to that of other African countries and which has been attributed to significant investments made in maternal and child healthcare , improved living standards and higher enrolments in schools . <p> RURALBut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ donor and development partners as well as other agencies in improving the economic conditions of citizens , the burden of the poor is still significant . <p> About one in every three individuals in Kenya is unable to consume the minimum daily calorific requirement of 2,250 Kcal as per their expenditure on food , says the Kenya Integrated Household Budget Survey report for the year 2015/16 , which was released today . <p> The proportion of poor children is larger than that of adults and more in rural than in urban areas , showing that poverty appears to be predominantly a rural phenomenon . <p> In the six worst hit counties for instance , more than one third of the total population live in conditions of extreme poverty , meaning that they can not afford the minimum food consumption basket . <p> FOODThe concentrations are also found in the counties of Kajiado , Kitui and Uasin Gishu . <p> " Turkana County had its figures at 52.7 per cent , Samburu ( 42.2 per cent ) , Mandera ( 38.9 per cent ) , Busia ( 26.8 per cent ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at 23.8 per cent , " Mr Zachary Mwangi , the bureau director-general said in Nairobi . <p> These percentages , when broken down in actual numbers , indicated that on overall , about 16.4 million Kenyans live in poverty across the country . <p> A further breakdown of the figures indicate that poverty remains highest in rural areas where 11.4 million are poor compared to 900,000 and 3.8 million in peri-urban and core-urban areas respectively . <p> " About 3.9 million Kenyans live in conditions of abject poverty and are unable to afford the minimum required food consumption basket even if they allocated all their expenditure on food alone , " Mr Mwangi said . <p> " The extreme poverty incidences remain high in rural areas where 3.2 million individuals were hardcore poor . <p> " The results further showed that six per cent of households were extremely poor , " he added . <p> ENERGYFemale-headed households had relatively higher poverty rates compared to their male counterparts while households in polygamous unions are relatively poorer than those in monogamous unions , the report says . <p> The prices of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bread , wheat flour and dry beans also doubled , and in some instances tripled as a result of prolonged droughts and increase in fuel prices . <p> However , prices of kerosene and petrol rose by only 10 per cent over the same period mainly due to the decline in the international oil prices that started in 2014 through to 2016 . <p> " The prices of the commodities doubled during the period except those of 2kg wheat flour , which increased by 30 per cent , " the report adds . <p> " The prices of dry beans and rice grade II recorded the highest growths , rising by more than three times during the reference period . " <p> INCOMEOn the flipside , the country experienced improved economic growth in the period under study , from a figure of three per cent to about 5.2 per cent . <p> The growth was attributed to private consumption due to increase in the number of disposable income , improved access to credit facilities , the stabilization of the shilling against other major currencies as well as robust manufacturing and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the improved economic outlook of the country , the report notes . <p> " The recovery of growth in the global arena also supported domestic growth during the period as external demand for local goods and services increased . <p> " The establishment of county governments also imparted positively on economic growth as public consumption expenditure rose . " <p> SOLUTIONDevolution was also hailed as the biggest contributor to the country 's growth as it opened up the once marginalised parts of the country as well as improved healthcare system and agricultural services , both of which are devolved . <p> And to reverse the inequalities , the report suggested a shift in the distribution of incomes that favour poorer people , strengthening of labour markets and increased access to healthcare , education , water and sanitation.

@@23829231 <h> by C.A. Chandraprema Courtesy The Island <p> The no confidence motion against Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe has taken the political centrestage . In normal circumstances , this no confidence motion need not have been taken seriously at all . The UNP has 106 MPs and their allies the TNA has 17 and that alone would have sufficed to render the no confidence motion redundant even before it was taken up for debate . But this no confidence motion was not presented in parliament under normal circumstances . The Joint Opposition which submitted the motion has only 52 MPs . The SLFP group in the government which may support it , another 44 , bringing the total number of those who may vote for the motion to a maximum of 96 . It is certain that not all in the SLFP group will vote for this no confidence motion even if President Sirisena asks them to vote for it . There is a very strong possibility that up to ten SLFP members may vote against the no confidence motion . <p> Going by those numbers , this motion should be dead in the water from the moment it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it has become a major issue is the ever increasing possibility of a revolt within the UNP itself . This revolt is not necessarily due to the due to the inherent merits of the no confidence motion but due to a long standing need within the UNP to get rid of their leader . The Joint Opposition realising that this is the most effective sales pitch for the no confidence motion , has been plumbing that line for all they are worth . Some of the posts that appeared during the past few days on facebook pages sympathetic to the JO went as follows : <p> " This is not against the government . It 's against Ranil . " <p> " If you keep Ranil on as leader you will have to field an outsider as presidential candidate again . Are you going to remove Ranil and have a proper UNP candidate contesting the presidency the next time at least ? The choice is yours ! " <p> " Ranil has been your leader since 1994 and you have been defeated 30 times . He used Sirisena and managed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . If you do n't get rid of Ranil at least this time , your party will have no future until he dies " . <p> " Are you going to have Ranil as the party leader until he dies or are you going to get rid of him while you have the chance to do so ? It 's up to the UNP to decide " . <p> " Even though you thought Ranil was a master brain ( molaya ) , you now realize he is just a potato ( alaya ) incapable of doing anything . He has destroyed the economy , the country and your party as well and created a situation where people retch at the mention of the UNP . At least now shall we see whether he can be removed , and the party leadership given to some capable person ? " <p> These are the kind of posts that should have appeared on the facebook page of a UNP dissident like Maithri Gunaratne , but they all appeared in well known pro-SLPP facebook pages . The JO is not going on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it does have inherent merits . The motion concentrates mainly on various aspects of the bond scam and the Prime Minister 's role in making it possible and the attempts he made to sweep the whole thing under the carpet after the scam took place . The failure to take prompt action to prevent the Sinhala Muslim clashes in Kandy while being the Law and Order Minister has also been tagged on to the no confidence motion . What the Joint Opposition has done is to give the UNP members of parliament the tantalizing and virtually irresistible prospect of being able to get rid of Ranil . If he loses the premiership , he will not be able to remain as party leader . By ousting Ranil , the UNP need not give up what they have because some other candidate from the UNP can be appointed prime minister and they can continue to be a partner in the government . So on the face of it , the UNP appears to have nothing to lose and everything to gain by backing the no confidence motion against their own leader @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when any member of the UNP thinks about the future , all that he can see will be absolute darkness . The UNP was soundly defeated at the local government elections even though no government in power has lost a local government election . So when it comes to the provincial council elections , what is certain is defeat once again . Thereafter the presidential elections will be held towards the end of 2019 and there is no prospect of any UNP candidate winning that either . In fact the UNP would be hard put to find a suitable candidate to even field at the 2019 presidentail election . If they field RW , he would have lost even before the contest . <p> If they were to field someone else at the 2019 presidentail elections while RW remains the leader of the party and Prime Minister , once again the UNP candidate will be seriously hobbled and have no prospect of winning . In fact if the candidate is not the leader of the party one can expect the incumbent leader to do his damnest to defeat his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that RW would lose his job as leader of the UNP . Back in 1982 , when the SLFP fielded Hector Kobbekaduwa , the Bandaranaike family was openly hostile to the thought of a Kobbekaduwa victory . So the UNP can not field someone else as their candidate either . <p> Someone could argue however , that if the UNP changes its leader now and appoints a new Prime Minister , the renewal in the party may give the UNP at least a fighting chance at the forthcoming provincial council elections and the presidential elections next year . Thus the temptation to use this opportunity to evict Ranil Wickremasinghe will be very strong indeed . After the defeat of the ruling coalition at the recent local government elections , it was the SLFP that first said that they can not continue with Ranil Wickremesinghe as the Prime Minister . They were in fact mooting the possibility of moving a no confidence motion against Ranil and appointing an SLFP Prime Minister with the support of the Joint Opposition . Later , the refrain was taken up by some members of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hinting that they may support a no confidence motion against the Prime Minister . There is a large constituency in the UNP which regards this no-confidence motion as an opportunity to get rid of Ranil . <p> Given the fact that the no confidence motion is being moved by the enemy one would think that members of the UNP would be diffident about availing themselves of this opportunity to get rid of RW . How will the UNP rank and file react to the idea of UNP parliamentarians voting for a no confidence motion brought against their own leader ? However , given the fact that there have been many internal rebellions within the UNP and all of them have failed to get rid of RW , this latest opportunity that has opened up may be too tantalizing to resist . Furthermore , since the UNP rank and file are also not happy with RW , they may not mind if their MPs vote for the no confidence motion for the purpose of getting rid of RW . The desire to be rid of Ranil Wickremesinghe is much greater within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the premiership through this no confidence motion , he will not be able to retain control of the UNP any longer . <h> The foreign dimension <p> However , it will be a mistake to take into account only the local factors in relation to the politics of the present government . One must not forget that foreign parties had much to do with bringing this sgovernment into power and they will want to protect their investment . One of the biggest strengths that RW has is the fact that the foreign powers that brought this government into power need him much more than any other leader in the coalition government . The whole yahapalana project will be different without Ranil . <p> It is his single minded willingness to submit to foreign diktat that makes RW such a valuable ally to the foreign powers . He is not following foreign diktat reluctantly , simply for the sake of power . He is in fact even more convinced than the foreign powers themselves that that foreigners are always right and that Sri Lanka should be governed the way the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ client that any foreign patron could hope for , and they are not going to allow him to be ousted if they can help it . The constitutional reform process to devolve power to nine semi independent provincial units , the UNHRC resolution 30/1 whereby Sri Lanka has undertaken to institute war crimes tribunals with foreign judges , the proposed ETCA with India , the 99 year lease of the Hambantota harbor are all associated with Ranil Wickremasinghe and his immediate cabal of friends including Mangala Samaraweera . <p> The foreign powers know that dissesnsion that takes place within political parties is often if not always based on someone not getting what he wants . Maithriapala Sirisena turned his back on Mahinda Rajapaksa because he was not given the premiership . Except in rare instances when a particular position is being aimed at for the sake of prestige , the reason why people are interested in positions is mostly to make money or to establish oneself politically using the resources and the employment generating capacity of the position concerned . Hence the foreign powers know that if the right amount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to retain the support of digrantled elements within the UNP . From what we have heard being said inside and outside parliament , such an operation is already in progress . <h> What will the Joint Opposition gain ? <p> Conventional wisdom would indicate that it is disadvantageous for the JO to get rid of Ranil Wickremesinghe at this point in time and the best option for them would be to allow RW to remain until the presidential elections next year so that the SLPP would be able to harvest the resentment created among the general public . By getting rid of RW , they will be helping to rid the UNP of its biggest liability and thereby they will be freeing and rejuvenating the UNP and making it stronger , not weaker . A new leader , regardless of who he is , will do better than RW in that job and a change in leadership may see many of those who left the UNP due to differences with RW rallying around the party again and that would make things tougher for the SLPP at the next presidential elections @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the minority vote as well and a rejuvenated UNP may be a formidable enemy indeed . <p> Even though that is the conventional view , there is also the well founded view that the UNP is far too gone today for even a change of leadership to be able to rejuvenate it . Furthermore , there is the feeling that if RW is kept on till the presidential elections next year , and a change of leadership in the UNP takes only after if it is defeated , then the next government will face a new and rejuvenated UNP under a new leader . It will be better for the SLPP if the UNP starts off again with yet another defeated leader . If RW is ousted now , the next leader will be taking over a major mess and he too will not be able to turn back the tide . In fact , it is unlikely that a new leader will even want to take over at this point in time . What we may see will most probably be a stop-gap leader who will take the consequences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the event that the UNP is defeated at the next presidential election . <p> Thereafter the next leader who takes over will have a difficult time trying to convince the party rank and file that he did not dive under the bed during the crisis . Anyone trying to build up his leadership credentials should have the courage to take on the leadership of the party at its worst moment , when the party is down and out in the immediate aftermath of Ranil 's ouster ( if it takes place ) . It is only then that he will be able to claim that he took on the challenge head on without ducking for cover and thinking about himself rather than the party . If the UNP gets rid of Ranil by supporting the no confidence motion , what they will need after that will be a willing Don Quixote to tilt at the Rajapaksa windmill . Anyone who refuses to play Don Quixote and sends someone else to the frontlines , will not be able to claim that he took on the challenge when the party needed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and loses , then he too will begin his tenure as a loser . So the potential successors to RW will be on the horns of a major dilemma due to this no confidence motion . Rather than allowing a new leader of the UNP to make fresh start after an electoral defeat , there is a clear long term political advantage to the SLPP in forcing change upon the UNP and then making them fail even after the change . The potential leaders who could replace RW are undoubtedly aware of this , which is why we do not see any of them saying anything against RW at this moment . The best option for any potential successor would be to allow RW to continue as the party leader and prime minister until the next presidential and parliamentary elections and after RW leads the UNP into another debacle and calls it a day , to come in as a new leader . <p> So to the question whether getting rid of Ranil will help the UNP at this stage , the answer is that it may not . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at this stage will queer the pitch for his successor as well and plunge the UNP into yet another crisis . After the multiple disasters of the past two and a half decades , anyone who succeeds RW will have to come in as a fresh face , with no record of defeat or disaster to his name . <h> Sudath Chandrasekera 's resignation <p> It would be an understament to say that Sudath Chandrasekera 's widely circulated letter of resignation has sent shockwaves through the UNP . There is no one in the UNP who does not know Sudath . He had been a member of Wickremesinghe 's personal entourage from the mid-1980s . The fact that he chose this moment to decamp and to make public the reasons for his decision is significant . No doubt there is an element of abandoning a sinking ship in all this , but what Sudath has said in his letter finds resonance within the UNP from top to bottom . Coming from someone who has been a member of RW 's inner circle for more than three decades , it confirms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has spoken of the manner in which RW tended to go into a world of his own whenever he had power and that all problems emanated from this propensity . Sudath has also said that RW did not know the meaning of the word gratitude and that he showed even a glimmer of it only when he was down and desperate . <p> Sudath has also articulated several grievances which are heard quite often in the UNP such as not being able to do anything for the UNP activists he organized to ensure the victory of the party . One case he has mentioned in particular is the kurundu polu clash that took place in Matara in 2014 which he has admitted to jointly organizing with Mangala Samaraweera to stop the march that was started from Devundara to Colombo by Maithri Gunaratne and Shiral Laktilleke demanding that RW resign from the party leadership . Sudath had said that if that march had been allowed to reach Colombo , Ranil would not now be sitting in the PM 's chair . Sudath had stated that RW never summoned and thanked the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ involvement in that clash and that nothing had been done for any of them either and that they were now reduced to selling their jewellery and property to meet the costs of litigation . <p> In fact , from the time this government came into power , political activists in the Matara district had been keeping a close watch on those who had participated in the kurundu polu clash to see whether they had got employment or other benefits because that would be a sign that something was available for them also to be able to stake their claims . Hence the fact that the kurundu polu hamudawa had got nothing from this government , was known to this writer independently . Ranil Wickremesinghe never took politics seriously . For him , politics and all that went on in the name of politics was one huge ' gon paat ' . His contempt for the hoi polloi was barely disguised . He reveled at pitting one candidate for a position against another and watching them fight like cats and dogs for the crumbs that fall from his table . Today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no confidence motion which in normal circumstances would not have had a snowflake 's chance in hell of succeeding , has assumed the proportions of a career endangering challenge <h> Leave a Reply <p> Disclaimer : The comments contained within this website are personal reflection only and do not necessarily reflect the views of the LankaWeb .

Mamo Waldo won the Olympics gold while Tanzanian John Stephen Akhwari finished last , but will be remembered for bravely battling through a bad fall to cross the line bloodied and battered . PHOTO FILE NATION MEDIA GROUP <h> In Summary <p> Worse for wear , the badly injured runner came in last at the 1968 Mexico City Olympics games , over an hour after all other runners had crossed the finishing . His brave ' victory ' captured the imagination of the world and his home nation . <p> In the countdown to the sound of the starting gun of the Gold Coast 2018 Commonwealth Games , we return to the story of John Stephen Akhwari . <p> Once long ago , he pushed his body to the farthest limits of human endurance and then gave the world of sports one of its most evocative statements about sacrifice and loyalty . Now is as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the coming weeks , a man or a woman may yet find themselves in his circumstances and be inspired to rise beyond their pain and expand the boundaries of human possibilities . <p> Before telling you this story , let me digress a bit . In the run-up to the 1984 Olympics , I read a story of how Ryohei Kanokogi , the famed Japanese judo teacher , wept all night long as he read the biography of Yasuhiro Yamashita , the greatest judoka of all time . I read the story of Akhwari in 2000 and I did n't weep despite my emotions . Instead , over and over , I read Dennis Brutus ' short poem in his collection , Stubborn Hope , which goes thus : <p> " Endurance is the ultimate virtue/more , the essential thread on which existence is strung when one is stripped to nothing else/and not to endure is to end in despair . " <p> In the Tanzania of 1968 , as indeed in most of the developing world , athletics training methods were rudimentary and the science would only come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of taking advantage of the slopes of Mt Kilimanjaro , Africa 's highest mountain , to train the nation 's athletes for the Olympic Games of that year which would take place in the thin air of high Mexico City . <p> Tanzania sent four athletes to those Games , Akhwari among them . Beyond basic preparations in the coastal capital of Dar es Salaam to augment their natural talent , they took with them only an athlete 's innate drive to excel and the nationalism imbued in them by their country 's founder and president , Mwalimu Julius Nyerere . Akhwari actually hailed from the Kilimanjaro area where he tilled the fields as a peasant farmer and ran the 10,000 metres and the marathon during his spare time . But the heights of Kilimanjaro 's slopes would prove to be of no help to him in Mexico . <p> The starting field of the Mexico ' 68 marathon featured 75 runners . Of these , 18 would drop out as the altitude took its toll . Akhwari , an African marathon champion who routinely posted times in the range @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world 's elite , started experiencing difficulties almost as soon as the race started . He suffered muscle cramps and hung at the back of the pack from where he would come across the anguished casualties as they fell by the wayside one by one . <p> ' NARROWED THE GAP ' <p> Despite his discomfort , Akhwari decided to narrow the gap with the leaders . He marginally improved his position only for the catastrophe that would put his name in Olympic lore to occur . Jostling for position , a group of runners were involved in a pile-up . This happened when the group was approaching the 21-kilometre mark of the race . The incident was serious and some of the runners tumbled heavily onto the tarmac . <p> Akhwari was one of those who suffered this fate and he dislocated his right knee . Blood gashed from the gaping wound . Picking himself up , he realised that his shoulder was also bruised by the hard surface and now an intense pain was assailing him from head to toe . Looking at his desperate condition , medical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But Akhwari refused . <p> The medics now had to go against their own advice and help him . Perplexed and overwhelmed by his courage , they carefully bandaged his knee and treated his shoulder before allowing him to proceed . Now limping badly , he fell to the back of the field , way far behind the next to last runner , and the distance between them kept increasing . <p> Mamo Waldo of Ethiopia , ever so comfortable with the Mexico altitude and having no difficulties of any kind , was leading the pack of 57 competitors still in the race . And 2hr:20min:26sec after start , Wolde crossed the finish line a worthy winner and accepted the thunderous cheers of the massive crowd packing the stands of Estadio Ol ? mpico Universitario , oblivious of the superhuman effort taking place far back in the course that he had run . <p> More than one hour after Wolde 's victory , darkness was falling over the stadium and the last spectators were going home after a memorable day of athletics . <p> And then an announcement came through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his way to the finish . Many spectators returned to the stands and a television crew raced along the marathon course . <p> And there was Akhwari , limping heavily on his injured knee , barely able to walk but every now and then still attempting to run . Some people winced at his every limp as if it was they who were feeling the excruciating pain in his bones and the exhaustion in his lungs . But all of them broke into the loudest cheer they had ever given a competitor . These cheers carried Akhwari over the finish line . <p> His time was 3hr : 25min : 27sec -- about one hour and five minutes after Wolde . But the race , in the grateful judgment of history , is always remembered as Akhwari 's , not Wolde 's -- without taking anything away from Wolde . <p> The journalists who talked to Akhwari after the race asked him the one question on everybody 's mind : why did he endure such punishing circumstances when retiring would have been so perfectly understandable ? That is when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ memorable in Olympic history . <p> He said : " My country did not send me 5,000 miles to start the race . They sent me 5,000 miles to finish the race . " <p> NEVER FORGOTTEN <p> Tanzania has never forgotten this performance and neither has the world . In 1983 , Akhwari was awarded a National Hero Medal of Honour . He was a distinguished guest to the Olympic Games of Sydney in 2000 and a goodwill ambassador to those of Beijing in 2008 . He has a charity , the John Stephen Akhwari Athletic Foundation which supports young Tanzanians who aspire to run at the Olympics and other major competitions . <p> Tanzania , once the source of some of Africa 's best distance runners , has long ceded that ground to Kenya and Ethiopia . But the legend of John Stephen Akhwari goes on and wo n't die as long as an Olympic or Commonwealth Games torch burns over any city in the world . The Olympic commentator who was so awestruck by his endurance in that race that he intoned " a voice calls from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " spoke as much for that moment as for the future . <p> **** <p> I covered the 1982 Commonwealth Games in Brisbane for Nation Sport . Brisbane is just next to Gold Coast and I went there several times to have fun during gaps in the work . Let me tell you two stories from that assignment . <p> First story : The opening ceremonies at the Queen Elizabeth II Stadium ( QEII ) were the most magnificent I had witnessed in my life . Understandable , of course , because I had not been to a similar event before . The highlight of the programme was a spectacular parachute jump over the city . When the skydivers landed dead in the centre of the pitch , they were given a long round of applause and the clapping went on until they disappeared into the main stadium exit . <p> Three days later , I read a story in one of the newspapers that the running of the Games was going on with clockwork precision , in part because all the rules were being enforced and no quarter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skydivers who participated in the opening ceremonies were quickly arrested and whisked away from QEII when it was discovered that they did not have accreditation badges to enter the stadium . <p> I remember thinking : It is well and proper to obey rules but is n't that taking it a bit too far ? <p> Second story : The Prime Minister of Australia in 1982 was a gentleman called Malcom Fraser . He was , of course , one of the dignitaries attending the opening ceremonies . <p> When the programme was over , people started leaving the stadium . From the Press Centre , which was adjacent to the VIP Stand , I walked down the steps towards the main exit . <p> We mingled with all manner of people , mainly dignitaries . On looking around , I noticed that the person directly in front of me was Fraser . He had his hands in his pockets and was engrossed in a conversation with another man . Fraser was just another person in the crowd and I did n't see anybody take a particular interest in him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ car and his driver took off . He might as well have jumped into a taxi . <p> At dinner time that evening and still incredulous at what I had witnessed , I asked Mbogo wa Kamau , the chairman of the then Kenya Olympic Association , how Australia 's Prime Minister could walk around like the next guy seemingly without a care in the world . Is n't that great , I probed Mbogo , do you think our African leaders can do the same ? <p> This was his answer : " An African president has very many enemies . He needs a lot of security . The way these people live here , the prime minister does n't need security . But it 's not advisable for us to try it . " Mbogo was a senior superintendent of police before running the KOA . <p> I was struck by the certainty in his tone . He spoke as if he was stating scientifically proven facts . And maybe he was ; security for our MPs is one of our major national problems . Do n't even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @

It was so from the day one -- 8th January , 2015 of their coming into political power when Maithripala Sirisena was elected President of Sri Lanka . <p> Of course there were those who expected a Rupees ten thousand salary increase , and others who expected goods rolling in from USA and the West brining in a life of luxury in prosperity who voted to bring this Yahapalanaya into power . The cry of out with the corrupt and the rogues " , intensified adding to the hopes of Government coffers getting filled with money that was supposed to have been stolen by the President Mahinda Rajapaksa 's previous governments . <p> The Media rolled up their shirt sleeves and some like Shauketali in News First said Oh wow and so he tracked journalists shot them beat em up lies through his teeth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !

They demand not to give any special recognition to Buddhism , have no- Wesak Pandals , and demand the arrest of Buddhist Monks who demand the government to protect the Sinhala Language , and the Buddhist Culture . <p> They of the Yahapalanaya do not want the history of Sri Lanka taught in Schools . They want to teach children sexology in schools , and introduce Western culture into Society . <p> In the world , Cuba existed as Cuba hemmed between USA and the West , Taiwan , remained Taiwan , Singapore stayed Singapore , Malayasia remained Malaysia ... but Yahapalanaya goons want Sri Lanka modernised making Sri Lanka-a Singapore , a Malaysia , a small England . They do not want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unique culture , its unique Buddhist Generosity , its way of life , its unique unity with Communities with their different cultures . <p> Sri Lanka under Sirisena Ranil Yahapalanaya is fast moving toward decadence . Before Sri Lanka reaches a point of no return from degeneration , the people have to wake up to take Sri Lanka back to what it had been before the 8th January , 2015- a Sri Lanka which was developing fast , as a unique nation of its own despite an unfriendly Indian neighbour and an interfering west using the UN Stystem to make Sri Lanka a poor country dependent on the scheming rogue states of the West . <p> Before that happens the progressive Parliamentarians should wake up to pass the presented No Confidence Motion against the Prime Minister of Sri Lanka and force Sri Lanka back in to the progressive and developing past from which it had been wrenched by the Vicious Sirisena Ranil Chandrika Yahapalanaya following a USA Western Agenda . <p> For the Yahapalanaya Government of Sirisena- Ranil , reconciliation with Tamils has taken paramount importance . Every thing of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a reconciliation with the Tamils . Neither Sirisena nor Ranil seem to understand that more they give into reconciliation with the Tamils , the Tamils tenaciously stand by their demand for more devolution and instead of reconciling with the Sinhala they strengthen their separatist ideology , condemning the Sinhala and demanding a federal Constitution to create there own federal provinces in the North and East .. <p> Even the writing of a new constitution under Ranil Sirisena Government is no more an affair of the Sinhala people . A new Constitution to Sri Lanka is being prepared under the supervision and direction of the US Ambassador Athul Keshup , Indian Government , Global Tamil Federation , Sampanthan , Sumanthiran , Wigneswaran and Mano Ganeshan . <p> How could we under the so called Yahapalanaya Government of Sirisena -- Ranil , get back the now lost pride , and glory of Sri Lanka and prepare its approach to modernity preserving its unique Buddhist culture ? <p> A strong Sinhala Buddhist Cultural background , assures unity of different cultures and create a healthy multicultural relationship amoung the peoples of Sri Lanka . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kanthar Balanathan , Radha Manohar who understand the reality of good relation ship with all communities sharing Sri Lanka as their motherland without causing antoganism between the major and minority Communities .

This Yahapalanaya Governments accepting on its knees a resolution against Sri Lanka and its Armed Forces presented by America and the West , was a sell off of Sri Lanka to foreign powers . <p> It is high time that the people of Sri Lanka rise against this Yahapalanaya government and get rid of it for good . <p> It would therefore be a beginning to vote for the No Confidence Motion against the Prime Minister Ranil Wickramasinghe which is to be debated in Parliament on the 4th April , 2018. the <h> 6 Responses to " Vote now for the NCM against Prime Minister to stop Sri Lanka reaching a point of no-return from decadence .

They will need a faultless one next Tuesday . <p> Manchester City started well and in composed fashion as they attempted to douse the flames of a fiery Anfield atmosphere - but it all went wrong from the moment they conceded the first goal to the prolific Salah . <p> City 's defence , so rarely put under stress this season , was a mess as Ederson saved from Firmino , Kyle Walker clearing the ball back into the Brazilian 's path to set up Salah , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> It gave Liverpool the perfect start and they doubled that advantage eight minutes later when James Milner nicked possession and City 's rearguard inexplicably stood off Oxlade-Chamberlain , offering an open invitation he accepted by rifling a powerful rising finish past Ederson . <p> There must also be questions about how the diminutive Mane was allowed to rise with ease between Walker and Vincent Kompany to head Liverpool 's third just after the half-hour . <p> City 's normally precise attacking play was beyond them in the second half when they did finally claim the share of possession they craved as they attacked The Kop end . <p> They were able to fashion several dangerous positions but were sloppy and wasteful as Liverpool avoided any moments of serious anxiety . <p> Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp was in celebratory mood after the final whistle as he applauded The Kop and whirled his fists in front of Anfield 's giant Main Stand . <p> It was easy to see why - but Liverpool will be taking nothing for granted against a side of City 's quality and attacking threat . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ result they would have dreamed of before kick-off with a three-goal lead to take into the second leg and that vital clean sheet to act as added insurance . <p> And , significantly , Liverpool have just the sort of attack to punish a team pushing for goals , as City will need to do next Tuesday . <p> Guardiola , whose team could clinch the title if they beat Manchester United at Etihad Stadium on Saturday , will not be giving this one up yet but City will need to be flawless in all the areas they were flaky here if they are to mount one of the great Champions League comebacks . <p> There is no shortage of big games coming up for these two sides . <p> Up next for Liverpool is the Merseyside derby , as they travel to Goodison to take on Everton on Saturday ( 12:30 BST ) while Manchester City host rivals Manchester United at Etihad Stadium on the same day ( 17:30 ) . <p> A win for Pep Guardiola 's side and they will be confirmed as Premier League champions . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ headline stories in your email inbox every morning <p> STAR COMMUNITY POLICY AND PARTICIPATION GUIDLINES <p> Thank you for participating in discussions on The Star , Kenya website .

@@24056236 <p> Political tectonic plates in Kenya literally paused , and fundamentally shifted early last month after President Uhuru Kenyatta and Raila Odinga shook hands and committed to work together for the greater good . They opened up debate about what exactly was discussed and the implications on Kenya 's political formation and succession politics as we march towards 2022 . <p> The two released a well-authored document launching an initiative aimed at establishing a ' united nation ' for all Kenyans ; outlined the historical context of the situation in Kenya , including the ethnic antagonism and divisive political competition and the lack of a national ethos ; committed to reject violence as a means of settling inter-communal scores . <p> They identified corruption as an existential threat to Kenya that has been passed to the younger generation , and committed not to allow political affiliation to be used as a shield by those who practice it ; committed to ensure a shared prosperity for all , including creating a conducive environment for innovation and investment ; and , emphasised the importance of civil rights and the responsibilities that every leader and Kenyan bears . <p> Their joint agreement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Two ; an admission by Treasury CS Henry Rotich that Kenya is in fact broke ; a deal with the IMF that would see fuel prices rise ; a damning Auditor General 's report indicating massive audit queries ; and , the burial of Meru University student leader Evans ' Kidero ' Njoroge , who died at th hands of the police . <p> In their statement , they acknowledged ethnicity had reached unprecedented levels . However , I did not hear them own up that some of their closest political lieutenants and confidants were infamous for stoking ethnic hate and chauvinism that has perpetuated division in Kenya . It will be interesting to see how these individuals reinvent themselves as crusaders of peace and reconciliation . <p> SIMILAR AGREEMENTS <p> Over Kenya 's history , similar agreements have been struck in the face of hotly contested elections , violent repression of dissent by state machinery and ethnic and political polarisation . In 1997 , the Inter-Parties Parliamentary Group Forum between Kanu , DP , Ford Kenya , Ford Asili and Safina made political concessions on selection of the Electoral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ civil rights , such as the removing the provision that required planners to obtain a permit from the police before holding political meetings or rallies . <p> The IPPG paved the way for the smooth running of the 2002 polls because all parties felt represented within the ECK . Ten years later in 2008 , another crisis led to the National Accord , an agreement between PNU , the government side , and opposition ODM after the hotly contested 2007 election , which was marred by allegations of rigging . <p> It opened old wounds and led to unprecedented ethnic clashes that caused over 1,000 deaths , thousands more injured and over a half a million internally displaced . <p> Unlike the IPPG framework , ECK officials had been handpicked by President Mwai Kibaki , thus causing anxiety about their impartiality among other actors . Moreover , the promise of a new Constitution had been thwarted mainly because of tribal interests . <p> Does this sound familiar ?

@@24056237 <h> Musa decries poor boxing standards in Kenya and the region <p> Former national coach Benjamin Musa has decried the poor standards of boxing in the East Africa region and Africa as a whole and predicted doom if the situation does n't change . <p> Musa said gone are the days when the region used to be a force to reckon with in the discipline . He said there is a major gap especially in Kenya in as far as boxing is concerned and that the country will soon grind to halt if urgent measures are not put in place . Musa also lamented that there are no longer youth structures hence they are forced to rely on fairly old crop of boxers . <p> " Rising kids are no longer inspired to take up boxing because there is little to celebrate . You can imagine the generation that sprung up after the late Robert Wangila won gold in 1988 Olympics in Seoul , South Korea , " he quipped . " The country has forgotten about feeder programs that used to supply the national team . " <p> Musa , who is currently coaching the Tanzanian national team @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the current education system has worsened matters . <p> " Pupils no longer have time to discover themselves in various fields and it is all about books . During our time , we used to proceed for sports at 4pm , immediately after classes , and that is why we had a lot of talent , " he added . <p> He said the current crop of over age boxers will last a little longer because they no longer have options . " Young players are not coming through and we are forced to rely on the older generation , " he noted . " We have to revive the social halls in the estates and encourage youngsters to take up boxing . " <p> He said teams like Posta , Kenya Airways , Breweries among other clubs no longer exist hence the current problems , adding that Boxing Association of Kenya leadership has also performed below par as the standards continue to plummet . <p> Subscribe to our FREE Newsletter <p> Get the Star headline stories in your email inbox every morning <p> STAR COMMUNITY POLICY AND PARTICIPATION @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Star , Kenya website .

@@24056238 <h> State justified to deport Miguna Miguna , says former aide to Raila <p> IT IS not so much that I only rarely agree with the government , more something that I believe has never happened before . But in the ongoing Miguna Miguna passport case , the government has my sympathies . <p> I believe that Miguna is completely in the wrong according to the law , as well as under international citizenship conventions . And I believe both he and his lawyers know this very well . The latter probably now find themselves between a rock and a very hard place . <p> First , it is necessary to understand what Miguna Miguna is . I have worked with him in the past . He can be charming and soft-spoken when he wants to be , and at first I admired his apparent intelligence . <p> But nothing about Miguna 's demeanour -- charming or furious -- is accidental . Everything with Miguna is an act . And he will do whatever it takes to get what he wants . Lying , cheating and betrayal are just the tip of it . <p> Miguna is a prime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the means ' -- in other words , it does not matter what you do to achieve your ambition . Simply achieving that ambition justifies whatever you might have done to get there , however wrong , illegal or evil it was . <p> It is significant to note that , wherever Miguna has been in his life , there have been major issues that have brought his behaviour into question -- from his troubled student days , through his days as a barrister in Canada , where he was charged with sexual assault on vulnerable young women seeking his help over -- ironically -- immigration issues , to his publication of a book about Raila Odinga that is replete with lies -- no event unexploited for exaggeration , aspersion , detraction , distortion , fiction , hyperbole , myth and propaganda . <p> And that is not to mention his violent flip-flopping behind one leading politician after another -- at one time with ODM and violently against the government , then violently against ODM and violently for Jubilee , back violently to ODM and Nasa and violently against Jubilee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep up . <p> ** <p> Miguna appeared on the main political scene in Kenya rather suddenly , just before the 2007 general election , after many years in Canada . He tagged on to Odinga and loudly praised him as some kind of god -- whom he " loved " , nothing less . <p> After Odinga became prime minister , Miguna was given a room at the PM 's office . Miguna grandly and unilaterally put on the door a notice with his name and the designation he had dreamed up for himself : ' Permanent Secretary ' . It was a joke -- but not to Miguna . <p> He thought he deserved a " significant position " , for which he felt he was " impeccably qualified " -- according to his book Peeling Back The Mask , written after Miguna fell out with Odinga after what he considered his unique talents were not adequately appreciated . <p> " Why did n't Odinga consider my candidature for the attorney-general , director of public prosecutions , anti-corruption commission or any of the newly established constitutional implementation organs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goes on to laud his own " credentials , training , tested skills , integrity , passion and commitment " as superior to the characteristics of other people appointed by the PM . " I strongly believe that he had realised that I ranked higher than Ruto and Uhuru , " he adds . <p> Lately , Miguna has a new position he has awarded himself : he is ' a general ' in the ' national resistance movement ' . As far as we know , this is a self-declared general without soldiers , despite Miguna 's boast that he will " rally my boys " and " bring five million men and women to the streets of Nairobi " . We wait to see that . <p> Meanwhile , Miguna found himself with passport woes . They began when he acquired Canadian citizenship -- and because I am in a similar situation ( in reverse ) , I well know what is required when it comes to acquiring , renouncing and redeeming citizenship . <p> Like Miguna , I changed my citizenship . That was in 1975 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go the British High Commission in Nairobi to renounce my British citizenship , because Kenyan law at the time did not allow dual citizenship . <p> My British passport was cancelled and I have been a Kenya citizen ever since . Though British-born , I do not hold a British passport . I am not automatically entitled to one , and if I wanted one , I would have to apply using the usual UK immigration department channels , just like anyone else trying to get British citizenship . <p> Miguna 's case is no different . He became a Canadian citizen at a time when Kenya did not allow dual citizenship . International immigration conventions -- and there is no way the Canadian authorities would have ignored these -- would have required him to renounce his Kenyan citizenship . <p> ( If not , why has he not got a legal Kenyan passport , which he has held and renewed ever since ? The answer is simple . He is not entitled to one , and he wo n't get one unless he applies anew in the prescribed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is not a lifetime right . If you decide to change your citizenship part-way through your life , shauri yako . You have made a choice to surrender something you had at birth . <p> This is true for everyone in the same position -- including the 3,000 or so people , formerly Kenya citizens who had taken citizenship elsewhere , who since the introduction of dual citizenship in the 2010 Constitution have applied to the Kenya government to reinstate their Kenyan citizenship . <p> They have complied with the rules . Miguna has failed to follow suit . So what makes him different ? Only his inflated , distorted opinion of himself , which he feels puts him above the law . <p> He is not above the law , and after Miguna ' officiated ' at Odinga 's swearing-in as the ' People 's President ' back in February , the government used its perfectly legal powers to deport a loud-mouthed Canadian citizen they considered a nuisance . <p> And there are no two ways about it . Whether you agree with it or not , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ countries . <p> In apparent keeping with his belief that the law does n't apply to him , Miguna , some time before the 2010 Constitution was enacted , acquired a Kenyan passport and ID card . Both were illegal . He was not entitled to either under the law of the time , and well he knew it . <p> It has been suggested that the issuance of these documents was facilitated by Otieno Kajwang , who from 2008 was minister of state for immigration and registration of persons . <p> Kajwang , another charming and amusing fellow , died in 2014 . Since his death , he has , in Kenyan tradition , been viewed as nothing less than a saint . <p> But there are no saints in Kenyan politics , and Kajwang certainly was not one . He had been struck off the Law Society of Kenya 's advocates roll no less than three times for misconduct , including embezzling a client 's money . The last time he was struck off was in 2008 , and he never applied for reinstatement . <p> Kajwang 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over his role in the issuance of any passport to Miguna before 2010 . <p> ** <p> After his deportation in February this year , Miguna , in his usual excitable , bombastic , angry , self-seeking way , went around like the Ancient Mariner ( who in a poem by 18th Century English poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge is compelled to tell his tale of woe wherever he goes ) making vitriolic speeches against .... well , everyone , really . <p> And people will always want to listen to Miguna because his demeanour offers entertainment . He is a buffoon . People laugh at him , just as they did at Idi Amin , despite his murderous ways . Miguna getting apoplectic , ranting and raving and boasting , will always draw a crowd . ( Unfortunately for him , this does not translate into electoral popularity . He gained only a little over half-a-per-cent of the vote when he stood for election as Nairobi governor . ) <p> But Miguna loves the attention his histrionic behaviour attracts . It affirms for him his belief that he really is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to try to illegally force his way into Kenya , make himself a victim with as much noise and violent behaviour as he could muster , and increase what he sees as his standing and popularity among the electorate ? <p> Accordingly , Miguna flew into Nairobi airport on March 26 , well knowing what was ahead of him , and what he had planned . He knew that any Kenyan passport he had was issued illegally , likewise any Kenyan ID card . <p> At passport control , Miguna demanded to be admitted as a Kenya citizen , which he claimed was his birthright . As stated above , a birthright does not last a lifetime if you make alternative arrangements . Miguna is supposed to be a lawyer , a barrister no less , and one who , if somewhat dubiously , has worked on immigration cases in Canada . He knows very well what the law says regarding his own situation . <p> But by emotionally shouting and repeating the ' birthright ' mantra , he knew he could convince folk who did n't know any better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hefty , threatening , lump of a fellow who has no compunction about throwing himself around physically . Pictures of him being restrained at the airport by several people must be absolute nectar to his soul . Never mind that the scene was all concocted and set up by Miguna on false premises . As far as he was concerned , he was appearing a victim of the state and , he hoped , making himself a hero of the people . <p> And he had no compunction about lying . He said he did n't have his Canadian passport . The document was reported to have been lost . His lawyer Cliff Ombeta said it had been " snatched " by the Kenyan authorities . <p> All this was untrue . Miguna had his Canadian passport all along , as he later himself admitted . But producing it and going about things correctly would have been too easy and would not have brought him the attention he wanted . <p> He offered his illegal Kenyan ID in place of his passport . How ridiculous was that ? There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the detailed driving licence for purposes of identification . Imagine how it would be if I , for example , produced my British driving licence to get into the UK . After extensive interrogation , I would be bundled on to the next plane back to Kenya . <p> Only one thing allows you into a country : a valid passport , with visa if necessary ( in exceptional cases , other legally issued travel documents ) . The clue is in the name -- ' pass port ' . Full stop . <p> As the Nairobi airport stand-off continued , the courts got involved , and their contribution only added to the sorry mess . They demanded the production of Miguna in court . But how could this happen when Miguna had no valid documents to enter the country ? <p> The courts erred in law , something that is far from unknown . Chief Justice David Maraga himself , commenting this week on the government 's vitriol against the judiciary over the Miguna issue , admitted that the courts " could make mistakes in ... orders " . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there should be an appeal . <p> That is no doubt very true in theory , but there was an ongoing situation the government was dealing with at the airport , however chaotically . The judges had made an order that could not logically be complied with -- in fact , complying with it would actually circumvent and break the law -- and how long would filing an appeal take ? <p> As far as I can see , Interior Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang'i acted within the law and according to the law in refusing Miguna entry to Kenya . <p> After the court orders , Matiang'i 's retaliatory description of some judges as " evil " was unnecessary and completely unworthy of him ( especially when the government has acted in contempt of court in many matters , behaviour which is in itself contemptible and which has had a knock-on effect in increasing people 's distrust of the government ) . <p> But in the matter of Miguna and his immigration status , Matiang'i is correct . You can not allow entry into Kenya of a foreign citizen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , obstreperous , strutting peacock of a boastful loudmouth on his own personal ego trip or not . <p> In the final chapter of his book , Miguna lauds himself and his so-called integrity and says , " My word is my bond . " <p> Some word . Some bond . Miguna has brutally violated any notions of honesty and integrity . He has been complicit in obtaining illegal documents . He has caused unnecessary headache for Kenya , in pursuit of a narcissistic personal goal . He has shouted endlessly about his unique commitment to justice and integrity and the rule of law . And yet when it has come down to it , Miguna has lied and cheated and attempted to circumvent the law with false documents for his own ends . His words and sanctimonious declarations are purely for effect . <p> The government has produced all the documents relating to Miguna 's citizenship saga ( If only they had done the same in the Eurobond saga ... but there , that is a different story ) and it is plain to see what has happened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conscience-free activities he has engaged in . <p> While it is clear that Miguna 's antics can fool some of the people , some of the time , if they continue to be taken in by this swaggering , self-important , irrational , unstable and ultimately dangerous character , they have only themselves to blame for the consequences -- including seeing their country rendered an international laughing stock . <p> Subscribe to our FREE Newsletter <p> Get the Star headline stories in your email inbox every morning <p> STAR COMMUNITY POLICY AND PARTICIPATION GUIDLINES <p> Thank you for participating in discussions on The Star , Kenya website .

This means charcoal has suddenly become more expensive than kerosene , which is retailing at around Sh80 per litre . A 35 kilogram sack today sells for between Sh 3,200 and Sh 3,500 . <p> Some residents are now trying any cheaper alternative , some of them quite risky . <p> In Kibra for instance , where most households are beneficiaries of ' stolen electricity ' from Kenya Power and Lighting Company ( KPLC ) grids , electric coils are on demand . This has led to increased cases of illegally tapping electricity . <p> Kelvin Olale says when pushed to the limit , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " God forbid , what happens in case of an electrical fault resulting from illegal connections ?

In our area , we have embarked on a tree planting campaign , " states Marpash . <p> Following the three-month ban on logging , the price of the commodity has sharply increased . The main sources of charcoal are Kajiado , Kitui , Kilifi and Tana River counties . But county administrators have banned the production and sale of charcoal with strict enforcement . <p> The government sanctioned the moratorium following a drop in water levels .

Charcoal production and consumption should n't be condemned , " observes the researcher at Kenya Forestry Research Institute . <p> Kagombe says charcoal production should be encouraged in counties like Baringo , Wajir , Garissa , Turkana , Tana River , Isiolo , Samburu and Marsabit to control the spread of prosopis juliflora ( Mathenge ) species due to its negative effects on livestock and indigenous species . <p> Instead of the periodic bans , Kagombe wants the charcoal rules of 2009 fully enforced .

Casuarina Equisertifolia ( Autralian Pine ) , Acacia Mearnsii ( Black Wattle ) , Acacia Polyacantha ( White Thorn ) and Acacia Xanthophloea ( Fever Tree ) are some of the species that produce high quality charcoal . <p> The national charcoal survey established that a majority of trees come from producers ' own farms .

@@24192237 <h> Matiba 's journey from corporate titan to political icon <p> Kenneth Stanley Njindo Matiba impacted my life in more ways than one . When I was growing up , I was one of the beneficiaries of a student bus ride introduced by Matiba and his team when he was the top honcho at Kenya Breweries Limited . <p> This is how it used to work . The buses would leave Ruaraka to the city estates , picking staff as well as their children . They would drop the children in their schools and come back for them in the evening . <p> This was one of the many welfare initiatives that made KBL employees some of the most pampered in the country . An avid sportsman , Matiba ensured all manner of sports were available to KBL employees . <p> Most of those engaging in sports were professionals in all but name . If ajua caught your fancy , then all you needed to do was report to work in the morning , don your company issue tracksuit , then spend the whole day playing . <p> Then there was the boxing team managed by Marsden Madoka and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that spread fear and despondency to many parts of the country . This is where my later friend Robert ' Aruba ' Wangila reigned supreme , beating opponents like rented donkeys . <p> In the football field , KBL FC ( later Tusker ) had in its ranks people like Dino Kitavi , Elly Adero and perhaps the roughest man ever to take to a Kenyan football pitch , the late Mulupi Makuto . <p> Everybody loved Matiba at KBL . Years later , I would receive a phone call from a long-time friend , Mwenda Njoka ( now the spokesperson at Interior Ministry ) . The good man was offering me a job at the Matiba-owned The People weekly . <p> The paper had established itself as a must-read among the political class as well as the hoi polloi . Its starting was a Matibaesque masterpiece .

We used this to the full advantage , where nobody was spared . We were also helped by the fact that unlike their political counterparts , the Matiba family was never in any scandal . <p> VENTURE INTO POLITICS <p> The Matiba that would vie for President in 1992 and become a staunch oppositionist was very different from the one that was a corporate titan . This was thanks to the stint he served in detention that left him almost a vegetable after he suffered a stroke . <p> Opinion is divided on what really happened to Matiba while in detention . There is the school of thought that claims the Special Branch people , having known that Matiba had a morbid fear of snakes , would bring a huge python into the man 's cell , scaring the living daylights out of the man . This apparently contributed to the man 's deteriorated mental health . <p> Another school of thought holds it that there was a particular government-friendly doctor who was tasked with injecting Matiba with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For his gallant contribution to the country and the field of medicine , the doctor was later rewarded with the directorship of Kenyatta National Hospital . He has since died . <p> Matiba held many firsts .

" <p> NO-NONSENSE MINISTER <p> It looks like Matiba had a lasting effect on those he got in touch with .

Ayoki Onyango claims the man took his family through financial ruin . <p> " Matiba sacked my father Jacob Ayoki , when my dad was a senior manager with the Kenya Breweries , on false claims that my dad was a member of KPU . KPU was an opposition party formed by Jaramogi Oginga Odinga in 1966 after falling out with Jomo Kenyatta . Matiba was KBL executive chairman . We subsequently suffered as a family due to the sacking . And as the official spokesman of the Ayoki family , we have forgiven Matiba and let his soul rest in peace . " <p> Then there are those who accuse Matiba of the stillbirth of the country 's second liberation . According to those holding this opinion , had Matiba @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opposition would have sent Moi and his Kanu henchmen packing . It would have worked out better for Matiba , in that Jaramogi died only two years later , meaning Matiba would have ascended to the presidency .

In total the country 's 65 public and private universities had declared to the Kenya Universities and Colleges Central Placement Service ( KUCCPS ) that they had capacity to admit 132,686 students . The government however admitted 62,851 students or just 48 per cent of total capacity . <p> Some institutions like the International Leadership University ( ILU ) as revealed by The Standard on Friday got no student at all .

The worst hit are private universities who depend entirely on school fees in order to survive . <p> Government universities get funding from the State based on the number of students admitted through direct entry . However before last year they used to get more than two thirds of their revenue from the module two programme which is now two academic years away from being wiped out . <p> A new policy was introduced this financial year by the government to fund private universities using the model applied to public institutions . Under the new system known as the Differentiated Unit Cost ( DUC ) , all university academic programmes were grouped into 14 clusters and the cost of teaching each fixed . <p> Under the plan , the University of Nairobi was to receive Sh4.5 billion , Egerton University ( Sh2.1 billion ) , Kenyatta University ( Sh2.8 billion ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ billion ) . Private universities too which began admitting government sponsored students last year were supposed to get money based on the same formula . <p> Half of this money however is yet to be disbursed and with a halved student population , universities are staring at a financial crisis . The Kenya Methodist University ( Kemu ) for example has put up for sale its iconic Kemu hub on Koinange Street in Nairobi in order to clear a Sh1.7 billion loan it took from Cooperative Bank . <p> The university used the building as security in order to take the loan and now want to be allowed to sell it in order to repay the bank .

This was after it emerged that the university had failed to submit over Sh55 million in deductions and penalties . <p> Some administrators are however putting a brave face about the challenges facing the sector like the Kenya Association of Private Universities ( Kapu ) national chairman Mumo Kisau .

This represented only 33.4 per cent of its budget . <p> But the county pays its staff three and a half times more than what it uses for development . <p> Despite spending Sh13.4 billion on staff salaries , the biggest wage bill among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ billion for its development expenditure in the last financial year . <p> The data analysis shows that the Nairobi governor 's offices was among the top three most expensive to run last year . <p> The breakdown for recurrent expenditure -- money used to pay for salaries in the governor 's office , buy tea , entertain guests and carry out county administration among others , ranks Nairobi second after Laikipia . <p> The county used Sh5 billion to run the office of the governor last year , which is one and a half times more than what it used for its total development budget . It means that the county used more money on paying salaries for officers in the governor 's office , buy tea , and entertain guests and other administrative costs than it spared for development . <p> The impact of this can be seen in how it was unable to channel money to projects . An analysis of its top ten development projects in terms of the highest expenditure shows that the county was unable to absorb the full amounts allocated . <p> For instance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ City Park Market Phase 3 in Waithaka , it only managed to spent Sh17.8 million , which is just 15 per cent of the budget . <p> But data from the Controller of Budget shows that Nairobi County did not give Pumwani hospital the entire Sh80 million it needed in the upgrade and completion of a 68 bed wards , despite being a roll over project from the previous year . <p> Instead , it only managed to give the hospital Sh70 million , which translates to an absorption rate of 87.5 per cent . The access toads to Maji Mazuri in Clay City also just got 43.8 per cent of their allocation while the construction of the access toad to HACCO Industries also in Clay City also got just 59.3 per cent of its budget allocations . <p> Maintenance of rental houses got a raw deal , with just 39 per cent of their Sh50 million budget being used . Instead the county overshot its initial budget of the purchase of a compactor by Sh2.9 million . It had budgeted to spend Sh45 million on the compactor but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stadium road in Makongeni only received 65.7 per cent of its budget . Insufficient funds have made it impossible for the county to complete the works on time and up to the required standard of a modern city . <p> Five years into devolution , over Sh51 billion spent , the county continues to have suffer from water scarcity and still relies on sources that are hurting from deforestation . Sanitation access levels to non-formal settlements is still wanting . <p> The supply problem is further aggravated by the poor state of the distribution system , which results in about 50 per cent losses due to leakage , illegal connection and inefficient and wasteful use of water by some consumers . Traffic remains a nightmare , and whenever it rains the drainage can not handle the water .

This , indeed , is yet another milestone in our political history : a reflection of how far we have come as a people , and how our democracy has matured . <p> I , like other Kenyans , look forward to a future when at least half the leaders in this room are women . <p> Ladies and Gentlemen , <p> Distinguished Governors , <p> Our presence here today in Kakamega celebrating our devolved system of government shows not just the resilience of our people , but also their aspiration to see their nation thrive and prosper . <p> Let us take a moment to celebrate this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people in every corner of our country . <p> Ladies and Gentlemen , <p> Let me take this opportunity to thank Governer of the green jewel and bull fighters , Governor Oparanya , I await your invite to the next Bull Fight . <p> Ladies and Gentlemen , <p> There is no doubt that devolved governments are finding their feet , and transforming the lives of the communities they serve for the better . <p> Today , Makueni has made good progress in rolling out its version of subsidized healthcare provision , and in fruit processing too ; in Mandera , child mortality has halved due to the County 's investment in medical facilities ; and Kapenguria now has its first Medical Training College . <p> We owe that success , first and foremost , to the diligence of our people ; and to the leaders here , and their predecessors .

All of us were chosen to fulfill the will of the Kenyan people . Therefore , in our different capacities , we must all work closely to tackle any challenges standing in the way of a better Kenya for our people . <p> Ladies and Gentlemen , <p> Last year , as I mentioned before in another forum , I had the privilege of meeting Kenyans right across the country . Everywhere I went , young and old alike shared their hopes and dreams for the Kenya they wished to see . <p> It was clear Kenyans share common desires : we all want to live in dignity ; we all want to be engaged in rewarding enterprise ; we all want the very highest standard of nutrition ; and we all want affordable and high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here who would settle for less ? <p> Ladies and Gentlemen , <p> Every year the Devolution conference gives us an opportunity as leaders to combine our strengths for the good of the country . <p> This year 's conference is no different , and today I come to you with a very specific agenda -- one that transcends the usual political imperatives . <p> Ladies and Gentlemen , <p> It is no secret that our resource envelope is highly constrained . We must , therefore , be prudent : every cent of revenue collected must return maximum impact on the welfare of tax payers . <p> It goes without saying that we need to candidly discuss how to maximize the benefits that can be derived by the National Government and county governments , working closer together . <p> And that depends on three critical pre-requisites . First , we must streamline our inter-governmental relationships , to exist and thrive beyond merely debating matters of resource allocation . <p> Our framework for cooperation and coordination needs to be strengthened and lifted above partisan and transactional engagements , to focus more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our people . <p> Second , we need to de-risk the political environment across the country . Left unchecked , our political intrigues can grow into a big tree under whose shade nothing can take root . We must all agree there will be a season for politics , but that season is not with us now . <p> It is now time to work to create wealth and prosperity for our people . <p> At every level of our political structures , I urge you all to engage each other on the basis of issues . If it becomes necessary to disagree , let us disagree without poisoning the environment for Kenya 's progress . <p> Thirdly , we must aspire towards strategic alignment of our national development goals . While every county government has its own agenda , it is necessary to align that agenda with the national blue print , that is , Vision 2030 . <p> When I conceptualized the Big Four , I did so in appreciation of the fact that for us to accelerate the achievement of our Vision 2030 aspiration , we would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and focus to those issues that would have the greatest impact on the well-being of our people . <p> I , therefore , stand here today not only to ask for your support but to convince you that working with the National Government to deliver on the " Big Four " Agenda will be beneficial for each one of you as individual governors , and for the people whom you represent , both in the near and long term . After all , when I read your manifestos , I saw plans that were not too different from the Big Four . Let us work together , then , to serve the Kenyans whose hopes we were elected to accomplish . <p> Allow me to talk very briefly about the " Big Four " , and specifically about those elements that require closer inter-governmental collaboration . <p> We can begin by getting clear on what the plan entails . The first priority of the " Big Four " is to grow our manufacturing sector and to raise its contribution to the Gross Domestic Product ( GDP ) from 9 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is on those sectors whose value chains will provide opportunities for our people and , therefore , create more jobs . For example : in doubling our textile manufactures for the AGOA export market , we expect to create upwards of 100,000 jobs at various levels , from cotton farms and ginneries to stitching facilities . <p> As you all know , last week I was in the United Kingdom , where I spent most of my time pushing for Kenya 's agenda to significantly raise our share of exports in the global export trade . <p> I sought to persuade investors in agro-processing and value addition in tea and coffee to re-locate their facilities to Kenya , so that Kenyan tea and coffee would be processed within our borders for the benefit of our farming communities . <p> I also sought to establish new opportunities for Kenya 's blue economy by seeking partnership with countries like Canada and the United Kingdom , who are ready and willing to help us establish the industries necessary to exploit our vast maritime resources . <p> All these opportunities will count for nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for these investments to take root . In this context , I wish to make two very specific requests in support of the manufacturing agenda : the first is for the deliberate harmonization of all fees and levies relating to businesses . We in national government have waived or simplified levies that hinder small business ; still , 70% of the levies that remain are payable to county governments . We can do better . <p> The second is more of an offer than a request : I have directed our Ministry of Public Service , Youth and Gender to avail space in our Huduma centres for any county government that wishes to bring under one roof its systems for issuing business permits and physical-planning approvals . This will make life easier for our people . You will be pleased to know that the County Government of Nairobi will be the first to put this offer on trial . <p> The painful lessons of the recent drought and the adverse impact of climate change inform my second priority : achieving food and nutrition security by 2022 . We must accept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country . We must also recognize that urbanization , speculative real estate practices , and poor physical planning are depleting already scarce arable land . This is a challenge we must confront head on as part of our strategy to realize our commitment to deliver on food security . <p> Kenyans expect no less than 100 percent food and nutrition security ; we will deliver it by 2022 . This is no minor responsibility , but devolved governments are now the owners of the last mile when it comes to addressing questions of productivity at the farm level . <p> Ladies and Gentlemen , <p> To have any impact in the next four years , we must progress our thinking beyond subsidies that , contrary to the intended objective , only benefit the rich instead of our small-scale farmers . <p> We must rely more on scientific data to drive our policy interventions on input subsidies and strategic food reserves . <p> We must empower our farmers with the information necessary to increase their output per acre , reduce their unit cost of production and , therefore , significantly improve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must find ways to support you to revive the necessary crop and livestock extension services , which hold the key to improved productivity . <p> For the cost of food to drop , we must think about necessary innovation , to increase yields significantly , as well as mechanization and scale . Empirical evidence has shown that for the production of our staples , the bigger the land under cultivation , the better . <p> For those of us responsible for setting the necessary policies and regulating the agricultural sector , we have no choice but to open ourselves to new ideas , and benchmark our standards with countries that are food sufficient . <p> Today , there is no reason for potato farmers in places like Nyandarua , Njoro and Kaptagat to struggle with seeds that produce 7 bags an acre when our neighbours in Ethiopia are harvesting 21 bags an acre . This , to say the least , is , indeed , embarrassing for a nation that was up to that standard in the 1970s . <p> The biggest obstacle to food security , it is worth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; it is the elevation of self-interest above the public good . I want to tell my Cabinet Secretary for Agriculture , who is here today , that the Ministry must now do the right thing . He must collaborate with every county government to give your farmers the support they need to make an honest living off their land . The misguided preoccupation with sugar , maize , and fertilizer imports must come to an end . Let us work together on this . <p> The third priority is health : we aim , by 2022 , to give every family in the Republic access to affordable healthcare . <p> Again , this is no small task and it will require a reimagining of the status quo . In defining this aspiration , I recognize that county governments are at the closest point of inflection when it comes to the provision of health services at the grassroots . There will be the hard work of financing this dream and restructuring all the institutions critical to its success . We will have to improve the quality of our facilities and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also have to train and recruit more doctors and nurses . <p> Equally , all of us will have to work together to fit existing programmes into the new plan . Still , the work will be well worth it : a win in healthcare today is a decisive win for generations to come . <p> The fourth priority of the " Big Four " is housing . I 've said it before , but I 'll say it again : Kenyans made it clear that they want to live in decent homes . <p> They elected us convinced we could fulfill their will . You and I , together , must create the environment for half a million new houses to be built over the next 5 years to fulfil the dream of our people . <p> There can be no illusions : this part of the plan calls for very substantial work , not least because it is the most ambitious building programme this country has seen in decades . We will have to cut the cost of mortgages ; we will have to cut the cost of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more patient capital . <p> Equally important , we will certainly have to invest in the institutions -- not least our technical training institutions -- that the construction industry demands . <p> Already , my State Department for Housing is engaging individual county governments who wish to join the early phases of the housing project . We are ready to work with those counties that are willing to co-invest within the set development framework . <p> Ladies and Gentlemen , <p> This is perhaps the most ambitious agenda in Kenya 's history . But it is equally fair to say that it will remain just that -- an agenda -- if we do not now come together in common endeavour . <p> None of us can stand aside , waiting for others to do the heavy lifting ; this plan will work only if we all work together . <p> Of course , we ca n't do everything at once . So today I ask all of you to begin the transformation by considering healthcare . I say so because I think all of us can see that of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kenyans most . I thank and commend the Chair of the Council of Governors , Gov . Nanok on his pledge and commitment to work together with the national government on delivering our health pledge . Indeed , all of us here will have contributed to a medical harambee , so none of us can doubt just how much Kenyans want affordable healthcare for their families . <p> It 's time , then , to replace the patchwork coverage we now have with a universal plan that covers every single Kenyan family . <p> I know it 's ambitious , but Kenyans chose us because they believed in our ability to deliver . For our part as national government , we are already at work : just the other day , we announced that Kisumu , Isiolo , Machakos , and Nyeri would be the first four counties to participate in our pilot programme that will test 100 percent cover . <p> We considered it better -- as , I 'm sure any reasonable person would -- to start with a pilot before taking the entire programme to cover all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have asked why these counties , and not others , were chosen . That 's a valid concern . <p> The criteria we adopted were informed by the empirical evidence on important parameters , notably : the disease burden in each county ; its population density ; and its risk of emergencies . These counties top the list ; that 's why we chose to begin with them . <p> Like you , I have a government to run ; I know that handling complicated recruitment routines can be tricky ; I also know that it would be wrong to ask you to carry the entire burden alone . To aid you , I hereby direct the NHIF to assign enrolment officers to counties . <p> Further , I direct the State Departments of Interior and of Social Protection to instruct their officers to support you in the enrollment . <p> Ladies and Gentlemen , <p> This pilot healthcare programme relies on public funds , and its success in the four counties will hasten its rollout elsewhere . So I will not entertain any delay in provisioning of resources , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have covered Wanjiku ; I do n't want to hear that when she came to hospital she found neither aspirin for her pain , or a doctor to attend to her . <p> I am certain I am not alone in wishing to see this programme succeed . Kenyans -- not just in these four counties , but right across the country -- want it to work . They know that if it does , their lives and those of their children will be transformed for the better . <p> Distinguished Governors , <p> You have your part to play . I ask you to work even more closely with us , to maintain fiscal discipline , to keep records accurately , and to use the funds , the resources , and the personnel allocated to you , in a manner that will ensure Kenyans get maximum benefits . <p> For those not in the first trial , prepare yourselves : we all want to see budgets , clear priorities , and management devoted solely to the health of your constituents . <p> Let me also ask you to complete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a deadline we can not miss , which is why I have asked the National Treasury to work with you to meet it . I had the privilege and pleasure to travel to Cuba with Gov . Anyang ' Nyong'o and Gov . Mahmoud for Marsabit . They bear testimony to what we saw and what we can aspire to . <p> And I want to see you preparing your facilities , so that they are ready to receive medicines and medical supplies when the time comes . <p> But above all , I ask you to lead : invest more in health , and show , by example , that you truly value the lives of the Kenyans who chose you to lead them . <p> I return , now , to the matter of inter-governmental cooperation . I 've said it before , and I 'll say it again : ours is an extraordinarily ambitious agenda ; and we have little more than four years in which to deliver it . <p> There is absolutely no time to waste : Kenyans want to see results , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they want prudence , not profligacy . Gov . Nanok has addressed issue of leadership , not political corruption , is corruption , it has no tribe . We must deal with it as a nation . Those who are guilty should no longer hide in a cocoon of tribal or clan . <p> And they are tired of political bickering too : they want both levels and all three branches of Government to work together , fully accepting our interdependence . <p> We all have shared responsibilities in realizing the national goals as set out in our Vision 2030 Blue Print . <p> So let me speak bluntly : there is neither room nor time for public servants who care for anything other than serving Kenyans . We in the national government will back that resolution with financial resources and support . <p> I 'm glad to announce that I will launch the Kenya Devolution Support Programme and the Kenya Urban Support Programme today . Both , combined , will inject Ksh 50 billion into your county governments , to help you build and improve the systems that support @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It worth underscoring that these funds are performance-based conditional grants extended to the County Governments by the National Government . Just like us in the National Government , you must also strive to perform to the very highest standards ; and must be ready to take a stern view of public servants who give in to lethargy and sloth . <p> Indeed , adoption of this programme demonstrates my Administration 's commitment to a devolution that truly works -- that truly serves -- every Kenyan . <p> The time for full cooperation with each other is now . This is important to ensure we succeed in executing the " Big Four " Agenda . <p> Now , we in national Government understand , as clearly as you do , that delivery of the " Big Four " demands a rethink of our institutions . <p> We will have to establish effective arrangements for planning and implementing the programmes and projects about which I have spoken about today . <p> That 's why you and I together will need to strengthen the Summit , the Intergovernmental Budget and Economic Council , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to make them more efficient and effective channels for the delivery of the " Big Four " . <p> As you can see , there is much to think about and much to do . But let me close by reminding you of one idea that will not lead us astray , if only we hold onto it . <p> Madaraka Day is almost here . On that first day of June 1963 , our freedom fighters took control of government for the very first time . We began to govern and determine our destiny . The spirit of that day lives on in devolution , for it is in ugatuzi that every Kenyan plays a full part in championing the affairs of this country . <p> If you are a leader today , it is because the true holders of madaraka trust you to lead them . In the end , all that matters is that you serve them to the very best of your ability . <p> On my part , I will continue to reach out to all leaders , so that we can protect and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> I ask you to join me in reaching out to all other leaders in your counties as I have done at the national level . If you do , you will have served your country well . Kenyans will accept no less . <p> May God grant you the wisdom to serve Kenya well ; and may He bless this country that we love .

A good pointer of this distress can be highlighted using two indicators -- maternal deaths and unmet need for family planning . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deaths , Kenya still records an unacceptably high number of maternal deaths .

One in every five women ( 18 per cent ) in a marriage or union -- who want to postpone their next birth for two years or more , or not have any more children -- are not using any method of contraception . <p> Access to family planning services , including access to contraceptives , can go a long way in reducing maternal injuries and deaths . <p> Unfortunately , the NHIF does not entirely cover members seeking family planning services , with access to contraceptives not included as part of the cover . <p> As it stands , couples seeking access to family planning services have enough social and cultural barriers to dodge without adding another .

@@24824239 <h> Genetically modified Bt cotton not worth the hype <p> Cotton is mainly grown for its fibre , which accounts for about 35 per cent weight of the primary product known as seed cotton . The seed is the main byproduct and is used to produce cotton seed oil , cake , and hulls for livestock feed , and linter ( used for film , plastics ) . <p> Kenya 's cotton sector is generally characterised by about 140,000 smallholder farmers , with a low average yield of 0.53 tonnes of seed cotton per hectare between 2000 and 2010 and poor quality cotton fibre outputs . The average production of 18,000 tonnes per year over 2005-2010 represents a mere nine per cent of the country 's potential . <p> The key challenges faced by the sector include poor agronomic practices , inadequate extension services , high cost , and poor quality seed . It is noteworthy that pest pressure of the African cotton bollworm is not mentioned as a key challenge yet , Bt cotton has been developed with public resources targeting this pest . <p> In terms of regulation , conditional release has been granted for ( GM @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Monsanto by the National Biosafety Authority . However , an environmental impact assessment report is still pending from National Environmental Management Authority . Kenya is at a crossroads on whether to allow GM cotton or not . It would therefore be incisive to draw parallels with the experiences of Burkinabe and Indian small-scale farmers who have already commercialised it . <p> Bt cotton was claimed to be resistant to the most common pests in India , the pink bollworm . In 2006 , just four years after its release by Monsanto , the pink bollworm had become resistant to it in Western India . Rapid development of resistance occurs because Bt cotton plants are engineered to continuously release toxins , and this constant , long-term exposure encourages the survival of any pests that are genetically resistant to the toxin . As a result , the usage of insecticide on cotton increased from 0.5kg per hectare in 2006 to 1.20kg in 2015 in India . <p> The cost of proprietary GM seed in Burkina Faso was $45 ( Sh4,539 ) per bag compared to $1.25 ( Sh126 ) for conventional cotton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ South Africa and has a high likelihood of being replicated in Kenya . On claims that Bt cotton has increased yields from 2007 to 2016 , yields stagnated as Bt cotton production rose from 67 per cent to 92 per cent and eventually declined in 2016-17 . <p> GM cotton was officially approved in 2002 by Mahyco Monsanto Biotech ( India ) Ltd . A joint venture between Mahyco Seeds and Monsanto India , which also supported its rolling out through an aggressive advertising campaign . There is no hybrid seed for cotton available in Kenya and the last variety bred was in 1989 which was a multiline . <p> Current cotton seed is from ginneries and is of poor quality . Access to non GM seed by non-GM and organic farmers was , and still is a huge problem as supplies of non-GM , and particularly organic seed became scarcer by 2012 in India . It appears that its cotton germplasm is contaminated with Bt genetic material and is considered one of the biggest threats to the future of sustainable cotton . <p> The national demand for seed cake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ domestic market opportunity for both oil and animal feed production which will in turn spur growth in the country 's cottonseed subsector . Consequently , cotton should in fact be viewed as a food and feed crop and the government must ensure that consumer safety is prioritised before any consideration of commercialisation of genetically modified cotton . <p> Evidence has also pointed to farmer suicides increasing in areas under Bt cotton . In the Vidarbha region of Maharashtra province , factors linked to it 's cultivation are reported to have led to 7,992 farmer suicides between 2006 and 2011 . <p> Today , it is clearer that Bt cotton 's benefit claims are exaggerated and now it 's rejection is not only from civil society voices , but official government ones as well . As a result of the challenges experienced by Burkina Faso between 2011 and 2016 , where it lost $82.4 million , it has now implemented a complete phase out of GM cotton for the 2017-18 season . <p> In contrast , Indian farmers growing organic desi cotton report comparable yields at nearly half the input costs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per cent of the global organic cotton , which is at par with conventional cotton in terms of profitability . <p> According the KBioC co-ordinator , Anne Maina , " Tough and expensive lessons have been learnt from the story of commercialisation Bt Cotton in India and Burkina Faso .

@@24839234 <h> Welcome to the English Football League revolution <p> Fulham and Aston Villa go head to head in football 's most lucrative game on Saturday but the EFL in general is in the midst of a revolution <p> Fulham and Aston Villa will contest what is generally regarded as the richest game in football on Saturday in the EFL Championship playoff final . At stake is a place in the Premier League and the untold riches it brings . <p> For context , West Bromwich Albion -- who finished bottom -- made some ? 95 million for taking part in the Premier League last season . Only Juventus made more money than that from competing in the 2016-17 Champions League . <p> That money is set to increase - in the short-term at least - with a new broadcast deal kicking in the season after next . And one of Fulham or Villa -- along with already-promoted Wolves and Cardiff City -- are ready to share in that bonanza . <p> The Premier League is so rich and powerful now that speculative investors are willing to take a risk on EFL clubs in the expectation of getting to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paradox that it is such a well-watched and exciting league because teams are so desperate to get out of it . <p> " What are our clubs playing for ? " asks EFL chief executive Shaun Harvey . " They are playing for the opportunity to get promoted to the Premier League so they can share in the riches that come from competing in that competition . <p> " Our clubs are investing and our owners are investing in their clubs chasing the prize of promotion and the financial rewards that come with it . " <p> Around 60 per cent of the clubs participating in the Championship season just passed had foreign owners and there are eight more down in League One . The clamour for promotion has meant the Championship is more competitive than ever . <p> Relegated from the Premier League , Sunderland have plummeted straight down to League One . Sheffield United and Millwall on the other hand were promoted from the tier below and had genuine aspirations of Premier League promotion until the last knockings of the season . <p> And the Championship is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standard . No second-tier division can boast as many quality players . It is the sixth best-paying league in Europe in terms of total wages . Outside the top five big leagues of Spain , the Premier League , the Bundesliga , Serie A and Ligue 1 , no league anywhere spent more on transfers than the Championship did in the summer of 2017 . <p> " It 's a really , really strong competition , " says Harvey . " But with the wages and transfer fees that our clubs are committing , they are reliant on owner funding . " <p> The EFL , like any other organisation , is seeking to grow its revenues and ensure the sustainability of the clubs within its structures . It is the third best-supported football division in the world based on total attendances -- League One is ninth -- behind the Premier League and the Bundesliga . More than 11.3 million fans were welcomed through the turnstiles last season in the Championship and more than 18 million attended games across all three EFL divisions . <p> The EFL - with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clubs in all , each with its own dedicated fanbase . All those fans are looking to follow their team , either in person , on matchdays , or on television and online . While the EFL would like crowds to grow further towards full capacity -- it 's currently at around 60 per cent for the 72 clubs in total -- on the broadcast front the EFL is changing the game . <p> Last year the EFL launched its ground-breaking iFollow service . For a fee of around ? 110 a season , and ? 5 per individual game , fans of EFL clubs overseas can access live over-the-top broadcasts of up to 46 of their teams ' matches . Games selected for traditional broadcast in a given overseas territory are not available to stream . <p> Sky Sports provides the multi-camera footage which is sold to broadcasters in some 217 countries around the world . But that leaves around 1,500 matches which were not needed by overseas broadcasters . The EFL decided to broadcast those matches over-the-top through iFollow . <p> Following an exhaustive tender process , NeuLion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company also works with the NBA , the NFL and the UFC . <p> " We were in a fortunate position because we have a league-wide fibre network which we had to put in place to meet our domestic requirements , " says Harvey . " So effectively all we 're doing is using that same technology that we 've already got to deliver an additional revenue stream . " <p> Research commissioned on the viability of the service produced a figure of around 270,000 fans of EFL clubs overseas . The EFL estimates around 55 per cent of all EFL fans are based in the USA , Canada , Australia and New Zealand . While the viewing figures for its first season of operation are under wraps , the iFollow service is considered in the industry to have got off to a strong start . <p> " It 's gone down really well , " says Harvey . " The EFL still sells its TV rights in the same manner as every other league tries to get theirs away . We have a domestic deal and then we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this country are the games that we sell to traditional broadcasters overseas . <p> " What we have then done is all the other games that are n't being shown are made available on our iFollow service to fans of the clubs in question . " <p> Sky Sports and the EFL last year renewed terms on a domestic broadcast deal worth ? 600m which will be implemented from 2019-20 with a 36 per cent uplift on the current contract . Sky will be showing a maximum of 150 EFL matches per season beginning 2019 -- including a minimum of 20 from League One and League Two . <p> Another 16 Championship games will be shown on Tuesday and Wednesday evenings across the season - a move that could well pit it against the Champions League , which is being broadcast on rival BT Sport . Into the bargain , Sky will show 80 EFL Championship games on its digital and interactive services starting 2018-19 . <p> Crucially , clubs will be permitted to broadcast games live to UK and Irish audiences - over-the-top - on their website and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will also be permitted to live stream the same games on its own platforms . <p> " The broadcasting deal with Sky will allow us to do that domestically as well from next season , " says Harvey . " It is exciting . " <p> Some clubs are excluded due to a desire to persist with their own streaming services ; among this season 's 11 rebels were both Fulham and Villa as well as Wolves , Sunderland and Middlesbrough . <p> " We work on a really simple premise , " says Harvey . " If you support a club you will always support that club . And if you have the opportunity to watch your club play you will do that in preference to any other game . <p> " We 've got to a position now where regularly every week there are tens of thousands of streams going out of England across the world to fans in different countries . And it will only continue to grow . " <p> Games in the Saturday 1445 -- 1715 slot will be subject to the traditional English football @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broadcast by Sky will be available to stream . The EFL in effect becomes its own live stream distributor on its own OTT service . <p> The CEO also discloses that the move is being watched closely by others within the European Leagues structure , who may not be able to sell the rights to their games as easily right now but who are always on the lookout for growth . <p> Article continues below <p> " People are watching on with a real interest as to how successful it is , " he says . " Some countries are n't in the fortunate position that we are where we 're able to sell our rights overseas as well . So this might be potentially the only source of income .

The simplest bet you can make is the outcome of the game -- either a win for one side or a tie . <p> Unsurprisingly , it is England who come into this friendly as the red hot favourites to come away with the victory .

A draw , meanwhile , is at 4.50 , according to Oddsshark . <p> It 's always more difficult to attempt to guess the exact score rather than the general result , but given that England are clear favourites you may well be encouraged to have a go .

I remember listening to a lady on the radio describe that she can not read any book where anyone is being falsely accused of a crime . It upsets her too much . The fact that Gen. Kale Kayihura is being accused of the murder of the late AIGP Andrew Felix Kaweesi is the perfect example of a man being crucified . What happened to all the people at Kaweesi 's eulogy who thanked Kayihura for spotting and nurturing Kaweesi 's talent to rise up the ranks as he did ? Why ca n't you , and all of Uganda who watched Kayihura trust and rely on Kaweesi more than anyone use any rationale and come forward to stop this clear witch hunt ?

So these forces resorted to lies . ? ? ? <p> I was stunned to find out that Kayihura is , in fact , not wealthy at all ? ? " especially compared to all senior Government officials . Even compared to many Government officials below him . Ask any international partners with the Police , some who even nicknamed him Inspector General of the People , realizing he was different from the rest . He was never after any amassing of wealth , and thus was a threat .

He was a good officer who the Police could n't afford to lose . <p> Kayihura was not loyal to NRM , he is loyal to the President , and that vision that drove him to leave a lectureship persuaded by his Professors at the London School of Economics after he finished his LLM .

Kayihura unfortunately believed that all this would go away . He especially believed so after his removal , and had just gotten into the groove of being a farmer and serving his community in Kashagama , Lyantonde . He insisted on using his own funds to get the cleanest underground water through a tap for all in the community to make use of , not just himself . <p> How can someone so generous and so of the people be made out to be a killer ?

They are a small district , seen as unimpressive and even unknown to many Ugandans , but they inhabit this country like any other citizen . Even Kayihura himself , a whole General and Senior official was despised by his fellow Westerners who are said to have insulted his identity on numerous occasions . Including the security agencies he worked with . Even in the same region , people harbour ethnic hatred and misguided superiority over another . <p> Uganda has reached a new low .

But I would also argue that the services being provided by Cuban doctors is invaluable and the reasons for not wanting them in Kenya are not justified . <h> The national benefit is paramount <p> The current fears of the Kenyan medical fraternity are understandable . But their fears may be based on misinformation . Prior consultations between Kenyan government officials and the medical fraternity would have gone a long way to allaying these . <p> Nevertheless , I believe that Kenyan doctors should focus on the national benefits of the programme . Cuban doctors are sent to rural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to work in . In these communities , the mere presence of a doctor can make a tremendous difference in health outcomes . <p> In addition , the Cuban doctors being sent to Kenya are highly specialised in areas such as oncology and nephrology , areas of medicine which are in demand the world over . Their presence can only improve access to specialised medical care while reducing congestion in referral hospitals . <h> Cuba 's healthcare missions <p> Despite a level of economic stagnation , Cuba has managed to maintain a universal health care system viewed as a model for other countries . Current data shows the doctor to patient ratio in Cuba is well above the United Nation 's target of 1:1000 , at 7.5:1000 in 2014 . By comparison , Kenya has a ratio of 0.204 doctors per 1000 patients . <p> Cuban trained doctors have been praised the world over for the level of service and compassion they offer .

The offer was rejected . <p> The argument that Kenya should invest in its own citizens rather than sign a multi-million dollar deal with the Cuban government is a fair one and should be addressed . But I do n't believe that it 's simply a question of one or the other . <p> Studying medicine is costly and requires training for between six to seven years . This excludes specialisation .

FILE PHOTO NMG <p> A couple of weeks ago I was invited to be a panelist on NTV 's am Live Friday morning Leadership Forum , and when anchor Debarl Inea told me the theme would be " Leadership Character " I began thinking about how to fill the few minutes I would be given within the programme to present on the subject . <p> My mind immediately went to the World Cup football match between Colombia and England I had watched a few days before , in which the Colombian players behaved with uninhibited aggression against their opponents , not least when English players looked like striking at goal . <p> Yellow card followed yellow card , and then a penalty was awarded against the spoilers , showing them that their inability to hold back from manhandling the English players did not pay . <p> Thanks to the presence of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the more restrained English carried the day .

( As , by coincidence , was previewed earlier by my fellow panelist Gituro Wainaina . ) I and my fellow panelists agreed that it is the leaders above all who must find the strength to hold back from doing the wrong thing , and it is they who must inspire others to do so -- ensuring there are rewards for behaving with good character and penalties for falling short . <p> Around the time I was writing this article I watched a CNN programme on Washington @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Nearly all men can stand adversity , but if you want to test a man 's character , give him power .

Neither is it unique to him .

@@25952237 <p> There 's a unique process through which Kenyan men , in specific , fall in love .

Though this uniqueness is universal there are differences in the way both men and women approach love and the way they express their affections . <p> Now , this is the part that differs depending on your culture , tradition , nurture and even race and beliefs . Therefore , there 's a unique process through which Kenyan men in specific fall in love . <p> This tends to happen in stages . For Kenyan men love is a happy experience no matter how macho we try to act . However , most of the time we try to bide our time and through no fault of our own , we take a detour , hibernating , before Cupid 's fever kicks in . <p> Here are the seven stages that Kenyan ? men undergo in the process of falling in love : <p> 1 . Love at first sight ( Fundamentals stage ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appearance of a woman on first glance- shallow kind of thinking , I know . Though each guy has his own preference in what he likes about a woman , there 's the obvious curvaceous figure and big derri ? ? res that has got Kenyan men 's tongues wagging and necks breaking . <p> 2 . Wooing and pursuing <p> It 's common knowledge that men generally appreciate loads of women on a daily basis . You 'll see them trying to steal quick glances at beautiful women all the time . However , this does n't mean that he will pursue each one of them , when he does then he enters the infatuation stage . <p> 3 . Memorandum of understanding <p> MOU is a common phrase in the Kenyan political scene . This is where both parties shake hands and agree to each other 's demands . When an attractive girl reciprocates the guy 's advances then the guy digs in and intensifies his pursuit of winning over the woman of his desire . <p> 4 . Gifts and spoiling <p> At this stage , most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just yet . They are more concerned about impressing her and making her like him . So he will spoil her woman- sponsor style . He is n't in love but he wants everything to go as planned . <p> 5 . Sealing the deal <p> Now after making a prospective sale every salesman has to close the buy by convincing the buyer to buy the product . So this is where most Kenyan men try to " seal the deal " as it is mostly referred to in the Kenyan dating scene . This is where the guy makes sure that he 's certain that the girl is interested and likes him . <p> 6 . Reality check <p> All this while most Kenyan men have been too preoccupied with winning over the girl 's affection and " sealing the deal " that they did not really evaluate whether they really like the woman they are pursuing or not . Now that the girl is in love with him , the Kenyan man starts weighing his options whether he really wants to have a relationship with this girl . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Now that the girl is in love with him , he takes a couple of days to sit back and weigh the pros and the cons of being in a relationship with that girl . If after a little soul searching and much deliberation with the " kitchen cabinet " - mostly his close friends . The Kenyan man enters the final stage of falling in love with the woman in question . <p> However , if he is not sure or convinced that the girl is the perfect fit for him he will start avoiding her or totally change his attitude toward her on a moments notice .

The urban setting , particularly Nairobi county , contribute largely to the Gross Domestic Product because of good infrastructure and availability of high end jobs . However a recent study has shown that towns upcountry have some of the bestinvestment-worth areas because of their relatively good infrastructure , hospitality , cost of living and improved security . Here are the top 10 favourable towns for investment according to Insight Kenya . <p> Nakuru <p> One of the oldest towns in the country , its centrality and cosmopolitan nature attracts people from all quarters in the public and private sector . Statistics show that food in Nakuru is 43 per cent cheaper than in Nairobi . Housing , transportation , education and electricity are also very affordable . <p> This town has managed to keep the cost of living low which explains a thriving economy particularly in the informal sector . County government investment in infrastructure has also helped forge growth even to its environs . <p> 2 .

Its relatively good infrastructure and the international airport mostly dealing with cargo have opened up the town to big time recognition . With the huge tracks of farmland , Eldoret has made its economy rise by the day thus embracing modernisation . <p> Large social amenities and grand businesses are a common landscape in this bustling town which connects Uganda via Busia border .

But something is terribly a miss in this equation : Wanjiku , the supposed target beneficiary and the ultimate bearer of all the cost was forgotten back in Egypt . <p> Despite the sweeping implications of this proposal , as late as Friday , the top brass in the ministry driving the agenda could not candidly answer four fundamental basic questions : One , what is affordable housing in our case ? Two , what is the target income bracket and are they in the formal or informal sector ? <p> Three , what shall be the criteria for allocating the housing units ?

Economic in the sense that it 's based on ability to pay , behavioural due to very peculiar individual taste and preferences , and spiritual due to personal contentment 's at various economic states . <p> Therefore , if one person lives at Karen , another at Kilimani , another in Umoja and yet another in Kibra , there is absolutely no objective measure of whether one is happier than the other under the three attributes . At minimum , each of the four is simply satisfying a basic need of shelter and eventually boils down to individual levels of satisfaction . <p> Stay informed while on the go by subscribing to the Standard Group SMS service . Text the word ' NEWS ' to 22840 . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three key economic assumptions that are flawed , but fatal to its success . One , the housing market is historically predicated on a central planning system by an all-knowing and benevolent social planner ; two , that there are arbitrage opportunities in the housing market in its current state ; and three , that a political solution is the cure to a complex socio-economic , cultural and behavioural problem . <p> Some of the countries that have commonly been mentioned to justify the government 's intervention in the sector are Singapore and South Africa . I shall add China in my discussion . Singapore and China housing sector 's are classic case studies of a successful central all knowing social planner . <p> Pre-democracy apartheid South Africa was also largely centrally planned even though now it is a mixed planning . Singapore and China have comprehensive policies on general size of houses per household , ownership structure ( often lease ) and how a household can graduate from say , a small house unit like a one bedroom to a three-bedroom apartment , if the household requirements change . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ address critical amenities like sewerage , schools and hospitals , utilities and infrastructure that are extremely essential for a home ownership decision . Contrast this with the realities in Kenya . Over the past three decades , despite its phenomenal growth , the real estate sector has grown on autopilot . There was no regard to city/town master plans and public utility spaces grabbed . <p> More important , our government has no pre-dispositions of the sacred ideals to be a social benevolent planner whose motive , actions and decisions are solely for the benefit of the masses . <p> Houses for who ? <p> In any market system , the cardinal rule of financial economic is that there ca n't exist any arbitrage ( profitable ) opportunity in equilibrium . Therefore , if there were any profitable opportunities in the low cost housing sector , the forces of supply and demand shall have wiped them away long time ago . As per the available real estate data , all the technology necessary to develop low cost houses is in the country . <p> So , why have investors refused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glut in the middle and high income segments ? <p> According to the Economic Survey 2018 , the economy averaged 2.5 million and 12.7 million jobs between 2013 -2017 in formal and informal sectors respectively . The average individual real income per month was Sh30,426 and Sh32,748 for the 2013-2017 period for private and public sector respectively . If we were to factor tax and other statutory deductions , the real net take home for majority falls below Sh25,000 per month . <p> These facts are collaborated in the FinAccess household survey 2016 . Of the 20.76 adults over 16 years old , 18.72 million earned Sh30,000 and below per month ; 1.75 million earned between Sh30,001 -100,000 ; and only 290,300 earned over Sh100,000 per month . <p> The 3 per cent contributions target the 2.5 million in formal employment . But , given their real net take home , can they really afford to service a mortgage ? From the scanty details available , the government is proposing to cap a bedsitter at Sh600,000 and a 3 bedroom at Sh3,000,000 . The interest rate being floated around is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( the government affiliated mortgage lender ) monthly repayments for a Sh500,000 loan at 4 per cent for 15 years is Sh3,698 ; for a 3 million loan is Sh22,190 . But can a family live in a bedsitter ? Does n't this explain why investor 's are reluctant to go into this segment ? <p> Why did slum upgrading collapse ? <p> Besides , is there really any vacuum in the low cost housing segment ? For starts , there is no society , community or group of people that is incapable of sum-mounding any economic challenges thrown on their path . While the policy- makers build golden mansions for themselves in exclusive neighbourhoods and investor 's gave them a wide berth , the hoi polloi regrouped among themselves in Saccos and Chamas and shilling by shilling , accumulated billions . When the winds of economic boom blew in 2003 they invested in " tu-plots " all over the country . In a nutshell , the masses the government seems to be targeting might actually be several miles ahead of it . <p> This push is purely political , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not feasible . Just why did the Kibra and Mathare slum upgrading projects collapse ? <p> Given , the " family home " is not only the most complex and difficult decision for those in the middle and lower income bracket , but also the most expensive . There are key lifestyle and socio-cultural considerations that defy any economic logic . For instance , the government says key in their target bracket are the young university graduates . <p> But we all know this digital generation of today will do anything never to be seen or associated with these perceived " low class " addresses . Are n't the policy-maker 's not aware of the now very big " sponsorship " and " slay queens " enterprise ? <p> Besides , majority of those lower in the pyramid may actually have no desire to own a home in the cities . Culturally , most Kenyans retire to some rural home , either their village of birth or some piece of land they bought in their working life .

If only he put these mathetics skills into realizing why he has cents on his balance : <p> If @SafaricomPLC get 50cents from each registered member daily thats is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Na M-Pesa is the Reason <p> Well , there are no algorithms involved , neither is the old , yet false , " Safaricom is stealing from us " game at play . The simple explanation is M-Pesa charges , not the non-decimal withdrawal and sending charges but the Lipa Na M-Pesa charges that you do not pay attention to . <p> Each Paybill and Till number has its own transaction charges . Some merchants are nice enough to do the heavy lifting and pay the full amount , some like equality and share the amount with you while some just leave you out to dry and you end up paying the full amount . Regardless of the situation , this is the first instance where you are likely to gather a few cents . <p> For instance , the screenshot below was obtained from one , @mmnjug , it shows that Shell Bellevue charged him Kes.2.50 transaction cost for his Kes.500 payment . There are many other instances of merchants charging transaction fees that have cents in them , this then translates to users having balances with cents . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ M-Shwari and also shareholders of Safaricom . M-Shwari users , I mean those who actually use it to save , get their interest deposited on their M-Pesa account and this is another source of cents since your interest is paid based on a percentage of your savings . Safaricom shareholders also get their dividends paid to them through M-Pesa and more often than not , this will include a few cents that build your mountain of cents . <p> So the accusations making rounds online that Safaricom , through M-Pesa is stealing from Kenyans are totally wrong .

Every one of us has their idea of a perfect holiday and once you decide where you want to travel to , you can get started as soon as possible , as early as six months in advance . <p> This can not be over emphasised , planning early gives you the best rates , enough time to explore all the exciting options and locations but most of all , it allows to set your budget and achieve it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Send : In one of my trips to the favoured Kenyan coast , during off-peak season , I inquired of the hotelier how they attract more guests in December , ( during low seasons , the hotels are not nearly full ) : " We are already fully booked , most of the guests and others who came last year , set a deposit and send instalments regularly , come December , they will not have to pay a large lump sum and they can still enjoy personalised care , good food and a relaxing time here . " Many airlines , including Jambojet may not have this option , but with our low flight costs , this is not a huddle when it comes to planning for your holiday . <p> STRESSFUL EXPERIENCES <p> Get there and enjoy ! Most of us do n't have too much trouble making the most of our holidays once we arrive . <p> But getting there and getting home again can be one of the most stressful experiences of the year , especially if you travel in peak season and with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spot in Malindi can be quite long and strenuous . As Kenya 's first low cost carrier , we have been flying Kenyans for four years and now your holiday can start the moment you leave your house .

@@50162234 <h> In Summary <p> " My name is Eunice Victoria and I have attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ) . I got diagnosed early this year , at age 27 . <p> When you get a mental illness diagnosis , people think you are mad or bewitched or they do n't believe you have it . For me , the diagnosis was a relief ; I finally understood why I had always behaved the way I did . My symptoms had exhibited since childhood ; it 's just that no one had been aware . <p> " When I was young , I was teased a lot for being overweight . I was also extremely disorganised . If I was n't motivated to do my chores , I could n't force it so I was beaten a lot and told I was lazy . I had trouble fitting at school . <p> This could be explained by the fact that one of the symptoms of ADHD is lack of restraint or boundaries with what you say or do . <p> I also express emotion to the extreme , be it happiness , anger or sadness . My mum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep quiet . <p> " I was lagging behind in nursery school so much that the sibling who was two years younger than me eventually caught up . No one in my family had ever repeated classes , so now , not only was I ' fat ' , I was also ' stupid ' . <h> Related Content <p> Recently , I went back to my primary school and in my records the teacher wrote things like ' easily distracted , disorganised , can do better ' . All classic signs of ADHD . <p> ' WIERD AND UGLY ' <p> " The first high school I went to , I was bullied so much that I asked to be transferred to a private school . It turned out to be worse . This was a mixed school and I did n't think I was beautiful . Also , because of my disorganisation , I appeared unkempt . I remember being labelled as ' weird ' and ' ugly ' . <p> This took a toll on my self-esteem . <p> " Anyway , I finished high school and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after pre-university , when they suggested I pursue communications , I wondered , who would hire me with my looks ?

But then symptoms of ADHD showed up . I would spend my whole salary on clothes and then I would be left begging for bus fare . <p> When I was angry , I shopped ; I just could n't stop buying clothes ! ADHD makes you impulsive . <p> EASILY BORED <p> " The other thing about ADHD is that I get easily bored . But if I am interested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very good at my job but when I got stressed , I became depressed . I was eventually let go . Shortly after that , I got another job at a motor manufacturing company .

But then again , I could n't continue because I did n't love it anymore . One day , I was told to explain why a customer had complained . I blew up . <p> I broke into my mother-tongue and used some choice words . <p> I was in rage . They were sitting there like ; we only asked a simple question !

She said , you have a good idea , but go and see a therapist first and let 's talks after . <p> That 's how I started therapy . <p> " One of the exercises my therapist recommended involved asking others what they thought about me ; the positive and the negative .

The fact that I have ADHD , depression and anxiety means I am a strong person ; not very many people can have this and still show up for life . <p> I also want to create awareness . My mum was telling about people in shags who have been locked up in their rooms all their lives because they have mental illnesses ! There is a child I know who is autistic and I can already see the denial ; everyone says ' oh , he just has slow speech ' . <p> He is autistic !

Some of the revolutionaries in history lived with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's the magic that made them who they are ! <p> " I am now pursuing my Masters in communications . I still get highs and lows . The highs are characterised by anxiety and sleeplessness . Sometimes I get this feeling that I will change the world and I come up with an idea on how to do it in less than an hour ! If it 's a business , I 'll even find clients . <p> Then the lows come and everything crashes and I have to start over . But now that I am on medication , I do n't get very low lows . <p> " Exercise also helps ; I carry a skipping rope everywhere so that when I start feeling some type of way , I go somewhere , even if it 's in a bathroom and I skip . My self-esteem has also gone up ; I no longer bleach myself or wear a fake behind -- I do n't feel that I need that sort of validation anymore . "

I then created a blog to interact more with my clients and expound on my interior d ? cor style . <p> Then came the hard part ; I had to figure out how I was going to make my finances work for me ; how I was going to run the business efficiently and provide quality products for clients while making a profit . When I originally began the business as a hobby , all that mattered to me was making my clients happy , often profit was an afterthought . However , because I wanted my business to grow , I was forced to be strategic with my money . <p> Additionally , I had to go on the ground and search @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ companies that would help me import goods . I also tried to direct my holiday trips to countries where I would get the chance to source for amazing interior d ? cor goods that were not in our market . Also , because I did not want to completely rely on the international market for my products , I decided to challenge myself and design my own decor pieces and make them locally . <p> My business is now a well-oiled machine ; it operates efficiently . For example , it has perfect delivery methods , strict operational and working hours , and well-structured payment method . I have also found a way to balance my career and my passion . I now know how to balance the two and work around both areas respectfully without them negatively affecting either . <p> WHERE I AM NOW : <p> My business has broken even . I have moved from making Sh2500 per month to not less than Sh50000 from my online platform . I am getting ready to open a physical shop at the Lavington Mall . I want to create @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not just in Kenya but in other countries as I have a number of clients from Tanzania and Uganda . <p> MY TIP : <p> You only have a viable and sustainable business if you can find a problem . So , before you start your business you need to find a problem and be the solution . Secondly , the key to success is to start before you are ready . You have to believe in yourself , listen to your gut and do what you love . <p> Thirdly , you need a great support system . I have my husband , Samuel Peter Okoth Nyabwa , he works with Multi choice Kenya , and is also a great businessman . He has walked with me and taught me a lot about running a business . <p> Fourthly , do not be afraid of competition . In fact , use positive and unique strategies to compete in the market . Engage in positive and healthy business competition by constantly being on the lookout for what is missing in the market and identify how you can you fill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your logo , your personality will be your business card , and how you leave others feeling after having an experience with you becomes your trademark .

The so-called saccos are running a failed system . <p> They must be scrapped and a cartel-proof innovative replacement found . The late Transport minister John Michuki , though hailed for sanitising the sector during his time , actually excercebated this mess by allowing a private transport operator to compete with an ailing Kenya Bus Service ( KBS ) rather than help it recover . That ushered in an imbroglio , particularly in Nairobi . <p> His so-called Michuki rules anchored on seat belts and speed governors were akin to treating symptoms of the public transport disease .

Those rushed rules can not yield any useful dividends in a city where suffering has only increased for commuters since their recent re-introduction . Fares have soared .

And that is only possible when the government steps into the sector currently in the grip of private hands and stops being a spectator awakened only by ghastly accidents . <p> The ongoing operation is knee-jerk , poorly executed and of no useful purpose . Reason ? Matatu operators are busy recovering expenses incurred on accessories . While logic underpins the fastening of seat belts for long distance travel , the same can not be said of crowded urban commuter service involving the movement of masses at short intervals . There were no seat belts for Kenya Bus and passengers were carried standing , yet accidents were rare . What ails public transport is abandoning this crucial sector to private individuals , including police officers entrusted with enforcing the rules . They can not punish their own crew and the impunity so engendered spills to other operators . This , coupled with endemic corruption , has mutated into something akin to stage four cancer .

David Njaaga , Standard <p> When farmers get their first flock , they normally start with excitement but along the way -- because of blunders they make -- end up with needless deaths . Today I will address the delicate process of handling chicks from the hatchery to your farm . <p> It is advisable to place chicks of similar age and from similar flock source in a single house : maximum five weeks difference if you have to mix donor flocks . <p> Placement per farm should ensure an ' all-in , all-out ' regime . This is how to do it : <p> Count chicks and confirm if the number is correct . <p> Reduce number of deaths <p> Remember that delays in placement can contribute to dehydration , resulting in higher chick mortality and reduced growth rates . <p> Ensure chicks are alert , active , and free of any obvious deformities , unhealed navels or sign of infection . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the supplier , for instance vaccination history/programme . <p> Transport chicks in well-ventilated but not windy vehicle .

Delays in placement can contribute to the dehydration of chicks and the delivery time should be as short as possible . Apart from chick dehydration , other issues with delays are high mortality and/ or reduced growth rates . <p> Finally home ! <p> Once in the chicken house , lower the light intensity during chick placement to reduce stress .

Dr Kimaru says , " Silage is an important way for farmers to feed cows and sheep during times when pasture is n't good , such as the dry season .

@@50222237 <h> The prolonged torture that is Brexit <p> BBC political correspondent Chris Mason stood outside of the mother of parliaments on Monday morning and said he did n't have the " foggiest idea " about where Brexit is going . Then he made what have been described as " exasperated noises " -- and promptly became an online viral sensation . <p> But Mason 's exhalations were a disgrace for two reasons . There was much to explain about the UK government 's draft deal on leaving the European Union , and many future possibilities to explore . More importantly , Brexit , for all of the chaotic politics it has provoked , is a genuine political argument conducted within the bounds of a robust democracy . Indeed , it is a sign of a robust democracy . To make exasperated noises about it is to mock the purpose of the famed public-service BBC in national life . <p> To be sure , the political process is chaotic , and at times alarming .

The nay-sayers include the Democratic Unionist Party , the largest party in Northern Ireland , which has provided a slim majority to give support to Theresa May 's Conservatives , but now seems too outraged by the implications of the deal for the province to continue . <p> To add strength to this view of the future , the cabinet has suffered a rash of resignations this week . One of those leaving is Dominic Raab , recently appointed as Brexit secretary charged with securing a departure deal . The government is being shredded bit by bit : the prime minister has retained the occupants of the three main offices of state -- the Chancellor of the Exchequer , Philip Hammond , the Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt and the Home Secretary Sajid Javid . If one of these goes , May 's government is over . Even now , Brexiteers are striving to fire her . And the best analysts of the parliamentary arithmetic indicate her time in office will soon be over anyway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so many object so strongly -- and for such very different reasons ? The overarching truth is two-fold . First , it is a highly temporary deal , with most of the technical details , especially on trade , still to be worked out in an extended negotiation period . And second , it constrains the UK , preventing it from making trade deals with non-EU states , as when it was a full member -- but giving it no voice in the councils of the Union . The UK will stay in a customs union , which will allow the continuing of frictionless trade between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland . But Northern Ireland will be subject to a tighter regulatory regime than the rest of the country -- a fact which leading Unionists in the province believe will hasten the break-up of the UK itself , and prompt Scots nationalists , who are in power in the Scottish parliament , to demand a separate deal -- arguing that Scotland voted heavily to remain , and bolstering their demand for independence . <p> The plan has attracted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a cage which the EU has constructed for an indefinite period .

The EU can not overcome national attachments and the desire of Europeans to have a government they can hold to account -- a necessary part of democracy the EU can not offer .

The solution to cheating is to liberalise exams .

@@50263235 <h> Why it is important to protect the rights of consumers in digital age <p> As the world marks World Competition Day ( WCD ) today , competition agencies face many challenges . <p> The regulated firms/organisations often accuse them of being quick to punish , but slow to sensitise them about the relevant laws to enhance compliance . On the other hand , many consumers , the ultimate beneficiaries of regulation , are unaware of their rights in a commercial transaction or the remedies available to them when their rights are infringed on . Indeed , for markets to operate efficiently , driven singularly by forces of supply and demand , all stakeholders ( producers and consumers ) need a good understanding of competition law and the benefits accruing from its effective application . <p> It is with this need in mind that the Global Competition Community set aside December 5 every year as the World Competition Day ( WCD ) . Consumer protection The objective of this annual event is to spur discussions and disseminate thematic information on competition and consumer protection and gain stakeholder support on the need for and benefits of a fair market . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 2018 event . This theme resonates with Kenya since , over the past decade , the country has experienced unprecedented expansion of its digital economy . <p> Internet penetration in Kenya is at its highest ever . Official statistics indicate that there were 41.1 million data users in the country as at June 2018 which is a significant increase from the 12.4 million subscribers as at June 2013 . This has precipitated innovation on a massive scale as entrepreneurs look to cash in on the opportunities presented by this connectivity . With just a few taps on a mobile phone , you can hail a taxi , buy clothes , book a holiday in Diani , pay school fees , order a meal or transfer funds between bank accounts . Innovation increases efficiency , spurs competition , lowers cost of doing business , encourages expansion to new markets and , most importantly , satisfies customers ' evolving needs through production of better quality goods and services . However , it also exposes consumers to new challenges including data breaches and identity theft . <p> Some unscrupulous business people fail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a service . Others are digital conmen . It is therefore critical that consumers understand their rights . Regulators , like the Competition Authority of Kenya ( CAK ) walk a tightrope in ensuring that markets function fairly and competitively and consumers protected , while at the same time supporting innovation . For instance , the country has over the past two years witnessed a proliferation of app-based money lenders who readily disburse funds minutes after users sign up to their services . <p> Mobile lending A study conducted by the FSD Kenya has revealed that about 6.5 million Kenyans have borrowed money through mobile phone platforms , sometimes at high rates which lock consumers in a cycle of debt . While these applications have opened up Kenya 's financial space , they should not be embraced to the detriment of consumers , who often times are unaware of the terms and conditions of the loans . A consumer can only be deemed to have made an informed purchasing choice if they had access to all relevant information prior to the transaction . An example of the Authority 's intervention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happened when it ordered all mobile-based financial service providers to disclose their charges prior to customers completing transactions . Today , when sending money through a mobile money app , or paying for electricity tokens , customers are notified of the expected cost of the transaction in advance , giving them a chance to decide whether to proceed or not . Additionally , the authority has been instrumental in the growth of app-based taxi services in the country . Last year , it investigated allegations that an international e-hailing taxi company was undercutting its competitors . The authority determined there was ease of entry and exit in this industry as players could move from one platform to another as well as from traditional taxis to app-based cab services . As a result , customers are enjoying competitive prices . These interventions exemplify how regulation can promote innovation and its raft of benefits , while ensuring that innovators do not trample on the rights of the very consumers they serve .

@@50263238 <h> The trouble with Kenya is our half-baked ideas <p> Spur-of-the-moment decisions and half-baked execution are the hallmark of Kenyan bureaucracy . <p> Government officials are notorious for making decisions from ivory towers , insulated from reality and informed only by ' best practice ' aped entirely from the West or East . We engage all our gears in these policies only to suffer loss and see our institutions begin to waste away under the weight of unworkable schemes . This past week we were treated to one such spectacle . The linking of teenage pregnancy rates to pornography . It was a reasonable leap in thought as indeed our teens receive more sex education from porn than they do from books , teachers and family . This is not the kind of education that they need , but given the low levels of adult engagement with our teens , it is obvious that they will seek it where they can find it : in porn . <p> From that point , the information becomes the norm , affirmed by the second-in-command to advise them : their peers . As a result , we have a teenage population that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Government is right on the effects of pornography on our teens , but woefully wrong on how to handle it . Assuming that restricting websites is equal to restricting porn is to live in 1998 in your mind when it is 2018 on the calendar . Cinderella land Allow me to explain . Porn is everywhere on the internet - on Facebook , Instagram , Telegram , WhatsApp . There are also millions of porn websites tucked away in the darkest corners of the web . To even imagine that you can block all these sites is to live in Cinderella land . It is simply impossible to do that - there are too many sites for one , and there are so many ways of delivering the content that it would be futile to try to stop it . The only logical path is not technical but much simpler : let parents parent . Let parents talk to their children about sex , let parents educate their own . <p> That way we do n't need a task force and extra taxpayer shillings to address teenage pregnancy ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be a scarce resource . We keep coming up with more and more half-baked ideas that we implement with zeal . What inspired the idea of stopping matatus miles from town and allowing in even more jam-causing personal cars ? I will tell you why ; because the idea is half-thought-out and half-baked . The half that is missing is that we have not yet deployed the bus rapid transport system , which is so easy to do and maintain that even Tanzania has one very functional one . It is uncaring and inconsiderate to assume someone can make it from Eastlands to Westlands for work without the connecting matatus being in proximity . <p> We increased fares and now we want them to find even more money to make connections . This was a half-baked idea that was executed because someone insulated from reality made a decision . Sweeping changes This tendency is also true in our universities . In our haste to implement sweeping changes , we got rid of the parallel programme , all in an effort to have an all-inclusive tertiary education system . Again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all despite economic status . But now what we have is universities that used to handle 12,000 students now receiving half of those students and the Government only paying 30 per cent of the required sum to educate them . This means that universities today have less money and fewer students , and as a result the infrastructure they had put in place is under threat of going to waste . Some universities have trouble paying staff . <p> In some cases , the staff has gone for three or four months without pay . Surely , wo n't half-baked universities produce even more half-baked graduates ? The same ' half-bakedness ' is applied in the conferences we hold . There was TICAD and , most recently , the Blue Economy Conference . Social media was awash with questions on what a blue economy is . The conference became a centre for taking selfies for the few who attended . There was been little pre- and post-publicity on the meeting .

We are a brilliant people and we have brilliant technocrats - now if we could only learn to bake . Our national cake , which we often allude to , is woefully under-cooked . Always with a nice golden icing but its innards are still a mess of good ideas mixed with bad execution . To move forward , we must be more practical , more sensitive to reality .

@@50263239 <h> Raising teens does not have to be hell on earth <p> Eight Ambira High School students cover their faces in the dock at Ukwala Law courts in Siaya county on November 26,2018 . The students pleaded not guilty to the charges against them and will be remanded for seven days pending investigations . Photo : Denish Ochieng/ Standard <p> Anyone who has successfully raised a teenager to adulthood deserves a straight ticket to heaven . That is because they have already been to hell and back ! So , goes the punchline of many a speech by your favourite toastmaster . And while the ensuing laughter may be gay and convivial , the subject of teenage behaviour , to some parents , conjures pictures of sullenness , resentment and rebellion akin to that of Hades itself . <p> The issue of the upbringing of teenagers is germane to current national discourse , not least of all , because of the behaviour of students of Ambira High School in Siaya County . The eight boys were captured on camera hurling insults at two Cabinet Secretaries whilst confessing to have cheated in the just concluded national examinations . Although the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dropped charges against the students , they can not escape responsibility for their reprehensible behaviour . The society , too , must be censured for allowing the proliferation of reprobates . <p> Empty slates Philosophers , from the days of Aristotle and John Locke , to the present , believe that children are born " tabula rasa , " ( Latin for empty slates ) . Society then fills these slates with the body of knowledge that equips them to live harmoniously with the world and humanity . Failure of any child is therefore a failure of society . In an environment that is as ethically and morally fraught as Kenya 's today , it is hardly surprising that society is failing . For starters , parents no longer seem to have time for children . Whether it is as a result of preoccupation with the search for transient riches or just downright inability to take up responsibility , children are now being carted off to boarding schools at increasingly early ages . As such , the people who should ordinarily exert positive influence on nascent minds cede that responsibility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then run of other malevolent actors having strong negative influences that manifest as indiscipline . Further , the lineaments of life in most public boarding schools cut the image of a hellish existence . Overcrowding in dormitories , inadequate ablution facilities and the poor food served that pass for meals , is enough to bring out the devil in the gentlest of souls . Second , the escalation of hostilities after every national election has helped to foment wayward behaviour in teens . Sour losers recourse to vituperation whilst winners are seldom magnanimous in victory . Civility is thrown out of the window and language degenerates to that of the gutter . If tales of cheating in examinations abound , it is because they are spurred by talk of " stolen " elections and wanton theft by public servants so that it seems the only way to get ahead in life is by larceny . The bravura of the Ambira eight was intended to elevate them to heroic status among their peers . After all , thieves in Kenya routinely find their way to leadership positions . Role models The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ First , the calibre of teachers must never be compromised . For many children , teachers are their primary role models and must be carefully curated to nurture only the best attributes in teens . <p> Second , the sort of duplicity that sees deviant national leaders escape censure should be done away with . Leaders who engaged in hate speech and theft should be subjected to the same swift retributive justice as the Ambira Eight . Third , leaders need to learn that respect is earned , not demanded . The thinking that calls for deference to authority based on age alone is ossified . Earning respect entails trust ; trust that leaders will deliver on promises ; that they will not steal elections or national resources and that they will conduct themselves with the decorum . Lastly , there should be a lasting approach towards issues of the youth that abjures the bare-knuckled Ambira eight approach . <p> Whilst the approach may serve its immediacy in curbing present excesses , going after the youth hammer and tongs only fuels resentment in the long-term .
