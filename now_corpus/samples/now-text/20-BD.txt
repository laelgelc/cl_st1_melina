@@51337239 <h> Between the rich and poor <p> A recent Washington Post article shed light on how billionaires in the US paid lower taxes than the entirety of the nation 's middle class -- encouraging us to think about whether the path we are taking in the name of growth and development is fundamentally flawed . <p> As Bangladeshis , it begs us to inquire as to whether the nature of development being witnessed in the country requires a systematic overhaul . <p> Interestingly , this state architecture consists of an ever-increasing number of businessmen and powerful elites -- a privileged group which has benefitted most from the development in the country , and that for me , as an observer , is concerning . <p> The nature of neoliberal capitalism has undoubtedly taken economies , including that of Bangladesh , towards a journey of nominal success . <p> But the numbers , when looked at more deeply , tell a different story -- across 2019 , the GDP growth rate of Bangladesh has hovered around 8% making it the symbolic jewel of all the Asian economies . <p> Nevertheless , the widening disparity between the rich and poor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for exclusive , rather than inclusive growth , has resulted in higher inequality levels across the country . <p> Whilst economic trends suggest that Bangladesh is now the 31st largest economy in terms of purchasing power parity , and on its way to becoming the 23rd largest economy by 2050 , the country has been unable to use its enhanced growth potential as means to sustainably reduce the rich-poor gap amongst its citizens . <p> Levels of inequality between the rich and poor are the highest in the country 's independent history and are expected to go up , even whilst poverty levels are reducing , albeit at a slower rate than past decades . <p> The benefits of development are going to the most privileged and powerful in society , including large corporations having direct links to the government , or , those occupying cabinet portfolios and other senior state offices . <p> Therefore , it is safe to say that neoliberal capitalistic architectures work in creating a camouflaged version of what reality truly is -- development in its truest sense is another tool for the privileged class to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the government of Bangladesh is in no way non-intervening when it comes to the development and governance of its country . <p> It has , to its credit , taken a number of initiatives to boost growth through state subsidization measures -- in areas ranging from digital technology to the accentuation of export processing zones . Yet , the government has intervened in arenas which they could have refrained from -- amongst these , are the government 's legacy of being primary actors in the slow yet systematic curbing of press rights , the use of law enforcement agencies as a subsidiary branch of the ruling party , the failure to instill accountability and neutrality within the judicial system , and the labeling of democracy standing in polar contrast to development . <p> In hindsight , if one is to think as to why development has not benefitted the middle class to the extent it has for the privileged , it is in this very notion -- the government has used resources and time to protect its own image , and those of the privileged with an understanding that such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ process . And therefore , we come back to square one -- the government 's tenure represents nothing less than a classic neoliberal approach towards development , and that is something which , for their very own legacy , they must address in the coming years . <p> One asks , how can they do so ? Well the answer lies in the very Constitution signed into law by the nation 's Founding Father -- Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman promoted the idea of an ideologically socialistic economy following the independence of Bangladesh . <p> A lot has changed in between , yet the root of development must be taken back to the notions of its understanding as construed by the likes of Sheikh Mujib and his economic advisers , including former PM Tajuddin Ahmed and academic Rehman Sobhan . <p> In June 2019 , Professor Sobhan cited subsidies , tax exemptions , and frequent loan rescheduling of defaulters as cases where the government 's inaction has resulted in the enhancing of the scope for the social disparity to flourish . <p> He also went on to suggest that he doubted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ received as much capital when compared to large corporations that have had a history of defaulting . <p> Professor Sobhan captures the root of the problem -- the government has intervened in arenas which it ought not to while sidelining its constitutional responsibility of being the architects of a welfare state . <p> That is the socialistic system promoted by the Bangladeshi Constitution -- where the state wilfully creates regulatory architectures and schemes to allow the middle class to have precedence over the richest in society , with an intention of creating an inclusive economy . And this is the destination towards which the AL government needs to navigate if it wants its impressive growth levels to be sustainable . <p> We do not need to be economists to recognize how fragile Bangladesh 's banking sector is -- neither do we need to ignore the fact that we have collectively created a system that works for a handful of people , rather than the entirety of society . <p> Otherwise , however much this nation develops and however many global brands operate in the country , it will be nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ addressing . <p> Mir Aftabuddin Ahmed is a Graduate in Economics and International Relations from the University of Toronto .

@@51475240 <h> The price of Wells Fargo 's fake account scandal grows by $3 billion <h> Wells Fargo has agreed to pay $3 billion to settle criminal charges and a civil action stemming from its widespread mistreatment of customers in its community bank over a 14-year period , the Justice Department announced on Friday . <p> From 2002 to 2016 , employees used fraud to meet impossible sales goals . They opened millions of accounts in customers ' names without their knowledge , signed unwitting account holders up for credit cards and bill payment programs , created fake personal identification numbers , forged signatures and even secretly transferred customers ' money . <p> In court papers , prosecutors described a pressure-cooker environment at the bank , where low-level employees were squeezed tighter and tighter each year by sales goals that senior executives methodically raised , ignoring signs that they were unrealistic . The few employees and managers who did meet sales goals -- by any means -- were held up as examples for the rest of the workforce to follow . <p> " This case illustrates a complete failure of leadership at multiple levels within the bank , " Nick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , said in a statement . " Wells Fargo traded its hard-earned reputation for short-term profits , and harmed untold numbers of customers along the way . " <p> Now the bank is grappling with the lingering consequences . Part of Friday 's deal , which includes a settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission , is a deferred prosecution agreement , a pact that could expose the bank to charges if it engages in new criminal activity . <p> " We are committing all necessary resources to ensure that nothing like this happens again , " Wells Fargo 's chief executive , Charles Scharf , said in a statement on Friday . <p> As part of its agreement with the SEC , the bank will set up a $500 million fund to compensate investors who suffered when Wells Fargo failed to inform them that its community banking business was not as strong as the fake accounts made it seem . The money is included in the $3 billion settlement total . <p> During the final five years of abuse , the bank quietly fired thousands of employees for falsifying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filings , and disciplined tens of thousands more . <p> In the filings , prosecutors described how , even after some Wells Fargo executives tried to curb the sales abuses , the bank hid the problem from investors by changing its public descriptions of its sales practices over several years . The intent was to be clearer about the limitations of the bank 's strategy , known as " cross-selling , " without tipping investors off to the problems that senior executives had uncovered , the filings said . <p> The practices covered by the settlement -- which includes an admission by Wells Fargo that it falsified banking records and harmed customers ' credit ratings -- are not the only misbehavior the bank has revealed since 2016 . Since the allegations came to light in a settlement with California authorities and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau , the bank has also admitted it charged mortgage customers unnecessary fees and forced auto loan borrowers to buy insurance they did not need . <p> The mortgage and auto loan claims are not part of Friday 's deal , and Justice Department officials @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ action against the bank . They said the settlement also did not include similar conduct that fell outside the 14-year period . <p> Wells Fargo is still under investigation by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau for abruptly closing customers ' accounts , and has said in regulatory filings that the authorities are looking into improper fees it charged wealth management customers . <p> Friday 's deal is also unrelated to a continuing criminal investigation of former Wells Fargo executives ' individual roles in the sales practices scandal . On Jan. 23 , the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency fined former top executives millions of dollars each for overseeing the bank while it abused customers . A former Wells Fargo chief executive , John Stumpf , agreed to pay $17.5 million . Carrie Tolstedt , Wells Fargo 's former head of retail banking , is contesting a $25 million fine . <p> Tolstedt was described by title , but not by name , in the court papers filed by the Justice Department as part of Friday 's settlement .

But it never released the figures produced by this new method , " in part because of concerns raised by Executive A and others that its release would cause investors to ask questions about Wells Fargo 's historical sales practices . " <p> " Ms. Tolstedt acted appropriately and in good faith at all times , and the effort to scapegoat her is both unfair and unfounded , " her lawyer Enu Mainigi said in an email to The New York Times . <p> Friday 's $3 billion settlement , while large , is not record breaking .

Including Friday 's penalty , the bank has paid more than $18 billion for misconduct since the financial crisis . <p> Senior Justice Department officials told journalists in a briefing on Friday that the bank 's payments to other authorities , including $1 billion in fines to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau in 2018 , were a mitigating factor in determining how much it would owe in the current settlement . <p> Wells Fargo 's profits last year totaled nearly $20 billion . <p> In early 2018 , the Federal Reserve imposed growth restrictions on Wells Fargo that will be lifted only after the bank has shown its regulators that it has made significant changes to prevent bad behavior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ October , Scharf has not offered any hints about when that goal might be accomplished .

@@51588232 <h> Looking back at the 50 years of Bangladesh Mahila Parishad <p> With the whole world entangled in the coronavirus pandemic , we have no other option but to shut down all work and fight to contain the deadly disease . Apart from the medical aspect of this battle involving doctors , health workers , physical facilities and equipment , it is also a massive social struggle with the people of the world coming together . In the midst of this unprecedented global crisis , with all public programmes cancelled , we have an occasion worth celebrating -- the 50th anniversary of the founding of Bangladesh Mahila Parishad . The struggle of Mahila Parishad to promote the rights of the women in Bangladesh is part of the global movement to establish a society where men and women are treated equally . It is both a national and global struggle , like the present one against the coronavirus , incorporating individuals , families , communities , the nation and the wider world out there . <p> Bangladesh Mahila Parishad was established on April 4 , 1970 , immediately after the mass uprising that toppled the decade-long military rule of General @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movement ; their massive participation was a new phenomenon , and in the end they created a platform of their own to promote the rights of women . Sufia Kamal , the respected poet and social activist , was the President and Maleka Begum was the General Secretary . Sufia Kamal was joined by a group of senior activists who had pioneered the women 's movement in the early days of Pakistan . The bulk of the new members came from the student movement of the Sixties . They were vibrant and committed . <p> In a way , Mahila Parishad reflected the long journey of women 's struggle in Bengal . Among others , Sufia Kamal was the junior-most associate of Rokeya Sakhawat Hossain , Manorama Basu was a veteran of anti-colonial movement , Hena Das was a legendary leader of the peasants movement , etc . The large number of young activists formed the base with blessings from the veterans . There can not be a better combination . The new organisation quickly expanded its branches but got engulfed in the great War of Liberation of the Bengali @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a big impact on society , especially on the women who contributed in many ways to become victors and suffered great pain as victims of sexual violence . The emergence of Bangladesh as a secular , democratic , national and liberal republic created great euphoria while Mahila Parishad started a new journey . Women 's role in society can no longer be denied in the name of obscurantism or religious bigotry . The constitution adopted in 1972 recognised the equality of man and woman . As affirmative action , the victims of sexual violence during the war were recognised as " Birangana " ( or war heroine ) , quota for women in government service was introduced , seats for women in Parliament were reserved as a temporary measure , etc . But such policies were few in number and symbolic in nature . The patriarchal society imposed its own dictum on the lives of women . The male-dominated society was not ready to accept women as equal in their rights . There existed a huge gap between constitutional proclamations and the policy and practices of the government . Moreover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if not more . <p> Against this backdrop , Mahila Parishad organised the women for the recognition of their rights and formulation of appropriate policies . It did its utmost to protest against violence and stand by the victims . In view of the widespread violence , the intervention of Mahila Parishad was selective but nonetheless made a big impact in society . Its quick , effective and persistent action brought many cases to the limelight , exposed the vulnerabilities of women , drew attention to the need for formulating proper policies and reforming the law . One can cite the example of Shabmeher whom the traffickers sold to the sex traders which ultimately led to her death by suicide . The brutal murder of Saleha by Dr Iqbal , or Sharmin Rima by Munir , both from the affluent educated class , showed how vulnerable women were irrespective of their social or educational background . The case of Noorjahan , a rural girl from Kamalganj , Moulvibazar , stoned to death following a fatwa by a local Maulana , shocked the nation . Similarly , the rape and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Dinajpur gave rise to massive protests where Mahila Parishad played a major role . In many such cases , Parishad activists had to launch sustained and persistent acts to ensure justice for the victims . The mural of Yeasmin erected by the local branch of Mahila Parishad on the road to Dinajpur reminds all of the victims and their struggle for justice . <p> Such acts highlighting the violence against women were a learning experience for BMP too . Gradually , the organisation developed an elaborate mechanism to provide legal support to persecuted women , establish Rokeya Sadan as a home for women victims and their children , advocate strongly for the enactment of law to protect women , adopt appropriate policy in support of victims , etc . As a result of such actions , the government enacted Act on Women and Child Abuse in 2010 . Proper implementation of the law is the new challenge that requires many support mechanisms as well as reforms . <p> The holistic approach of Mahila Parishad has driven the organisation to adopt multifarious measures being carried out by the members of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a Uniform Family Code . As part of this effort , in conjunction with legal experts and civil society representatives , they formulated a draft law in 1997 and handed it over to the government . This is a forward-looking document that storms the citadel of patriarchy . The growing participation of women in the workforce has made it imperative for BMP to address the issues of their rights , protection , pay , health , support mechanism and other related issues . <p> The linkage of national struggle with the global march of women for their fundamental rights was part of BMP 's goal right from the beginning . The close relation with the left-leaning World Federation of Democratic Women inspired BMP to introduce 8 March as the International Women 's Day in Bangladesh as early as in 1972 . The subsequent development within the UN to promote women 's rights has opened up new opportunities for the organisation . The organisation is a strong partner in monitoring the implementation of CEDAW charter . It is also lobbying for the full ratification of CEDAW including clause 2 and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in both governmental and non-governmental policies and implementation . The content and form of women 's movement are changing and BMP has to redefine itself in light of the new reality . <p> Sufia Kamal proclaimed in late Eighties that women 's right is a human right . This is a globally recognised slogan to make women equal to men in every aspect of life . In Bangladesh , BMP became the embodiment of that struggle , with its widespread organisational network incorporating members from a broad spectrum of society , both rural and urban . The voluntary participation of women is the basis of the organisation and this is what makes BMP different from others . The organisation has transformed itself to meet the new challenges of life ; it has expanded its organisational network , turned itself into the largest women organisation of the land , and at the same time it remains rooted in the nation 's past and true to its core philosophy as an organisation linked to the great tradition of Rokeya and others , composed of members rendering voluntary service to the cause of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long way .

" Somehow , I do n't see it for myself . " <p> Trump 's announcement , followed by his quick dismissal , was a remarkable public display of the intense debate that has played out inside the West Wing over the past several days as a divided administration argued about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ social behaviour . <p> Dr Steven Choi , the chief quality officer and associate dean at Yale New Haven Health System and Yale University School of Medicine , said the president 's behaviour at the briefing contributed to confusion among health care workers and regular Americans . <p> " For anyone , particularly the president of the United States , to ignore recommendations from the CDC is not only irresponsible but selfish , " Choi said . <p> The president 's remarks came during a particularly contentious briefing where Trump insulted reporters , jousted with members of his own administration and returned to pugilistic form after several days in which he appeared to grasp the grim implications of a virus that could kill hundreds of thousands of Americans . <p> Trump again dismissed the recommendation of Dr Anthony Fauci , the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases , for a national stay-at-home order , saying he would leave such demands to the governors . But he did say that the federal government would pay hospitals to treat coronavirus patients , instead of allowing people to buy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exchanges , as many Democrats have urged . <p> The mask debate has played out in public and in private . Trump said Americans who choose to comply with the CDC 's recommendation should use a basic cloth or face mask , not medical- or surgical-grade masks that are used by hospital workers and emergency workers . He also said people must still follow social distancing guidelines , which he called the " safest way to avoid the infection . " <p> Senior officials at the CDC have been pushing the president for days to advise everyone -- even people who appear to be healthy -- to wear a mask or a scarf that covers their mouth and nose when shopping at the grocery store or while in other public places . <p> The embrace of such a policy would be one of the most visible alterations to social habits in the United States in the face of a pandemic that has infected more than 1 million people around the globe and killed nearly 60,000 -- a physical manifestation of fear that has gripped millions of Americans . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dr. Robert Redfield , said that as many as a quarter of those already infected may show no symptoms but still contribute to " significant " transmission . Local officials in New York and Los Angeles have already called for people to cover their faces in public . On Friday , the governor of Pennsylvania called on his state 's residents to wear masks when they go out . <p> The surgeon general , Jerome Adams , stood next to the president Friday and urged Americans to comply . <p> " The virus can spread between people interacting in close proximity , for example coughing , speaking or sneezing , even if those people were not exhibiting symptoms , " Adams said . " In light of this new evidence , the CDC recommends and the task force recommends wearing cloth face coverings in public settings where other social distancing measures are difficult .

Other officials believed that was excessive . <p> One top CDC official who has seen emails from people in the West Wing said that some of Trump 's advisers were pressing him to recommend mask wearing only in " areas of widespread transmission . " That worried CDC officials because the virus has already spread , largely undetected to most parts of the country . Wearing masks or other face coverings everywhere , including in places where there are few reported cases , will help slow the rate of infection , they believe . <p> The result was been a policy stalemate that played out on live television . <p> Dr Anthony Fauci , director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases , and Dr Deborah Birx , White House coronavirus response coordinator , wait for the start of a coronavirus news conference at the White House in Washington , Mach 31 , 2020 .

( Erin Schaff/The New York Times ) <p> Dr Deborah Birx , coordinator of the White House coronavirus response , expressed serious reservations Thursday , saying that asking all Americans to wear masks could inadvertently signal that Americans can abandon social distancing and return to public life as long as they wear a mask . <p> " We do n't want people to feel like , ' Oh , I 'm wearing a mask . I 'm protected and I 'm protecting others , ' " Birx said at the daily briefing . Others at the White House have expressed worry that asking all Americans to wear masks could heighten shortages for doctors , nurses and emergency workers , even if they urge people not to seek the highly protective , and scarce , N95 masks used by hospital staff . <p> Fauci said in an interview on CNN this week that " you do n't want to take masks away from the health care providers who are in a real and present danger of getting infected . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ N95 masks , which filter at least 95% of particles that are 0.3 microns or larger . In a move to increase the availability of masks , the Food and Drug Administration said Friday it would allow use of a Chinese equivalent . <p> Sceptics inside the administration also raised doubts about whether people in the United States would ever feel comfortable wearing masks in public , noting that the cultural norms are different in America from some Asian countries , where the use of masks became more common after previous outbreaks . <p> Some conservatives have said they did not believe that Americans would ever accept wide usage . Michael Dougherty , a conservative writer at National Review , wrote that Americans would " quickly feel that masks are ridiculous , menacing , or an imposition on life , then conclude they must be temporary .

On Friday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Democrat , urged residents of his state to wear masks if they ventured out of their homes , the state 's health secretary reiterated that staying at home -- away from groups of people -- remained the most effective way to ensure that the virus would not spread . <p> " A mask is n't a pass to go back to work , or go visit friends , or go socialize , " said the health secretary , Rachel Levine . <p> At the World Health Organization briefing on Friday , Dr Michael Ryan , executive director of the health emergency program , said that while the WHO still recommended masks only for front-line health workers and those who are sick or caring for someone who is , " we can certainly see circumstances in which the use of masks , both homemade or cloth masks , at community level may help in an overall comprehensive response to this disease . " <p> Sen. Patrick Toomey , R-Pa. , has been one of the most vocal supporters of wearing masks . In an interview from the basement of his home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with lawmakers who tested positive for the virus , he said wearing masks would help limit the effect of it . <p> " It just makes sense to have some kind of physical barrier that would reduce the droplets that are released when people speak and breathe , " Toomey said . " The idea is to protect everyone else . My mask protects you . Your mask protects me . " <p> Toomey said he spoke with Trump on Wednesday to urge him to recommend masks for everyone . He said the president seemed " very sympathetic " to the idea but did not reveal his course . <p> " He did acknowledge that it was under very serious consideration and the subject of fairly intense discussion among his team , " Toomey said . <p> He said it was " premature " to conclude that Americans would not wear masks . " Who 's to say that people wo n't respond in a way that this becomes acceptable and normal ? " he asked . <p> Evidence arguing for the use of face masks to limit the spread @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Friday in the journal Nature found that flat surgical face masks significantly reduced the number of virus-carrying droplets that mask wearers released into the surrounding air . <p> Although the study did not look at the new coronavirus , researchers based their analysis on closely related seasonal coronaviruses that cause the common cold and are similar in size to the virus that causes the disease COVID-19 .

Ambulance lights shone against the darkness . Downtown on Broadway , a man in his late 40s greeted the bus . No , he was not the patient . He was her landlord but he had called 911 because she had just informed him that she had been sick for a while . He wanted her taken away from his building . <p> The woman , worn , red-eyed , wrapped in a scarf , her hair wild , appeared in the doorway .

@@51617240 <h> COVID-19 and Default of Commercial Loans : Looking Ahead <p> The time we are living in is unprecedented , to say the least . While claims relating to health , social and political unrest are undeniable , the economic disaster that we are facing now or will be facing in the future is worrying . The experts are unanimously predicting that there will be substantial employment cuts across most sectors in the aftermath of the pandemic and the affected countries will face a sharp decline in economic prosperity . It is predicted that Bangladesh will not be immune from this catastrophe either . The World Bank 's report suggests that Bangladesh 's gross domestic product growth will fall from last year 's 8.15 percent to 2 percent by the end of this financial year ( June 30 ) , with the highest growth range peaking at a mild 3 percent . <p> At this rate , many companies and other corporations will face massive losses and will be forced to wind up their businesses , or declare bankruptcy . The inevitable result will be a rise in default of loan repayments . To combat this situation and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ utmost importance . The Government of Bangladesh is very much aware of this economic challenge and , through its actions , has taken an aggressive approach in its fight to keep our economy afloat . The Hon'ble Prime Minister has already declared generous stimulus packages to be distributed through the Bangladesh Bank and several initiatives have also been taken by the Bangladesh Bank to support businesses to navigate through these troubling times . Some of the noteworthy steps include , inter alia , declaration of stimulus packages for helping the export-oriented businesses to pay wages to their workers , credit provided to service-oriented businesses at a subsidised rate to be used as working capital , credit provided to small and medium enterprises ( SMEs ) with nominal interest , creation of a refinancing scheme in the form of a special incentive for the agricultural sector , and so forth . <p> It is felt , however , that a more aggressive approach may be taken by the Bangladesh Bank to address the problems which will be faced by the borrowers in repaying their loans . It is clear that ailing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the current financial climate . As part of its crisis mitigation strategy , the Bangladesh Bank , by exercising its powers under the Bank Companies Act 1991 , has already directed all scheduled banks not to downgrade the classification of any borrowers for defaulted loans between the period of 1 January 2020 and 30 June 2020 . Additionally , by exercising its powers under the Financial Institutions Act 1993 , the Bangladesh Bank has also directed the financial institutions to do the same . In a nutshell , these initiatives by the Bangladesh Bank have led to a status quo on credit classification which has to be maintained by the scheduled banks and financial institutions during the said period . This is undoubtedly a helpful step taken by the Bangladesh Bank which will aid the defaulting borrower 's situation given the current circumstances and the looming crisis . However , it is suggested that , in order to effectively mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on the borrowers and , resultantly , the economy , the Bangladesh Bank may consider announcing a more robust regulatory package . Among other measures , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the repayment of debt , relaxation of certain norms for working capital facilities , and so forth . <p> Apart from a stay on credit classification ( as mentioned above ) , the Bangladesh Bank may also consider offering a moratorium to the ailing borrowers on their loan repayments . A moratorium can be termed as a payment holiday , which allows the borrowers to defer due payments for a specified period . In simple terms , the effect of a moratorium will be that if any bank or financial institution in Bangladesh grants a moratorium to the borrower , then the borrower will not be required to pay the loan amount due to such a lender , during the moratorium period -- thereby giving the borrowers the much needed " breathing space " . <p> The moratorium shall defer all instalments , including the interest payable during the moratorium period for all the term loans , and all of the interest accumulated during the moratorium period can be paid at the end of the repayment schedule . For working capital facilities , the moratorium will only suspend the interest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during this period shall be payable after the end of the moratorium . In this way , the borrowers can concentrate on focusing to keep their businesses afloat and retaining their employees rather than going on a spree of employment cuts and lay-offs . It is believed that this may not have a massively adverse effect on the bank 's profits as well because , consequently , the repayment schedule for such a loan account will be extended and the amounts payable during the moratorium will , in any event , be repaid during the said extended period . This proposal has also been suggested by the World Bank and has already been introduced by our neighbouring country India , where the Reserve Bank of India ( RBI ) has permitted all commercial banks , including regional rural banks , co-operative banks , all-India financial institutions , non-banking finance companies and housing financing companies to grant a moratorium for up to 3 months on the payment of all principal , interest and repayment instalments ( between 01 March 2020 and 31 May 2020 ) to their borrowers for all term @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a moratorium , by exercising its powers under the Bank Companies Act 1991 , the Bangladesh Bank can also direct the scheduled banks not to trigger the default clauses under the loan agreements . Typically , a financing facility provides for a material adverse effect , popularly known as ' MAE ' , as a trigger for an event of default . The banks generally negotiate an expansive definition of MAE which includes any event that has a materially adverse effect on the business of the borrower . Undoubtedly , COVID -- 19 has already brought large swaths of the world 's economies to a grinding halt through the lockdown , and the financial markets have almost entered the recessionary territory . As a result , the future cash flows of many businesses will get negatively impacted , which may trigger MAE in a financing facility , subject to its terms and conditions . Generally , the banks do not favour a ' force majeure ' clause in their financing documents , since it may allow a borrower to avoid its payment obligations . In the absence of an explicit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a situation like COVID-19 , the borrowers will be left to argue an implicit ' force majeure ' clause -- thus increasing disputes and litigation between the parties . A clear guidance from the Bangladesh Bank may certainly avoid such a situation . <p> Another important area where the Bangladesh Bank can provide some valuable assistance to the ailing borrowers is the valuation of assets kept as security . The COVID-19 pandemic has already upset the stock market , with recession looming large . All these factors have a cascading impact on the valuation of assets . In a secured financing transaction , the security package may have a variety of assets such as shares , immovable properties and moveable assets . If the security depletes , a bank can typically ask a borrower to replenish the security . If the borrower fails to replenish the security , it will constitute an event of default , which entitles the bank to accelerate repayments under the facility and enforce any security . <p> Since most of the assets kept by the borrower as security will devalue , unless the Bangladesh Bank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at liberty to sell these assets at the reduced value and then claim additional security from the borrower for their remaining loan amounts -- thereby creating more pressure on the ailing businesses . Recently , an Indian High Court restrained a bank from selling the promoter 's shares , in the current crisis , which have been pledged to the bank as security .

The case is ongoing and it will be interesting to see if such a precedent is set and whether other courts will follow suit . <p> Lastly , due to increasing defaulting loans and the dangers of being declared insolvent , the Government of Bangladesh may also consider a temporary suspension of the insolvency provisions contained in our relevant Companies Act and insolvency statutes .

@@51682234 <h> US FDA approves first antigen test for detecting the coronavirus <p> FILE -- A health care worker holds a swab at a drive-through testing centre for the coronavirus in New Rochelle , N.Y. , March 16 , 2020 . ( Andrew Seng/The New York Times ) <h> The Food and Drug Administration has approved the first antigen test that can rapidly detect whether a person has been infected by the coronavirus , a significant advancement that promises to greatly expand the nation 's testing capacity . <p> The test , by the Quidel Corp . of San Diego , was given emergency use authorisation late Friday by the FDA , according to a notice on the agency 's website . <p> Unlike commonly available coronavirus tests that use polymerase chain reaction , or PCR , antigen diagnostics work by quickly detecting fragments of virus in a sample . The newly approved Quidel test will rely on specimens collected from nasal swabs , according to the FDA , and they can only be processed by the company 's lab instruments . <p> " Diagnostic testing is one of the pillars of our nation 's response to COVID-19 , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ critical products available , " the agency said in a statement Saturday . " One of the main advantages of an antigen test is the speed of the test , which can provide results in minutes . " The FDA said it expects to grant emergency clearance for other antigen tests in the near future . <p> A shortage of coronavirus tests in the United States has hampered efforts to contain the pandemic and has limited the capabilities of states seeking to ease the lockdowns and social distancing measures that have throttled the nation 's economy . <p> Although antigen tests are extremely accurate in detecting positive infections , they can not detect all active infections , and they have a higher chance of false negatives than PCR tests . Positive test results may also need to be confirmed with the slower but more accurate PCR test , which relies on detecting the presence of genetic material . <p> Experts said the approval of an antigen test for COVID-19 would boost testing efforts by giving medical workers and health authorities an inexpensive tool for mass rapid testing .

" A lot of us have been looking forward to this moment . " <p> Jha said he still had questions about the sensitivity and specificity of the test . He noted that even an antigen test that produces false positives is preferable to one that results in false negatives because infected people given a negative result could unknowingly spread the virus to others . <p> " It 's ideal to have low false positives and false negatives , but usually you 're trading off between the two , " Jha said . " The reason you 're willing to live with more false positives is , you want to be able to screen people , and if they are negative , you want to feel confident that they are truly negative . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shopping ever be the same ? <p> A temperature scanner at Lane Crawford in Hong Kong , May 7 , 2020 .

Galeries Lafayette began to reopen its stores in France on Monday . Nordstrom said that by early this week , the company plans to have 32 stores open -- a combination of full-line stores and Nordstrom Rack locations in South Carolina , Texas , Oklahoma and Tennessee . Selfridges and Harrods are also expected to reopen in the coming weeks , subject to British government directives . <p> So far their plans are similar : Employees will wear face masks and submit to health screenings ; some store layouts will be reconfigured to create more space and promote one-way traffic flows ; customer capacity will be limited ; stores will be cleaned more often ; hours will be reduced ; hand sanitiser will be liberally available ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tutorials , bra fittings ) will be suspended or adapted . <p> There are also a few differences : At Nordstrom all employees will wear gloves , for example ; at Saks they will not . <p> Yet even with these plans announced , or soon-to-be announced , none of the retailers know how they 'll be received . <p> " We have this idea of what it 's going to look like when we open the doors , " said Jamie Nordstrom , the company 's president of stores . " We 'll be wrong about half of it . " <p> Despite years of financial turmoil , the purpose of department stores has largely remained unchanged . They are still one-stop shops for a sprawling catalogue of goods ; they are still home to Santa Claus photo ops and panic buying before the holidays ; they still exist in the imagination as settings for movie makeovers and dressing-room montages . <p> Many people are hungry to have this kind of shopping experience again . But many are also feeling " psychologically vulnerable , " said Michael R Solomon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's going to be a downer , " he said . " Nobody wants to be out there wearing a mask , even if it 's from Gucci . " <p> Consumers may turn to shopping , as they have in the past , to deal with the emotional stress of this moment . Yet how can they escape that stress when they 're surrounded by reminders of it ? <p> " The most basic thing people will be looking for is health and well-being : Am I going to be safe ? " said Mary Portas , a retail consultant and broadcaster . " That said , the fact people want to come to that space means they are going to buy . They have made the effort . They have intention .

One commercial cleaning company , Enviro-Master , has even begun offering clients certificates to hang in their windows proving they received a " virus vaporiser " service . <p> Visibility offers reassurance , and wary shoppers need reassurance . That starts at the entrance to their stores . <p> " It 's important that the measures implemented are visible and become rituals , " said Andrew Keith , the president of Lane Crawford , the high-end department store chain in Hong Kong and China ( where its locations , bar one in a Beijing mall , remained open throughout the coronavirus outbreak ) . <p> Keith said that his store 's employees , like most others , must wear masks and have their temperatures checked when they arrive . So must Lane Crawford customers ( who also declare their travel histories ) . Such policies are unlikely to catch on in other regions , Portas said . <p> " I ca n't see somewhere like Britain having temperature checks on every entry and exit point for customers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a cultural fit . What feels reassuring in Asia might feel off-putting here , when buying a new piece of fashion . It is still about selling a dream , after all , even if this is the new retail reality . " <p> This is the challenge of reopening an upscale department store right now : fitting the dream of luxury shopping -- " the treasure hunt , " as Solomon put it -- into the anxious reality of an ongoing pandemic . <p> " In stores like this , you want to appeal to the senses , and not just visually , " he said . " You want to use textures and touch -- and wearing gloves and so on does n't help that . So you design around that . " <p> MJ Munsell , a retail designer and the chief creative officer at MG2 , an architecture firm in Seattle , offered a number of ways retailers can manufacture warm environments upon entry . They could have associates show personality with customised protective gear ; build elaborate and delightful displays of merchandise ; diffuse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to boost energy , particularly when there are fewer shoppers around . <p> Companies should n't take these steps only at their outsize flagships in New York or Los Angeles , Munsell added , but at their comparatively overlooked suburban locations , too . <p> " The retailer who is going to succeed is going to understand the value of that suburban experience , " Munsell said . <p> Nordstrom said its strategy for its 116 locations ( soon to be 100 , with many in suburbia ) is to " overcommunicate . " Before reopening , the company wants to prepare shoppers for what to expect by posting photos and videos of the changes on social media . It wants to hold customers ' hands -- in a gloved , socially distant kind of way -- from the moment they walk in ( and are handed a disposable mask ) to the moment they check out ( behind a plexiglass partition ) . <p> " We 're thinking about how we really double down on communicating , not just through signs or tape on the ground , " Nordstrom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the doors talking customers through what 's going on , guiding them throughout their journey in whatever way customers want . " <p> WHO GETS TO BE A VIP ? <p> The beating heart of a department store is the beauty counter -- typically on the first floor , near a busy entrance , staffed with eager and eagle-eyed representatives from each brand . <p> Makeovers and smoky-eye tutorials happen here . Perfumes are spritzed and moisturisers are sampled there . A lot of money is spent . But without skin-to-skin contact , the experience of testing and purchasing products will change dramatically . <p> " Brands are going to have to be very inventive , " Munsell said . " We still need someone to help us through the vast assortment of choices . " <p> Virtual try-ons -- technology already used by Sephora and Ulta , among others -- could become standard . Employees will need to find new ways of demonstrating how to use products ; they may still be able to put eye makeup on a customer ( though that could violate social distancing ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face mask . And not everyone will want a high-touch , high-technology experience . <p> As with makeup , the experience of trying on clothes in a fitting room -- those small , and confined , shared spaces -- will also change . <p> " Are customers going to feel safe going into a dressing room ? " Munsell said . " Do we need to consider spacing them out or making them larger ? Having them be by-appointment so they can be sanitized by a sales associate in advance ? " <p> At Saks and Nordstrom , clothing brought into fitting rooms will be quarantined ( 48 hours at Saks , 72 at Nordstrom ) before being returned to the sales floor . The same goes for returns -- and Nordstrom expects its first few days back in business to be dominated by returns of merchandise bought online during lockdown . <p> At Saks , foot coverings used when trying on shoes will also be thrown out after one use . Nordstrom will rely on visibility , spacing out dressing rooms and posting forms indicating the last time they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the company said . <p> If this all sounds like a more intimate , personalised and VIP-style experience than the traditional shopping trip , that 's intentional . <p> Most high-end department stores are expecting foot traffic declines in the high-double digits when they reopen their doors , particularly in cities dependent on tourist shoppers . In Paris , Nicolas Houz ? , the Galeries Lafayette chief executive , said that he does not expect to see a return to normal levels of business until the end of 2021 , adding that it had lost " hundreds of millions " of euros worth of expected sales . <p> But the expectation is that those shoppers who do return in the coming months will be far more likely to buy . Simply put , retailers need to be selling more goods to fewer shoppers . And that means rolling out the red carpet . <p> " Last Monday , we had an extraordinary transaction in Beijing , " said Keith of Lane Crawford . " A customer contacted her stylist and said she was making one of her first journeys outside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the store but only had an hour . She bought 80 pieces of ready-to-wear and accessories , a total transaction of 1.4 million renminbi " -- around $200,000 at current conversion rates -- " in that hour . " <p> A tiny handful of shoppers can afford such a spending spree , but customers should expect a higher degree of service and attention , regardless of how much they can spend . <p> Marc Metrick , the president of Saks , said that while store hours will be reduced , the company will offer by-appointment shopping before opening and after closing , " giving people the opportunity for one-on-one service when the store is limited to just a few customers . " Virtual appointments to shop via video conferencing are also in the pipeline . Lane Crawford has introduced an app that lets associates send personalised looks to customers . <p> Associates will play a more important role than ever before in making shoppers feel comfortable in what may initially feel like clinical or alien surroundings . <p> " Retailers often talk about how it starts with a smile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're wearing a mask . " <p> DINE AND DASH <p> Before the pandemic , retailers were increasingly entering the hospitality business . But for now , department-store dining options -- from coffee shops to cocktail bars -- in cities like London and New York are shuttered . When they do reopen , most will adhere to the local directives are in place for the hospitality industry , from double spacing between tables and online rather than physical menus . <p> " It 's certainly going to look different for some period of time , " Nordstrom said . <p> In Britain at least , food service has started to resume in some department stores . The food hall at Selfridges reopened on May 1 , albeit with a limited number of shoppers allowed inside , a one-way traffic policy , hand sanitiser pumps everywhere and sneeze guards for staff , who also have their temperatures checked once a day . <p> Eventually , it 's assumed , food and beverage service will return to normal . Strict social distancing measures will be relaxed -- like Saks ' decision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , pregnant or disabled . ( Escalators are still in service , though steps will be marked to keep shoppers 6 feet apart . ) <p> But the last stop customers usually make at a department store -- the cash register -- may permanently change . <p> At Lane Crawford , centralized cash registers have been replaced by remote points of sale to limit lines , while associates roam floors with tablets or phones ( wearing gloves to handle all cash and credit card transactions ) . <p> Western department stores are likely to follow suit , with many looking at how to install contactless checkout and create more space at stores for curbside pickup and returns and " click and collect " stations , where customers can claim items they already bought online . <p> According to Portas , these services will become increasingly important as customers adjust to shopping in the COVID-19 era . Many shoppers will be too nervous or unable to browse or linger in line , she said . Munsell added that she expected to see more stores using Apple Pay , or their own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already becoming more technologically savvy , bridging their e-commerce and brick-and-mortar businesses . COVID-19 has meant that these efforts have been accelerated by a few years . But this acceleration will require money and time , which were in short supply even before the lockdown began devastating retailers . <p> Still , Nordstrom appeared sanguine in the days leading up to his stores ' reopening announcement , as if accustomed to his industry 's constant and ruthless change . <p> " A lot of old department stores that have gone away over the last 20 to 30 years -- they stopped changing , they stopped evolving , " he said . " The minute you stop evolving , the customer is going to move on . Who knows what curveball gets thrown at us a week from now ? "

I felt a sense of dread . I asked myself , " Is this something I can handle ? " I felt scared , but there was no running away . It was what I had to do . My colleagues all felt the same . I feel a strong bond with them now . The sense of camaraderie is like that of a war veteran . <p> I felt so bad for my family . At first , they were against me being dispatched to the hospital , but later they supported me . My daughter said , " Mom , you are amazing . My friends think so , too .

Now I 'm focused on hooking people up to ECMOs for heart and lung support , and managing the machines . <p> I have to be more accurate and safer than usual , but using senses that are now worse . Our face shields fog up in an instant . We 've also started wearing three pairs of gloves . It 's like I 'm trying to treat patients through a fogged-up shower curtain . <p> I ca n't do things by myself the way I used to . I understand how important it is to work as a team . I 'm trying to avoid disagreements about the patients ' treatment more than before . Even if there 's a difference of opinion in the team , we do n't have the time to discuss it at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hospital to hook an elderly patient with advanced cancer to the ECMO . It was my boss ' decision . Thinking about the number of ECMOs and the need for treatment going forward , the chances of recovery and so on , they thought it was n't appropriate . <p> When you have to make that decision yourself , I think that 's really tough . There are patients coming to us who we absolutely must save . Finding a way to save them is our job . <p> When I 'm off , I 'm really careful that I do n't bring the virus home with me . I 'm not seeing my family to make sure I do n't give it to them . I just shout , " I 'm home " when I walk through the door . We have our meals at different times . <p> Claudio Del Monte , chaplain <p> Bergamo , Italy <p> I go around dressed like the medical staff , with protective eyewear , a good surgical mask and another wider one on top to protect it . I put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so that people understand that I am the priest . I walk around holding a small cross and a small bottle of sanitiser . There are already bottles in the halls , but there are moments when a patient reaches out because they want to hold your hand . Like doctors and nurses , I wear more than one set of gloves . <p> I 've never gone into a room to pray with one patient where the other patient did n't want me to say a prayer with them as well . If they tell me that they are not Christian , there 's always time for a greeting because certainly the mystery of everyone 's life is intangible . <p> During the most delicate moments , you are accompanying someone heading toward the infinite and there is fear . So you tell them , " Do n't be afraid . You are going toward the light . Have faith that God is with you . Do n't be afraid . " <p> Those are the things we whisper in their ears . <p> It 's a medical situation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Melissa Todice , nurse <p> Shelton , Connecticut <p> It kills me when I hear , " Well , that 's what they signed up for . " I never took a pandemic nursing class . <p> The biggest change is worrying about myself . Going into the rooms and flinching when patients cough , even though we 're covered head to toe . Feeling guilty you flinched at all . Guilty that they ca n't see my face , hear my voice , muffled under my face shield . Guilty that I ca n't hear them . Then leaving them alone in that room . <p> The guilt has no beginning or end . <p> Amanda Dasaro , EMT <p> Staten Island , New York <p> When people are experiencing their worst moments , I feel good knowing that once I arrive I can make a difference . We did choose this job , but we are human and people have their limits . Some of us are just getting by , some of us are doing fine , and some of us are just not OK . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when I looked my 7-year-old son in his eyes and said that I loved him and would see him later . I walked out the door with a few personal belongings and a few clean uniforms . I chose to live in temporary housing so that I could protect my family . Did I want to quit and stay home ? Yes . <p> The calls skyrocketed . I have pleaded with patients to hold on while transporting them . I have told them to be strong while they are wheeled into a room full of nurses and doctors waiting to intubate them . I feel horrible for having to tell family members that they could not come with their loved ones . <p> There have been plenty of times these past few months when I have broken down and cried to my work partner . Sometimes I just hug her with no words needed . I often ask her , when will this end ? <p> Enrique Bolo ? a Gilbert , critical care doctor <p> Guayaquil , Ecuador <p> When you work in intensive care , seeing people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So very few things scare you . But I had never felt what I have felt in the past few weeks : Afraid of getting myself infected and putting my family at risk . I woke up fearing going to work . I went to bed afraid . It drains you . <p> As head of the ICU , I have to supervise everything , every case . Prioritising , organising , coordinating is very stressful . There was a time when we had 64 COVID-19 patients , 34 of whom were intubated . We have not had a single day off in the past six weeks . <p> Thank God , we never had to choose to remove ventilation from an old person to give it to a young person . Yet , I had a 44-year-old patient who died , and that hit me hard . I thought : " This guy is my age , he was pretty healthy . If I get infected , it could happen to me . " At that moment , I realised how fragile life is . <p> Amanda Ramalho @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! I never thought I 'd be living in this warlike situation . Still , I 'm happy to be of help and I take a lot of care not to be contaminated . <p> The hospital provides us the PPE , but I buy more with my own money , like some glasses that were more comfortable than the standard ones provided . <p> Since we 're wearing the PPE , we have to be conscious of going to the bathroom . Sometimes I skip the bathroom altogether . <p> I first tested a patient for COVID on March 12 , and I have n't hugged anyone since then . I went to see my family once but did n't get out of the car . <p> I live by myself . I miss my family and friends a lot . <p> Brooke Spence , critical care nurse <p> Las Vegas <p> My patients are watching the news and seeing how many people are dying around the world , knowing they are positive . They ask me if they are going to die . I tell them that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home to their loved ones . <p> I chose a career in health care -- specifically , critical care -- because I wanted to help others in their most vulnerable and dire time of need . I put my faith in God and take precautions by properly donning , removing and disinfecting my personal protective equipment . But in the back of my mind , I ca n't help but wonder how much the risk of infection increases from constant exposure . <p> Judit Amig ? , endocrinologist <p> Barcelona , Spain <p> " Tomorrow you are not coming to this department , from now on you 'll be in a COVID ward . " That 's what I was told on March 14 . I had mixed feelings of courage and fear . Attending to these patients was daunting . The moment I went through the door of their room , my muscles tensed and I could only think of how contagious the virus was . Lack of PPE contributed to the creeping feeling of risk . Patients kept being transferred to the ICU every day , many of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together . <p> Thomas Lo , anesthesiologist <p> Queens , New York <p> On 9/11 , I was working at Morgan Stanley on the 73rd floor of the World Trade Centre . It was actually my birthday . When the second plane hit my building , I felt the entire building shift and sway . I thought we were going to topple over . I thought , " I 'm not going to survive this . " <p> An event like that gives you a different perspective on life . A few years later I realised that I was meant to be a doctor and make my life count by helping others . <p> Now we have another war in New York and in the world with COVID . I 'm an anesthesiologist , so I 'm intubating patients who are no longer able to breathe on their own . I 'm right by the patient 's airway , often inches away , as I place the breathing tube .

Afghans are so conservative , they do n't want male doctors to check their women . Women are losing their lives . That is why I decided to become a midwife . I save moms ' lives . <p> When the COVID-19 centre was established , I applied for a job . <p> I work 12 hours per day . Many people , including pregnant women , come for tests . Sometimes it is hard to handle , but it is a crisis and people must be kind . <p> A few days ago , a pregnant woman with symptoms came to the centre . Her husband said no men were allowed to check her , even if she died . We put the woman in isolation . My co-worker and I went to check her . She was panicking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I lost myself , but very soon I realised I needed to stay strong and help her . We took her blood and checked her blood pressure . When she gained consciousness , she started crying and said she wanted to go home . I told her the virus does n't kill everyone , and it is n't a thing to be ashamed of . Anyone can get it . It was hard to convince her , but we made it . <p> Ferrukh Faruqui , family physician <p> Ottawa , Ontario <p> For a few years , I 've thought of quitting medicine . In my family practice , I see affluent people who are discontented with their lives , the medical system and doctors . And they 're not afraid to say so . <p> This week , I went back to acute care medicine to look after COVID-19 patients . The first day , I stood tall . We gowned , gloved , donned our masks . And we went out , like soldiers do , to fight a common enemy . <p> I 'm reading EKGs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm connecting with patients in a way that matters again .

At the end of December , we started hearing about an outbreak , but because the government had still not publicly disclosed anything , we really did n't know any details . <p> Then , at the beginning of January , I heard some colleagues say that the respiratory department was suddenly having a lot of patients die . Dr Li Wenliang the whistleblower doctor who died of the coronavirus and became a symbol of many Chinese people 's anger and frustration was my co-worker . Even though I never spoke to him , we worked in the same part of the hospital , and I recognised him . <p> When I first found out that he had tried to warn people about the virus , and then been censured by police , I thought , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the time , the government was saying there was no human-to-human transmission , so I relaxed a little . <p> When I saw the news that he had died , I was so surprised . He was so young , how could this happen so suddenly ? I could n't sleep . I cried all night . Five doctors at our hospital died during this epidemic . <p> Because Wuhan was locked down , from the start of the epidemic until now , I have n't had any chance to visit my hometown . I can only video chat with my parents and tell them I 'm OK , they should n't worry . Now that Wuhan 's lockdown has been released , I think in a few days I will go home to see my parents . <p> Christelle Nancy Diane Mike , doctor <p> Yaounde , Cameroon <p> I have been attracted to the medical profession for as long as I can remember .

What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a medical doctor , to achieve that ? <p> I am currently working with the Doctors Without Borders COVID-19 team in Buea , in the southwest region of Cameroon . During the first weeks of the outbreak in my country , my sister developed the symptoms of COVID-19 . She called every night to complain about a severe headache , which I thought was related to her wearing glasses . She cried on the phone for days and added that she had lost her sense of smell and taste . <p> Travelling to her was not possible . Her fear of going to the treatment centre was another stress . But I helped in managing her case from afar , and she recovered . I am scared this pandemic will not be controlled soon . There is a high risk of having to bear this for longer than we wish . But my will to help has not changed a dime . <p> Ilaria Sommonte , nurse <p> Naples , Italy <p> When the coronavirus appeared in China , I never thought it would involve Italy so directly and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , gentle-looking man who came to us with already well-known diseases , including Alzheimer 's .

Other times , he silently watched me while I was doing my job . <p> COVID-19 worsened his situation , hindering him from breathing freely , making it difficult for him to even drink a glass of water . During a night shift , he passed away silently . That silence echoes in my head because his two daughters had called us daily to get news of their father , but that night they could not wail in pain or hug the man who raised them for the last time . <p> This COVID crisis has totally changed the way I live my life .

That 's when I realised that we were dealing with something we had never seen before . <p> Daniel Akinyemi , ICU nurse <p> Montclair , New Jersey <p> Our ICU is very busy .

So usually I will put a glove over the phone so that I can answer . <p> About a month ago , I had a patient on a ventilator whose husband kept calling . When I spoke with him , he said he believed in God and the power of a miracle . We said a little prayer together over the phone and I asked , " Does she have a favourite song ? " He said she 's been singing Blue Bayou ever since they met . When she does laundry , when she does her hair . I knew the song and I said , " I will sing it for her . " <p> I play songs for patients on my phone . I found out that you can have your iPhone in a sandwich bag and you can actually unlock it with your thumb . I sang it to her while it was playing . And I read her favorite verse in the Bible , Psalm 23 . The monitor started going off . Basically she started sucking in the air that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side and she was looking toward the right .

I am proud of what I do . The biggest challenge here is to get all the necessary supplies , such as drugs , personal protection equipment and other materials . We usually get supplies from international providers , but with all the restrictions to travel and closure of borders , it 's getting more and more difficult . We risk facing shortages when it 's crucial for frontline health workers to be protected in order to avoid any new contamination chains . This situation makes us think out of the box . For instance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ million tissue masks in the local factories , in order to distribute them to the general population . <p> Francis X Riedo , infectious disease doctor <p> Kirkland , Washington <p> The improbability was striking -- that two patients in one critical care unit in a small , community hospital in a suburb of Seattle would both test positive for COVID-19 . It was Feb. 28 . <p> With the first result , I suspected a testing error . With the second result , we understood that our 318-bed hospital had the first known cases of community spread in the U.S. <p> In that moment , our lives changed enormously . <p> One day , it dawns on you that your entire academic and professional life has prepared you for this moment . <p> Am I concerned about getting COVID-19 ?

@@51682237 <h> Making best of COVID-19 : Pushing online learning in higher education in Bangladesh <p> We have come a long way in teaching and learning using technology . Whatever we call it -- online learning , virtual learning or e-learning , it has made education that is independent of time and place . Users have access to course materials 24 hours a day , seven days a week . Learning management systems ( LMS ) makes it possible to upload course materials , assignments , and exams as well as to create discussion boards and other communication tools . Online learning has made distance learning accessible and an effective alternative that is traffic-jam free and unaffected by unexpected campus closing because of shutdowns , strikes , and man-made or natural calamities like the coronavirus pandemic . Online learning makes it possible to not lose a semester or spend extra money for overstays in hostels . As a result , it solves the problem of campus housing , which is always a major problem for university students . This also provides opportunities for stay-at-home mothers and persons who have jobs but would like to advance their degrees . <p> Online @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : flexible schedule and environment ; independence of place and time ; saving in on-campus housing ; independence of transportation hassles and expenses ; student-centred learning according to the learner 's convenience and timeline ; equal opportunities for all students -- introverts and extroverts alike ; improving technical skills through the use of LMS ; freedom from campus buildings or fixed learning resources ; access to many free courses like Massive Online Open Courses ( MOOCs ) and modules from anywhere in the world ; access to lectures from world-famous experts in the discipline ; supplementing in-class learning ; finishing a semester strong and on time and independent learning and time management . <p> There are a few myths on online learning including : online learning is less rigorous ; online promotes " cheating " and can not be monitored effectively ; learning online is isolating and lonely ; and the instructors are inferior . These are all unfounded . Online delivery can be done with maximum rigor and professionalism . Because of these myths , unfortunately , there was a strong resistance to implementing online learning in higher education @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ welcomed because of its " disruptive " nature . In traditional classroom teaching , students are tested on what they read . In online learning , the emphasis is on authentic learning -- learning by doing . Students engage in various ways , such as through experimentation , real-world problem solving , problem-based activities , case studies , and participation in discussion boards and virtual communication . Exams and quizzes are proctored like in the TOEFL and GRE to avoid cheating . Online learning provides a strong networking community for group study , discussion , and sharing ideas and interests , reducing feelings of isolation or loneliness . In universities in global north , most on-campus instructors also facilitate online courses , and all online instructors are required to go through training on online teaching-learning . Communication with instructors usually takes place through telephone , email , discussion boards , virtual live meetings , and chatrooms . <p> Online learning requires specific software , hardware , technological know-how , and , of course , high-speed broadband internet . An LMS is required for uploading courses and related resources on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are some of the popular LMS platforms . Moodle is a free open-source LMS . Desktops , laptops , tablets , or smartphones are needed to access an LMS . A webcam or built-in HD camera and a high-quality headset help in video conferencing and live classroom sessions using Zoom , Skype for Business , Blackboard Ultra , and WebEx . Virtual live meetings can be treated as traditional classroom sessions from one 's residence , and all activities can be recorded for later review or for students who missed a class . These classes provide the students with the opportunity to ask questions and participate in discussion . <p> Many of the private universities in Bangladesh proactively adopt new technologies to provide contemporary education to their students . These students are able to complete their education on time and will have an added advantage in the job market . Most private sector employers will prefer candidates who are trained in online learning because most jobs will require such expertise . Unfortunately most public universities are lagging behind in offering their students an opportunity to complete their education on time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ situation . It is slated that the universities will probably remain closed for many months causing wastage of precious time for students . <p> Some of the private universities in Bangladesh have been delivering their courses online since the onset of the pandemic in March 2020 . For example , BRAC University 's James P. Grant School of Public Health offers a one-year full-time Masters in Public Health ( MPH ) program , with half of its student-body coming from abroad . As the lockdown started , BRAC University went online , and most of the courses were offered remotely . In the MPH program , students have already completed the modular course on epidemiology , which was done with interactive teaching followed by Q&amp;A . Using Google Form , the School has also successfully conducted exams . According to the course coordinators and School administration , there were some initial hiccups as the students returned home following the lockdown , but since then , it has been running without any significant challenges . The students ' attendance in ' classes ' has also been one hundred percent . Such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first author was a Fulbright visiting faculty at the School . Moodle was the learning management system used , and the course went successfully . <p> There is more than one way to train faculty members to teach online within a short period of time . Resources are available to offer free training . Technology companies can help with hardware and software . Policymakers and regulators such as the University Grants Commission can play a significant role in developing guidelines and making available the needed resources to incorporate online learning as an integral part of learning in higher education . A challenge in scaling up online teaching-learning is the mindset ( often of teachers ) and in addressing this both persuasion and regulation will be necessary . The public universities in Bangladesh must not shy away from this transformation .

@@51712239 <p> This year 's theme of International Women 's Day -- " Think equal , build smart , innovate for change " aptly fits with the achievement of women farmers at Maheshwarchanda village in Jhenidah 's Kaliganj upazila , where the change-makers ' innovative steps help promote gender equality and women 's empowerment . <p> Kaliganj is very rich in agricultural diversity . Walking beside the Chitra river , one would see fields covered with various crops . Winter vegetables , sugarcane , betel leaf , guava , baukul ( Bau variety of plum ) are on fields . Large patches of land are covered with marigolds . Boro paddy is planted in relatively low lands . Farmers are earning well by cultivating different varieties of fruits and crops here . Farmers know that soil is the source of their livelihood . And so , they are conscious enough to take care of the soil . They are encouraged to use organic fertilizer more and reduce the use of chemical fertilizers . <p> Dear readers , today , I will take you to a village of organic farming . The village is known as Maheshwarchanda . <p> The commercial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some nearby ones has already generated great response in the country . <p> Poet Kazi Nazrul Islam wrote in a song of his , " The soil of my country is purer than pure gold . " But that soil is losing its purity due to unplanned cultivation , excessive tilling and massive use of chemical fertilizers . Thus , fertility of the soil is gradually decreasing . Currently , there is about 79.46 lakh ( 7.9 million ) hectares of arable land in the country . And the organic components of these cultivable lands play the most effective role in maintaining quality of the soil . Ideally , the amount of organic compound in the soil is supposed to be five percent . But in most areas of Bangladesh , the amount of organic compound has dropped below one percent , which is a matter of great concern . The main reason for this is the increased intensity of high yielding crops and excessive use of chemical fertilizers . Various types of programmes , both public and private , have been taken to find a solution to this problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conducted in rural areas to signify the importance of organic fertilizers . Maheshwarchanda village of Jhenidah 's Kaliganj upazila has become a role model . Here , in every household , farmers are making vermicompost , which is truly a rare example in the country . <p> The commercial production of vermicompost was unknown to the common people and rural masses even a decade ago . Readers , I remember that in the ' 80s , from the time of ' Mati O Manush ' on Bangladesh Television , I used to continuously broadcast programmes , explaining to the farmers about the importance of organic fertilizers and later on with ' Hridoye Mati O Manush ' on Channel i , I have been inspiring farmers to do it from the very beginning . Vermicompost production has spread across the villages of Fulbaria , Shivalaya , Belabo and Raipura , mainly through the hands of rural women . And now it is being produced more or less all over the country . <p> In rural areas , women have joined this work . They are producing poison-free crops . It meets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earning money by selling additional crops . For this reason , vermicompost is playing a very important role in socio-economic changes of rural livelihoods . <p> I went to Maheshwarchanda village earlier , quite some time ago . Then I saw how creative their idea of protecting the soil was . When I came here again after seven or eight years , everything looked different . It seems that the soil , nature , farming and people of this village understand each other 's language . I have to add again , women farmers have played a pivotal role in this change . <p> When I reached Maheshwarchanda , the sun had tilted to the west . Homemaker Shahnaz Parvin of this village was then busy working with tools for producing vermicompost at her courtyard . I talked to her . She mentioned how vermicompost changed her life . Once very poor , Shahnaz Parvin changed her life by producing vermicompost . She now lives in a concrete house with tiled floors . In front of the building , stands her vermicompost producing plant . <p> Shahanaz said she earns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a month by selling vermicompost . She produces 600 kg of vermicompost a month . And she sells about 10 kg of worms per month . Shahanaz said , she uses vermicompost with her own land . As a result , the land needs less irrigation on 24 kathas ( approximately two acres ) of land . <p> Shahnaz Parvin 's mother-in-law Rebecca Begum was present there . She has been able to bring solvency to the family by producing vermicompost . She has received social recognition for this organic farming campaign . She has been honoured with certificates , crests and awards from public and private organisations . <p> Like Shahnaz and Rebecca , by producing vermicompost Sultana , Mariam , Mili , Sahiron , and many other women have become self-reliant . Ninety-three families among of a total of 96 families in Maheshwarchanda village have engaged in the production of vermicompost . Vermicompost is being produced on large clay-made containers kept on courtyards , cattle farms or empty places . It has created employment opportunity for rural women , at the same time villagers have got back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has decreased production cost too . <p> I saw a cattle farm near a rice mill . The cow dung is used for biogas production which meets the rice mill workers ' need of cooking fuel . And the slurry of the cow dung is used to produce vermicompost . Altogether , the production cycle is great here . <p> Dear readers , tomorrow ( March 8 ) is International Women 's Day . It is a time to reflect on progress made , to call for change and to celebrate acts of courage and determination by ordinary women who have played extraordinary roles in their communities and countries , says UN . <p> This year 's theme , " Think equal , build smart , innovate for change " focuses on innovative ways in which we can promote gender equality and the empowerment of women , particularly in the areas of social protection systems , access to public services and sustainable infrastructure . <p> The achievement of the ambitious Sustainable Development Goals ( SDGs ) requires transformative shifts , integrated approaches and new solutions , particularly when it comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and girls . And , I firmly believe the women and girls of Maheshwarchanda have just done that and the world has to know it . <p> The need of organic farming and safe food production has been recognised by all farmers of this region . Women have predominantly come forward while men are following . Each woman will turn into a successful farm entrepreneur in the near future in this village by making vermicompost , I am pretty much sure . The soil of this region will be much more productive with their contributions . Financial solvency will reach every household . More importantly , producing safe food is the key to ensuring good health and these women have done this . I hope that day is not far when no farmer of the country will depend on excessive pesticides or chemical fertilizers . Rather , they will be encouraged to protect the health of the soil and produce pure , fresh , healthy and organic crops for the people of Bangladesh . 
@@51712240 <h> Niloufer Manzur -- An Unparalleled Nation Builder <p> As I write this amidst a deep sense of shock , sadness and disorientation , I remain at a total loss for words . Words are my strongest suit -- I love writing , and I always have . Nevertheless , what do you write about , when the person who helped you pick up your first pencil , or the one who captained a magical journey called childhood , departs from your world ? In fairness , there is nothing barring emptiness in your heart . This is what thousands of teachers , students , staff members , alumni and well-wishers of Sunbeams school are feeling today . The beloved founder and principal of this noteworthy institution Niloufer Manzur breathed her last in Dhaka at the Combined Military Hospital in the early hours of 26 May 2020 . She had tested positive for Covid-19 recently . <p> Mrs Manzur was a nation-builder in the truest sense of the word -- and this too while being surrounded by a plethora of notable personalities in her own family . Her father , husband and children have made their own contributions to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her students , Mrs Manzur held a unique place in their lives , independent of the prominent status her family has across Bangladeshi society -- not because she craved fame or desired attention , but because her story of perseverance , tenacity and collective growth is both humbling and yet unreservedly inspiring . Her tale is one of women empowerment and of the timeless testament of investing in people and it is a story worth sharing . <p> Photo : Collected <p> In 1973 , in a nation devastated by a nine-month struggle for independence , Niloufer Manzur , like most in her generation , was concerned about the future of her two children Nasim and Munize . As a teacher , she wanted to build a future for her toddlers -- and so , with the blessings of her friends and the support of her husband , Mrs Manzur , put her feet in the world of academia . In fact , it was more of a hopeful jump rather than a dip in uncertain waters -- her initial capital coming from a loan of BDT 10,000 from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desks and some benches , which she painted red -- red standing for prosperity . On 15 January , 1974 she wrote Sunbeams on a blackboard outside her residence at Indira Road and rang the bell -- and thus began the journey of Sunbeams School . <p> From moving around home furniture each day to accommodate classes at her home to building what is perhaps one of the most progressive institution 's in Bangladesh , Niloufer Manzur stood as a beacon of education and hope as the principal of Sunbeams for 46 years . Come to think of it , she started the school with 8 students , two of them being her own children -- today , as we mourn her passing , she leaves countless children and admirers who only wish they could thank her in person one last time , before she departed this world . <p> Sunbeams is a school with a small student body -- this perhaps , was Mrs Manzur 's niche brand of education . She focused on quality , rather than quantity . She put thought to family and community -- some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I recognise what her overriding philosophy truly resonated towards -- it was never about how many students were graduating from Sunbeams , but rather , it has always been about the ability of the school to mould individuals to be responsible community members . Members who share an unyielding set of principles and values . It is important to reflect on what she believed in , and perhaps these words from her message on the Sunbeams website can shed some light : I believe each student has a role for tomorrow . Each student has so much to offer . In terms of ability . In terms of talent . In terms of opportunity . They are the new face of Bangladesh . With feet that transcend borders , we hope to prepare them to be equally at home with the east and the west . <p> Photo : Collected <p> There were three remarkable aspects about Mrs Manzur which I believe is crucial to share . The first , being her unwavering dedication to Bangladesh -- her beloved country . The study of Bengali as a language and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ private English-medium schools -- nevertheless , Mrs Manzur made it a point to mandate the study of our language , our history and by definition , instilled a sense of duty to the nation . Secondly , she never shied away from stating an obvious truth -- members of the Sunbeams family were and continue to be from the elite and privileged sections of society . And in repeatedly driving us to acknowledge this privilege , whilst simultaneously institutionalising a sense of patriotism , she navigated her students towards remaining humble . Yet being so , by remaining committed to be the future of Bangladesh . And this is a sense of duty which I take to heart deeply . And lastly , she remembered the names of every single student , teacher , staff member and alumni by heart , across my time at Sunbeams -- call it caring or call it a photographic memory , this aspect of Mrs Manzur continues to amaze me . <p> Tributes have been pouring in for Mrs Manzur as I finish writing this . One of her students deemed her a class @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and dignity to the fictional Headmaster of the Harry Potter series Albus Dumbledore . Another reflected on a video where she made a comment to a batch of recent recruits to the Sunbeams family -- a statement which signifies the love she had for her students and the joy she felt in expanding her family . With a characteristic smile and her soft yet captivating voice , she said : I am still floating on clouds -- Please , give me time to come down . <p> But one aspect of how she fashioned Sunbeams , is being repeated across social media by her well-wishers : the school motto defined by the 7 beams of sun in the logo itself . If one were to reference certain principles to describe Niloufer Manzur , the mention of these values , her values , would be enough -- knowledge , leadership , patriotism , integrity , humility , confidence and commitment . The biggest tribute we can pay to this iconic educator , is to continue enshrining these simple yet fundamental principles across our communities . <p> On a personal note , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teacher and a defining guardian . Bangladesh has lost a leading light in the field of modern education -- she was the kind of leader who never craved glory , but rather dedicated her entire life for children . She gave meaning to the notion of knowledge being power -- and she thrived while educating . She was a change-maker of the highest order . To make Sunbeams a premier institution in Bangladesh , that too independently and within the framework of a paternalistic society , took guts , courage , vision and a willingness to serve -- and she ticked all the boxes . She leaves behind her husband , children and grandchildren in a state of mourning and shock -- we keep them in our thoughts . But while it may sound selfish of me , Mrs Manzur belonged to us all -- and we collectively feel the pain of losing our very own . No words , no OP-ED and no statuses across social media can appropriately pay tribute to Niloufer Manzur , because her impact on moulding human beings across generations can not be defined by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to write about the life of Niloufer Manzur -- and there will come a time when her students themselves will share these stories . But I end by saying this : I walked into Sunbeams in 1998 and an angel called Mrs Manzur stepped into my life -- that Mrs Manzur will forever live on in my heart . Your students and this nation owes you an immense debt of gratitude . The beam of light and hope that you were , will carry on , even as the sun sets on your life and we will make you proud . Rest in eternal peace Mrs Manzur . <p> Mir Aftabuddin Ahmed is a student of economics and international relations ( Honors Bachelor of Arts ) at the University of Toronto .

@@51775231 <h> Editorial : Time to get rid of the DSA for good <h> Govt should address allegations rather than suppress public opinion <p> The illusion is long gone -- or perhaps , as media observers remind us , it was never there -- the illusion created by the proponents of the Digital Security Act ( DSA ) that it could be used to address actual threats facing users on digital platforms . It never happened . Far from being an improvement on its infamous predecessor ( Section 57 of the ICT Act ) , this law , if anything , has turned out to be a more frightening version , an instrument of intimidation used ever more zealously to punish opponents and suppress any hint of critical opinion directed at the powers that be . Even during the Covid-19 crisis , we have witnessed how its wielders have frequently sought to disrupt the free flow of information and views , which is vital to save lives . According to data gleaned from the Bangladesh Peace Observatory ( BPO ) , a project by Dhaka University 's Centre for Genocide Studies , at least 142 people , including journalists , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so-called " misinformed " news , or their social media activity . These are only reported cases , and a picture of the full extent of harassment endured by critics in various forms is yet to emerge . <p> Against this backdrop , a group of teachers on Monday joined the growing chorus of voices calling for the abolition of the Digital Security Act . Members of the University Teachers ' Network , a platform for private and public university teachers , staged a sit-in to express their demand , saying , rightly , that the government is applying the law against those who have been outspoken about corruption , abduction , killings and other irregularities . Instead of addressing those allegations and saving people 's lives , which should be a priority amidst a raging pandemic , it is being used to protect corrupt politicians and bureaucrats , they alleged . They also called for the immediate release of all those arrested under the DSA . Their demand comes on the heels of a police arrest of a 14-year-old student of class nine in Mymensingh on Saturday , allegedly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prime minister . The incident , which followed after he was framed in a case under the Digital Security Act , caused widespread public outrage . <p> Under the circumstances , we think the demands raised by the university teachers merit serious consideration . The public has a right to know about , and speak out against , the mismanagement , corruption and irregularities that are endangering their lives and livelihoods . Equally , the government has a responsibility to listen to the legitimate concerns of the people and take adequate measures to address them . Using repressive measures and laws such as the DSA to suppress their voices only serves to create an impression that people 's safety and security are secondary to the interests of their representatives . This is not the image that Bangladesh can afford to have of itself at a time when its ability to handle the crisis is being questioned globally . It is time to make the DSA obsolete , or better still , repeal it for good .

Clem , a postdoctoral researcher at Victoria University of Wellington in New Zealand and the lead author of the study . <p> While climate change resulting from emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases has very likely played a role , the analysis showed that natural climate variability could account for all of the extreme swing in temperature , effectively masking any human-caused contribution . <p> " The Antarctic interior may be one of the few places remaining on Earth where the anthropogenic signal can not be easily teased out due to such extreme variability , " Clem said .

But the only other permanent base on the plateau , Russia 's Vostok station about 800 miles from the pole , has also recorded rapidly rising temperatures , he said . <p> The ripples from the tropical Pacific also had an effect on the Antarctic Peninsula , which for most of the late 20th century had been one of the fastest-warming areas in the world .

Nowadays , you can find Smartphone devices built by diverse local and international brands . Their lucrative advertisements often make people confused . Many buyers can not understand what to look for in a Smartphone , which ultimately wastes their money . Read this article to get some tips to buy the best Smartphone in 2020 . <h> What to Look for While Choosing a Smartphone <h> HD vs FHD Display <p> What kind of display you are looking for , HD or FHD ? The term HD refers to pixel measurement of 1280 x 720 pixels . On the other hand , the Full HD or FHD features display measuring 1920 x 1080 pixels . <p> However , the pixel density of any Smartphone depends on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Smartphone has a 6-inch or bigger screen , you can enjoy the splendor of an FHD display .

IPS display drains battery power , as they need stronger backlights . Furthermore , IPS LCDs can make the phones bulky . If you emphasize daylight readability , bright white screen , sharp texts along with vivid images , then you can buy Smartphone bearing IPS LCD display . <p> On the other hand , the AMOLED display is an advanced form of previous OLED technology . Though the AMOLED screen is less visible in daylight and can not make the images excessively sharp , the modern panels offer better color-contrast and superior viewing angles . If you prefer longer battery life , lively colors , and deep blacks , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AMOLED display may cost you some extra money . The Samsung Galaxy S20 Series offer AMOLED screen . <h> Refresh Rate : 60Hz vs 90Hz vs 120 Hz <p> Measured in Hertz ( Hz ) , the refresh rate of a screen features how many times the content can refresh per second . A 60Hz display is able to refresh the screen about 60 times for each second , while a 90Hz screen can refresh 90 times per second . If the screen features a 120Hz refresh rate , the content gets 120 times to refresh per second . Therefore , a 120Hz display can refresh the screen two times faster than a 60Hz panel . To get better user-experience , try to buy smartphones with a higher refresh rate ( 90Hz or 120Hz ) . <h> Screen Protection <p> It would really hurt if your adorable Smartphone 's screen gets scratched or broken . To protect a phone-screen from getting damaged , the Corning Company produces ' Gorilla Glass ' featuring a scratch-resistant screen with greater durability . <p> Nowadays , the reputed brands are offering different versions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gorilla Glass 5 offers the toughest protection against scratches or damages than its ancestors . Xiaomi 's Note 9 Pro is protected by Gorilla Glass 5 . <h> Build Quality <p> The durability of a Smartphone mostly depends on its build quality . The metal built phones feature the longest durability . However , you can hardly find one of those today . The glass built Smartphone devices are great offering both solid construction and a great aesthetic . Polycarbonate construction is good if your budget is low to medium . However , try to avoid phones built with plastic material . <p> There are some other features to consider . Before buying , check out whether the chosen Smartphone is Flash-proof . The inclusion of a dedicated MicroSD card slot is another necessary aspect you need to verify . Furthermore , confirm the availability of 3.5mm audio jack , USB-type C port , Flashlight , Fingerprint sensor , etc . <h> Storage and Data Transfer <p> Today , the advanced phones come with 128GB memory ; while the most mid-range Smartphone models are offering 64GB internal memory . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lower memory like 32GB . <p> Moreover , make sure the phone has a good Data Transfer speed . The eMMC technology can send data in one direction ( either read or write ) at a time , with the utmost capacity of 2Gbps only ; whereas , the UFS 2.1 can deliver 5.9Gbps speed at the peak in one lane . So , try to find a Smartphone equipped with UFS 2.1 or 3.1 technologies instead of eMMC . You can find UFS 2.1 in Redmi Note 8 Pro Smartphone . <h> Performance <p> The RAM capacity controls how much speed you can get from the Smartphone . The higher the RAM power the greater the performance . To get swift performance while playing games , try to get 4GB RAM at least . In addition to this , the LPDDR4X RAM should be always preferred to get superior performance . <p> If you are planning to buy a Smartphone to play HD Games , do not forget checking out the Processor .

And , considering the budget you can opt for the best version of the chipset . <h> Camera <p> If you love taking pictures and shooting video , then look into the camera configuration of your Smartphone . The more powerful the lens quality is the high-resolution picture it can deliver . Standard camera series are expected to deliver images with good color-contrast , detailing , and correct edges . <p> For taking wide-angle captures at dynamic range , your phone must have an ultra-wide Sensor .

@@51830235 <h> OP-ED : What we need to know about the transmission of Covid-19 <p> Covid-19 is transmitted primarily through respiratory droplets and direct contact with infected persons , or indirect contact with surfaces laden with virus particles from infected persons . Under certain circumstances , Covid-19 can potentially spread through airborne transmission . <p> Droplet and contact transmission of Covid-19 occurs when an uninfected person is exposed to an infected person 's respiratory droplet through direct , indirect , and close contact . When a person with Covid-19 coughs , sneezes , talks , or shouts , respiratory droplets that include SARS-CoV-2 can reach the mouth , nose , or eyes of an exposed individual and cause infection . <p> Infectious respiratory droplets can also fall on nearby surfaces where the virus can remain viable for several hours to days . A susceptible person touching these contaminated surfaces and subsequently touching his or her face without washing hands can get infected . More recently , there have been concerns about airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 . <p> Airborne transmission occurs when microdroplets ( droplet nuclei usually &lt;5 micrometres in diameters ) containing infectious pathogens are expelled through coughing , sneezing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the air for a long distance and time . <p> If a healthy person shares the same airspace and inhales that contaminated air , he or she might get infected . Airborne transmission has been observed with other respiratory viruses , such as influenza , and there is now limited data available to suggest SARS-CoV-2 may also be transmitted by airborne routes . However , the risk of airborne transmission is mostly within confined spaces . <p> Transmission hotspots <p> It is increasingly important to understand how , when , and where the transmission is most likely to occur , to suggest prevention strategies . A person infected with SARS-CoV-2 , with or without symptoms , may transmit Covid-19 to others . A SARS-CoV-2 infected person can start transmitting the virus from one to three days prior to symptoms onset and up to a couple of weeks after the onset of symptoms . Bangladesh has one of the highest population densities in the world , which poses a unique challenge in the prevention of Covid-19 transmission within communities and hospitals . <p> The WHO-China joint report showed that around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which suggests the home can be a source of infection if appropriate infection prevention measures are not followed . The most likely pathway of household transmission could be poor ventilation ( less air exchange ) , close and prolonged contact , sharing food , sharing beds or rooms without any precaution , and a lack of handwashing . <p> Open plan office spaces can be hotspots for airborne transmission of Covid-19 , which has been observed in a call centre in South Korea , where 94 out of 131 people working in an open-plan office were infected . <p> Crowded living conditions in dormitories or barracks can also be hotspots for airborne transmission as observed in Singapore and possibly in Bangladesh . Hospital-acquired Covid-19 transmission among health care providers , patients , and family caregivers have been widely reported . <p> In Bangladesh , most hospitals , clinics , and even the doctor consultation rooms lack basic building designs that can provide sufficient air exchange , which can promote airborne transmission . Moreover , these facilities often have limited access to handwashing stations with running water and soaps further aiding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personal protective equipment ( PPE ) supply and use also contribute to health care-associated infection . In open spaces like playgrounds and streets , the risk of Covid-19 transmission , however , remains low . A high number of people congregated on the footpath are less likely to transmit the disease when compared with the same number of people in closed environments . However , if a person infected with SARS-CoV-2 coughs or sneezes directly on someone 's face , the risk of infection is high , even in open spaces . <p> Infection prevention and control measures <p> Rapid identification of Covid-19 cases , isolation of cases , and quarantining people who were in contact with the infected person are crucial in reducing transmission of the disease . However , in resource-poor settings like Bangladesh , with high background rates of community transmission , optimal testing , and contract tracing for Covid-19 might not be feasible . While we wait for a vaccine , the effective and appropriate universal use of face masks should be promoted . <p> There have been many controversies regarding the use of face masks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emerges , it is becoming clearer that the use of face masks will have to be the " new normal . " Due to the shortage of PPE and the increased risk of aerosolization of airborne particles within health care settings , the use of N95 respirators should be restricted to front line health care workers . <p> It is advisable for community members to adhere to the use of three-layered fabric masks . A fabric mask will not protect against microdroplets , but can filter up to 90% of larger respiratory droplets . However , use of face masks alone is not sufficient to prevent transmission of Covid-19 . Consistent and appropriate use of face masks in conjunction with practicing other proven control measures such as frequent handwashing , covering sneezes and coughs , maintaining physical distancing , and avoiding crowded spaces where possible will help keep the numbers of Covid-19 low , potentially avoiding intermittent lockdowns and helping the economy breathe as well . <p> Lastly , moving forward , public health professionals should work closely with experts from built-environment disciplines , to better design buildings , homes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and limit the transmission of not only SARS-CoV-2 , but potentially other respiratory viruses . <p> Md Saiful Islam , PhD , is Researcher ( Infection Prevention and Control ) , University of New South Wales , Sydney , Australia .

@@51915235 <h> Developers mad at giving up 30% of the Apple pie <p> Over the last year , companies have been getting more vocal about their disagreement with the sales cuts Apple takes from its app store . App developers like Epic Games and the digital music service Spotify have recently challenged Apple , the most valuable company in the world , for the company 's policy of taking a large cut of its app store sales . <p> The App Store is one of the most prominent centres for commerce . Last year , the platform led to half a trillion dollars in sales . And Apple still takes 30% of the sales on its platform from third-party developers . This cut has made way for tremendous growth for Apple in recent years . However , it has also caused some problems in the guise of antitrust scrutiny , dissatisfaction from app developers , and several lawsuits from consumers and business partners . These problems were further intensified when Epic Games recently sued both Apple and Google , accusing them of breaking antitrust laws and forcing app developers to pay 30% of the revenues generated . <p> Epic Games @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ game in the world right now . The game has recently been removed from both the Apple and Google Store in response to the developers ' encouraging direct payment through the app instead of the payment services of Apple and Google . This removed the payment processing fees that the app store owners could avail . After Apple had pulled Fortnite out of the App Store , Epic launched an in-game event inside Fortnite creating awareness among gamers and released an epic parody video titled " Nineteen Eighty-Fortnite " with the hashtag " #FreeFortnite " mocking Apple 's " 1984 " commercial for the Mac . <h> Do the Companies Really Need a Third of App Store Sales ? <p> Apple and Google together are worth more than $3 trillion and they provide software to support a majority of the world 's smartphones .

Unlike Apple , Google has much lower stakes in its Play Store as the store is a much smaller portion of its overall business . They have not impacted Epic Games the way Apple has . Android users can download apps from outside of the android app store . This leaves Epic with numerous ways to reach consumers with android devices . <h> How are Consumers Impacted ? <p> One side-effect of this 30% sales cut is the increasing cost for consumers . The developers have to pass the added cost to consumers in order to survive and support the app store policy . Spotify , for instance , increased its monthly subscription back in 2014 from $10 to $13 to accommodate Apple 's fee . Apple then took advantage of the situation by introducing its own music streaming service at $10 . Now , Spotify subscription in a website is a must however , they can not mention that in the Spotify iPhone app . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2019 and filed a huge class-action lawsuit that accused Apple of breaking antitrust laws while enforcing the commission and inflated app prices for iPhone users . <p> On August 7 , Facebook joined the talks and complained against Apple 's collecting of 30% of sales in live events where people and small businesses share seminars , talk about fitness and take cooking classes through the Facebook app . Facebook wanted to process the payments by themselves so that all of the generated revenues could go directly to the small businesses that generated the contents . However , Apple declined to do so . When asked about the problems and disagreements , Apple 's CEO Tim Cook defended the company in front of Congress mentioning a better situation prevailing for developers than the past , when 50-70% of the retail price used to go to the middlemen . <h> The Way Forward <p> Apple generates more sales through its App Store although Android is much more widely used as an operating system .

In the US , in the lawsuit of Thurman v City of Torrington , the police department was found liable for failing to protect a victim of domestic abuse and , following this , the right to police protection for DMV was established . This landmark judgment introduced the importance of criminalizing instances of DMV . <p> Unfortunately , the Domestic Violence Act , 2010 considers only women and children as victims of DMV as mentioned in Section 2 ( 18 ) and excludes men . Referring to only women and children as victims fuels the assumption that marriage is not an equal platform to begin with . <p> Within the purview of this Act , a woman can not file a suit of DMV against her husband after divorce . Often , women have suffered abuse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neighbouring India , in 2018 , the Supreme Court held up a decision by Rajasthan High Court from 2013 , stating that the term DMV can not be confined to marital relations alone . This decision enables a woman to file for DMV against her ex-husband even after the divorce . <p> The duty of law enforcement <p> A major portion of responsibility in this Act depends on police and law enforcement agencies who belong to the same society where people continue to be in denial of DMV . <p> The Act ensures a victim 's immediate rights to the required and necessary medical services , the services of enforcement officers , necessary legal services under the Legal Aid Act , 2000 , and to file complaints under any other law as mentioned in Section 4 . <p> It is the duty of a police officer responding to an incident of DMV to announce these rights . Hence , the police officers themselves need to be trained and there should not be any negligence on their part . <p> It is unfortunate that the Act does not mention anything about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> A protection order is provided after long scrutiny and hearing of both parties as mentioned in Section 14 . Once the court makes a prima facie determination of DMV , it may order a temporary protection order for the victim and , simultaneously , a show of cause notice for the respondent , requiring a reply within seven days as to why a permanent protection order should not be issued against him . <p> After allowing both parties to be heard , the court may issue a protection order for the victim that includes a restraining order against the respondent . The victim has to reside in the shared residence until a shelter home is managed . <p> In the current situation , this is not feasible as victims are trapped in the same household as their perpetrators and there is a dearth of available shelter homes . <p> The cases of Abdul Khaleque v The State , Kh Ehteshamuddin Ahmed Iqbal vs Bangladesh and others , State vs Munir Hussain Suruj and others show disturbing yet common scenario : Physical assaulting against the wife resulting in death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filed , the victim should be removed from the shared residence with the perpetrator . Otherwise , their lives will continue to be in danger . <p> No hope for rehabilitation ? <p> The Act only penalizes breach of the protection order and filing of false complaints with imprisonment . But the Act fails to provide counseling to the accused and provide a pathway towards rehabilitation so that such acts are not repeated in the future . <p> In 2017 , Kyrgyzstan adopted a new law , " Safeguarding and Protection Against Domestic Violence , " which , apart from improving protection measures for survivors and simplifying reporting procedures also introduces rehabilitation programs for perpetrators . <p> Bangladesh 's 2010 Act fails to raise awareness and apprehension at the national and international levels , which is most needed in the current scenario . <p> The way forward <p> To tackle the current escalation of DMV cases , law enforcement officers should be provided with training on how to offer the required aid to victims . <p> Hotlines and service providers need to be more responsive . It should be ensured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by effective response from the authorities . <p> Victims should not be made to share residence with perpetrators until a permanent protection order is issued . There should also be an adequate arrangement of shelter homes . <p> Most importantly , people should be notified of all the avenues comprising domestic violence so that victims remain vigilant and are aware of the avenues through which they may seek help . <p> Moreover , rehabilitation should be offered to perpetrators to reduce repetition . The 2010 Act should adopt certain amendments and criminalize domestic violence more clearly . <p> In Bangladesh , this crime , breeding on stereotypical gender roles and biases and an overall lack of awareness , is escalating during Covid-19 pandemic . <p> The Domestic Violence Act , 2010 is not adequate when it comes to tackling incidents of domestic violence , let alone in the current situaiton . <p> But through adopting certain changes and spreading awareness , we can hope to combat this long prevailing social disease as the world searches for a vaccine for the novel coronavirus . <p> Suriya Tarannum Susan is a student @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @

Although the Arabs have lost every time , the support of the Arabs for Palestine has been seen . But for geopolitical interests , many Arab countries are not on the side of the Palestinians today . The Arab states have become close allies of Israel in their fascination with politics , business and power . Palestine can only be hopeful that Fatah and Hamas top leaders Ismail Haniya and Mahmoud Abbas have agreed to hold elections in the next six months after lengthy negotiations , the first in 15 years . <p> A rare mixture of Islamist and socialist thought , Fatah was the voice of all the people of Palestine .

Truman said there was no Arab lobby inside the country that would help him to win the election . This is one of the reasons for the one-sided policy of the United States on the question of Israel . In its continuation , President Trump 's " Middle East Peace Plan " has affirmed Israel 's priorities in every layer .

Palestine has described the move by Arab states as " stabbing in the back . " <p> Iranian President Hassan Rouhani criticized Arab countries because of the Arab Emirates and Israel 's covenant . But Iran 's statement against the treaty and compassion for Palestinians are not given importance to the West Bank of Palestine . The residents of the territory has hesitance to strengthen relations with the country because religion ruled state Iran is isolated from other Arab countries and target of the US sanctions .

However , Turkey is also currently facing various foreign policy complications . Conflicts with Syrian Kurdish organizations , diplomatic troubles with Greece , conflicts with UN-backed Prime Minister Fayez Sarraj in Libya - all raise concerns about whether Turkey now has the capacity to support Palestine . <p> Saudi Arabia , meanwhile , feels the necessity to be trusted by the United States and the West to keep its economy afloat . Also , the growing " axis-power " of Iran and its allies in the Middle East has raised concerns in recent times between Saudi Arabia and its allies .

Thus it is easy to understand that when the Palestinians lose their Arab allies , Trump declares Jerusalem as the capital of Israel , the Palestinians are stripped of their land in the name of the ' Deal of the Century ' , Israeli illegal settlements in the West Bank are legalized , it 's hard to find any effective ally in their struggle . <p> So , now it is urgent to forget the long-standing enmity between Hamas and Fatah , the two main pro-independence parties in Palestine .

Although the Arabs have lost every time , the support of the Arabs for Palestine has been seen . But for geopolitical interests , many Arab countries are not on the side of the Palestinians today . The Arab states have become close allies of Israel in their fascination with politics , business and power . Palestine can only be hopeful that Fatah and Hamas top leaders Ismail Haniya and Mahmoud Abbas have agreed to hold elections in the next six months after lengthy negotiations , the first in 15 years . A rare mixture of Islamist and socialist thought , Fatah was the voice of all the people of Palestine . But when Arafat agreed to negotiate with Israel , the anti-colonial image of Arafat began to crack in the minds of the Palestinian people . Meanwhile , Hamas , which was born in the first intifada , became popular with the Palestinians due to non-compromise during the second intifada in 2000 . Capitalizing on this popularity , Hamas defeated Yasser Arafats Fatah in the 2006 election @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ election was to compromise with Israel and sell out the Palestinian struggle .

In its continuation , President Trumps Middle East Peace Plan has affirmed Israels priorities in every layer . Besides , the Gulf state of Bahrain has normalized relations with Israel after the UAE announced the signing of a peace treaty with Israel at the behest of Trump . The Arab countries laid down three main conditions for establishing relations with Israel . These are the relinquishment of Arab countries lands occupied by Israel during the war , the formation and recognition of a Palestinian state , and the transfer of occupied Palestinian land . Even if none of those conditions are met , the Arab countries are building relations with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is confusion over what to say about the agreement between the UAE and Israel , despite Palestinian allegations .

But Irans statement against the treaty and compassion for Palestinians are not given importance to the West Bank of Palestine . The residents of the territory has hesitance to strengthen relations with the country because religion ruled state Iran is isolated from other Arab countries and target of the US sanctions . US pressure may arise on Palestine by strengthening relations with Iran . However there is an impact on the Gaza Valley due to Irans connection with Hamas and Islamic Jihad Movement parties .

Conflicts with Syrian Kurdish organizations , diplomatic troubles with Greece , conflicts with UN-backed Prime Minister Fayez Sarraj in Libya - all raise concerns about whether Turkey now has the capacity to support Palestine . Saudi Arabia , meanwhile , feels the necessity to be trusted by the United States and the West to keep its economy afloat . Also , the growing axis-power of Iran and its allies in the Middle East has raised concerns in recent times between Saudi Arabia and its allies . And so there is no possibility of getting Saudi Arabia on the side of Palestine . On the other hand , Qatar has always maintained talks with Israel on Palestine and sent a large amount of financial assistance to Gaza . As a result , many Palestinians are optimistic about Qatar in future mediation with Israel . However , these hopes are still unfulfilled . Palestine hopes Russia will come forward for the Palestinians . But in the Syrian sky , as Russia and Israel have a military roaming , they are interested in maintaining a friendly relationship through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the Palestinians lose their Arab allies , Trump declares Jerusalem as the capital of Israel , the Palestinians are stripped of their land in the name of the Deal of the Century , Israeli illegal settlements in the West Bank are legalized , its hard to find any effective ally in their struggle . So , now it is urgent to forget the long-standing enmity between Hamas and Fatah , the two main pro-independence parties in Palestine . But the rift between Fatah and Hamas is not just a conflict , it is an ideological one . Fatah has carried on secular-nationalist goal of a two-state agreement with Israel but Hamas has desperation of Islamist rhetoric of armed struggle until complete victory . Though there is a long history of bad blood and actual bloodshed between them , the only thing the two sides agree on is that they are all Palestinians . Otherwise , it is also a danger of fearing to become more isolated by reducing their influence .

@@52048232 <h> Proposed Bangladesh Land Act and land rights of the indigenous people <p> The proposed ' Bangladesh Land Act 2020 ' has stirred a good many quarters of thinkers . However , what has not come to much focus is the issue of land rights of the indigenous people . For generations , the indigenous people are fighting for their ancestors ' lands which have been systematically taken away either for settling outsiders or for realising various government projects . It is high time their rights be recognised and implemented in and through domestic laws . <p> Article 6(2) of the Bangladesh Constitution provides that , ' The people of Bangladesh shall be known as Bangalees as a nation and the citizens of Bangladesh shall be known as Bangladeshis ' . This provision masks indigenous people 's identities with a majoritarian identity : both in terms of nationality and citizenship . Article 23A , articulates that ' it should be the policy of the state to take step to protect and develop unique local culture and tradition of the tribes , minor races , ethnic sects and communities . ' However , without preserving the economic , political , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protect the cultural rights of the indigenous people . <p> The proposed Land Act in Section 112 ( 5 ) provides that no land owned by indigenous community should be taken over unless for the development and protection of them and their environment . On the other hand , Section 111 deals with the regular provision of acquisition in case of public interest subject to the approval of the District Commissioner . If any party feels aggrieved by such decision , ( s ) he has to file objection against such application to the district commissioner under section 118 . An authority who is supposed to give the permission for acquisition , is assigned to adjudicate upon complaint on the same issue . It strikes at the very root of the basic principles of natural justice . <p> The lifestyle of the indigenous people is unique ; because they tend to have a very close connection with and because they depend on their surrounding nature , lands , forests and swamps for their living . Though Section 112(5) gives protection to the lands recorded in their names ( apparently their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does not guarantee protection from changes in surrounding areas ' forests , and lands by privatisation , commercialisation and other projects . But the obligation not to dismantle or bring any structural changes in these areas is well recognised under international law such as ILO Convention No. 107 , United Nation 's Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous People etc . If such areas be selected for acquisition under section 111 , their life , culture , habitat and livelihood will be subjected to serious threat . And if so happens , for the impropriety of section 118 , they will remain incompetent to get any remedy . In this regard , we can not conclude that if the proposed land act comes into force , the section 112 ( 5 ) shall be enough to safeguard the interest of the indigenous community . The root of the problem lies in the lack of inclusivity of the indigenous community in proper legal and administrative forums . It is evident from numerous case studies that though there are provisions for compensation and settling issues regarding land acquisition of indigenous communities , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tracts Treaty of 1997 , no khas land or tenancy of hill tracts can be subjected to disposal , transfer or lease without the prior permission of the regional district councils . However , the reality is that the regional district councils representing the indigenous communities have not yet been entrusted with the responsibility of land administration , general administration , law and order , and local policing according to the CHT Accord of 1997 . All these functions are regulated by and under the authority of the local district Commissioner . Fewer provisions of the Peace Treaty have been implemented till date . In this context , if the proposed Land Act comes into force consigning all powers to the District Commissioner and the Settlement Officer , the council 's provision would become meaningless . <p> In this backdrop , a comprehensive legislation on protecting the rights of the indigenous people needs to be enacted .

They walked past the Martyr 's Square , the central bank and the parliament building before gathering near the country 's crumbling port . Then there was silence , and then candles were lit near ground zero -- site of the recent Beirut explosion . This is how the people of Lebanon marked the first anniversary of their protests against the misadventures of the country 's ruling political elites . <p> But what has really changed over this one year ? Economically the country has plunged into one of its lowest points since the 15 year civil war that ended in 1990 . Inflation has peaked to a staggering 120.03 percent ( as of August 2020 , Trending Economic ) putting the already struggling Lebanese Pound under increasing pressure . Food inflation -- as reported by CNBC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rate crossed the 30 percent mark in May , 2020 , according to the same report . The country 's gross public debt soared to USD 93.40 billion in the first six months of 2020 , as per data released by its finance ministry . It is an increase of 8.94 percent compared to the first half of 2019 . <p> Life overall has suffered . Power outages due to fuel shortage -- in certain areas up to even 20 hours per day -- have forced hospitals to limit their operations , that too at the height of a global pandemic . " Clouds are gathering and we might be heading into a storm ... If we do , what is the current capacity of our hospitals considering recent events ? Will we be forced into another lockdown ? Can we still change course and avoid a surge ? We can , but it will not be easy , " suggested Firass Abiad , director general of the Rafic Hariri University Hospital , while voicing his concern over the situation on Twitter . <p> People are unable to buy food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imports which have been affected by the country 's rising external debt , which stood at USD 34,798.7 million in June 2020 , a 7.82 percent increase from June 2019 ( data from Trending Economics ) -- have been forced to grow their own produce . Many have lost their savings , thanks to the country 's economic meltdown . For the majority of the population the future looks bleak . And amidst all these happened the Beirut port blast , pushing the economy and the nation closer to the brink , deeper and more desperate than the woes that had triggered the protests last year . <p> Politically , however , not much has changed it seems . After a year-long sabbatical the prodigal son is back again at the centre stage of Lebanese politics . Saad Hariri has been entrusted with the responsibility of forming the next government of Lebanon after he received 65 parliamentary votes out of 118 on October 22 . <p> Prior to his " election " , in a live interview with MTV television channel , the most prominent Sunni Muslim leader of Lebanon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " . " I will not close the door on the only hope left for Lebanon to stem this collapse , " he further added . <p> So , here we have the man who had had to bow down to the relentless demands of the protestors last year , back in full glory , trying to salvage the nation and the economy from the very crisis that spiralled out of control during his tenure . Not that Hariri alone is responsible for the plight of the Lebanese people , but it can not be denied that his government had a role in the failure in managing the economic affairs of the country before things reached the tipping point . <p> But the return of Hariri , while surprising is not an unexpected move , not at least for those who are familiar with the delicate structure that holds the fragile and fragmented political system of the country together . There are the Maronite Christians and there are the divided Muslims ; there are the Druze , the Armenians and there are a few secular groups . And all of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the interests of the republic . And in a diverse ethno-religious political landscape such a Lebanon 's , practicing secular Democracy perhaps translates to serving the interests of all these groups so that everyone can hold their peace . <p> In the context of the troublesome history of Lebanon , way back in 1943 a National Pact was agreed upon by the various political factions . It was an unwritten agreement that dictated the terms of a delicate balance among all parties : a parliament with a 51 percent Christian majority ; a Maronite Catholic as the president of the Republic ; a Sunni Muslim as its prime minister , a Shiite parliament speaker , a Druze chief of the general staff of the armed forces , and Greek Orthodox Christians as deputy speaker of the parliament and the deputy prime minister . Ever since the multi-confessional state of Lebanon has been led and exploited by these vested groups -- collectively , to the extent that this has become the ruling political elite : a group so powerful that even the unrelenting protests of the entire nation could not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have one head of state , it 's a group of men , they have agreed to divide the spoils of the state at every level . It 's a system that you can hardly topple , " told Carmen Geha -- associate professor in public administration and an activist -- the Associated Press , referring to the system of exploitation that has been created by this powerful group over decades . <p> When Saad Hariri resigned last year , some thought this might perhaps shake the foundation of the political mechanism that is sucking Lebanon out of its resources . But things did n't improve ; if anything things got worse . Because Hariri -- or his party -- alone was not the reason behind the economic collapse of Lebanon . It was the system . <p> And the system remains . But Hariri is promising to push through the reforms suggested by Lebanon 's former coloniser : France . Even if Hariri succeeds in forming a cabinet of independent technocrats to carry out the much needed reforms , he faces two major hurdles : Hariri lacks the support @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Movement headed by the president 's son-in-law Gebran Bassil . Second and the one fraught with more difficulties : navigating the complex maze that is the political landscape of Lebanon , satisfying all quarters , while taking measures that would be unpleasant to them all . Hariri is faced with the biggest challenge of his political career and the stakes are too high , and for everyone . <p> Betting on Hariri to be the saviour might be over-optimistic . He is just one man , that too a part of this group of establishment elites . And the establishment and their system are going to be around . And there remains the possibility of this collective , powerful group of puppeteers pulling the strings no matter who sits in the cabinet , no matter who the prime minister is .

REUTERS <h> Keith Raniere promised a path to happiness , seducing wealthy people who felt they lacked a higher purpose in life . His company , NXIVM , offered self-improvement workshops that became popular in Hollywood and business circles . <p> But beneath the surface , Raniere was a puppet master controlling a cultlike criminal enterprise , prosecutors revealed at his trial . Some women in NXIVM were sexually abused by Raniere and even branded with his initials in a secret ceremony . <p> On Tuesday , Raniere , 60 , was sentenced to 120 years in prison for sex trafficking and other crimes , effectively a life sentence . The judge also ordered him to pay a $1.75 million fine . <p> The sentencing capped a remarkable downfall for a man who was once idolised by his followers but has since been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money , sex and power . <p> Judge Nicholas G Garaufis of US District Court in Brooklyn , New York , determined the punishment after hearing hours of wrenching testimony from 15 victims , many of whom described how Raniere had left them traumatised and brainwashed from his pseudoscientific teachings . <p> Raniere 's lawyer , Marc Agnifilo , said he would appeal the sentence . " I salute the people who came in and spoke , " he said . <p> The first to speak was a woman identified only as Camila , who in a trembling voice recalled that Raniere started sexually abusing her when she was 15 and he was 45 . She had previously declined to cooperate with prosecutors on the advice of a lawyer who was recommended to her by Raniere 's counsel . <p> During their 12-year relationship , Camila said , Raniere expected her to be available for sex at all hours . He ordered her to weigh less than 100 pounds and directed her to get an abortion . She said she tried to kill herself once . <p> " I want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so many ways , " Camila said . <p> When he wanted to replace Camila , prosecutors have said , he directed his inner circle to find another " young virgin successor " for him . <p> Camila 's mother , brother and a sister also spoke Tuesday , telling the judge that Raniere destroyed their once close-knit family . The father and oldest daughter in the family -- who had a child with Raniere -- are still supporters of him . Raniere had a sexual relationship with all three sisters in the family . <p> In a speech before the court , Raniere , wearing blue prisoner clothes , maintained his innocence and said some of the victims were lying . He said he was " deeply sorry , " arguing that he did not mean to cause so much pain and anger . <p> " Where I am is caused by me , " Raniere said . " This is all my doing . " <p> As Raniere waffled between apologising and blaming the women , one of his victims and ex-girlfriends , Toni Natalie , buried her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statements , Raniere 's lawyer , Agnifilo , argued that his client never intended to hurt any women , saying he was in love with them and simply had trouble dealing with breakups . In a stunning moment , Garaufis interrupted Agnifilo in the middle of his speech , yelling , " No ! " <p> During a back-and-forth in which the two men shouted through face masks , Garaufis spoke forcefully about how intent did not matter when a 45-year-old man sexually abuses a child . <p> " It 's an insult to the intelligence of anyone who listens , " the judge said . <p> Agnifilo did seem to acknowledge tensions with his client , saying that he had refused to file a motion claiming evidence tampering by the government even though Raniere asked him to . In recent months , Raniere has spearheaded a campaign to overturn his conviction , directing his supporters to create a podcast about his case and set up a contest to find errors in his prosecution in exchange for a $25,000 cash prize . <p> Another victim , India Oxenberg , told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her mother , actress Catherine Oxenberg , whose efforts to extricate her daughter from the organisation were part of a recent HBO documentary series about NXIVM called " The Vow . " <p> India Oxenberg said Raniere expected her to wait naked for him , like a piece of meat . She became so thin under his manipulation that she stopped getting her period , she said . <p> " You are a sexual predator , and you raped me , " India Oxenberg said . " When you touched me , I recoiled . " <p> Former NXIVM ( pronounced NEX-ee-um ) members said Raniere preyed on insecure people who hoped that immersing themselves in expensive self-help classes would unlock the key to fulfilment . Even highly educated people became trapped inside Raniere 's system , which he sold as the only way to overcome their fears , shaming anyone who tried to quit . <p> At Raniere 's trial , a primary focus was a secretive women-only group inside NXIVM . During a videotaped initiation ceremony , the women lay naked on a table , saying , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pen seared their skin without anaesthesia . <p> Some of those women testified that they thought they were joining a women 's mentorship group , only to discover that they were directed to have sex with Raniere . <p> The women , referred to as " slaves , " were regularly required to hand over collateral like sexually explicit videos , which they constantly feared would be released . Prosecutors called it extortion . <p> On Tuesday , a former " slave " identified only as Nicole told the judge that the collateral was the only thing stopping her from spitting in Raniere 's face during her time in the group , which she described as the most degrading experience of her life . <p> " I had never agreed to give up the right to my body , " she said . <p> A jury convicted Raniere in June 2019 after a six-week trial . Besides sex trafficking , the jury found him guilty of crimes that included racketeering and child pornography . <p> To this day , Raniere has many supporters who insist that every activity in NXIVM @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ court urging leniency . <p> His supporters flocked to Brooklyn on Tuesday , waiting hours in line to enter the courthouse . There was a tense atmosphere before the sentencing ; Raniere 's loyalists would approach victims or other lawyers involved in the case , who tried to dodge them . <p> NXIVM was funded in large part by an heiress to the Seagram 's liquor fortune , Clare Bronfman , who spent more than $100 million of her inheritance to sue Raniere 's enemies and support the organisation . <p> One of NXIVM 's top recruiters was Allison Mack , the former television actress known for her role on " Smallville , " whose glowing testimonials helped bring Hollywood celebrities into the organisation . The Dalai Lama once spoke at a NXIVM event . <p> Raniere was charged along with five women in his inner circle , including Bronfman and Mack . Each of them pleaded guilty ahead of his trial . <p> Bronfman was sentenced last month to more than six years in prison for her role in NXIVM . The others do not have sentencing dates yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with multiple women . NXIVM 's curriculum taught that women were to be monogamous , while men were to be polygamous . <p> He fathered children with two women , including Kristin Keeffe , who spoke at his sentencing and said he had never paid child support for their teenage son . <p> Keeffe said that even though she was hired as an employee in NXIVM 's legal affairs department , Raniere commanded sexual obedience from her . She and other victims said NXIVM 's leaders told them not to seek professional medical help because Raniere knew better than doctors . <p> Since Raniere created NXIVM in 1998 , around 18,000 people have taken its courses in the United States , Mexico and Canada . <p> The group 's sales pitch claimed that Raniere was a genius with one of the highest IQ scores in the world . In reality , prosecutors have said , he graduated with a 2.26 GPA from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy , New York . <p> Most NXIVM members never had a sexual relationship with Raniere , but they did face pressure to pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do so . One couple estimated they spent $300,000 on NXIVM courses and were forced to declare bankruptcy , prosecutors have said . <p> NXIVM defectors said it was not as easy as it seemed to leave the group . <p> Many participants took some workshops and moved on . But others had quit their careers and moved to the company 's headquarters near Albany , New York , where they were isolated and more susceptible to Raniere 's influence . <p> The ones who became NXIVM coaches depended on the organisation for income . Some were Mexican immigrants who needed NXIVM for their legal status in the United States . <p> And they had seen what happened to critics of NXIVM , who were targeted by private investigators and hit with endless lawsuits . Bronfman had even persuaded authorities to initiate criminal investigations against some of them . <p> When authorities finally arrested Raniere in 2018 , he was at a luxury villa near Puerto Vallarta , Mexico , hiding in a closet .

@@52266236 <h> Can these period underwear crusaders convert you ? <p> Sasha Markov , left , and Karla Welch , co-founders of The Period Company , in Los Angeles on Nov 18 , 2020 . The New York Times <h> The concept of " blood " and " bleeding " is generally avoided in mass marketing for period products . It was only recently , and with some fanfare , that commercials showed red liquid being absorbed , instead of blue . <p> But when it comes to period underwear -- an increasingly popular type of underwear made with extra-absorbent fabric -- it 's difficult to avoid . At least when talking to the founders of the Period Company , a brand that was introduced in October , touting period underwear that was more affordable and sustainable than other menstrual products . For them , bleeding is a kind of profound act . <p> " Something emotionally begins to happen when you bleed into your underwear and you do n't have tampons , you do n't have pads , you do n't have waste -- when you 're just allowed to really kind of be in your period , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ founded the company . <p> " Flowing is a very different experience , and we feel kind of evangelical about it . " <p> Markova , a longtime creative director , is not exaggerating about evangelising ; she refers to switching to their product as " conversion . " As in " We really converted ourselves to the idea of this underwear . " Or " The amazing thing you can begin to do with Gen Z is say : ' OK , now we 've got you . Hey , convert your older sisters and your mothers . ' " <p> There 's a spiritual element to this approach , landing somewhere between typically Californian and harmlessly cultish . But conversion really is essential to running the business . The Period Company and every other brand making alternative products ( such as the menstrual cup ) needs customers who are open-minded enough to break from the products they 've always used -- the products their mothers handed them long ago , " sighingly , with a lot of burden , " Markova said . <p> It is n't an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raised to dread leaks . ( For a time , fear of humiliation was a hallmark of period product commercials , along with the blue mystery liquid . ) And there is growing competition for those willing to convert . <p> Which is why it helps that the company was co-founded by Welch , a high-profile stylist whose clients include Tracee Ellis Ross , Olivia Wilde and Sarah Paulson . ( On Instagram Chelsea Handler and Busy Philipps were among the celebrities giving unpaid endorsements to the brand , wearing matching gifted sweatshirts that read : " Dear Mother Nature : Thank You ! " ) Welch has also designed a line of tees in collaboration with Hanes , initially inspired by her client Justin Bieber , as well as jeans with Levi 's . <p> Four years ago , when her child 's first period arrived , Welch found herself in a " hot mess , " struggling to guide her now teen , who does n't identify as female , through the traditional options . <p> " Which made me go back to when I got my period @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about it , " she said . <p> Welch had also become increasingly determined to reduce her personal waste , including the plastic discarded every time she used an individually wrapped pad . <p> " I was like , ' There 's got to be something better , ' " she said . <p> REDEFINING CONVENIENCE <p> This kind of zeal is fairly common when it comes to alternative period products . The internet teems with articles and videos preaching the gospel of the cup , in particular -- even more so than period underwear -- and the destructive evils of disposable tampons . <p> In 2018 , this devotion led the Shelton Group , a marketing firm focused on sustainability , to conduct a survey about these products , collecting responses from more than 2,000 people with periods . <p> In the survey , nearly 60% of respondents said they have used or considered using reusable menstrual products . <p> " We were flabbergasted by that number , " said Susannah Enkema , the group 's vice president for research and insights . But it did n't come as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 34 , the age group most concerned with the environment . <p> " It 's the perfect product category for Gen Z and young millennials who absolutely , more than any other age cohort , feel a desire -- and to some degree an obligation -- to go greener , " said Suzanne Shelton , the chief executive of the firm . <p> At the same time , about 20% of respondents said they had decided against reusables . They were more likely to be in their late 30s and 40s , Enkema said , and resistant largely because they 'd already found what worked for them . <p> " The group that 's rejected these products is a group that does n't care as much about the environment , " Shelton said , pulling no punches with Gen X. " They care more about their personal convenience . " Conversely , the younger group had a different concept of convenience . <p> " I 'm in my early 50s , " she continued . " The idea of period panties or the idea of a Diva Cup seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What seems inconvenient is having to go buy products every month . " <p> The younger group also tends to talk more openly about periods , seeing menstruation as a women 's empowerment issue and promoting the idea that " ' this is not dirty , this is not gross , it 's not embarrassing , it 's not something to be whispered about , ' " Shelton said . The researchers also learned from this group , qualitatively , that it 's no longer acceptable to refer to period products as " feminine hygiene . " <p> Still , another 20% of respondents said they had never even heard of reusable products until the survey , Enkema said . <p> JOCKEY MEETS KOTEX <p> When Welch turned to period underwear for her child , it was a solution , but it was n't perfect . Most pairs ranged from about $25 to $40 , and she did n't want to pay $40 for juniors underwear . <p> The market 's two dominant brands are Thinx and Knix , both founded in 2013 . At one point , Thinx @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States .

Another competitor , TomboyX , specializes in gender-neutral underwear , while Ruby Love ( formerly PantyProp ) was founded to help address urinary incontinence . <p> The founders of the Period Company said they 're fans of these brands , but , as Welch has repeated , she and Markova are more interested in being like Jockey , offering basic no-frills underwear , than like La Perla . Their prices fall between $12 and $14 . Comparatively , a pack of disposable tampon or pads typically costs under $10 . <p> Their underwear fits tightly but with some stretch , not unlike shapewear , if shapewear had a pad sewn into the crotch between two thick layers of cotton ; converting to the underwear seems easiest for those who already rely on pads .

" We do n't want to be posh . We want to be accessible . " <p> There 's also nothing particularly sensual about the Period Company 's marketing , which uses a lot of text and even footage of the ( bloody ) cleaning process . Other companies tend to lean into innuendo or , like many fashionable underwear brands , emphasize an " all bodies are beautiful " approach with unretouched photos of diverse models . <p> But that 's the thing , Welch said . Despite her close industry ties , the Period Company does n't want to be a fashionable underwear brand . <p> " I honestly do n't think we live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We 're essential , as far as I 'm concerned .

@@52266239 <h> OP-ED : The Sundarbans : Not a tragedy of the ' commons ' <p> Profit-making ventures are destroying the organic relationship between the people and the Sundarbans <p> The Sundarbans of Bangladesh were inscribed in the list of UNESCO World Heritage sites on December 7 , 1997 , on the premise of the possibility of its irreversible loss and the importance of the forest 's unique ecosystem . One may ask : Why does such degradation of natural resources happen ? In The Tragedy of the Commons ( 1968 ) , Garrett Hardin claimed that human beings , with their biological urge and greed , will destroy communities and the environment -- natural resources -- for some extra benefit unless restrained by an authority . <p> Hardin 's claim resonates with the UNESCO World Heritage Centre 's recent consideration of the proposal to label Sundarbans -- the largest mangrove forest on earth -- as " World Heritage in Danger . " Even though , during the 43rd session in 2019 , the Word Heritage Committee decided not to keep the Sundarbans on that list , there is an ongoing debate about the diversified uses of the forest sites @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tragedy of the ' commons ' <p> The question that appears before us : " To what factors can we relate the tragedy of the Sundarbans ? " In answering this question , I will illustrate how the menace that is looming over this world heritage site does not originate from the uses of it as " commons " by the people living in close vicinity , who heavily depend on it for natural resources . Rather , the threats against the Sundarbans are posed by capital investments and profit-seeking undertakings by absentee investors who receive support from a " development " -oriented government . <p> In 2019 , three organizations received permission to set up Liquefied Petroleum Gas ( LPG ) bottling factories within the Ecologically Critical Area ( ECA ) of the Sundarbans . Besides , the government allowed five cement factories to operate within the ECA of the Sundarbans . In 2018 , the Department of Environment published a list of 190 factories that are built within the 10-kilometre buffer zone of the Sundarbans . <p> The more worrying aspect is that these factories are likely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refineries , ship breaking and building yards , salt and cement factories , LPG bottling , brick fields , etc will severely damage the ecology of the mangrove . Meanwhile , construction of the 1,320-megawatt coal-fired Rampal Power Plant near the Sundarbans generated concerns over the possibilities of its total extinction . <p> A development-oriented government expects that industrialization will create more employment opportunities and reduce the local population 's dependence on the forest resources . This approach towards achieving sustainability of any natural resource site , eg , the Sundarbans , is similar to Garrett Hardin 's claims about the tragedy of the commons . <p> Many critical comments can be made about the expected inclusion of locals in these industries . As very few are directly benefited , many people are forced to forgo customary practices of forest resource use , risking the wellbeing of the Sundarbans . <p> In contrast to the centralized governance model , Elinor Ostrom , in Governing the Commons : The Evolution of Institutions for Collective Action ( 1990 ) , proved that local communities can use commons sustainably over the long term @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practices . Rather , I want to emphasize on the social significance of " places " such as the Sundarbans . <p> The Sundarbans as a site of socialities <p> In Indian Cultures as Heritage : Contemporary Pasts ( 2018 ) , Romila Thapar stated , heritages -- " objects , ideas , or practices " -- make our cultures and connect the past to the present . Therefore , a loss of the Sundarbans will incur the extinction of wide-ranging cultural practices beyond the eminent environmental crisis . The essence of my argument is this -- The Sundarbans is a site of human interactions which creates socialities . <p> Around 3.5 million people are directly or indirectly depending on the resources of the Sundarbans , including wood collectors , golpata ( nypa palm ) harvesters , honey collectors , and fisher folk . These forest-dependent people usually follow social conventions and over the years have developed an evolving " ethno-task-scape " centering the Sundarbans -- a reciprocally organic relationship between people and the forest . <p> The Sundarbans-dependent people follow some common rituals . Their beliefs and practices espouse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ religion . Local people regard Bonbibi as the guardian spirit of the Sundarbans . Both the Hindu and the Muslim residents of the Sundarbans venerate Her . Bonbibi is also termed as Bondevi and Bondurga . <p> Given that Bonbibi is a common deity of the Sundarbans-going people , whenever a group enters the forest , regardless of whether they belong to Hindu or Muslim communities , a visit to the shrine of Bonbibi is not an unusual sight -- it is a one of a kind inter-faith socio-ritual practice . <p> One of the features of Bonbibi worshiping is that it does not require a priest . Moreover , there are no fixed texts/hymns to be recited during the rituals . Above all , there is no auspicious time for performing the rituals . Forest-goers mostly perform rituals as per their convenience . The rituals involve offerings of wildflowers , creepers , weeds , and seeds , which are usually picked from the forest . The offerings mark the forest-dependent people 's commitment towards saving the forest . <p> While collecting resources , the forest users follow specific rules @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bawalis ( wood collectors ) usually leave one stem in each clump after cutting ( choose which have at least 4-5 stems ) and they collect wood from a compartment every alternate year . They do not cut young and straight trees but the trees that have limited possibility of growth . Similarly , Mauals ( honey collectors ) never put fire on the beehives , thus ensuring the safety of young bees . <p> Despite the fast depletion of the forest resources and the decreasing number of direct forest-dependent people , the essence of Bonbibi has not yet ebbed in the remote areas of Sundarbans . Yet today , the Sundarbans-dependent people try to pacify the Royal Bengal Tigers and keep them happy by offering roosters and pigeons . <p> There is an annual celebration of Bonbibi when the tales of Bonbibi are staged for the younger generation . This celebration in January ( Magh ) every year reaffirms the relation of Bonbibi with the people and the forest . The forest and associated beliefs and rituals -- heritages that the unique nexus of forest and people has generated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of years . <p> The dilemmas to overcome <p> Burgeoning industries in the Sundarbans zones calculate the material resources of the forest . Capitalist endeavours only become profitable if utilitarian motivations can destroy the social conventions . Thereby , the Sundarbans is under the capitalist seizure -- losing its social character and arguably , the spaces and social relations within are being used for capital accumulation . <p> Profit making ventures are altering the ways people have been relating to the Sundarbans and the repertoire of tangible and intangible cultural heritage . Therefore , it will be wrong to see the Sundarbans ' depleting resources and risks of existence as an outcome of the " tragedy of the commons . " <p> One may argue that increased industrialization benefits the people by creating job opportunities and thus reduces their forest dependency .
