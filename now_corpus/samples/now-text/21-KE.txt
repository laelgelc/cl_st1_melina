@@62542239 <h> China promised Africa coronavirus vaccines were a priority . But where are they ? <p> China 's Foreign Minister Wang Yi concludes his tour of Africa this weekend without making a single concrete vaccine commitment to a continent hoping a benevolent Beijing will help inoculate its population out of the global coronavirus pandemic . <p> Last year , as Covid-19 tore across the globe and wealthy countries began to pre-order stockpiles of vaccines for their citizens , Chinese President Xi Jinping pledged that African vaccinations were a " priority " for Beijing . <p> His commitment followed mass donations of masks , testing kits and medical equipment to the continent by Beijing and private individuals , such as billionaire entrepreneur Jack Ma . <p> Now , with negative sentiment towards China hardening in Western democracies due to trade wars and human rights issues , African allies -- which have crucial voting rights at major international bodies -- have arguably become an even more vital bloc for China to keep on side with its so-called vaccine diplomacy . <p> China has the resources to honor Xi 's pledge . Its Sinopharm vaccine has been approved for domestic use , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trials -- the last step of testing before regulatory approval is sought . <p> Unlike some other vaccines , it does n't require storage at an ultra-low temperature , making shipment easier in developing countries . <p> Millions of Chinese citizens have already been vaccinated at home and employees of state-owned enterprises in Africa were offered shots in trial phases as early as last June , enabling Chinese citizens to work safely on the continent . <p> None of China 's Phase 3 trials were conducted in sub-Saharan Africa , which would have given some countries advance access to a vaccine , despite such tests taking place in the Middle East and South America . <p> And while a cold chain vaccine air bridge from Shenzhen , in southern China , to Addis Ababa , in Ethiopia , has been established , and manufacturing capabilities are being set up to make Chinese shots in Cairo , Wang 's trip made it no clearer when Africans can expect to receive a Chinese vaccine -- or on what terms . <h> A power house and a continent in need <p> " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There has been no timetable , only promises , " said W. Gyude Moore , a senior policy fellow at the Center for Global Development and former Liberian minister of public works . <p> " Today , I am not aware of any African country that 's taking delivery of Chinese vaccines . " <p> The Chinese Ministry for Foreign Affairs did not reply to CNN 's requests for comment on Beijing 's plans to roll out vaccines in Africa , but state media has rejected claims that vaccines will be used as a " bargaining chip to expand political influence . " <p> Wang 's whistle-stop tour of Nigeria , the Democratic Republic of Congo , Botswana , Tanzania and the Seychelles continued a three-decade tradition of China 's top diplomat making his first international trip each year to Africa . <p> That tradition signals Africa 's diplomatic importance to China , with stops in places like the Seychelles , a sparsely populated archipelago , proving no nation is insignificant to Beijing , and serves to embarrass Western countries which typically neglect the continent but often view it as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protocol was established in 1991 , on a basis of mutual underdog brotherhood , but China has fundamentally changed since then . <p> So much so that Wang 's claims , in a video interview ahead of his trip , that China and Africa had a " shared identity of the developing world , " which had both suffered " weal and woe , " did n't tally with the two regions ' recent history -- and very different experiences of the pandemic . <p> In 2020 , as the world 's second-largest economy , China announced it ended abject poverty , successfully contained a virus that has floored the globe 's biggest superpower , the United States , and developed some of the first coronavirus vaccines . <p> Across Africa , countries did n't report the huge caseloads seen in India or the United States -- as of Thursday , the continent had reported fewer than 70,000 deaths , compared to the 150,000 in India and more than twice that in the US . <p> Many tumbled into recession and faced a mounting debt crisis , which saw Zambia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a decade . <p> About a quarter of Zambia 's $12 billion external debt was owed to China , which refused to provide debt relief . <p> Compounding the debt issue is another potentially worrying , and somewhat ironic , trend for African leaders : credit lines from China that once seemed almost free-flowing have been throttled in recent years , amid increasing criticism of reckless lending . <p> According to the China Africa Research Initiative , Chinese loans to Africa dropped from $29.4 billion in 2016 to $8.9 billion in 2018 . <p> Wang 's visit also came on the back of the sharpest racial tensions between Africa and China in decades , after alleged coronavirus-related discrimination against African nationals in the city of Guangzhou sparked widespread anger across the continent last April . <p> An extraordinary video was subsequently posted on Twitter of the Chinese ambassador to Nigeria being scolded by a Nigerian politician over the mistreatment of Africans . <p> Yet there was little chance of Wang being challenged on any of these points . In Nigeria , Wang held closed-door meetings and signed a vague @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DRC , he postponed the repayment of interest-free loans from China that matured at the end of 2020 , although it was not clear what the value of these were . <p> While in Tanzania , China and local officials launched a vaccine training college , in Botswana Wang committed to deepening bilateral ties , and in the Seychelles he discussed importing more fish from the nation devastated by a collapse in tourism . <p> Moore , the former Liberian minister , said African countries needed to exercise more agency in the procurement of vaccines , taking the charge on placing orders . <p> If countries are expecting the vaccines to be delivered for free , either directly from China or through the World Health Organization 's COVAX scheme to provide vaccines to those in the greatest need , which Beijing is a signatory to , they will have " no leverage " in bargaining over the delivery timetable , he said . <p> The COVAX scheme has only pledged to work to secure enough doses to protect 20% of Africa 's population in the initial phase , meaning nations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Russia 's Sputnik vaccine . <p> The director of African Centers for Disease Control ( CDC ) , John Nkengasong , predicts the continent will need 1.5 billion doses of vaccine to inoculate 60% of the population -- the level needed to achieve herd immunity . <p> Procuring the vaccines and establishing delivery systems could cost up to $10 billion , according to the Africa CDC . <h> A health silk and road <p> On a bright blue-sky day last December , senior African diplomats , Chinese construction workers and officials , wearing masks , gathered to celebrate breaking ground on a grand new building in the Ethiopian capital . <p> The headquarters of Africa CDC , an organization conceived in the wake of the 2014 Ebola crisis , will be at the heart of the continent 's healthcare planning in coming years -- and has been subject to intense political wrangling between the US and China . <p> Launched in 2017 , the organization originally received funding from the US , China , and the World Bank , among other donors , with Washington taking a leading role , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its early years . <p> But when China announced in 2018 that it would build the $80 million CDC headquarters in Addis Ababa , Washington was outraged . <p> " The Chinese want to build the CDC to eventually steal the data from all the other centers , " an unnamed Trump administration official told the Financial Times in February . <p> " If the Chinese build the headquarters , the US will have nothing to do with Africa CDC . " <p> Recent reports that the Chinese hacked and bugged the African Union building they also built in Addis Ababa give the US claims more credence . <p> The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs did not reply to CNN 's questions on the matter of spying on government buildings it has constructed in Africa . <p> The Chinese have forged ahead with the plan , effectively ousting major US influence on the body , and signaling how important it is to Beijing to be front and center of what it calls the Health Silk Road -- essentially , the export of its medical and scientific expertise globally . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , medical equipment to the Middle East , and has conducted vaccine trials in South America , giving countries such as Brazil early doses of those resources . <p> Priority access to vaccines has also been promised to countries in Southeast Asia , which it has ties with along its Belt and Road project . Early in the crisis , China sent 148 medical workers to 11 African countries , according to state media . <p> In October , 50 African diplomats visited a Sinopharm vaccine factory and were told by the company 's chairman that " after the Covid-19 vaccine is developed and put into use , it will take the lead in benefiting African countries . " <h> A friend indeed <p> African nations are not totally without leverage when it comes to their relationships with Beijing . <p> While the pandemic has raged , so has China 's long-running trade war with the US -- as well as a new one with Australia . <p> It has also gotten into diplomatic disputes with the United Kingdom and Canada , which have condemned Beijing 's violation of democratic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ countries increasingly important diplomatic allies who can be expected to vote in China 's favor at international forums , and help Chinese candidates get elected at United Nations bodies . <p> When the UN Food and Agriculture Organization Director-General was elected in 2019 , for example , it was votes from Africa and South America , where China is also heavily invested , that helped a Chinese candidate win the seat for the first time . <p> " For international legitimacy , support is key in this region . With Africa , you have 54 votes in any international forum . That 's a huge bloc , " says Moore . <p> African countries typically negotiate with China as individual units , presenting a David and Goliath dynamic . <p> This year , however , African heads of state are scheduled to meet with Beijing 's top brass in Senegal at the triennial Forum on China-Africa Cooperation ( FOCAC ) , usually attended by the Chinese President . <p> Should the event go ahead in person , there could be an opportunity for countries to come together to press Beijing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the continent . <p> A date for the event has not yet been set . <p> Over the past two decades , this forum has traditionally been a showcase for headline pledges of Chinese investment in the continent , going from $5 billion in 2006 to $60 billion in 2015 and 2018 . <p> This year is likely to be the first in which Beijing will announce a smaller investment than at the previous FOCAC . In the absence of that monetary commitment , vaccines are likely to be the most pressing issue . <p> " African countries are so desperately in need of a vaccine , not because of the health implications , but because of the economic implications , " said Moore . " We 'll soon be living in a two-tier world , where Western countries will be opening the door after vaccinating their populations and developing countries , especially in Africa , will lack access to the rest of the world . " <p> Yet there is incentive for China to help African countries , says Yanzhoung Huang , a senior fellow for global health at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to improve China 's image . Secondly , they want to expand China 's market share of the Chinese vaccines . Third , they want to use vaccines as a strategic tool , especially in countries where China has strategic interest . " <p> Tellingly , Wang chose to wrap up his tour in the Seychelles , which this weekend will be one of the first African nations to begin inoculating its population . <p> The country has received a donation of 50,000 doses of the Chinese Sinopharm vaccine -- but not from China . <p> Instead , they were donated by the United Arab Emirates , which has commercial interests in the Seychelles , and procured the vaccines by conducting clinical trials for the Chinese pharma giant . <p> While it is natural that China would want to vaccinate its most vulnerable before supplying other nations with resources , African leaders must be wondering what Xi means when he says African inoculations are a " priority . " <p> According to analysis by the Economist Intelligence Unit , coronavirus vaccines are unlikely to be available in most of sub-Saharan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If the vaccines are n't forthcoming , it will be hard for China to continue peddling the narrative that it shares " weal and woe " with its African brothers when those on the continent remain exposed to the virus , and thus trapped within their own borders , as millions in China attempt to put the pandemic in the past .

@@62550237 <p> Legal questions continue to arise as the County Assembly of Nairobi prepares to vet Deputy Governor nominee Anne Mwenda Kananu in two days . <p> According to Lawyer Danstan Omari , Kananu 's nomination by law can be considered a nullity after Mike Sonko was impeached as Nairobi Governor on December 17 , 2020 . <p> " Sonko was impeached last month and at that time by law any nomination that had not been sworn in by operation of the law Kananu became nullity , " he said on Tuesday . <p> In his view , Omari highlighted that the Jubilee Party is divided on its position of Nairobi Politics resulting in many court cases . <p> " The reality is that two factions of Jubilee are fighting for Nairobi and one seems to be a threat while the other one is putting in efforts to ensure that there are no by-elections in Nairobi , " he noted . <p> On Sunday , Deputy President William Ruto warned the county assembly against vetting Kananu on Friday . <p> He said that would forestall a democratic by-election to fill the governor 's slot , as provided by law . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ governor using the court and that Nairobi residents have a right to elect their own governor . <p> " We want to tell those who are roaming in court , we want to tell them that even if they choose their governor in court , the people of Nairobi can choose their own in a by-election , " Ruto said . <p> Despite being against the scheduled vetting , Omari questions which law Kananu will use to become the governor if she sails through the vetting process . <p> He argued the constitution only allows a substantive Deputy Governor to occupy the office of the Governor . <p> " The legal question is , if Kananu occupies the position of the DG how does she hover to be a substantive Governor yet she is being vetted to be a DG , " Omari added . <p> Article 182 of the Constitution highlights ; if a vacancy occurs in the office of county governor and that of deputy county governor , or if the deputy county governor is unable to act , the speaker of the county assembly shall act as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the circumstances contemplated by clause ( 4 ) , an election to the office of county governor shall be held within sixty days after the speaker assumes the office of county governor , " it further reads . <p> Supporting his sentiments , former Nairobi Deputy Governor Jonathan Mueke questioned what law the DG nominee will use to ascend to governor since the office is already occupied by an acting governor . <p> " Under which law is the county assembly of Nairobi using to vet someone for deputy governor ? Even if Anne Kananu is vetted and becomes DG ; how will she ascend to Governor since the office is already occupied ? He questioned . <p> County Assembly Speaker Benson Mutura was sworn in as Acting Governor on December 21 , 2020 , after Sonko 's ouster . <p> Poking holes , Mueke also raised concerns that the law does not highlight that an Acting Governor can hand over to a Deputy Governor who has been vetted by the county assembly . <p> " The law only states the DG can ascend into the Governor 's position only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sitting Deputy Governor . This is not the case for Nairobi as by the time Sonko was impeached he did n't have a deputy , " he added . <p> However , Omari said the courts are likely to stop the vetting as many legal questions are surrounding the process . <p> The Assembly Appointment committee on Monday said it will proceed with the vetting as there was no law hindering it from doing so .

Please take us through your career journey . <p> Growing up , I was always fascinated by the hospitality industry , and I remember telling my folks that one day I want to work in big hotels like Serena and Sarova . <p> My folks have always encouraged us to do what we are passionate about as long as we excel in it . That is how I ended up with a BSc . Hotel Management from United States International University . <p> At USIU , I graduated top of my class with Magna Cum Laude honors . I then got an internship opportunity in the U.S. through the American Hospitality Academy and worked with the Hilton Hotels before I transitioned to the Marriott Hotels for about 5 years . <p> As I worked , I also studied for my MSc . Operations Management at the Friends University , KS . When I came back to Kenya from the U.S. in February 2008 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hotel industry was in the doldrums due to travel advisories . <p> I was faced with my first career crossroads because the hospitality industry was not hiring . Matter of fact was that a lot of hotels were closed ! <p> One day in July of 2008 , as I was flipping through the newspaper , I saw a full-page advert by KCB Bank for Management Trainees . <p> I paused and read it over a couple of times and then asked myself ; what would I lose by applying ? So , I took a risk , repackaged myself and how my skill set would add value and applied for a management trainee at KCB Bank . <p> In my 7 years at the Bank , I worked as a Brand Marketing Manager in the Marketing Division , Customer Service Manager at the largest branch in the Retail Banking Division and Retail Service Experience Manager overseeing over 200 branches in the Customer Experience Division . <p> My learning curve was quite steep in the first 2 years at the bank but I was determined to go the extra mile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was also deliberate to transition to a new role every 2 years . <p> As 2014 drew to a close , I started mulling over the idea of exploring my options the following year to transition to a different sector . I signed up for the Program for Management Development at the Strathmore Business School to expand my leadership skills and grow my networks . <p> My parents having been career civil servants , I was open to Public Service . That is how I ended up at my current job as Head of Corporate Communication and Customer Experience at the Higher Education Loans Board from October 2015 . <p> When I joined HELB , I was tasked with setting up a new department , introducing and operationalizing a modern contact centre , and consolidating service delivery between our staff at HELB desks at the Huduma Centres and Head Office and run media and marketing campaigns to drive loan uptake and loan repayment . <p> I now lead a team of over 75 staff and have championed citizen service delivery with various awards as a testament to the transformation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for improvement , I am immensely proud of the progress we have achieved in improving service delivery at HELB . <p> This is in line with our promise of empowering dreams of Kenyan youth who without HELB , would not have an opportunity to pursue higher education with the dignity they deserve . <p> What are some key lessons you 've learnt in your career journey that have remained relevant and applicable to date ? <p> One of my favourite quotes is by Bill Gates : " Most people overestimate what they can achieve in a year and underestimate what they can achieve in ten years . " There is a tendency to focus on New Year goals that are typically unachievable . <p> In 2008 , I chose to work with 5-year plans for my career where I would challenge myself to learn a whole new skill set and possibly even in a different sector , where possible , and seek relevant certification in addition to on-the-job experience . <p> My key lessons therefore are : <p> Your career is your responsibility , do not look to your boss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a recipe for frustration and epic disappointment .

It will challenge you and keep work exciting . <p> In 2013 , my former boss Micheu Njiru ( the current Director of Customer Experience at KCB Bank ) introduced me to Top of Mind Awareness TOMA . A simple but powerful reminder that whatever projects you run , whatever initiatives you introduce or operationalize , there must be at least one 1 or two 2 every single year that must be significant and impactful to the point that it gives you TOMA and is worth including in your career profile . I still subscribe to that to-date . <p> Deliberately work on identifying and cultivating your relevant transferrable skills . This will help transition in the event of depression in a specific sector @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ growth trajectories . I now have solid Brand Marketing skills , PR &amp; Communication skills in addition to my Customer Experience foundational skills .

When I told my dad that I would be joining public service , he sat me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a senior civil servant . <p> He reminded me not to be greedy , to always be grateful for what I got remunerated and serve with integrity as this would give me peace of mind even when temptations or false accusations came my way . <p> Tenacity is defined as ' persistent determination .

@@62690239 <h> Review tax administration to address reconciliation issues <h> Summary <p> The main objective of the iTax was to create a sustainable tax system that could generate adequate revenues to finance public expenditure . <p> The system was also supposed to help eliminate direct contact between taxpayers and revenue authority staffs in a bid to reduce corruption loopholes . <p> In 2014 the Kenya Revenue Authority ( KRA ) rolled out the iTax system . The main objective of the iTax was to create a sustainable tax system that could generate adequate revenues to finance public expenditure and also address issues of inequality , improve on tax administration , increase productivity and reduce economic distortions created by taxes by enabling taxpayers to register , file and undertake remittance online . <p> The system was also supposed to help eliminate direct contact between taxpayers and revenue authority staffs in a bid to reduce corruption loopholes . Additionally , the rollout of the iTax was meant to ensure timely update of taxpayers payment details in driving better tax report period and consistent to factors that shape the strategy implementation for future tax system . <p> Section 37 of the Income Tax @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deduct , remit and account for Pay As You Earn ( PAYE ) and at the end of the calendar year , employees and corporations are given six months ( Jan-June ) to file returns rrelating to tax paid in the preceding year . Section 38 of the same act provides that the provisions relating to deduction of tax shall be binding to the government . <p> It is worth noting that the rollout of the iTax system has helped taxpayers to make payments for their taxes , file tax returns online and more importantly it has ensured better utilisation of Persona Identification Number ( PIN ) assigned to each taxpayer which has increased tax compliance and consolidate payment of all taxes and levies . <p> The KRA has enlisted a number of commercial banks as tax collection agents . The bank accounts are linked to iTax system such that a taxpayer registered on the system when paying and declaring the same , the iTax accounts get reconciled automatically . However , this is not the case for national and county government entities . These institutions pay their taxes through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regulator is not an agent of KRA in relation to tax collection and the bank account that receives taxes is , therefore , not linked to the iTax . As a result , tax returns filed by the national and county government entities on iTax get automatic default notices . <p> The problem encountered by the taxpayers as a result of the default is extreme enforcement adopted by KRA especially when requesting for tax compliancecertificate . Such incidencts do little to endanger trust and cooperation between KRA and many government institutions are in " default " as far as 2015 . <p> As a result , manual reconciliations are done , against the aim of iTax system . Seven years since the launch of the iTax system reconciliations have been done up to 2015 . The problem is made worse by frequent transfers of KRA officers dealing with those reconciliations . Since government institutions are collection agents of KRA in relation to Value Added Tax and Withholding Tax , the amount withheld is sent to CBK and the filing of VAT returns equally gives default notices . <p> These anomalies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since they can not automatically get tax compliance certificate from the system . This provides an opportunity for them to walk into KRA offices , which increases probability of rent seeking yet the system was to reduce such kinds of interaction . There is a strong believe that iTax system was aimed at reducing human interaction to save time , resources and get rid of opportunity for rent seeking . Indeed , if there is an office in public service that compels government institutions not to pay their taxes through commercial banks , it should be alive to the fact those accounts belong to KRA and not the banks . The iTax system provides undisputable audit trails for all transactions . <p> While we are cognisant to the fact the National Treasury maintains single account in line with Public Finance Management Act , this should not be used to stifle the efficiency and effectiveness of the operationalisation of the iTax system in the national and county government entities . <p> It is ironical that the same government that is enforcing the implementation of the iTax is not enjoying the benefits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accounting . In addition , the iTax being a system relied upon to give key statistics of various taxes , interests and penalties , might be giving wrong information due to accounts that have not been reconciled . <p> There is , therefore , an urgent need for the National Treasury , KRA and accounting officers to agree on how tax administration from the affected entities should be handled . The National Treasury should give a directive that taxes by the government institutions are remitted through KRA collection accounts for automatic reconciliations of the accounts or better synchronise the CBK collection account with the iTax . <p> KRA should also consider adopting risk-based approach to allow it to distinguish between compliant and non-compliant tax payers and so target its approach and resources more appropriately . <p> The authority should also engage extensively with the tax payers to advocate for change in the tax payment culture in addressing some of the sticky issues like those raised above .

He 's also the founding father of the Liquid Arts Entertainment theatre company where he often directs his own scripts , the latest being Tapeli which premiered on YouTube this past weekend . <p> Coming on the heels of another one of Tosh 's creation , The Closet , which he had the audacity , during the slight loosening of lockdown , to stage live at Ukumbi Mdogo of Kenya National Theatre ( KNT ) , Tapeli was also performed at the theatre . Only this time , the audience was small , made up of just the videographer Stanley Mulindo , his Nano Film House staff , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " We were all set to stage Tapeli here at KNT , but then the lockdown cancelled that . But since our fans had already bought tickets , we decided not to let them down . We 're giving all those who buy tickets the link to our pre-recorded show , " Tosh said on the day of the filming . <p> Tosh 's passion for theatre is exceptional , especially as many thespians have allowed the pandemic to shut down their performance processes altogether . He , like Brian Christopher Orina who also staged The Heart of Oblivion at KNT recently , chose to risk putting on his production in spite of the Covid restrictions . But that was before this so-called ' Third Wave ' hit the country and lockdown returned . Now he had fans awaiting his new show and his cast all set to perform . <p> Given the challenges Liquid Theatre faced , Tosh had no choice but to take his show online . It was n't easy . There were several technical hitches which ultimately got ironed out . But one thing I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( which I watched at a safe social distance as it was being filmed ) and Tapeli on YouTube was the immense difference between the two . First off , there 's the electricity and excitement of seeing theatre live versus seeing it on film . <p> Then there 's the fact , as other stage actors who 've turned into TV celebs have testified , there 's a big difference in the way one works . On stage , you can stretch out and move anywhere on or off stage . But on film one needs to be ever-mindful of the lens and what the camera is seeing . Great stage actors do n't necessarily become film stars overnight . There 's a lot they have to learn . <p> Some members of the Tapeli cast figured out the differences quickly and made Tosh 's premier performance of his new work a frolic as well as a fascinating expose about corruption . <p> Ironically , the star of the show was not the super-crook and tendertrepeur Tapeli ( Jesse Maundu ) or even his nemesis , the gallant public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Lilian Nyawira ) although all of them played critical roles in portraying Nairobi 's swampy fields of corruption and the difficult struggle to ' drain the swamp ' . <p> The star was the street-wise street boy Kym ( Dadson Gakenga ) who was hired to literally do Tapeli 's dirty work , like take the millions Tapeli had recently stolen and launder through the Mwananchi Bank , or at least try to . Kym is street-savvy to the point of being prepared to out-thieve Tapeli himself as he teams up with dirty cops and Tapeli 's secretary , Ruth . <p> Tapeli presents his cynical philosophy in the opening moments of the play : take all you can whenever you can , no matter who you hurt in the process . His greed , selfishness , and cunny style of colluding with fellow conmen is despicable . <p> But Tosh makes clear that Tapeli is not alone . He has cronies and ' enablers ' everywhere , from the police and politicians to the judges and corporate executives . They all know he 's a crook , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> But now , supposedly , things are going to change , a new supposedly incorruptible public prosecutor Mbeye has come to town . Committed to justice , transparency and accountability , Mbeye is out to get Tapeli . But will he succeed ? That 's an open question we are left with . <p> There 's a lot of finger pointing in Tapeli as good versus evil seems to be in a serious contest . The trick will be to figure out how the good guy will finally foil this cunning bad guy . <p> If you did n't see the show , hopefully Tosh will share it on a wider platform next time so the real-life tricksters and thieves portrayed in the play can see their lives ( and downfalls ) enacted on stage .

@@63079238 <h> Evolution of M-Pesa from a person-to-person platform to a sophisticated fintech <h> Wednesday June 30 2021 <p> In just about a decade and a half , M-Pesa has evolved massively . Today , it has a lot more capabilities and functionalities . This has seen it transform from a one person-to-person money transfer platform within the country into a sophisticated fintech platform . Presently , it supports electronic payments , airtime top up/transfers , mobile banking , digital lending , international remittances and fintechs , among other functions . <p> It has generated massive economic rents distributed through the platform . To date , on average Ksh7.5 billion or ( $75 million ) are transacted on the platform daily . <p> This growth has progressed through six evolutions . M-Pesa has significantly impacted retail electronic payments system , inclusive financial services , improved livelihoods , spurred innovative digital financial solutions , inspired changes to the monetary policy framework and supported an e-Government services platform . As the evolution continues , it is important to keep track . <p> It all started in 2007 . Beginning as a mobile money system , it influenced financial inclusion through a diversity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This platform and a savings culture that has evolved has contributed towards tackling poverty sustainably and enhanced market accessibility . In this first-evolution phase , many of the unbanked , who had been excluded from the formal financial system , could now save securely without enduring the cost of servicing an account , minimum balance requirements or a trip to the bank . With these micro-savings , they could accumulate savings and assets that would cushion them from negative shocks or accumulate capital for investment . M-Pesa heralded their entry into the formal financial system . <p> This led to the second evolution of M-Pesa , during which even more innovative solutions emerged , mostly based on partnership with financial institutions . This saw the emergence of a virtual banking system , allowing for a standalone savings account or one linked to a personal savings account . Alongside this was electronic retail payment for goods and services , through Lipa na M-pesa . <p> With the emerging partnership with financial institutions , the natural progression for the third evolution was unlocking short-term digital credit .

This was pushed further to the frontier by the virtual platform using savings and transactions data to generate credit scores that provided a basis for assessment , pricing and distributing of short-term credit . This in turn revolutionised lending and greatly boosted economic activity , particularly for small businesses . <p> Advertisement <p> In addition to evolving locally and impacting the economy , the fourth evolution of M-Pesa took it beyond borders , to support cross-border payments and international remittances . This immediately transformed the informal Hawala money transfer system to a formal and convenient remittance system in the phone . It also positively impacted the regulatory regime as demand for regulations grew to cope with these innovations and more intensive use of technology to monitor the money-transfer market , strengthening Anti-Money Laundering/ Combating the Financing of Terrorism ( AML/ CFT ) efforts . <p> Riding on the M-Pesa platform , uptake of fintech has increased , marking the fifth evolution of the platform .

The benefit of innovation transcends financial inclusion , leading to a better monetary policy environment . The evolution of the velocity of money seen in the mid to late 2000s depicts different regimes -- financial development and less cash changing hands . In addition , the rising money multiplier could imply that the Central Bank of Kenya ( CBK ) may have lost control of money supply process , but that was not the case , it reflected financial innovation in the market . Consequently , targeting broad money via reserve money as an intermediate target was inadequate and perhaps obsolete . This led to change in monetary policy framework in 2009 with CBK adopting Net Domestic Assets in place of Reserve Money . This allows a more forward-looking monetary policy that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an environment of policy clarity . <p> Going forward , the M-Pesa platform is likely to be more dynamic . It has created endogenous demand for a national strategy on financial inclusion , cutting across the financial sector . Several banks and Telcos have replicated the product and its platforms . The cut in costs of financial transactions has led to the emergence of an efficient , effective , and real time payments and settlement platform allowing financial inclusion . All it requires now to sustain this development is a complete physical infrastructure for connectivity and a strong regulatory and institutional capability to support and protect the market . <p> Prof Njuguna Ndung'u is Executive Director of African Economic Research Consortium and former Governor of Central Bank of Kenya

@@63233230 <p> When the Premier League campaign begins this weekend , managers will be quick to stress that the season is long and nothing is decided in the opening weeks . <p> Legendary Liverpool manager Bill Shankly famously said : " the league is a marathon not a sprint " , while at Manchester United Sir Alex Ferguson used to talk about title challenges beginning properly in February . <p> But as the game evolves , do those two views still hold true ? <p> The evidence suggests that at both ends of the table , a fast start is now more crucial to success than ever before . <p> Taking the lead at the top <p> Before the Premier League began 29 years ago , there was less correlation between taking an early lead in the title race and actually winning the top flight . <p> In the 99 years played before the Premier League 's formation , only 26 per cent of teams who led the table during September actually went on to win the title , and fewer than half of teams top in October would still be there at the end of the season . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ League era , 69 per cent of teams top in September have gone on to win the title , a figure which rises to 76 per cent for those top in October . <p> And what about Ferguson 's idea of waiting until the new year to really get into your title stride ? <p> Before 1992 a relatively low 64 per cent of sides top in December became champions , while that figure is 86 per cent in the Premier League . <p> In an era when a few defeats can be fatal to a club 's prospects of becoming champions , it has never been more important to get off to a fast start . <p> Another indicator of the importance of these early matches is that two-thirds of the time the eventual champions ' first 10 matches provide a better percentage of points gained than the other 28 games . <p> Can a fast start avoid a slow death ? <p> Promoted teams have struggled to survive in the Premier League , with 47 per cent relegated in their first season . <p> So it is little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opening day . In fact , they have won just three such fixtures out of 30 in the past decade , losing 20 . <p> But getting early-season points is just as vital lower down the table as it is at the top and rebounding from an early setback quickly marks out those that survive . <p> Over the past 20 seasons there has been a reasonably clear threshold that promoted teams have to reach to be confident of survival - 11 points from the first 10 matches . <p> Below we see the number of points earned by promoted teams during their first 10 matches in the Premier League , the number of teams surviving and being relegated with those points , and the survival rate : <p> Overall , 11 or more points to start your campaign gives an 89 per cent chance of staying up , but get less than 11 and the survival rate drops to 31 per cent . <p> But are the opening games more important than the final ones ? Does the closing of the transfer window allow teams to regroup ? Crystal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ avoid the drop , winning 18 and 22 points respectively from their final 10 games , but these superhuman efforts are rare . <p> When comparing the opening and closing 10 games of the season for promoted teams , being better in the first 10 gives a 71 per cent chance of survival , while being better in the final 10 ( Palace and Leicester aside ) gives a 58 per cent chance . <p> And what of the magical 11 points from 10 games ? Twenty five clubs have managed this in their first 10 games and survived , while only 15 have managed this in their final 10 and stayed up . <p> A poor start can lead to a long , disappointing season . So whether you hope to challenge at the top or scrape survival at the bottom , it is wise to carefully analyse those opening fixtures and make the most of them .

The killing was definite though , as just the latest of many dozens of residents shot by invading , armed herders in western Laikipia . <p> As a farmer , he and almost all his neighbours have been targets for the herders . Three days earlier , James Lokwang was shot in the hip : he is still in hospital . They came last Thursday to Mary Njoroge 's house , shooting at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cattle grazing near the high school in Ndindika . <p> But the residents of western Laikipia are without aid , and unprotected . Yet things are set to get a lot worse for them . For when Cabinet Secretary Fred Mataing'i issued an ultimatum to illegal herders to leave Laikipia , security forces were sent only to northern Laikipia , so now thousands more cattle have been driven illegally into western Laikipia instead . <p> In fact , there are millions of dollars being raised to rehabilitate pastures there , damaged by climate change and 147 invasive alien species . But instead , this week , that pasture is being eaten to desertification , as the few hundred illegal herders there the last four months are now multiplied tenfold . <p> And it 's blowing up fast -- into far more killings than an exploding oil tanker .

And that 's despite phones being dropped full of contacts , found after attacks , retrieved . <p> Yet beyond the growing insurrection in western Laikipia , and the mystery of the security forces ' ' stay-away ' , there are far , far bigger issues of neglect going on . <p> Laikipia is the top wildlife preserve in the world for large and endangered animals . It has more than either Serengeti or Kruger National Park , half of all Kenya 's rhinos , the widest diversity of large mammals anywhere . <p> More millions of dollars were coming in to create a migratory corridor for the wildlife . As it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aside for the exclusive use of wildlife on conservancies , but that two percent holds Kenya 's greatest wildlife assets . <p> But Laikipia has been experiencing rapid population growth , up 30 percent from 2009 to 2019 , and even faster growth in livestock , up 55 percent over the same period . <p> Some 90 per cent of the population is pastoral , so nearly all those cattle are grazing . Yet there are no laws on land use in Laikipia , and the surge in cattle to feed has coincided with climate change -- with the county plagued by drought since 2015 . <p> Without management of the rising herd numbers -- and management options are possible -- this year 's surge in huge herds roving the area is leading to the permanent destruction of pasture .

Being a woman in politics , what are some of the highs and lows and how did you balance between politics and family ? <p> It is very difficult to balance your life and give people time . For instance , look at the time you have been waiting . I really feel I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At the same time , I have my family members calling me . And then there are also other people who want to come and sit and feel good and you need to ask them very politely what exactly brought them to the office . You have to be very polite . <p> For women , it really is harder because you are balancing between your office , family , children , friends , politics and even your own self-time . Churches are waiting for you on Sundays , schools are waiting for you , there are burials and weddings to attend ... name them . The telephone never stops ringing . They ( voters ) can not understand why you did not pick their phone . <p> And when they call , they ask : " Governor , do you know who is speaking ? " Now , you must say yes , even if you do n't . The assumption is that since they voted for me , I must know each and every one of them by name . They also do not like people around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They say they are the ones making me inaccessible . They say we never elected these people here , we only voted for you . <p> Balancing this thing is very difficult ; that is why a lot of women find it very difficult getting into office . If they must succeed , they must have very strong support from their families and if they are married , from their husbands . My husband supported me , he was there every time . Wherever he was , he told people I was the best MP . I miss him and I feel sad he is not around to be with me as the governor now and see the journey I have travelled . He would be proud of me . A woman needs all the support , from the spouse especially . Men are supported so much by their wives and I wish all women also have their husbands to support them . <p> As a champion of women leadership , do you foresee a time when a major presidential candidate will pick a woman as a running mate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not be either of the two . I can never work with Ruto . If we get one nominated , by the only one in whose hands we are safe , it would be a very nice thing . <p> Why is it so ? <p> Some of us have sets of values we believe in . It will be a tragedy to have a woman supporting that one . No . <p> You missed death by a whisker in an incident that killed former Kitui mayor Martha Mwangangi in 2016 . Who was after your life ? <p> It pains me so much . In fact every time I walk in the streets of Kitui , that is the only thing that comes to my mind . I walk out from here and again I know the people who killed my friend Martha also wanted to kill me and they were part and parcel of this same county government workers that I am now presiding over . It is very painful . <p> The other day you had an Azimio rally in Makueni amid murmurs of a deliberate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all Ukambani governors have little or no time for the regional supremo . Why is that so ? <p> No , we did not sideline anyone . Everybody was invited and the Wiper leader has been part and parcel of Raila Odinga 's cause for all the years . If you remember , in 2007 , I was the first person to sell Raila Odinga here . I ran on the Narc ticket and he was the presidential candidate . Kalonzo was a presidential candidate and I did not support him , I supported Raila . <p> I am always persuaded to believe that Raila Odinga won , but between Kibaki and Kalonzo , whatever happened , they took the seat and we later on worked together . In 2013 Kalonzo joined Raila Odinga , so he sold Raila Odinga in the whole of Ukambani and the Akamba accepted Raila fully . In 2017 , again , Kalonzo was with Raila and , again , every vote , with the exception of a few , went to Raila . <p> There is a raging debate on in whose hands , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What 's your take ? <p> This is akin to choosing between day and night . The only person who can protect this country is Raila Amollo Odinga . <p> You do n't seem to have any kind words for DP Ruto . What did he do to you ? <p> His leadership style , that 's all . If you have the heart of a leader , would you , when looking for some place to get your hotel visitors ' parking lot , teargas primary school children ? In the Bible , 2nd Samuel 12:4 to be specific , a story is told of a rich man who instead of picking a lamb from his huge flock went for the only one from a poor neighbour to entertain his guests . That 's exactly what happened in this case . <p> Why did n't you indict him for the alleged crime when you were the Land minister , or were you under pressure to protect those involved ? In fact , you told us that some Singh brothers were behind the attempted land grab . <p> You know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protect it . But the title deed for that piece of land indicated it belonged to ' Habanse ' . <p> What did the President tell you ? <p> He directed me to go and fence it .

@@63599236 <h> Q&amp;A With Police Spokesman Bruno Shioso <p> The National Police Service Spokesman Bruno Shioso fields questions from the public via Sunday Nation . <p> This month , some police officers will have to source for advances to supplement their income after receiving slashed salaries . This salary and promotions problem has lingered since 2018 . Are you concerned that the move to cut their salaries will affect their morale and increase cases of officers engaging in criminal activities ? Is there something being done to address this matter once and for all ? Evans Njogu , Utawala <p> I do empathise with the affected officers since no one can bear with diminished earning capacity . That said , this is a legal and policy issue rather than an administrative one . It is also a cross-cutting issue affecting the National Police Service Commission ( employer ) , NPS , Salaries and Remuneration Commission , Judiciary and other actors such as the Treasury . <p> Therefore , it is well beyond my pay grade or NPS ' intervention . I invite you to familiarise yourself with the Court of Appeal ruling in Civil Appeal No. 352 of 2019 ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Appeal ruled against the position advanced by the aggrieved officers . That , unfortunately , is the position that we must not only respect but enforce too . <p> When the current Inspector-General of police took office , he published a Gazette notice detailing those who have right of way on Kenyan roads . He identified five categories with less than 30 offices . The publication of this notice brought hope that finally the anarchy on roads would be addressed . Unfortunately , this notice ended up being a public relations exercise . Today , observance of traffic regulations is voluntary . Drivers of government and county vehicles along with those of public corporations have been joined by MPs , MCAs , and county officials in competing with matatus to determine who can be most obnoxious to other road users . What is the NPS doing to restore sanity on our roads ? Mike Johan <p> True , Mike , the policy was published by the IG and it is still valid and in force . Your concern , which I wholeheartedly agree with , tells of a much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tells on the capacity of police to enforce the laws and policies . I think first we as Kenyans and also road users need to cultivate a basic sense of road discipline , courtesy and good manners generally . This should be the preventative baseline , rather than focusing on more laws and police actions . Or are we going to blame the police for our bad road manners too ? <p> Why did the Anti-Terrorism Police Unit ( ATPU ) raid the headquarters of the Prisons Service in commando-style to arrest the former Prisons ' boss ? Was all that force necessary ? Do n't you think the act was humiliating both to the outgoing boss and the image of the correctional service at large ? Andrew Maranga Ratemo , Nairobi <p> Andrew , firstly , ATPU never " raided " Prison 's headquarters , but responded to a distress call , whose specifics I would not get into now . Their posture as seen on TV was merely an issue of police techniques , especially when responding to a call without having the benefit of the details upfront @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a standard police procedure when responding to all calls , including of a lost pet ! Officers were simply on high alert and were n't taking any chances . And as a correction , the Commissioner-General of Prison was never arrested . <p> There were several versions of the chaos that erupted during DP William Ruto 's recent campaign tour of the Nyanza region . That the DP gave out money to be shared among the boda boda riders , but some people made away with it , hence leading to chaos ; and that the police had intelligence reports the previous day indicating that there would be chaos but did not act on them . Which version should we believe ? Erick Ole Agade , Busia <p> Erick , when faced with a situation of conflicting official information or narrative , always stick to the police version . Police are authentic , objective and reliable . We do n't have interest in public ( political ) discourse but pursue only facts as they are . <p> And let me add that in addition to our mandate of official @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quality of the news we share -- we are also well represented at the grassroots so we get first-hand information . Beyond that , we utilise other capabilities , including intelligence , forensics and technology . <p> Therefore , what we share from headquarters is an outcome of a laborious effort by many actors to feed Kenyans with objective reality . I , therefore , encourage you and others to always trust the police version of narratives since you can always hold us to account . <p> One of the fundamental principles of community policing is to make the police and the community work together . However , the police force is largely very unfriendly towards community members . What is being done to address this apprehension ? David N. Ndungu , Kilifi <p> True , David . This is one area greatly responsible for tensions in the police-community relations , hence impacting negatively on good policing outcomes . It is an area police reform is focused on , and that is why community policing is a big plank of the ongoing police reforms . We are addressing the drivers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fullness of time bring police and the public together . <p> We are fully aware we ca n't be effective without the full cooperation of the public . You saw the role the public played recently towards the recapture of the prison break trio . That is the direction we aspire towards . But it is a process . <p> Reforming such a big organisation with an entrenched culture is no mean feat . The USA has been reforming for more than 60 years now , and still have trust deficit issues . Our reform journey is still in infancy -- a mere 10 years -- and we are acknowledging our weaknesses and building on our strengths . <p> We need the support of the public , first by giving us the benefit of doubt , then working with us . So much is already happening in the counties where frontline policing is taking place . <p> In Nakuru County for instance we have a football initiative to bridge to normalise relations . In Tran Nzoia , we have a senior commander who employs singing to reach out to disadvantaged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great impacts . <p> The IG banned the erection of roadblocks without approval . While the physical roadblocks are gone , the police still man those spots with the sole purpose of extorting money from motorists . When are we going to see the end of this ? David N. Ndungu , Kilifi <p> The roadblocks policy is well communicated and enforced . Roadblocks should be for a specific purpose and time-bound . Roadblocks are meant to detect criminal offences and not traffic violations . Traffic operations should be mobile , not static . <p> Therefore , whenever you come across lone officers on the road stopping cars , be a good citizen and make a report , even on the NPS Twitter account and action will be taken . This is an area the IG and Deputy IG of the Kenya Police Service are very passionate about . <p> All roadblocks and traffic checks must be sanctioned by local commanders , who are held strictly accountable to the IG and DIG KPS over the performance of their officers . <p> As police continue to attract negative publicity , including @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ask themselves whether the much talked about police reforms ever took place or bore any fruits . Sir , what is your take on these observations ? Komen Moris , Eldoret <p> Dear Komen , police reforms are not only real and ongoing but the greatest strategic agenda ever undertaken in the history of our police . Reforms do n't easily happen , even with the best corporates . It is a great feat that NPS has soldiered on this far . If you doubt this , just try to reform your own life or even family and see how hopeless it gets ! <p> We have a clear roadmap , and have our priority areas right and well mapped out . We also have the buy-in of the rank-and-file who are keen to turn the page for the better . So far , much ground has been covered , but we still keep our focus on the prize ; to bring the police and public to the same policing table to design joint interventions on security , peace and safety . And in all this , we remain grateful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unwavering support The Government is keen to see NPS succeed in this transformative effort .

It discusses key steps in the design , implementation and monitoring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policies , strategies and laws crucial to having effective child-sensitive social protection programmes . The document gives guidelines on how to identify gaps in existing social protection schemes for children and how to address them . Importantly , the guide discusses factors that determine how child-sensitive a social protection programme is . <p> The guide targets policymakers and implementers of social protection programmes in government and non-state sectors who are seeking to initiate child-sensitive social protection or strengthen existing initiatives . It advocates for holistic rights-based child-sensitive social protection programmes . Regardless of economic status , states have the obligation to undertake policy , legislative , budgetary and administrative measures to increase and improve the quality of public investments in children . <p> Countries that have ratified the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child are required to budget appropriately for children . Budgetary measures include mobilising resources regionally and nationally towards implementation of children 's rights , including those who are internally displaced , refugees , girls , and those belonging to minority social and religious groups . <p> To give social-economic context , the document explains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There is increasing recognition that beyond income poverty , a large proportion of children are affected by more than one type of deprivation with regard to education , health , shelter , water and sanitation . <p> The Oxford Poverty and Human Development Initiative index shows that 63.5 percent of children in Sub-Saharan Africa are multi-dimensionally poor . This is the highest incidence of multidimensional poverty among developing regions . In countries such as Burkina Faso , Chad , Ethiopia , Niger and South Sudan , 90 percent or more of children under the age of 10 are multi-dimensionally poor . <p> The guide gives steps to be taken before initiating a child-sensitive social protection programme . First is to understand the extent and reasons for child poverty and vulnerability in the given context . This is done by analysis of primary and/or secondary data . This exercise clarifies the incidence , types and levels of child deprivation and vulnerability . <p> Primary data collection aims at assessing availability of services such as health care , education , water and sanitation , nutrition and shelter , as well as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ involves assessing the knowledge , attitudes and practices of a community that may contribute to factors that impact negatively on child development . <p> Analysis of secondary data also helps to determine the kinds of vulnerabilities facing children . For example , a child-sensitive social protection intervention that aims to reduce harmful child labour and improve school attendance may look at data and trends for literacy , school attendance regularity and retention , and harmful child labour , and then break these down by gender and different socio-economic groups . <p> The next step after analysing the types of vulnerabilities children face is to identify gaps and opportunities in policy , laws and programmes with regard to existing child-sensitive social protection programmes . This is done by reviewing background information , design , operational features , and the monitoring and evaluation system of programmes . <p> Identifying gaps in social protection policies is crucial . This step helps programmes , policies and laws to become more sensitive to specific needs of children . Knowledge gained from this exercise also helps to inform and shape advocacy on child-sensitive social protection with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political support for child-sensitive social protection is to engage in advocacy . Advocacy can be targeted to line ministries in charge of children , gender , social protection , finance , education , health , housing , water and sanitation , among others . Advocacy can also be targeted at members of parliament or parliamentary house committees in charge of social welfare or social protection . <p> Other targets of advocacy include the media , partners who support governments in implementing social protection programmes , and civil society organisations . Regional level advocacy can involve working with the African Union or other regional blocks , such as the Southern Africa Development Co-operation , the East African Community and the Economic Community of West African States . Advocacy targeting regional and international human rights institutions is also important so as to enhance accountability for child-sensitive social protection programming . <p> Appraisal of programmes , policy and laws can reveal opportunities for inter-agency cooperation , including between government and non-state entities . This process involves review of background of programmes as well as implementing and financing agencies . It also looks at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ determine eligibility to social protection programmes . <p> Policy and legal review can lead to further opportunities . For example , it can show gaps in connecting existing social protection and other complementary programmes . A good instance of complementary linkages is the Livelihood Against Poverty programme in Ghana , which has been able to link cash transfer with subsidised enrolment in the National Health Insurance Scheme . In this instance , cash transfer has been linked to insurance support in order to address multidimensional vulnerability . The Cash Plus programme in Tanzania and South Africa 's child grant have also been able to link cash transfer with other complementary social protection measures . <p> The next step is to use the knowledge gained from the surveys , analysis and reviews to design viable and appropriate child-sensitive social protection interventions . Social protection interventions are divided into three categories : social assistance , social insurance and labour market . <p> Social assistance includes regular and predictable cash transfers , vouchers or in-kind assistance such as school meals that do not require a contribution from the beneficiary . Examples of cash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grants , widowhood grants , etc . Social assistance also includes subsidies or fee waivers for goods and basic services . <p> Social insurance beneficiaries typically support it by making contributions , though it may be subsidised by the government , especially for the poorest . Examples are health and accident insurance , disability insurance , maternity benefits , workplace pensions or unemployment benefits . Labour market policies and interventions include livelihood programmes , skills training , minimum wage policy , wage subsidies , maternity policy , and protection in the workplace . <p> Intervention could also be in the form of strengthening social protection programmes at policy and legal levels . This helps existing policy and legal frameworks to become more sensitive to child rights and child protection . There is an opportunity to promote and incorporate principles of child-sensitive social protection in situations where there are no specific policies and laws on social protection . <p> The guide stresses the importance of children 's participation . The level of child participation can be assessed by analysing the extent to which girls and boys of different ages , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from social protection at each point in their life cycle . It is therefore crucial for these services to be indiscriminately available and accessible to all children and their families . <p> A child holds up art work . PHOTO COURTESY <p> Children 's participation is one of the factors that indicate a child-sensitive approach to social protection . Other principles of child-sensitive social protection include respect for children 's views which should be canvassed without intimidation , respect for their views , and protection of children against all kinds of risks . Additional principles are inclusivity of all children regardless of gender , religion or other classification . Child-sensitive programmes also give feedback to children on how their participation has influenced outcomes . Additionally , child-sensitive programmes have adults who are trained to work with children . <p> The guide notes that most of the existing social accountability tools do not monitor the outcomes of social protection programmes for children . Monitoring the impact of social protection programmes is often limited to measuring reduction of poverty levels , increased food consumption , and improvements in livelihoods in households . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and food consumption , and considers the needs of children in the beneficiary households , including access to services such as sanitation , education , health , water and nutrition , among others . It is important to have a participatory monitoring approach , which involves beneficiaries and communities . Listening to and learning from programme beneficiaries , including children , is critical in making programme improvements . <p> Finally , the guide discusses factors that determine how child sensitive a social protection programme is .
