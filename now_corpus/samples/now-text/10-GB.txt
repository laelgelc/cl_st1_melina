And , after what happened with Broad and the umpires over a review at Centurion , you would have thought he would want to stay away from any possibility of trouble . <p> But we have to remember that the ball was spinning when he stepped on it and if Broad thinks he has the ability to stick his spikes into the scuffed side of the ball in that situation then he is in the wrong game . He should be a footballer ! <p> It would have been completely random and would not necessarily have led to the desired effect even if he had wanted to get up to no good . <p> Foolish : Footage shows Stuart Broad treading on the ball <p> If England really were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than that . And if Broad had put his spikes into the shiny side by mistake then he would have incurred the wrath of Jimmy Anderson and his own team anyway ! <p> If I was the match referee , Roshan Mahanama , I would have a quiet word with Broad and tell him not to be silly . I would not feel the need to take action against Broad or England . <p> Mind you , the ball did reverse swing early for England again on Tuesday -- more to do with the heat and the dry outfield than any malpractice -- and if they had been able to take one wicket then , before Graeme Smith had fully settled , it could easily have led to three or four . <p> As it was the swing virtually disappeared and this was emphatically South Africa 's day . <p> The South Africa captain was mighty impressive . Smith is far from a classical player and has n't got a great technique , but he is so , so strong mentally . <p> It was Smith who won the series @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2008 and he could conceivably be playing a similarly significant innings here . <p> Driving force : England could learn a lesson from Graeme Smith <p> Smith is clearly so determined to bring his side back into this series . Make no mistake , he is the one who runs , controls and drives this South Africa team forward . Not coach Mickey Arthur or anyone else . He was really leading fromthe front again on his home ground . <p> I think England could learn a lesson from Smith because he was full of positive intent and clearly had a declaration in mind as he stepped on the gas as his innings went on . <p> He knows he needs five sessions to try to bowl England out and wanted to be positive and give himself as much time as possible . England can be guilty of dawdling when on top . <p> I believe Smith will dangle a carrot in front of England by declaring soon after lunch and setting them 450 or so because this is the Test he knows his side must win . <p> Saved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standing with Tony Hill <p> This is South Africa 's big chance . You never know what the weather will do in Johannesburg next week and Smith will not want to have to win at the Wanderers to avoid losing the series . He wants to go there at 1-1 . <p> That said , all hope is not lost for England . They bowled pretty well and Graeme Swann , in particular , troubled Smith at the start of his innings and would have had him had his lbw not been overruled on review . <p> I had a good look at the pitch and England really should not have anything to fear on the fourth and fifth days . I do not think it will deteriorate as much as it usually does here even though the baking sun will cause cracks and there might be some uneven bounce on day five . <p> England got a bit hot under the collar as things went wrong -- with Kevin Pietersen getting stick from Broad and Anderson in the field and Swann at one stage having a go at Broad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though Broad again has to be careful with his onfield demeanour . <p> It was not done in a Ryan Sidebottom ' look at me ' sort of way and I think they were just showing passion . They cared when they could n't find a way through South Africa . <p> People ask me what it is like playing in this sort of heat -- it touched 40 degrees here -- but while it does n't help it is not too bad . <p> For a start playing in extreme heat is what you train to do and secondly this is probably the fittest England side of all time . They have left no stone unturned in preparing themselves and we can not blame the weather . <p> One last thought . <p> The review system saved Daryl Harper from making a real howler when he wrongly gave Ashwell Prince caught down the leg side and that is what this innovation is there to do . <p> Even though Harper was a little bit ' stuffed ' by Prince looking as though he was walking , the umpire was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bottom line is that Harper is a poor umpire and he seems to have a shocker whenever we see him . <p> Nothing personal , but Harper is a weak official and if the review system helps right his wrongs then it is doing its job . 
@@1338232 <h> Philips 32PFL7404 32in LCD TV review <h> Summary <h> Our Score <p> 9/10 <h> User Score <p> Review Price free/subscription <p> A few weeks ago we looked at and were very impressed by Philips ' 42PFL7404 : an actually affordable 42in model that still offered at least a taste of the heavy duty processing power for which Philips is becoming famous - or infamous , I guess , if you 're one of those people still clinging to the idea that lots of processing inevitably leads to pictures that do n't look natural . <p> So we thought it made sense with the January sales upon us to look at how well the 7404 Series ' ' stripped down ' processing approach works on a smaller , much more affordable screen : the 32in , ? 560 32PFL7404 . Will Philips ' processing efforts still be visible enough at this size level to warrant stepping up to the 32PFL7404 from ultra-cheap models like Toshiba 's 32AV635D and 32AV615D ? <p> First impressions are promising . For the 32PFL7404 's design is really quite exquisite by the usually cheap and cheerful standards of the sub- ? 600 32in market . Its unusually slender bezel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the way a translucent outer ' shroud ' curves forward around the main black frame . <p> The only disappointment for me is that Philips has had to strip all traces of its Ambilight technology out of the 32PFL7404 , meaning your viewing experience is not enhanced by any sympathetic coloured light emissions from the TV 's sides . Boo . Though if you 're one of those miserable blighters who finds Ambilight gimmicky and flash , then I guess you 'll be only too happy at its removal from the 32PFL7404 . <p> Philips has n't compromised as much as it might have with the 32PFL7404 's connections . There 's still a highly credible count of four HDMIs , for a start . Plus you get solid multimedia support from a USB socket able to take in and play a surprising number of AV file types , and a PC input . <p> As part of its cost-cutting measures to make the 32PFL7404 's price possible , Philips has n't been able to give it the Ethernet port found on the brand 's step-up 8404 and 9000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and no access to the Internet . But while a pity , this is hardly a deal breaker for the 32PFL7404 's sort of money . <p> Especially as elsewhere it has some quite nice specifications up its sleeve . It has a Full HD resolution , despite its size and cost , and it claims a contrast ratio of 80,000:1 that ranks as one of the highest we 've seen on such an affordable 32in TV . And then , of course , there 's the TV 's video processing , which here consists of something called ' Pixel Precise HD ' in conjunction with 100Hz. <h> xenos <h> January 6 , 2010 , 1:52 am <p> I 've always been a bit of a Toshiba freak but I really like this , might save and buy a more expensive model as my old toshy 32WL56 is beginning to look like a dinosaur : ) <h> Epic <h> January 6 , 2010 , 12:34 pm <p> It 'd be nice if you iincluded some info about power consumption and backlighting technology given the way Samsung and others are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ January 6 , 2010 , 3:39 pm <p> Agree <h> Stu 2 <h> January 6 , 2010 , 3:41 pm <p> I 'm awaiting delivery of the 42PFL7404 ( which incidentally only cost ? 615 through M&amp;S online ) , I decided to buy Philips primarily based on the rave reveiws they get from TR .

I 'm a little worried about the over processed look but I 'll let you know my thoughts once I have it installed . <h> BOFH UK <h> January 6 , 2010 , 5:12 pm <p> Totally agree with sets like this that offer so much image processing needing to have user-defined presets for various sources . I 'd never get one that needs constant tweaking because a ) it 's a massive pain for anyone other than me to use and b ) I 'm getting too old and too busy to spend relaxation time messing with settings . <p> Looking to replace a 42 " Samsung plasma at the moment but trying to hang on until the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3D set mind you , but I at least want to know what the technical requirements are as I 've already got a PS3 for media playback so it makes sense to wait and see what happens . <h> John Archer <h> January 11 , 2010 , 8:23 pm <p> Hi all <p> For everyone struggling with the processing on this - and other - Philips TVs , try choosing the Cinema preset as your starting point when trying to calibrate the picture . For although you would n't guess it from its name , this mode mostly sets all the processing elements to their minimum levels , allowing you to just add on bits of processing in incremental stages as your tastes desire . This is easier than starting with a mode that has loads of processing switched on , and trying to figure out what 's causing problems and what isn't.

' . <p> " I started to look at it and I found it to be one of the most fascinating stories there is . " <p> Stephen 's talk will take his audience from the birth of Thomas Perkins to the heights of the success of Perkins Engines . <p> It will highlight the importance the company came to have on the international stage , from humble beginnings in 1932 in an office in Queen Street , which was located on the site of what is now Queensgate . <p> Frank Perkins had been thinking about the idea of a high-speed diesel engine for some time , and had started to develop it with an engine designer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the idea took off , as the pair joined forces with two other men , G D Perks , and Frank 's brother-in-law AJM Richardson , to establish the company . <p> Perkins engines went on to play a key role in the Second World War , as its now-famous P6 engine was used in rescue boats and other marine craft . <p> By the early 1950s , Perkins engines were being used by many key car manufacturers , including Austin , Chrysler , Ford , Dodge and Vauxhall , and in the 1960s and 1970s , Perkins was the biggest employer in Peterborough . <p> Stephen will also reveal something of the man behind all of this , the inspirational figure of Frank Perkins . <p> He was the one who saw the potential that a high speed diesel engine possessed and set up the company which bought success to both him and the city . <p> As well as having the determination to found his own company , Frank also had an eye for publicity and was ahead of his time in getting word about his product out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the public needed some convincing that diesel engines were a good idea . <p> " People were concerned about where they would get a diesel engine serviced . They knew how to do that for petrol engines , but not for diesel , " Stephen said . <p> Fortunately , Frank was a master at marketing and publicity stunts . <p> " What he tried to do was tell the country - and the world to some extent -that diesel engines were here and were a viable proposition , " Stephen said . <p> In order to do this , he aimed to get the public 's attention . He drove a diesel engine car to Moscow , and in October 1935 , he put a diesel engine car on Brooklands racing track . The car lapped the circuit at 92mph , and at times reached 100mph -- eye-catchingly fast speeds in the 30s . <p> Stephen has a lot of respect for Frank and the work he did . <p> " I think he had great vision . He had a great interesting in driving the company forward , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ setting up the company as a pioneering venture . <p> " In the early days he had the vision to see that the world needed high speed diesel engines . <p> " Even today across the world if you talk about high speed diesel engines , it 's the name Perkins that 's mentioned .

Betsy herself can remember more than 340 words and as she waited for each new command her eyes glowed with the sort of devotion to learning last seen on a human child in the 1950s . But the curious thing is that it 's not just dogs whose brain power we 've radically underestimated . If you think back over the past year , there 's been what looks almost like a planned attempt by the animal kingdom finally to show humans what they can do . <p> It started with the crows -- remember the crows ? For several weeks in late 2009 they monopolised the feel-good end of the news with their amazing corvid skills : fashioning hooks to pull worms from narrow tubes , solving problems involving water levels and eureka cans , hopping with excitement at their own cleverness .

Even the sticklebacks managed a small news item : " Sticklebacks learn like humans despite tiny fish brains . " <p> Yes , it 's exciting -- but it 's also frightening . I 'm all for farming , even ( useful ) drug testing on puppies . I 'd never suggest that a dolphin was the moral equivalent of a man . But if animals keep proving themselves ever cleverer , some time soon we 'll have to take stock of the great weight of misery we inflict , all the unnecessary harm . <p> I 've been trying to think up ways around the issue all week ; none of them work .

If intelligence is irrelevant , on what basis do we claim our own superiority ? <p> I know it 's a mistake to imagine that animals do n't think or feel in the same way we do -- but it does n't follow that they do n't suffer . And there is an autistic academic in Colorado who claims to think like a cow . She 's called Temple Grandin , and she says that though cows do n't mind being milked by machine , they are less keen on rotting in the dark covered in sores . <p> Loophole three nearly saved me : if animals behave like animals , I decided , then why should n't we ? Even the kindliest dolphin does n't give a monkey 's about my welfare , so why should I consider his ? But then , who 'd trust a toddler to give a toss either ?

With respect to all the right-wing thinkers , I think they 've got the question quite wrong .

By Monday evening the Cameroons were poised for a disaster , and the health fiasco would have made front-page news but then -- a miracle ! Saved ! Cameron made another gaffe -- this time about his proposals for a marriage tax break , and the health story was old news . It 's going to be jolly exciting when they 're in power . <p> *So much talk of snow , so many pictures of snow , but no talk of how the old people are faring . Where are they all ?

@@1342240 <h> Born-again Christian Stephen Baldwin : great fun for atheists <p> I do n't know whether Professor Richard Dawkins is watching Celebrity Big Brother . I 'll go out on a limb and guess that he is n't . If that 's the case , it 's a pity . I think he 'd rather enjoy the current series . Although not as much as I 'd enjoy seeing him as a contestant on it . <p> The reason for this is Stephen Baldwin . In 2001 , Baldwin , the star of The Usual Suspects , became a born-again Christian -- and , as is the case with so many born-again Christians , the thing he most enjoys talking about is being a born-again Christian . This , at any rate , is the impression he has given in his first five nights as a contestant on Celebrity Big Brother , during which he has delivered , from his own little mount of jaunty self-importance , sermons that I 'm sure have entertained all the show 's viewers , apart from any educated Christians among them , who must be groaning at his bumptiousness . <p> On Wednesday night 's programme , Baldwin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ following declaration at the dining table : <p> " What my faith requires is that if I , my wife and my two kids were sitting on a public bus , and somebody came on with a machine-gun and pointed it at my daughter and said to her , ' Say Jesus does n't exist ' ... If she turned to me and said , ' What do I do ? ' , I 'd say , ' What have I taught you to do ? ' And she 'd say , ' Jesus absolutely exists ' , and I 'd see her in heaven . " <p> Personally I think it rather a slur upon Our Lord to suggest that He is so heartless that He 'd rather a small girl be shot dead than hear her say He does n't exist . But I concede that I 'm no theological expert . <p> On last night 's programme , Baldwin loudly presented his argument against evolutionary science : <p> " No , I do n't believe in evolution . See , because here 's my problem . Evolution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Correct ? OK , so my question is , if we 're from apes , why are the apes still here ? If we evolved from apes , they would have died off . " <p> Sadly none of Baldwin 's housemates -- among them a topless model , a cage fighter and a boy band singer -- proved capable of explaining that evolutionary science does not state that we are " from " apes , if by apes he means the apes we see today , such as gorillas and chimpanzees ; rather , we share with gorillas and chimpanzees a distant common ancestor , and so the reason that the apes Baldwin 's thinking of have n't died off is that they 've been evolving too , albeit in a different way from human beings . <p> But even if his housemates had tried to explain that , Baldwin would almost certainly have drowned them out using his missionary charm . On he barked and fizzed and hooted ... <p> BALDWIN : " Let me ask you a question . What keeps you alive every day ? What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , if I took it away ?

See , somebody told you that oxygen was called oxygen , the thing you need the most . Well , guess what ? Somebody told you that the words in that book The Bible are true , and you went , ' I do n't believe it . ' But you 'll believe oxygen ! " <p> I suppose what Baldwin is saying here is that Reid is woolly-headed for a ) being prepared to believe in the truth of something whose existence has been proven using scientific evidence , and b ) not being prepared to believe in the truth of something for which at present there is no scientific evidence . <p> To return to the subject of Professor Dawkins : although an atheist myself , I 'm not a great fan of his .

People are entitled to believe in whatever religious doctrine they choose , just as they are entitled to vote for whichever political party they choose ( and just as I 'm entitled to disagree with them ) . <p> But how I would love to see Professor Dawkins engage in theological debate with Baldwin . Dear , strident , overweening , bullying , magnificently absurd Baldwin . That he 'll go to heaven , I personally doubt . But that he 'll go to the pantheon of all-time most amusing reality TV grotesques , I am certain .

@@1346232 <h> Making The Cut <p> Libby Galvin investigates the increasing popularity of plastic surgery amongst British students , asking why we 're so desperate to change the shape of the student body -- has Nottingham 's reputation for a campus full of beautiful people come at too high a price ? <p> Often I get something of an unwelcome shock when I look in the mirror . In my mind 's eye , I certainly look better than my reflection tells me . Taking stock of the image in front of me , I accept that the basics are fine -- but with a little bit of work , I could have the face and body I think I have when I 'm feeling great and do n't have access to any reflective surfaces . But if I could , would I change my looks to match my personal ideal ? Increasingly , women and men my age are making permanent changes to their physiques , and using surgery to make their idealised selves a reality . This is n't unheard of -- everyone knows about plastic surgery : you can hardly miss it for the coverage on television and in magazines -- but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In 2008 , a total of 34,187 surgical procedures were carried out by members of the British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons ( BAAPS ) , an increase of more than 5% on the previous year . Statistics including a breakdown of the age range of patients are not easily available , but a brief survey of Nottingham University students alone showed over three quarters knew someone in their peer group who had had plastic surgery , or was considering it seriously enough to have had a surgical consultation . <p> I spoke to Lucy , a fourth year Nottingham student considering rhinoplasty , and her best friend Charlie , who had a breast enlargement two years ago . A student at Roehampton , Charlie had her surgery aged 20 after considering it since the age of fifteen . Her surgeon was Mr Brent Tanner , who has also dealt with such high profile clients as Katie Price . Charlie described the feeling after having her surgery as " like having bricks on my chest " but is extremely pleased with her new shape , having gone from an uneven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happy with " her pals " as she calls them , Lucy expressed concern that her friend now looks in the mirror some days and still considers them too small . When she went for surgery , Charlie was seeing a man whose previous girlfriend had a breast enlargement paid for by him , and who is now seeing another woman who he has also bought new breasts . Did his encouragement prove to be an important factor in her decision to undergo augmentation ? " No , but his support certainly helped . " Now they are no longer together , Charlie 's figure attracts romantic attention from footballers and other high profile men when she goes out in London , and she frequently gets photographed at clubs by paparazzi mistaking her for a glamour model or WAG . For ? 6000 , it seems you can buy not only a new chest but a passport to a certain lifestyle . Underneath her glossy exterior , though , Charlie plans to become a primary school teacher and is currently taking her PGCE -- in the course of her placements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real life Barbie doll ? " Self aware enough to be entertained by this , Charlie is adamant that her surgery has improved her confidence and she loves the look she has constructed , brushing off the idea that she may be attracting attention from people who are only interested in her looks with the assertion that " they might start talking to me because of my appearance , but then I 'll dazzle them with my personality ! " <p> Drastic overhauls like hers do not make up the majority of examples of students having plastic surgery , however . Whilst breast augmentation is the most common procedure across age ranges with 8,439 performed in 2008 ( up 30% from 2007 ) , the other procedures in the national top 5 -- eyelid surgery , face lifts , tummy tucks and breast reduction -- are less popular amongst students for obvious , age related reasons . Instead , rhinoplasty , or nose jobs , seemed to be the most commonly desired or undertaken surgery by men and women alike . I spoke to several boys who had had reconstructive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consequence of multiple breakages playing sports , and to yet more girls who had looked into the possibility . In my North London sixth form alone , I knew of 4 girls in just one year who had nose jobs during the summer holidays , and there are many more at Nottingham University who have gone away at the end of one term and come back the next looking somewhat more facially streamlined . Few , however , are willing to talk about it , perhaps understandably ; for many girls , facial alteration is a particularly sensitive subject and incredibly closely related to self confidence and one 's own perception of beauty . Whilst breasts , or the lack thereof , can be hidden or enhanced by careful dressing , the face is constantly on show . Lucy , 22 , went to the same surgeon as her friend Charlie for a consultation about removing the small bump from the bridge of her nose . Initially keen to have it done , she changed her mind after first realizing she could n't afford the ? 4000 fee , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no difference at all ! " Between the reluctance to spend so much money and the worrying possibility that she would n't like the outcome if it did make a drastic difference , Lucy has opted to put her plans for surgery on hold indefinitely . <p> Intrigued to see exactly what it took and how easy it is to change your appearance , I decided to book myself a consultation at a local plastic surgery clinic . The Harley Medical Group are a nationwide company offering ' a range of surgical and nonsurgical solutions . ' I visited their Nottingham clinic on Castle Boulevard , ready to see what they could offer me to remedy my " unfeminine " nose ( their words not mine ! ) . The waiting and consultation rooms were innocuous and comfortable , more reminiscent of an upmarket beauty salon than a medical facility , and my Nurse Counselor was charming and confidence inspiring . The surroundings and her treatment of me made me feel it was the most normal and reasonable thing in the world to consider spending upwards of ? 4000 on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the past twenty years -- I went in there purely for research purposes , and came out quite seriously interested in how ' just a touch ' of the surgeons scalpel and chisel could fashion my heretofore ungainly proboscis into something altogether more elegant . It was n't until I got home and saw my housemate 's puzzled reactions when I expressed my newfound desire for a neater nose that I remembered I did n't really want one at all . Some people do have real issues with their noses , and easily alterable ones at that -- I saw fantastic ' after ' shots at the clinic of straightened noses that would previously have given Pinocchio a run for his money , but it seems there is little differentiation made between those who have a genuine issue and those who are simply spending too much time in front of the mirror . Looking back on my appointment , I did feel I 'd been privy to a sales pitch more than a medical assessment -- there was the inherent assumption that I 'd already made a definite decision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seconds away from booking a further ? 500 consultation with my assigned surgeon in London . More worryingly , on further investigation it became clear that my assigned surgeon was not BAAPS accredited , but a Czech doctor with no British qualifications . Although there is nothing illegal or necessarily inherently dangerous in this , companies like the Harley Medical Group ( who incidentally are one of the heaviest advertisers in women 's magazines ) are trading off the trusted reputation of Harley Street when in fact the surgeons they employ are not necessarily at the top of their game . Students and other clients who have not fully researched their surgery but gone on price or the attractiveness of an advert may , without realising , be choosing to be treated by surgeons who are not held to the rigorous standards of the British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons . Payment plans of " only ? 99 a month " make this type of surgery readily accessible to anyone , explaining how even students can afford to augment their features on a budget . <p> That having been said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had it with the full support , both moral and financial , of their parents ; and often well before they 've reached university age . More regularly now surgery is undertaken to remedy acutely embarrassing problems that can manifest themselves in adolescence , particularly regarding one specifically male problem -- gynaecomastia . Gynaecomastia is the medical term for the commonly known and unaffectionately termed problem of ' man boobs ' , and surgery to resolve this condition has increased by an astounding 44% this year , with an increase of over 1000% in uptake of this procedure since 2003 . Joel , now 22 and a third year humanities student at the University , had gynaecomastia surgery in 2003 when he was 15 years old , and was one of only 22 men to have the surgery in Britain that year . " The problem first became obvious to me after a school swimming lesson . I 'd thought it was just a result of getting a bit tubby , but after the ribbing at the poolside I went to my GP and found out it was a real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I had the surgery done privately ; you could get it on the NHS but it would have taken too long . It only took six weeks between my initial appointment and the completion of the surgery -- they removed two clementines worth of fat from my chest and improved my confidence almost immeasurably . " <p> Girls , too , are increasingly seeking a more ' intimate ' kind of alteration . Currently , 91% of all plastic surgery is undergone by women , and in recent years the type of surgery available has considerably broadened . One girl , who preferred not to be named , underwent surgery on her vulva aged 14 to reduce the size of her labia . Media attention on this type of surgery usually suggests it is a result of the sexualisation of society and the saturation of pornographic images available to men and women of all ages , provoking people to aspire to a false set of norms . However , now 18 and attending University in the South West , this girl stated that " I did n't have the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supposedly ' perfect ' images I 'd seen , but simply because I felt uncomfortable -- wearing trousers and walking could chafe , and although I know many girls and women have labia which are more ' out ' than ' in ' I found it a handicap for me on a daily basis . Since having the surgery I feel far more comfortable and do n't have to worry about it anymore . " <p> These stories are testament to the belief of consultant plastic surgeon and past President of BAAPS Douglas McGeorge that " When performed under the right circumstances , cosmetic surgery can have a positive psychological impact and improve quality of life . " Undoubtedly , he is right , and for every story of nose jobs being bought as 21st birthday presents and young girls begging to be allowed to cut themselves open and insert breast implants in order to compete with friends who are simply developing ahead of them , there are stories of students whose lives have been vastly improved by having embarrassing physical concerns removed and their confidence restored . Despite the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ results : you only need to look at celebrities like Tara Reid , the elasticity of her skin ruined by liposuction and her breasts permanently and obviously scarred , to think twice before trying to ' improve ' what you already have . Perhaps we should n't be surprised that the younger generation are so enthusiastic in their acceptance of surgical quick fixes and permanent aesthetic improvements -- after all , we 've been brought up with it . British teens spend 1 hour and 8 minutes a week researching plastic surgery online , and according to one study in 2007 , those in the 18 to 24 age bracket are the most likely to approve of plastic surgery . Nonetheless , for all the successes we see , it is all too easily and too often forgotten that surgery both risks your life , and in cases such as breast enlargement , commits you to a lifetime of upkeep .

@@1350236 <h> The Big Question : Are we heading towards a 3D screen future ? <p> The technology is suddenly everywhere -- heralded as the future of television and transforming cinema-goers ' experience . This week rugby sponsors O2 announced that England 's upcoming Six Nations matches with Wales and Ireland would be beamed live in 3D to 40 Odeon and Cineworld cinemas nationwide next month . Meanwhile James Cameron 's Avatar is proving the most successful 3D movie ever made , with takings that have topped over $1bn , and Pixar 's Up took $680m globally . In 2010 around 20 out of 170 movies will be made in 3D , double the number from last year . A 3D animated remake of the Beatles ' Yellow Submarine , directed by Robert Zemeckis , is also in the pipeline . At last week 's Consumer Electronics Show ( CES ) in Las Vegas all the major TV manufacturers unveiled 3D sets . BSkyB plans to launch a 3D channel later this year . <p> Have n't we seen all this before ? <p> 3D technology has been around for almost as long as cinema . In 1922 , The Power of Love was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ambassador Hotel Theatre in Los Angeles . The effect was achieved by projecting two films strips -- one using reds , one using greens -- on top of one another . Viewers watched the film using glasses with different-coloured filters in their lenses . The golden age of 3D was in the early 1950s , and began with 1951 's Bwana Devil , an action-thriller set in Africa . Two prints were projected through polarising filters at the cinema screen , before being separated by glasses with differently-polarised lenses . The trend declined due to its expense . As well as duplicate prints , it required two projectionists <p> It was only a matter of time before the technology reached TV . In 2008 Samsung launched a ? 700 3D TV which requires glasses ; specialist TV manufacturers like Alioscopy and Magnetic also already make glasses-free 3D screens . <p> So what 's different now ? <p> Digital technology . Instead of using film , digital cinemas project images from a computer 's hard drive . Although 3D technology uses the same principles of polarising light used back in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meaning 3D is a much more worthwhile investment for Hollywood studios . Special adapters are fitted to conventional digital projectors that rotate the light several times per second , mimicking the effect of two projectors . <p> There are around 300 cinemas in the UK that can show 3D films . Traditionally , shooting in 3D required two cameras ; now , especially in situations with limited post-production such as television sports events , " stereoscopic " cameras with two lenses are employed . A spate of films have ridden the 3D wave over the last year -- among them Ice Age 3D and Journey to the Centre of the Earth 3D -- re-igniting interest in cinema during a difficult economic climate . At CES , Panasonic unveiled a 152-inch plasma screen that produced a better image than many cinemas . <p> Is n't watching 3D going to cost us more money ? <p> In the short term , yes . In 2008 , the average UK ticket price was ? 5.18 , but with their premium mark up , 3D films are generally up at around the ? 7 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be as much as ? 14 . Around 30p per ticket goes to RealD , who make the clip-on gadget that converts conventional digital projections to 3D . <p> With regard to televisions , US research firm Gartner says it only costs 15 per cent more to make a 3D TV than a regular flat screen . " At the moment 3D TVs are the same price as High Definition HD TVs were when they were first launched , " says Stuart Cupit , a director at 3D production specialists Inition . " But when people start to buy them in large numbers the prices will come down . At the moment they are premium products . " <p> So just how successful is 3D ? <p> In the first weekend of January , Avatar took ? 4.9m from the UK cinemas with 3D screens , ? 713,000 from 418 D cinemas , and ? 282,000 from nine Imax sites . Individual cinema averages were as follows : ? 31,353 in Imax 3D ; ? 16,340 in regular 3D ; and ? 1,705 in D. That tells its own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ record gross takings of ? 1bn in 2009 . <p> While all the broadcasters have been watching such trends closely , BSkyB is the only one to publicly commit to a channel launch . It is currently amassing enough 3D raw material to broadcast . The BBC says it is " exploring the possibilities in terms of multi-view capture and stereoscopic imaging " but says it is too early to say how popular 3D will be with audiences . The cinema and TV craze must be something of a surprise to computer games fans , who have been buying 3D games for years . <p> What 's the verdict in the film and TV industry ? <p> DreamWorks Animation chief executive Jeffrey Katzenberg has described 3D as " the greatest innovation in film since colour " while Intel CEO Paul Otellini told crowds at CES that , " I think that 3D ... is the next thing that 's poised to explode in the home . " Cupit , who is helping to develop the technology to be used to broadcast the Six Nations , says : " 3D creates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ image . I think it will become the new standard . As the technology sorts itself out it will become more prevalent . " <p> Ironically Cameron , who has necessarily been one of 3D 's most ardent standard bearers , recently merely issued a guarded approval of 3D TV technology . " As 3D starts to come into the living room , and come in at higher frame rates , then we 're gon na have to up our game again . ' Cause movies ca n't look worse than what you 're getting at home , " he told Variety magazine . <p> Does 3D annoy the cinema purists ? <p> According to the US film critic Roger Ebert , " Every single frame of a 3D movie gives us something to look at that is not necessary . " His main argument is that the more unbelievable shots of debris flying from the screen in 3D destroy the illusion that the viewer is a part of the action . <p> The British film critic Mark Kermode is also outspoken in disliking 3D , saying that " all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do with 3D ... unless you 're making a movie about sky-diving spear-chuckers there 's a limited use of 3D . " Kermode says that the 30 per cent colour loss involved with wearing 3D glasses during the film was not worth the 3D effect . " Avatar shows us exactly what stereoscopic cinema is capable of . And the answer is nothing . " <p> So where does 3D technology go from here ? <p> BSkyB has not confirmed an exact launch date for its 3D channel but says it plans to first launch its 3D service in pubs before marketing it to domestic users . Long-term developments are less clear . " It will probably be the technology that does n't require glasses coming through , " concludes Cupit . " It 's the latest in a long line of incremental steps . First it was black and white , then colour , then HD . Eventually we 'll have holographic images bursting out of your TV . But not so radical that you think it 's science fiction . " <p> Is 3D here to stay ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ British cinema audiences in a challenging economic climate <p> * Most major broadcasters and TV manufacturers are investing in 3D technology <p> * The number of films being made in 3D has doubled over the last year , and the trend is set to continue <p> No ... <p> * Prices of 3D TVs and cinema tickets continue to be more expensive <p> * While it might become the standard in cinemas and TVs , current stereoscopic technologies may soon become obsolete <p> * Historically , acceptance of 3D technology has risen and fallen ; the latest phase may be yet another fad

The other known MiFi device being touted around by many vendors is a basic Novatel offering , which is n't network specific and many resellers are selling the unit through expensive packages with a lesser data allowance than 3 is offering . <p> 3 's Huawei E5830 on first impressions does n't enthral .

The next button powers up the WiFi part of the unit , with the top button enabling a data connection to the 3 network . It is no more complicated than pressing three buttons to get up and running , and it 's really as simple as that . 3 has also preconfigured the unit with an SSID and WiFi key , taking the headache away from setting up the E5830 . These can all be changed from the admin software that installs when the unit is connected to a PC from a USB @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> There are four LEDs on the display , with the first one on the top left showing the SIM card 's signal strength . Although the light is in a bar chart format it 's actually the colour changes that highlight how good the signal is .

The bottom left LED can impart information on the connection obtained , where a dark blue LED shows it 's connected to the 3 network and a light blue colour highlights if the unit is using HSDPA . <p> On the top right of the screen is an LED that turns green if the MiFi unit is fully charged , yellow if half charged and red if the device needs charging .

There are however some minor intelligent aspects to the device , from the screen powering down after 10 seconds to the press of a button awakening the display once again . Also the WiFi is automatically disconnected after 10 minutes of inactivity , but it 's not intelligent enough to completely power down the Huawei E5830 if not in use . <p> Besides containing a 1500 mAh battery for powering the device , the unit can also be powered from a computer via a miniUSB cable . This is ideal if there is n't any juice left in the E5830 , as for all intents and purposes the device can almost double up as a 3G dongle for the laptop while still providing WiFi access to other devices . There is a slight trade off here in terms of powering the unit . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ microUSB power adaptor while connected to WiFi and the data network , since only when the unit is powered down and disconnected can it be recharged . <p> WiFi connections over a great distance were n't the best for the Huawei device . Do n't expect the MiFi unit to mirror the reach of a home or office wireless router . At half a metre distance the connection dropped on our Asus Windows XP netbook from an ' Excellent ' 54Mbps connection to ' Very Good ' 48Mbps . On the 1.5m mark the signal dropped even further to just ' Good ' 36Mbps , at the 2m point a ' Low ' 24Mbps signal was obtained , and at 3m only a ' Very Low ' 18Mbps was seen . This is fine for a small location , but if any more distance is required the Huawei E5830 fails dramatically . <p> In testing the MiFi unit we saw some good connection speeds and activity over the 3 network , and over several different locations the connections were decent and reliable .

All of which is fairly acceptable , albeit not reaching the maximum figure of HSDPA 's 7.2Mbps and 5.76Mbps for HSUPA . <p> The 3 network claims the Huawei E5830 is capable of five hours of battery life , where our tests proved differently although not exactly in regular usage . Over an HSDPA connection the MiFi device only lasted for three hours of continuous use after a full charge , where it was downloading an extremely large file in the test . Although this mobile broadband device is not really geared up for this type of punishment , it is conceivable that a much longer battery life would be obtainable from just regular surfing rather than the edges to which we pushed the E5830 . <p> In ShortMiFi offers the ability for multiple users or multiple devices to connect to mobile broadband at HSDPA speeds on a portable WiFi unit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even simpler is operating the device , which is just a matter of pressing three buttons on the E5830 and you 're connected . Compared to having a 3G dongle hanging out the side of your laptop it is a blessing , as the Huawei MiFi product is discreet enough to be in a pocket where it also contains its own power supply . There were some niggling issues over WiFi distances , but it is n't a home WiFi router and it should n't be expected to perform like one .

This week : flying the flag on the red carpet ; nifty knitwear ; a warning for fashion students ; fur 's new takers . <p> BY Sarah Mower 20 January 2010 <p> Go British : ( left and right ) Roksanda Ilincic 's modern , elegant column gown and Christopher Kane 's chiffon beaded dress would be savvy choices during the awards season for British actresses like Carey Mulligan ( centre , in Nina Ricci at the Golden Globes ) . <h> Related articles <p> Looking at the results of the Golden Globes from the fashion angle , it struck me that British acting and design talent could be scoring far more joint wins . Why , for instance , was Carey Mulligan wearing Nina Ricci and Emily Blunt , Dolce &amp; Gabbana , when they might choose from brilliant London designers and come off looking original ? There , too , was Helen Mirren , looking impeccable in Armani Priv ? , but she might have looked just as fantastic in something by Antony Price , who knows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in fact , turned out far more pro-English on the night : Maggie Gyllenhaal in delicate-yet-edgy R ? M by Roland Mouret ; Anna Paquin in gold-paillette Stella McCartney ; and Cameron Diaz in fiery-red satin Alexander McQueen . Burberry also cleaned up with numerous actors ' tuxedos . <p> There 's no rule that British actresses should figuratively wrap themselves in the Union flag when they step on the red carpet , but it seems to me that , along with our designers , they are missing a trick . <p> There 's good news on the horizon , though . Lucy Yeomans , editor of Harper 's Bazaar , and chair of the British Fashion Council 's press committee , a savvy journalist who moves in both the fashion and film worlds , is stepping forward to connect the two . The Baftas fall during London Fashion Week next month . Until this year , it has always been as if the two events are oblivious to one another , but , on February 19 , Yeomans has asked Kate Winslet and Lanc ? me , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ event at which British designers will mingle with actresses , talk frocks and - let 's hope - dress nominees . I 'm already playing fantasy fashion , thinking which dresses from the London shows could get a twirl . My favourites in the modern-elegance department are Jonathan Saunders 's and Roksanda Ilincic 's columns , and in the avant-garde sector , Christopher Kane 's pastel beaded pieces and Erdem 's lace-embroidered frock - perfect for the rising teen actors , who are burgeoning everywhere . <p> Knit news <p> It 's always nice to be proved right when predicting a long-playing micro-trend guaranteed to make all ages happy . If you were reading this column the Christmas before last , you may remember a rave over how great Markus Lupfer 's sequin motif jumpers were , for everyone . Glad to say , his popularity shows no sign of abating , to the point that Lupfer 's planning a presentation at London Fashion Week . <p> Meanwhile , he has triggered a whole trend on the high street . Topshop and Oasis have the best : jumpers with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and shoes picked out in jacquard or sequins . Cheerful , inexpensive and cosy , they 're ideal for this dank , freezing January . I love Lupfer 's collector 's trophy , the scent-bottle jumper , best , though , even if it is ? 235 . <p> Students beware <p> Last week , I met three students , who were shocked by the standard of the fashion degree courses they had been thrilled to be accepted on . Two had arrived to find 80 students in their classes and that staff at the university , formerly one of the best of its kind , were bailing out . One , who had prepared herself to come to England , fabled land of excellent fashion education , by completing a foundation degree at home , returned to Denmark , after being horrified by the size of the class . She had been told to get on with work on her own for two terms , while the others were introduced to the concept of a dart . <p> In light of that , it rings hollow to me that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ social inclusion of students , so that Britain can compete internationally . <p> Historically , the teaching of fashion did compete , to the point that we 've been undisputed world-leader , producing a steady parade of talent since John Galliano graduated in 1984 . Since Labour arrived in government , though , the uncomfortable evidence is that quality has been on the slide . <p> It seems to me that the converging effects of two deleterious policies have done it . One was the avaricious idea that fashion schools should fund themselves by becoming commercial sellers of education . For the past decade , I 've been aware that universities have been sending recruiters out to sell courses to all and sundry who can afford the astronomical fees in foreign countries . Simultaneously , they have been relaxing the strict limits on class numbers , which used to contribute to the excellent intensity of teaching our best schools used to achieve . In tandem with that , the abolition of the grant system for British students has gradually conspired to create the skewed class situation for which the Government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it getting worse , as talented youngsters from poorer backgrounds conclude it 's just too expensive to study . <p> I sympathise with dedicated teachers , and I feel terrible for students who take a wrong turn and end up wasting their money and precious years on a disappointing , crowded degree course , where they hardly see a tutor and have to fight to get near sewing machines . That said , there are still some courses which are much better than others , and , generally , the standards of Masters courses are still something to be proud of . But if I were a parent of a child with a passion to design , I would be careful this year to visit prospective colleges and ruthlessly interrogate staff to compare numbers , dropout rates , the quality of visiting designer-practitioners , internships and how many go on to MA courses , before committing . <p> Facing fur facts <p> One thing I learnt when I was in Copenhagen last week was that the future is looking up for mink farmers . Kopenhagen Fur , the biggest auctioneers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buying 70 per cent of their wares - a proportion built up from nothing over the past five years .

However after a disaster the top priority is to look after the living . Fears of dead bodies fuelling a health crisis can be propagated by the media , spreading the myth that there is an urgent need to bury the dead . <p> The reality is far from this . Dead bodies do not cause epidemics after natural disasters because people the cause of death is injury , drowning or fire . Almost all diseases that people may carry while alive die within two days of their death .

Even though livelihoods and homes have been rebuilt across Asia , the deep emotional scars still remain as families travel to the site of mass graves of unidentified bodies , wondering if their loved ones are among the tens of thousands buried there . Those wounds will never heal . <p> The situation in Haiti is dire and there is obvious distress about the accumulating piles of dead bodies across the county and particularly in the capital , Port-au-Prince . The reality is that lack of clean water and poor sanitation amongst the living pose a much greater risk of disease than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and smell of dead bodies can be distressing , the Red Cross recommends moving all unidentified bodies to specially designated body collection areas once resources become available . Given the lack of storage space in a city that has been levelled to the ground , the temporary burial of bodies in shallow graves can be an option , preferably identifying them beforehand . <p> Last Tuesday 's earthquake has left tens of thousands of Haitians homeless and desperate , adding to Haiti 's long history of humanitarian crises . No one has been left untouched . It makes sense to ease the psychological pain of the survivors by identifying the dead even if this means taking longer to bury the bodies . This is part of the imperative of giving priority to the needs of the living and making a small step on the long road towards the physical and emotional sustainable recovery of a traumatised population .

What I would say is that , while there must still be larger-than-life characters in the game , the top clubs enforce a PR exclusion zone around their players . Journalists do n't enjoy the same access to players they once did and players are gagged by over-protective communications departments .

They 're not . Social networking sites do , however , provide a relatively unregulated channel through which footballers can communicate with supporters .

Clothing factories set up by American and Japanese companies to take advantage of cheap Mexican labour provided employment for many women , who are prized above men for their skills at the sewing machine . <p> But with the jobs at the factories ( known as maquiladoras ) came a modest income , allowing workers to upset the traditional dependence on men . " Women are occupying the space of men in a culture of absolute dominance of men over women , " Esther Ch ? vez observed . <p> When the bodies of women and girls ( some not yet in their teens ) began turning up , abused and discarded , in the desert , the gender-specific nature of the crimes -- even in an area known for its violence -- appeared clear . They became known as los feminicidios , the victims of what are sometimes called " femicides " . <p> Esther Ch ? vez was born on June 2 1933 in Chihuahua , the capital city of the Mexican state of the same name .

@@1362235 <h> Boeing 747 gets an efficiency makeover <p> More than 40 years ago , Boeing introduced the world to the first jumbo jet , the 747 . Today the company is giving the legendary airliner a makeover that could extend its life another 40 years . The new 747-8 features efficient new engines and an all-new wing designed to reduce drag and improve performance for the iconic jumbo jet . <p> With its trademark hump behind the cockpit , the new 747-8 may look like just another 747 . But in addition to the new engines and swept wings , the new aeroplane is stretched more than 18 feet , increasing the volume by 16 percent . Boeing hopes the extra size -- and most importantly , extra efficiency -- will attract customers away from the competing Airbus A380 . But with a first flight still ahead of them , Boeing has some catching up to do . <p> The last few months have been quite busy at the American Boeing factory . After many delays , there was lots of pent up excitement for the first flight of the all-new , composite 787 Dreamliner last month . Outside the aerospace industry , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first flight scheduled to take place sometime in the first quarter of this year . But when the new 747-8 lifts off the same runway at Paine Field north of Seattle where the 787 first flew , it will be carrying on the torch of perhaps the most legendary airliner ever built . <p> The 747 made its very first flight from Paine Field as well in February of 1969 . The aeroplane ushered in the jumbo era with its multiple aisles , spiral staircase to the second deck and even a piano bar to entertain passengers . Today the prototype 747 that made that first flight sits at the Museum of Flight on Boeing Field in Seattle , where the 787 is based during flight testing . As for the original piano , it did n't last long . <p> Today 's airlines care about one thing , according to aviation analyst Richard Aboulafia of the Teal Group : " It 's not about the piano bar in the upper deck , it 's about the lowest dollar cost per seat , per mile . " <p> In an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offer the maximum number of routes for the airlines , Boeing opted not to challenge the Airbus A380 directly with a new super jumbo . Instead , the company opted for the smaller , point-to-point efficiency with the 787 Dreamliner . But the company did n't want to give away the jumbo jet crown without a fight . <p> So instead of developing an all-new aeroplane to compete in the relatively small jumbo jet market , the company decided to give the iconic 747 a makeover . The new 747-8 is a stretched version of the most recent 747 model , the -400 . The extra space can accommodate 51 more seats than the -400 . Though even with the new room , the new Boeing aeroplane still wo n't be able to carry as many passengers as the A380 . <p> But Boeing claims that does n't matter . With low cost being the deciding factor today , Boeing says the new 747-8 Intercontinental will consume 11 percent less fuel per passenger on a flight , making it a greener aircraft . The company says this fuel saving translates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seat mile . <p> Airbus disputes Boeing 's claims . The European plane maker says the A380 burns two percent less fuel per seat than the 747-8 . The company also says the A380 gives airlines options not offered by Boeing because of the sheer number of passengers it can carry . A common three-class arrangement shows the A380 carrying 550 passengers , and the 747-8 carrying 450 . Airbus points out if you need to carry that many people , the A380 is the only option . <p> Analyst Aboulafia says that as of now , the A380 does indeed offer the most seats for the dollar . But the Airbus plane has some drawbacks . First off , the jumbo passenger market is n't that big . These days flying cargo is a big part of the jumbo jet market . And Airbus abandoned the cargo version of the A380 after the double-decker design did n't attract many customers . <p> With the A380 still receiving big subsidies from the European nations involved in building the aeroplane , Aboulafia says Boeing will have a hard time competing for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 747-8 would be great if it were n't for the heavily discounted A380 , " he says . " As long as the A380 is offering the lowest dollar per seat ever , the -8 is a hard sale . " <p> Not surprisingly then , Boeing is focusing the new 747-8 directly at the cargo market , and the launch customer Cargolux wo n't be touting luxury seating or in-flight entertainment . <p> For more than 30 years , Boeing proudly wore the crown of making the largest airliner in the world . Today Airbus wears the same crown with equal pride . But Aboulafia says in today 's marketplace , crowns just do n't mean as much as they once did . <p> " Successful businesses care less about icons these days . It 's something new that the market needs rather than an iconic status . " <p> So the A380 will remain the king of the jumbos for the foreseeable future . It will be the biggest airliner , carrying the most passengers of any aeroplane in the world .

@@1366238 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Base Metals Stockpiles <p> Ever since its secular bull kicked off in 2003 , the once-boring base-metals sector took on an aura of excitement . What trader was n't excited when copper , zinc , nickel , lead , and aluminum put together respective gains of 475% , 523% , 650% , 829% , and 163% from their 2003 lows to their interim bull-market highs ? <p> A structural shift in base metals ' core fundamentals sent prices skyrocketing , as supply simply was n't able to keep up with fast-growing demand . The age of consumption extended well beyond the Western economies that normally drove commodities prices , and an Asian monster was aggressively feeding its voracious appetite for the metals . A new group of developing economies had finally joined the modern era , initiating colossal infrastructure buildouts . <p> But as is apparent today , base metals prices were rising too far , too fast . And as any knowledgeable trader understands , such a blistering pace is unsustainable . Either supply would catch up to demand , demand would soften , or crazy-high prices would enable a convergence of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that are fundamentally justified . Base metals prices coming off their lofty highs would n't damage the integrity of their secular bulls , but instead bring order to a bit of speculative excess . <p> And prices did come off their highs . Zinc saw its high in 2006 , nickel and lead in 2007 , and copper and aluminum in 2008 . Whether consolidation or correction , base metals prices retreated in search of that balance . But thanks to the global economic crisis , downward-moving base metals prices were pushed to the other extreme . As with all assets at the time , they careened into the depths of despair . <p> Many traders that have tried to game the base metals markets have gotten crushed on both the upside and downside over the last several years . It really has been challenging to find that balance for these wild and wacky base metals . And it seemed like no chart , tool , or model could predict what they were going to do next . <p> But there has been one tool that has been helpful to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had great success navigating the base metals markets thanks to its unique presentation of fundamental attributes . Technicals alone can only get traders so far , which is why it is always important to stay abreast of what 's happening on the fundamental scene . <p> The London Metal Exchange ( LME ) , the world 's premier non-ferrous metals exchange , is host to this excellent fundamental data . In addition to being the most reliable source for prices , futures , and options , the LME operates a warehousing and delivery system . It manages over 500 approved warehouses around the world to physically store the base metals . And it is the tracking of this storage , or stockpiles , that feeds us our data . <p> The LME calls this network of warehouses a market of " last resort " since physical delivery is a very small percentage of its metals trading activity . As described by the LME , its warehouses are utilized to deliver excess stock to in times of oversupply , and as a source of material in times of extreme shortage . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vital role in creating price convergence . <p> With these stockpile levels updated on a daily basis , traders can integrate the data with daily price activity , plot it on charts , and come away with a hybrid fundamental and technical trading tool . And the resulting charts have been very useful in assisting with trading decisions . <p> This price convergence acknowledged by the LME really plays off the notions of surplus and scarcity . If stockpiles are rising , it can be implied that supply is outpacing demand . And if such a trend persists , it is natural that a recognized surplus will lead to lower prices . Inversely , if stockpiles are declining it can be implied that supply is falling short of meeting demand . If this trend persists then prices should naturally rise as more capital is chasing after scarcer goods . <p> Over the last 4 years I 've chronicled this LME stockpile and price relationship in a series of essays that have analyzed the 5 primary base metals . And this normally reliable tool has been consistent in its reads . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spawned by the bond and stock panics have really thrown base metals traders off balance . As you can see in these updated charts , a fundamental disconnect is glaringly apparent . <p> Copper , the most mainstream of the base metals , paints a beautiful picture of what the inverse relationship between LME stockpiles and prices can look like . Over the first 3 years of this chart we can see prices rise and fall based on the tides of LME stockpile levels . <p> Copper 's meteoric rise in 2006 was a result of rapidly dwindling stockpiles , as demand was well-outpacing what the refiners were able to bring to market . With most mine and scrap supply gobbled up via direct channels , consumers were forced to tap the world 's aboveground inventories to meet their needs . <p> As recent as 2002 LME copper stockpiles were at 1m metric tons , but rounding the corner into 2005 they had gotten as low as about 50k metric tons . Considering this is the equivalent of only about one day of daily global usage , the markets reacted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go but up . And up they went ! With such alarmingly-low stockpile levels a huge speculative risk premium was placed on copper 's price . <p> LME copper stockpiles slowly built off their 2004/2005 lows , but for years they levitated in the 100k- to 200k-metric-ton range . At these low levels the risk premium was still affixed to copper 's price . As you can see each time LME stockpiles retreated to support , prices would pop into the upper $3 neighborhood . <p> Considering that copper had never even seen $2 prior to this bull , these new high prices were exceptional . But with a low-inventory reality , this was the balance where traders were comfortable , and thus what buyers had to pay . It would be interesting to see where prices balanced once the supply/demand gap tightened . And when copper stockpiles commenced a build in the second half of 2008 , we would begin to get a feel for this new balance . <p> As stockpiles headed towards resistance copper 's risk premium was quick to fade . And the subsequent correction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $3 . But just as LME stockpile levels were stabilizing at resistance leading into October 2008 , the **30;178;TOOLONG stock panic took the driver 's seat . Copper , along with all commodities , entered into a death-defying downward spiral . <p> This major crisis , that at the time many thought was the beginning of a neo-Great Depression , froze copper consumption . And this was immediately reflected via rising LME stockpile levels . Copper stockpiles soared at a rapid pace , rising over 400% from 2008 's low to the panic high . And by the time all was said and done , its price had shed 69% off its 2008 high . <p> Copper was of course violently oversold , and its price recovery commenced in early 2009 even before LME stockpile levels turned the corner . This pre-stockpile-shift recovery was generally accepted by the markets since copper was at 2004 prices . But interestingly , can you guess when copper stockpiles were last above 300k metric tons ? Yep , 2004 . <p> By March LME stockpiles began a steady fall off the panic highs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But this renewed inverse relationship we 've come to know was short-lived , as in July LME stockpiles took an about-face and commenced another sharp build . If this longstanding relationship held true the price of copper would have at least taken a break to consolidate , and given the sharp rise in stockpile levels it should have retreated . <p> Instead the price of copper kept on rising , and has risen ever since . Since July copper stockpiles have more than doubled and are nearly back to panic levels . And provocatively , the price of copper has soared by 59% over this same period of time . This is a huge fundamental disconnect from the precedent set forth in this coherent relationship . How could the price of copper be back to pre-panic levels with LME stockpiles at panic levels ? Has this conundrum thrown a wrench into this once-reliable metric ? <p> This development has indeed added a number of question marks to say the least . And this is no small disconnect on the duration front , now running 7 months . With LME @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that copper is exhibiting interim fundamental weakness and is extremely overbought . But with prices hardly exhibiting weakness , are we seeing a strategic shift in the balance of these markets ? <p> Let 's now take copper out of isolation and see if the other major base metals subscribe to this same trend . And looking at zinc , so far they 're on the same page . Like copper , zinc 's bull gained momentum as rapidly falling stockpiles exposed a structural supply deficit . <p> Zinc 's inverse relationship with LME stockpiles is n't as visually-compelling as copper 's , but it was a strong force in the early going . From 2004 levels around 800k metric tons , LME zinc stockpiles plunged by over 90% in a virtual freefall before finally stabilizing in 2007 . This of course sent zinc prices through the roof . In 2006 zinc blasted through $1 and then $2 for the first time ever . <p> With the equivalent of only about 3 days worth of global zinc usage , futures traders affixed a huge risk premium to its price . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a classic head-and-shoulders pattern and entered into a vicious downtrend that did n't end until the panic had its way with this metal . And like copper , LME zinc stockpiles mounted a rapid build during this panic period . <p> After the panic high , LME stockpiles retreated for a few months while at the same time zinc 's price commenced a recovery . The inverse relationship was on . But this stockpile retreat was short-lived as warehoused inventories again mounted a build . And this build has taken LME zinc stockpiles well past levels seen at the panic peak . <p> How did zinc prices respond ? Like copper they continued to rise right along with stockpile levels . Now zinc was so oversold , down 77% from its 2006 high , that it did deserve a little wiggle room in its recovery path . But an 80% gain during a span where stockpiles rose 56% is again a major disconnect . The last time LME zinc stockpiles were at 500k metric tons , the price of zinc was well less than what it is today . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ zinc , except on steroids . From its 2006 high LME nickel stockpiles fell by over 90% in quick fashion . The result of this pilfering was the equivalent of only about one day worth of global usage . And staying at the 5k-metric-ton level for nearly a year allowed futures traders to have a field day with nickel 's price . <p> Nickel 's huge risk premium took it past $10 and then $20 for the first time ever . And when LME stockpiles finally commenced a build in 2007 , much of this premium was quick to come off . The price of nickel stabilized rounding the corner into 2008 as stockpiles settled around the 50k-metric-ton level . But nickel got sucked into the global commodities correction as 2008 progressed , and its price started to fade even before the stockpiles started to build in the second half of the year . <p> By the time selling was exhausted , nickel had fallen by a staggering 84% . Like the other base metals LME nickel stockpiles were way up over the course of the panic , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stockpile levels stabilizing at this point nickel commenced its recovery , and by August its price had more than doubled . But at this same time in August LME stockpiles changed direction and again mounted a rapid build . But unlike copper and zinc , nickel would heed the call of this fundamental shift . <p> Nickel traders played the inverse relationship to form and started selling the metal . While the prices of the other base metals continued to rise in parallel with their ongoing stockpile builds , nickel took a different course over the last 5 or so months . As you can see a downtrend has been carved and prices have retreated down to the $8 level . <p> Interestingly this activity should not be all that surprising given nickel 's stockpile history . LME nickel stockpiles are currently more than double the previous high point since 1998 , when the LME started logging daily data . This big nickel oversupply has righteously suppressed its price . <p> Lead took a bit of a different path in the beginning of its bull . And this path was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an initial sharp fall from 2002 highs near 200k metric tons , sending its price from bear-market lows of $0.20 to more than a double . But in 2005 and early 2006 when the stockpiles for the other base metals were still falling or flat-lining at lows , lead stockpiles mounted a build . <p> As you can see this move higher to about 120k metric tons gave futures traders little reason to boost lead 's price , and it actually fell in the first half of 2006 . But with global average daily usage of about 22k metric tons , even this 120k level ( 5 days worth ) was on shaky ground . And when stockpiles started to fall in the second half of 2006 , that low-stockpile risk premium shot lead 's price way higher . <p> With LME stockpiles falling dangerously low to only a day or two 's worth of usage , and staying there for over a year , lead shattered its all-time highs and climbed well above the $1 mark . Lead stockpiles eventually gained ground in Q2 2008 , thus leading to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stockpile move higher , an uncharacteristic drop in the second half of 2008 occurred . And instead of lead responding with rising prices , it continued to fall into the panic . Lead traders ignored the fundamentals and joined the global selloff . <p> Eventually lead stockpiles turned higher to follow the rest of the herd , and in 2009 they more than tripled . And what happened with lead 's price is the same old story . A persistent rally defied logic and displayed yet another major disconnect from fundamentals . Even though LME lead stockpiles are at their highest levels since early 2003 , traders are unwilling to sell the metal and have been propping up its price as though stockpile levels were much lower . <p> Aluminum 's story is similar to that of the other base metals . Historically-low stockpile levels led to higher prices . But for a variety of reasons these levels never got as low as the others , which is why aluminum 's gains were not as substantial . One reason for this is aluminum is not as scarce as the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more robust than all the rest . <p> At the beginning of aluminum 's bull its LME stockpiles got down to only about 3 to 4 days worth of global usage , which boosted its prices above the $1 level . But when these stockpiles started to mount a material build in the second half of 2008 , aluminum 's price was doomed . Aluminum consumption fell so fast into and after the panic that the producers could n't throttle back supply fast enough . <p> This stockpile build had been incredibly sharp , hardly taking a breather until the second half of 2009 . LME warehouses are now teeming with aluminum , at record levels . And how did prices respond ? With a rally that has completely ignored fundamentals . Since aluminum bottomed in February 2009 , it had a well-deserved initial recovery off its oversold lows . But it kept on going , rising 85% . Over this same exact span LME aluminum stockpiles rose 46% , again a major disconnect . <p> So how are we supposed to read these fundamental disconnects ? There is no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very material rises indicate that there is an oversupply , however temporary it may be , and that consumers should not have a problem going to the market to buy base metals . Are we to just assume that these base metals are wildly overbought and all due for sharp corrections once the interim fundamental picture becomes clear to traders ? Perhaps , but perhaps not . <p> One valid argument for a delay in corrections is that fundamentals are still out the door thanks to the stock panic . With everything so oversold as a result of the first stock panic in over 100 years , everything seems to be recovering in lockstep with the world 's premier stock index . My business partner Adam Hamilton wrote an essay earlier this month that included a copper price chart overlaying the S&amp;P 500 . It is quite stunning to see the correlation , I encourage you to check it out ! <p> We must also consider that these prices may be factoring in future supply deficits and thus lower stockpile levels . The global credit crisis has seriously hampered the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the lion 's share of supply , and they need to continually renew reserves and build new mines to grow production and replace depleted deposits . But the lack of credit has shut down a lot of development projects and throttled back exploration efforts . This will likely lead to future supply constraints . <p> Yet another factor to consider is that base metals are still priced in US dollars . Today 's nominal prices are n't actually as high as they seem if the true value of today 's dollar is taken into account . With the money supply continuing to grow at a staggering pace , adjusting for inflation would show a much lower real value for these metals . And if I was running a country that was stuck with a lot of US dollars , I 'd certainly diversify some of them into say copper or aluminum rather than keep everything in a currency that is in the midst of a secular bear . Perhaps foreign investment , diversification , and dollar hedging will play a bigger role on the consumption front from here . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what we are seeing with LME stockpile levels it is painfully obvious that base metals prices have disconnected from fundamentals . While a new balance may be developing , I still believe there is a higher probability for a correction than not . Current copper , zinc , nickel , lead , and aluminum prices are still 367% , 211% , 154% , 406% , and 75% above their respective 2003 lows . Even a decent-sized correction from these levels will not challenge the integrity of their secular bulls . <p> But whether a correction , consolidation , or ongoing upward momentum , base metals prices will in all likelihood continue to move higher over the long term . And the best way for investors to leverage these gains is by owning the mining companies that bring these metals to market . There are a number of quality miners that are making money hand-over-fist at today 's prices , can still do so at lower prices , and are well-positioned for future growth . There is also an elite group of junior explorers that are finding and developing the deposits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> If you are interested in base metals stocks but do n't want to go through the hassles of painstaking fundamental research , at Zeal we can make the job easier for you . We do all the research , sifting through hundreds of stocks , and publish reports that profile the best-of-the-best in a given sector .

LME stockpile fluctuations occur on a near-real-time basis , which gives us measurable and meaningful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the LME 's intent on creating price convergence has played out rather well . <p> But since the panic a fundamental disconnect has disrupted the balance of the base metals markets . Prices are rising even though stockpiles are building at a torrid pace . Normally stockpile builds put selling pressure on the base metals , but this has n't been the case of recent . Is there a new balance being created in this post-panic economy , or is there an imminent correction right around the corner ? Either way investors need to be ready to buy the miners when opportunities arise . This secular bull has yet to run its course . <p> By Scott Wright <p> So how can you profit from this information ?

@@1366240 <h> I have always admired Sarah Brown , but is she making herself look a Twit with such dubious friends ? <p> You might not be able to judge a book by its cover , but you can certainly judge a person by their friends . That 's why Sarah Brown 's motley crew of new best pals poses such a puzzle . <p> How is it that this hugely impressive woman , renowned for her good sense , quick wit , sharp intelligence and a genuinely altruistic commitment to doing good work through her charities , has resorted to hanging around with nitwits such as Naomi Campbell and Cheryl Cole ? <p> Hand-in-hand : Sarah Brown and her new best friend Naomi Campbell at the launch of a fashion show for Haiti last week <p> Sarah and Naomi embrace at the fashion event <p> What has happened to our serious , sensible Sarah that she spends her evenings Twittering away like a love-struck schoolgirl , gushing over the B-list celebrities she meets . <h> Share this article <p> Share <p> Being friends with author JK Rowling , as Mrs Brown has for many years , is life-enhancing ; being Dannii Minogue 's mate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came home from the National TV Awards and downloaded a picture of herself arminarm with the X Factor judges Cheryl and Dannii . The caption on her Twitter site read : ' LOVE Cheryl and Dannii . ' <p> Mrs Brown is a keen Twitterer and keeps her 1.1million followers up to date with her daily life through the social networking site <p> ' Love ' a couple of sweet but dimwitted judges on a reality TV talent show , hosted by Simon Cowell no less . Let 's not be po-faced , but it 's not very edifying , is it ? <p> And what of the picture of Naomi Campbell - she of the flung mobile phone - and Sarah Brown this week , promoting a catwalk show in aid of Haiti earthquake victims , walking down a London street , hands clasped together in sisterly solidarity ? Was it really necessary ? <p> I ca n't be the only one feeling queasy at our Prime Minister 's wife holding hands with a former cocaine user with a string of convictions for assault . <p> Even the law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threw a jewel-encrusted mobile phone at her housekeeper claimed she was a danger to everyone around her . Some role model . <p> What 's so fascinating is that for the first 18 months of her life in Number 10 , Mrs Brown remained resolutely in the background , a hugely refreshing antidote to the very public antics of Cherie Blair . <p> Mrs Brown poses with the Sugababes and radio host Lauren Laverne at the Fight Cervical Cancer in Style earlier this week <p> But in the past year or so , Sarah has raised her profile dramatically , not only in terms of the admirable charity work she does - both with the British fashion industry and in support of women 's health worldwide - but also in the number of outings with her celebrity chums , who include the likes of those cartoon characters Paris Hilton and Piers Morgan . <p> So is all this an act of wifely devotion to try to make her awkward and morose husband seem attractive to younger voters because his wife is Twittering away and befriending celebs ? Is it the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the likely event Gordon loses the next General Election ? <p> Or could it be - whisper it - that she has come to enjoy the trappings of the showbiz world rather more than is dignified ? For if her new best friends are anything to go by , Mrs Brown seems to have a split personality these days . <p> The Twittering Sarah is unrecognisable from the passionate , principled , articulate Sarah who stood up at the Labour conference two years in a row to speak up for the beleaguered man she married . <p> The first time I met Sarah Macaulay , as she was then , was back in the early 1990s when she was dating Gordon Brown but still waiting for him to pop the question . <p> She strode into a room full of politicians and journalists - serious movers and shakers - sporting shoulder pads straight out of Dallas , killer heels and an Italian scarf draped seductively around her shoulders . Boy , could she make an entrance ! <p> She and her school friend Julia set up the ethical PR company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right- on politically correct causes . The couple were the epitome of glamorous , successful , power-dressing career women . <p> For those who knew her then , the Sarah Brown we now see holding hands with Naomi Campbell is mystifying . <p> Not only do these two share many charity events , Sarah even nominated Naomi as her 21st-century heroine in a magazine poll . Heroine ! The Sarah of old would n't have given such a creature house room . <p> On the one hand , Mrs Brown is close to Michelle Obama , a powerful , intelligent and serious lawyer . On the other , she likes to hobnob with Big Brother 's Davina McCall . One minute she 's doing charity work with Queen Rania of Jordan , the next she 's enamoured with Paris Hilton . <p> And then there 's her Twitter site . At Christmas , Sarah Tweeted that she had wrapped all her presents in newspaper , doing her bit to save the world . <p> More recently she confided to her 1.1million followers on the website : ' Actually had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ haircut , a Pilates class and a walk in the superfresh air . ' <p> Sarah poses with The X Factor judges Dannii Minogue and Cheryl Cole in a picture posted on her Twitter account <p> Me-wise ! And : ' Great to see Bill Gates arrive on Twitter to such a warm welcome - he will find good people here who care about others around the world . ' <p> Oh dear , she sounds like a hand-wringing politics student - and yet this is a sophisticated woman with a successful business behind her and a 2:1 degree in psychology from Bristol University . <p> The role of a Prime Minister 's wife is both extraordinarily arduous and almost impossible to define - so we should allow Sarah a little escapism . She is a wonderful mother . <p> But you 'd think that those two young sons , a stressed husband to look after and a public life to lead would occupy her every waking moment . <p> Yes , that eclectic group of friends could be attributed to the endless charity and political events she 's expected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her tenure as unofficial First Lady , there 's also that nagging feeling that she has come to relish the celebrity opportunities her role affords just a mite too much . <p> It 's good to see Sarah has kept up with her old friends , such as the charity fundraiser Dame Gail Ronson , the campaigner against forced marriage Jasvinder Sanghera and Gail Rebuck , wife of Labour 's focus group king Philip Gould . <p> But she can well do without the Stephen Frys , Dannii Minogues and Davina McCalls of this world . <p> And as for Naomi Campbell ? What a gift to the Browns ' enemies , who will ask : ' Who needs a brooding , bad-tempered mobile phone-throwing best friend when she 's got Gordon at home ? ' 
@@1371230 <h> Six Nations 2010 : Massimo Giovanelli looks back on 10 years of Italian rugby <h> It is 10 years almost to the day since Massimo Giovanelli , one of the true warriors of Italian rugby , lifted Alessandro Troncon on his shoulders and led a lap of honour around the Flaminio Stadium after his side had beaten defending champions Scotland on their Six Nations debut . <p> Reflections : Massimo Giovanelli remembers his crowning moment when Italy beat Scotland in a match which also ended his careerPhoto : ALLSPORT <p> Giovanelli was hurting badly , although the tears he shed were still of joy . The former Italian captain knew already that an eye injury incurred during the heat of battle was very serious and that his short but gloriousSix Nations career was over . Now it pains him to admit thatItaly have not advanced beyond that extraordinary opening-day victory over the Scots , 34-20 , on Feb 5 , 2000 . <p> " It is a very elite level and perhaps we have n't done as badly as some think , " he muses unconvincingly . " I read it took France nearly 50 years to win a championship . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past 10 years . Firstly , it is not acceptable to have six coaches in just over 10 years . That can never work . We needed to pick our man and stay with him so he can bring his vision to the team and a group of players could grow with him . We now have a coach of world standing in Nick Mallett and hopefully he and the federation are thinking in the long term . <p> " Secondly , for whatever reason -- probably because we were a small rugby nation with no voice -- we lost out on the ' politics of the Heineken Cup ' . Big rugby nations like Ireland , Wales and Scotland -- with much stronger club systems than Italy back in the 1990s -- were allowed to switch to provinces , yet no concession was made for Italy . That was not fair . <p> " The two Italian teams in the Heineken Cup should be two regional sides so we can concentrate all our best home-based players . It would have an immediate impact and is even more important now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned down . " <h> Related Articles <p> " There are other issues . At national level we do not lack funding but I would question if we are spending wisely . Clearly our biggest need is to find a new Diego Dominguez , a match controller and goal-kicker . To do that we must bring the very best specialist coaches in that position to coach all the way down the ladder in Italian rugby . We need more return for our investment . <p> " I am a proud Italian from the north , where our rugby is good , but our Six Nations game must always stay in the south , in Rome . We must spend our money developing Flaminio . All the other nations play in their capital and we must stay in Rome . It is a beautiful setting and visiting fans love the ambience . It is something very good that Italy has been able to add to the tournament . <p> " Also I believe the south of Italy is the great untapped area for rugby , we can attract many more good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a presence . " <p> Giovanelli , who won 60 caps , 37 as captain , offers his advice only when pressed , he is not an agitator in the background . Having graduated as an architect in 2007 -- in the same class as long-time Italy colleague Paolo Vaccari -- he spends every working hour building up his business in Parma , specialising in eco friendly and renewable housing . <p> In rugby circles his energies are concentrated on trying to restore the struggling Milan club to former glories . <p> But the memories of that day against Scotland linger and , when finally unleashed , arrive in torrents : " It was the most beautiful rugby day of my life . I felt like the captain of a great sailship who had spent his life navigating rough seas and surviving the tempests and feeling perhaps everybody has forgotten him .

He was with us that day . <p> " I spent my rugby life trying to help Italy into the championship . We were strong -- we had beaten France and everybody in Europe except for England -- but we were an ageing team on our last legs .

To ease yourself in , read our stripped-down catch-up ... <p> Season 1 In September 2004 , a passenger plane crash-lands on an uncharted tropical island in the South Pacific . As fate would have it , an overwhelming majority of the survivors are fabulously telegenic , in particular Jack ( Matthew Fox ) , Kate ( Evangeline Lilly ) and Sawyer ( Josh Holloway ) .

It 's the entrance to an underground computer lab , manned only by Desmond ( Henry Ian Cusick ) , a wild-looking Scot ( or possibly Irishman : his accent tends to waver ) . The lab is one of several on the island , all of which were set up decades ago by a secret society ( the Dharma Initiative ) researching goodness knows what . The Dharma lot have since been wiped out by those nasty Others . The wild-looking Celt says his job is to enter a series of numbers ( 4 , 8 , 15 , 16 , 23 , 42 ) into his computer every 108 minutes or " the world will end " .

Will the freighter 's crew rescue our heroes ? <p> Season 4 No , they wo n't , because they 're even nastier baddies than The Others ( even The Others ca n't stand them ) .

Each development was intended to change the way visitors think about Las Vegas -- moving away from tacky casino themes to instead focus on cutting-edge architecture and refined spaces - and had backing from somewhat similar sources . <p> CityCenter was intended to be a collection of upmarket hotels -- four in total including the wave-like 4,004 bedroom Aria complex and a towering Mandarin Oriental -- residential apartments , a high-end shopping centre , a convention centre and public space , all designed to ensure that visitors never leave . <p> Fontainebleau , although smaller in size at just 24.5 acres , was of a siimilar ilk , with a sizeable 3,889-bed hotel , a 60,000 sq ft spa , a 3,300 seat theatre , plus shops , convention space and numerous nightclubs , bars and restaurants . <p> CityCenter is backed by MGM Mirage , the $5.4bn publicly quoted gaming company , and Infinity World , a subsidiary of Dubai World . <p> Fontainebleau was backed by Soffer , a Miami property developer and Nakheel Hotel &amp; Resorts , the Dubai-owned company behind much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " World " island complex . <p> But that is where the similarities stop -- and the reason behind the two very different outcomes is simple : money . <p> The first problems for Fontainebleau emerged in late 2008 , when Lehman Brothers , which had been largely funding the resort 's proposed retail complex , pulled the plug on funding following its own implosion . <p> By March 2009 , Fontainebleau Resorts , the holding company behind the project , was suing a banking consortium over its unwillingness to provide $800m in previously arranged funding . <p> The consortium -- including Barclays , Royal Bank of Scotland , JP Morgan Chase and Sumitomo Mitsui -- decided to pull the plug following what court papers showed to be an " unspecified event of default " which was thought to be a missed payment on an earlier loan , something which the casino developer denied . <p> Nonetheless the lawsuit was eventually withdrawn , and by June , in its place stood a Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing for Fontainebleau Las Vegas LLC and two of its affiliate companies , leading to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the banks and other creditors including contractors were calling on the property to be liquidated and sold to the highest bidder , the latest victim of the corporate credit freeze hitting the commercial property industry . <p> The added problem to all this was that neither of the resort 's backers appeared to have enough money to push the casino to completion . <p> Soffer had signed a $220m personal guarantee to secure financing for the retail part of the project , and last autumn had to put his $175m yacht , Madsummer , on the market . <p> Nakheel itself was suffering from financial problems , cutting 15pc of its workforce in December 2008 as it moved to scale back projects , and by May of last year had to be bailed out by the Dubai government in a $20bn bond offering , half of which was bought by neighbouring Abu Dhabi . <p> That Nakheel should be part of Dubai World -- the very same oil-diversifying venture set up by the emirate in 2006 that CityCenter 's backer Infinity World is part of -- should not come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investment decisions , leading it to eventually be part of the $26bn restructuring Dubai World undertook in December , Infinity World had made only one investment : the CityCenter complex itself . <p> As a result , it was not tied to problems elsewhere in Dubai World 's property portfolio , and had the backing of the sovereign wealth fund through a specifically-tied $5.5bn syndicated loan , with Dubai World going so far as to say at the end of November 2009 that Infinity World was on a " sound financial footing . " <p> MGM Mirage also proved to have deeper pockets and greater access to capital than Fontainebleau 's Soffer , in spite of its own $13.5bn debt pile . <p> But that is not to say the financing of CityCenter was not without its difficulties -- not least in March last year , nine months before the complex 's opening date , when Dubai World sued MGM Mirage in order to limit its exposure to the then troubled project . <p> The sovereign wealth fund asked a Delaware court to free it from making future payments and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after paying $5bn for a 50pc stake in the development . <p> The lawsuit was eventually resolved a month later , after the pair reached a deal with lenders led by Bank of America to fully finance the project in return for an asset exchange of certain other MGM assets , as well as an agreement by MGM Mirage to reduce its debt pile . <p> " We had a very near-death experience , " said Bill McBeath , president and chief operating officer of the Aria Resort &amp; Casino recently , with a spokesman saying that there was a point when the development came " very close to bankruptcy " . <p> The project is not completely out of the woods yet , however . In spite of the recent opening of three of four hotels , the Crystals shopping centre , the convention centre , and some of the 335 Veer Tower apartments beginning to be handed over to buyers , there are still some teething problems financially . <p> MGM has been forced to lower prices on the apartments , with local estate agent Paul Bell saying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first went on sale " off plan " , with the smallest 500ft studio now on sale for $348,000 . <p> As a result , the revenue the complex generates from them will be considerably less than the first thought , on top of the fact that The Harmon hotel , due to open later this year , was not built with the 200 apartments it was originally intended to hold . <p> A second issue is the rate the complex can charge for rooms . According to Robert LaFleur , gaming analyst with Susquehanna Financial Group , the plan to operate the Aria hotel at a premium to MGM Mirage 's nearby Bellagio complex is not quite bearing fruit just yet . <p> Based on his analysis of MGM Mirage 's 10 hotels along the Strip , the upmarket Bellagio is priced at 7PV-10pc premium to Aria on weekdays in February and March , while the February weekend premium is 41pc higher . A recent spot test of this proves his point , with a king bedroom for one night on Valentine 's Day weekend costing $259 at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as LaFleur notes , the silver lining is that MGM Mirage receives 100pc of the revenue from the Bellagio , but only 50pc from the Aria due to the CityCenter ownership model . <p> According to Goldman Sachs ' team of gaming analysts , led by Steven Kent and Betsy Gorton , the troubles of MGM Mirage 's recent past should not be forgotten , in particular what they call the ' mistakes ' made in producing a complex that will make only slightly more than a 5pc return initially and basing a development on profits to be made from high-end condo 's . <p> But that said , CityCenter is open for business and making money , and anecdotally appears to be very popular with visitors and guests alike in its first month of opening , with gaming tables busy well into the early hours and again by mid-morning . <p> Even for Fontainebleau , which has lain desolate for so long , has a ray of hope , in this week 's court decision to hand control of the development to Carl Icahn for a low-ball offer of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cost another $1bn-$1.5bn to complete . <p> In Las Vegas , as in life , fortune tends to favour the brave -- and in both these casino 's cases , some significant gambles may yet pay off .

She writes about engaging the students of Lambeth Academy . <p> I 'd been paired with Olivia Hills , into her second year , teaching English language and literature at Lambeth Academy in south London . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the range of ability in the class , what they 'd already studied - I forgot to ask one thing : what to wear ? <p> This one did n't hit me till the morning of my planned lesson . Memories of my own teachers in a mixture of 70s knitted tank tops or 80s Lady Di-style frilly blouses and dirndl skirts were not helpful . I decide to stick with what I wear to work . <p> I went for a smart trouser suit , but then could n't resist adding a jumper underneath because of the cold . Channelling a bit of 70s geography teacher , possibly , but definitely no corduroy elbow patches . Plus a pair of hoops ( what one student in a previous class had helpfully labelled my " rude girl " earrings ) . <p> First assignment I set the class an assignment to do a piece of literary criticism on TV news . I 'd taken a DVD with two different versions of the same story that ran on two different news programmes the same day . <p> It was about a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as young as 16 into prostitution . The students really engaged . <p> I ask them to think about the choices of pictures and interviews , and individual words and phrases in the script . How the police provide mugshots and their own video footage of crime scenes . Why to say the girls were forced to " entertain up to 20 clients a day " normalises the language of the sex industry , rather than " forced to have sex with " which is simpler and more responsible . What it adds when the reporter does a piece to camera outside the house used as a brothel . Why it engages the audience when he tells you the house is in a " respectable neighbourhood " . <p> We notice that the piece that tells you the most facts about the sentencing - naming all six defendants and their sentences - is n't actually as good a piece of journalism as the report that names only one trafficker , but shows photos of him posing with " his " women , and tells you the human story about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the police and uses clips of prosecutors and detectives warning other traffickers that the their assets here and abroad will be seized . <p> I 'd worried that talking about prostitution might be uncomfortable or intimidating in a mixed class ; but boys and girls seem to take the idea of analysing the news with enthusiasm and seriousness . There are a lot of bright faces and hands in the air . <p> People have occasionally fallen asleep in Channel 4 News meetings , so I have to confess I 'm not actually worried when I noticed one boy apparently " resting his eyes " , but before I had to make a decision on whether to do anything about it , the teacher discreetly nudges his elbow and deals with it for me . <p> As part of a broader discussion we talk about how different outlets handle stories for their audience . I 'm interested to hear what they have to say about the suicide of the talented and much loved children 's presenter Mark Speight a couple of years ago . <p> Partly because I was struck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by adults off children 's TV . Only Newsround actually gave children an outlet to mourn , and talk about how much he meant to them . <p> I tell them they should watch news and read the papers critically like they 've been taught to analyse any other piece of English - and not assume it 's always " right " . <p> I realise I have n't timed things quite right , even with time allowed for Q and A. There 's still some time to go , and I feel they are being very polite , but eyes of even the keenest are starting to glaze over , and I spot the odd stifled yawn . <p> One student asks what my best report is and Ms Hills comes to the rescue by suggesting we watch it . I wonder if a seven minute film on " corrective rape " in South Africa might be piling on the gloom a bit , but afterwards one of the academy 's other teachers tells me older students appreciate not being talked down to . <p> In the last half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slightly dazed , and enjoy watching them write and read out elegies . <p> Looking back Despite having airily told Teach First I 'd done talks in classrooms before , the reality of running my own class for one hour - not just giving a talk about journalism - has impressed on me the amount of preparation and structuring teachers put into every one . And that 's without worrying about every single student being engaged and participating . <p> My whole experience was also somewhat tempered by memories of one of my own inspiring teachers , who died at the weekend . <p> Dr Bruce Mitchell was a fellow and tutor at St Edmund Hall , Oxford and a world authority on Anglo Saxon literature . It was more than 20 years since he 'd taught me , but I often found myself remembering with pleasure , so many aspects of his tutorials . <p> You might think it was rather different teaching the kind of new students who appeared in his rooms every year from 1955 to 1987 for the compulsory module of Anglo Saxon set texts . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had to try and hold the interest of a load of teenagers being forced to grapple with a subject they thought ( initially anyway ) was irrelevant when they 'd rather be having a wild time having got away from home for the first time . Over they years they included future children 's author Kevin Crossley-Holland , Python Terry Jones and ( in my year ) comedian Stewart Lee . <p> I remember he was always smiling , but I also remember feeling the iron guilt of letting him down if work was not completed or up to scratch . <p> My ability all these years later , to quote bits of " Aelfric 's Life of St Edmund " in Anglo-Saxon is more than a party piece . It 's a reminder of how great teaching can inspire and change lives . <p> And for one hour I got a just an inkling of the effort and energy that goes into that work .

No doubt , there will be some blue neon thrown in too . <p> Meanwhile of course , mainstream application requirements are becoming equally demanding , for example in high-end business intelligence . As a consequence the use of higher-performance computing platforms is becoming more important in ' routine ' business operations . To determine whether the gap was closing between traditional HPC and more run-of-the-mill high-end computing , we ran a Reg survey and gathered information from 254 respondents , the majority IT professionals and systems architects from a mix of industries and company sizes . <p> The first thing we were concerned with , was what 's out there in terms of technology ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ highlighted the high degree of confidence that traditional enterprise server operating systems hold as high-performance work horses . UNIX , Linux and z/OS are all seen positively for the majority of requirements , high-performance or otherwise . <p> Microsoft 's Windows is a comparatively new entrant but is already seen as potentially useful by almost half of respondents , giving organisations another option when assessing which platform to deploy for such workloads . We say ' potentially ' because it is n't without its issues , as illustrated -- but it still has more of a footprint than either mainframe or ' specialist ' super computer equipment . <p> This nod towards more commodity operating systems is also illustrated when we look at the chipsets . Commercially available chip sets now dominate the HPC markets displacing specialist suppliers , as Intel and AMD x86 offerings have taken over in terms of perception of their suitability to handle such workloads . The Power chipset from IBM is also recognised as a suitable platform by just over 40 percent of respondents again reflecting its long history in this space ; the Sun/Fujitsu @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also well regarded . <p> While the trend may be towards commodity chipsets and operating systems , HPC still brings a number of facilities to the party -- not least how systems are architected using symmetric multi-processing , for example , or bringing in specialist compilers and hardware acceleration features . While respondents were generally positive about such features , note also that all options have also been reported to pose challenges . It is unlikely that specialist skill sets will diminish any time soon for the leading edge of HPC , as reflected by the respondents who said that the requirements of HPC will continue to demand systems tuned explicitly to compute-intensive workloads . <p> Despite the confirmed ongoing need for more specialist additions , a clear drive exists towards commodity-based high-performance computing for more mainstream applications . The use of ' commodity ' equipment is seen as the best approach to building HPC systems with three out of four favouring the use of such equipment versus ' specialist ' kit . Of the remaining respondents some 14 percent are either open to idea of using commodity equipment or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether it would work for them . Only one organisation in eight actively favours using specialist equipment in their HPC operations . <p> What 's driving this commoditisation ? <p> Familiarity , cost and choice emerge as the reasons -- the jury is out as to what is most important but the general responses come down to ' the devil you know ' . Commodity chipsets have clearly crossed a threshold where they are powerful enough , and configurable enough , to render less relevant any additional benefits that might come from depending on more specialist platforms for example . There is also evidence ( not shown ) of an interest in the potential to utilise these ' commodity ' based systems and generic operating systems together with virtualisation techniques , to allow equipment to be switched back and forth between HPC and non-HPC activity , with obvious cost benefits . <p> With the potential business demand for higher-performance computing platforms likely to grow , it is probable that increasing attention will be focussed on using more commodity-based platforms as time goes on , with a particular focus on ease @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ownership ( TCO ) . This suggests a virtuous circle : as more use is made of such platforms , so do we expect to see high-performance computing become increasingly accessible and more straightforward to deploy , which can only benefit the business community in general .

@@1382240 <h> Remembering a special Sheffield Wednesday fan <p> I want to blog about the armed services this week , but I 'd better start by congratulating our gaffer on winning the Manager of the Month award . We won four out of five matches in the Championship during January and that coincided with the arrival of Alan Irvine . <p> When he came in , he had a long chat with the players and told us what he expects from us in his own way . He obviously got his point across because we started winning straight away . <p> Alan is very astute , he does n't leave any stone unturned in preparing for matches and he does n't leave anything to chance . I think that is the way it has to be because then we all know where we stand . He does n't like it when players slack off and he never slacks off himself . The standards have been set so high that we do n't want to let them drop . <p> With the victory over Blackpool on Tuesday night , we 've now won five of our last seven matches . But we must n't let our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be won in the remainder of the season . We 've got some tough , tough games coming up and we have to prepare right for them . <p> The gaffer is a gentleman , but he is also someone who will give you every opportunity to try to win games . We 've been reaping the rewards of all the effort that we 've been putting in and it 's a great place to be at the moment . It 's been a joy to come in for training every day and , because of the results , the players have all got smiles on their faces . The results have also seen us climb out of the bottom three , and we have to keep on winning so we do n't slip back into the relegation zone again . <p> On Tuesday night , we paid tribute to Corporal Liam Riley , who lost his life in Afghanistan last week . It 's important that we remember the incredible work that our armed services do overseas and the difficult times that soldiers ' families go through . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roadside bomb while trying to save his friend and fellow soldier Lance Corporal Graham Shaw . Liam was only 21 and it is such a tragic situation . He was also a massive Sheffield Wednesday fan , like everyone in his family , so when I was asked to wear a T-shirt in the warm-up I felt it was a real honour . It puts football in its place when people are losing their sons or a member of their family . <p> I wore a T-shirt in tribute to Liam Riley <p> We ca n't really comprehend what Liam 's family must be going through , but if we can make a small gesture in honouring him and help put a smile on their faces , then it 's nice to do that . A few of the family and friends were waiting to take photos of me in the T-shirt during the warm-up , so I ran over to where so they could get a decent picture . I also know that the fact that we picked up three points against Blackpool that night would have cheered up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show immense courage in their line of duty and it 's sad to hear about the losses , not only of British soldiers , but all of those who are wounded or killed in war . The Football League is now supporting Help for Heroes as their nominated charity this season and I think that 's a really good move . Sheffield Wednesday 's Help for Heroes game will take place against Leicester on 6 March , another game in which we will recognise our armed forces . Many servicemen are football fans as well , so it 's nice when TV shows like Soccer AM recognise our soldiers , airmen and naval officers . A lot of footballers and fans watch that programme and I know those things go down really well with the families of those on service abroad . <p> What we can do is only a little gesture in the grand scheme of things but hopefully it helps the troops and their families . <p> Nearly every team visits their local hospital before Christmas and gives out presents to the kids so that is really nice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ further , and we try to do as much as we can for The Children 's Hospital . We have donated money from every replica shirt sold - and that alone has raised more than ? 20,000 for them . I also decided that the fee from this blog should go to The Children 's Hospital - it 's not a big gesture from me but anything that helps put a smile on the kids ' faces has to be a good thing . <p> I know the kids appreciate it , too , because you can see the look on their faces when a player walks in wearing the Sheffield Wednesday tracksuit . We might be their heroes , so it 's good to give something back . If it helps them in any way in their recovery , or to lift their spirits , then that is great and it 's very rewarding for us , too . <p> It 's a privilege for us to have hospital logo on our shirts and it 's a great gesture from a club as big as Sheffield Wednesday . Hopefully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other clubs because it has been a really positive experience for both parties . <p> Back to the football side of things , we have a rare Saturday off this weekend ( we were set to play West Brom but they 're still in the FA Cup ) but two big home games next week - a South Yorkshire derby against Doncaster on Tuesday and then Ipswich on Saturday . They are two other teams in the relegation battle and we have to keep focused and work hard to get the results we need . <p> Nothing has been achieved yet and there 's still a lot of hard work to be done between now and the end of the season . The target is about 53 points , we are still some way off that but we want to get to that as soon as we can . <p> Hopefully we can keep the momentum from Tuesday 's 2-0 win over Blackpool . We were 1-0 up at half time thanks to a James O'Connor header and then your hero and mine , Darren Potter , stepped up with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and guess what , no tache ! Potts has been in brilliant form and deserved to top his performance off with a great finish . Who knows , maybe the razor will remain in use for the remainder of the season and he could finish as top scorer !

@@1392239 <h> Lone Lady Nerve Up Jude Rogers , February 22nd , 2010 06:25 <p> It 's time we forgot about the myth of Manchester . So many people come from towns where stormclouds gather and brew , where storeys of concrete tower and loom , where indiscretions and improprieties take place in the shadows . Lonelady -- Julie Campbell from Hulme -- has been slotted into her city so thoroughly , in both interviews and profiles , that the music she makes has almost been forgotten , vanishing into a vortex of associations and echoes , splattered with rain , wrapped up in long overcoats . Playing Nerve Up for the first time , I 'd expected its rhythms and rhymes to be carved from Ian Curtis ' corpse at the very least ; perhaps nuzzled with the fuzz of the Buzzcocks ; or at least polished politely with the sheen of Sumner and Hook . In fact , the only Grim Up North flavours I could taste were the odd bursts of Ludus and a tiny hint of A Guy Called Gerald . Nerve Up often sounds a lot more American , as well as more female . <p> That 's not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first musical obsession was the early output of REM , and it shows . Building up her collection of albums week by week on cassette , Campbell spent her teenage years trying to unravel Michael Stipe 's lyrical myth-making , and the sense of mystery and menace that his group cultivated so well in their early career runs through this record , as do specific sounds . ' Intuition ' , ' Army ' and ' Cattletears ' could have fallen straight out of Murmur , their scratchy , just-out-of-tune guitars showing the same debts to Gang Of Four as REM 's debut album did . Peter Buck 's famous falling fourths descend proudly in the middle of ' Early The Haste Comes ' , while Campbell 's lyrics , most noticeably in the lovely ' Marble ' , are as incomprehensible and mystical as Stipe as his mistiest ( I doubt she really sings , " Brace for the sun/And too bright groo/Said a ghost is more solid than that/Back tuggy beal " , but I ca n't work out an alternative for love nor money ) . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fresh , urgent and vital . Like all the best acts who wear their references prominently , it 's what Campbell does with these inspirations that counts , what makes her stand out , which helps her float free . <p> The way Campbell uses her remarkable voice -- not like Stipe 's mumble at all , but a bold , stark thing all of its own -- sets her apart . It 's like Kristin Hersh 's voice more than anyone else 's , simultaneously fierce and vulnerable , shaky and strong , but also carrying shades of Kim Deal 's lovable raggedness ( possibly accentuated by producer Guy Fixsen , who has worked with both The Breeders and Pixies ) . On ' Immaterial ' , it reaches a tender , melancholy peak , Campbell 's high notes carrying echoes of Liz Fraser . On the brilliant title track , it does something even better , turning into the strident , spiky vocal of a dirty early house diva . Campbell delivers ' Nerve Up ' ' s lyrics coldly and with calculation , her clean notes an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and percussive breaths . " Waste your time on empty drama , " she sneers , deliciously , dangerously , before arching an eyebrow . " No " , she instructs us , commanding us completely . " You got to make a decision on your own . " <p> Nerve Up is an album that bristles with similarly liberated smartness and confidence -- until it ends on the comparatively lush , zither-twinkled ' Fear No More ' , a denouement that sounds strangely twee after the spiky stuff that preceded it . But given further plays , even this curveball of a song grows , builds and charms , and its unique character emerges . Nerve Up in its entirety also works in this vein , if you give it the chance . At first , driven completely by the past 's short , sharp shocks , it soon leaves behind the shackles of the city in which it was made , and becomes its own perfect , peculiar creature . <p> Fantastic debut album sans hype .

Stretched wrestling similes aside , ' Farewell , Mona Lisa ' explodes into neo-grindcore drums , Ben Weinman trying to invent fire on his fretboard and Greg Pucciato betraying what , for him , is a rare moment of confusion and self-doubt : " But what am I supposed to say ? / Oh sorry I guess I forgot / You think you could tell me again ? / Please ? / I do n't remember / What am I supposed to think ? / What am I supposed to feel ? / There 's no feeling in this place . " About two minutes in , you may mistake some percussive clanking in the background for your housemate preparing food in an adjacent room . Or maybe that was just me . The gloomy croon it leads into , meanwhile , invites comparisons to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DEP 's career , and not one likely to be ' just me ' . <p> Good Neighbor <p> Long-term aficionados of this quintet may well spot similarities between the staccato discord of this track 's intro , and that of ' 43% Burnt ' -- the second track on Calculating Infinity , DEP 's gamechanging debut full-length from 1999 . As a whole , though , ' Good Neighbor ' is decidedly less head-upside-smacking than that was ; the middle section of this , by the standards we 're dealing with here at least , is kinda catchy , and kinda orthodox metal-tinged hardcore . Pucciato bellows " Hey there you fucking bum / Look what you have become , " at a nebulous adversary , conceivably channeling Lou Koller from Sick Of It All or Agnostic Front 's Roger Miret as much as anyone more ... cerebral . Not too shabby , though . <p> Gold Teeth On A Bum <p> More bums . Are we picking apart an album or a Mr Motivator workout VHS , I wonder to an empty room ? More crypto-Faith No More @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mike Patton for a one-off EP in 2002 ( the one with the versh of Aphex 's ' Come To Daddy ' that recalled Samuel Johnson 's woman preaching / dog walking on its hind legs analogy ) , precisely what hypnotic spell did he cast over Dillinger that caused them to drop in a tribute or three on each of their albums since ? Aside from this , the incongruous string ( sounds like a violin , strike me down if wrong ) plucking offsets the polished muscles of the central riffage nicely , and Billy Rymer 's drums sound great on this . <p> Crystal Morning <p> Is that title a quasi-Nazi reference ? You scamps , you . No matter ; ' Crystal Morning ' is textbook ADD DEP , all laboratory mice raced along guitar necks until a mutatingly moshable guitar break takes control . Lyrically a classic of the you do n't need to know what it means , the words sound rad placed together and shouted " school ( " All the nights of broken glass drown the screaming / Choke your breath and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where will they turn " ) , it lasts precisely two minutes and bazookas straight into ... <p> Endless Endings <p> The solo that rears up around this song 's half-minute mark is n't the first on Option Paralysis ( duh ) , but it is the first to vividly recall the ' shredder ' guitarists who rose to fame in the Eighties , and who naysayers have been keen to invoke when naysaying The Dillinger Escape Plan . Hey beardo , did I just catch you laughing at Yngwie and doing the " YOU HAVE UNLEASHED THE FUCKING FURY " line* to your dumb friends ? And yet these guys are ' acceptable ' and ' envelope-pushing ' despite being just as masturbatory and self-involved . Huh . I 'm playing devil 's advocate , obviously . ' Endless Endings ' is n't a classic , but there 's some nice little nods to Nineties Dischord post-hardcore -- Fugazi and Bluetip , say -- around the one-minute mark and again near the close . <p> *I do know this was a hoax , before you say anything . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Garson , a jazz pianist whose name was made through his contributions to Bowie 's Aladdin Sane , provides keys on this six-and-a-half-minute Olmec head of a centrepiece . Limpid throughout -- it would n't be reaching too hard to suggest Bill Evans ' spectre -- and practically horizontal at the inception , quite how Garson and The Dillinger Escape Plan manage to combine this with a thudding bass riff and Meshuggah-recalling guitar chug , without making it a preposterous disaster , is an issue to tax scientists of sound for generations to come . But it works . That this finds Pucciato breaking the habit of his DEP tenure , by writing about a relationship without resorting to rotgut bitterness , probably helps . ( " He 's going through transitional stages in his life right now , " confides Ben Weinman in the press biog , thoughtfully . ) <p> Room Full Of Eyes <p> " Little honey I needed / I needed a reminder from you / There sure ai n't nothin ' like the sight of your fine skin / From across the room .

Perhaps appropriately , this one has a dirtier feel than most of Option Paralysis , the vox buried further in the mix ( and flecked with some pleasingly raddled David Yow perspiration ) before a factory-precise sludge/doom riff takes hold at 2:20 -- if you 're not checking the display , you 'll probably think it 's the start of the next track . Less immediate than many of the other nine songs , time spent with ' Room Full Of Eyes ' satisfies . <p> Chinese Whispers <p> For better or worse , it 's feasible that this might be used as evidence that Dillinger have gone a bit softsoap . It 's a solid performer , but apart from the frantically fucked time changes apparent in the early part of its third minute , much of it sounds equally like At The Drive-In or Mclusky as the DEP that cemented their rep a decade or so back .

Another of the group 's showoffishly intro-free numbers -- the showing off part comes when they do it live without fucking it up -- the climactic guitar skree around 1:25 is equal parts Skullflower and Kerry King . Shortly , eccentric jazz piano is married to radio-rock anthemia , before another near-grindcore beatdown returns about a minute later . <p> Parasitic Twins <p> Vocally , Mike Patton must once again be called up for comparison service , although Pucciato is histrionic enough to also inject a few cc of Chris Cornell into lyrics like " Although I miss you I 'll never say I do / Bleed like the rain that 's falling / Cut me through and through .

And if you ca n't get behind that as a preferred option , well , I question what kind of monster you are , frankly . <p> Option Paralysis will almost certainly not convert anyone who previously found The Dillinger Escape Plan a vulgar , showboating aural trial . At best , it might convince them that there is the germ of a listenable , if sardonic , pop-metal band here -- although these tendencies were already in evidence on their two previous LPs , Miss Machine and Ire Works .

@@1406232 <h> This Bleeding City <p> There have been several fine non-fiction books to address the nature and causes of the financial crisis of the last few years , but a paucity of effective novels to explore the issue . If , as Matthew Arnold said , the function of art is to hold up a mirror to society , then novelists have failed us during the financial maelstrom .

This endlessly self-forgiving , chillingly one-dimensional self-love requires constant affirmation in concrete expressions of love and respect from others . <p> At university , our hero is a lionised but poor artist , a bit like Charles Ryder from Brideshead Revisited , but with added cocaine and nookie . The chic French siren Vero dispenses sexual favours . But , when Vero later shares a London house with Charlie , she withholds sex . Her unfathomable reason is that he is unemployed . <p> So Charlie 's penis drives him to the City in search of money and further worship .

There are echoes of Jay McInerney 's Bright Lights , Big City , of Salinger , and especially of Michael Chabon 's The Mysteries of Pittsburgh , although the gay pointers are less explicit : a penchant for boyish girls , hero worship of the dominant Henry , an intense interest in male looks . <p> The angry rants to be found in recent works that deal with the financial crisis ( such as the scatter-gun vitriol of Ben Elton 's Meltdown and the better-calibrated , angry-outsider narrative of Sebastian Faulks 's A Week In December ) do n't tell the human story anywhere near as well as Preston does .

Preston 's style is both spare and rich , brutal and deft .

@@1406238 <h> Online tutoring : extra help is as easy as logging on . <p> It 's a normal Thursday morning in South Kensington , but 24-year-old English tutor Will Orr-Ewing is giving a most unusual lesson . For while he is in London , his pupil is in Geneva . <p> Welcome to the brave new world of online tutoring , where the teacher is n't a man in leather elbow patches who comes around to your house every Tuesday teatime , but a man who sits at a computer terminal several hundred miles away , and communicates with you via a headset with built-in microphone . <p> " I know that parents throw up their hands at the mention of today 's screen culture , " says Orr-Ewing , founder of upmarket Keystone Tutors . " The truth is , though , that children feel it 's far less of a chore to sit down in front of a computer than it is to sit down in front of a pile of books . And if anything , an online teaching session is more structured than a face-to-face situation , because only one person can speak at a time . " <p> That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known as Skype ( free of charge ) . Meanwhile , written communication takes place on the computer screen ; both tutor and pupil can write or draw on a computer-screen " whiteboard " , which performs the function of a shared blackboard , suspended in cyberspace . If you want , you can set up a webcam and see the face of the person at the other end , though that 's by no means essential . <p> At first hearing , it sounds a somewhat mechanical and impersonal arrangement . What strikes a more harmonious note , though , is the price : as little as ? 15 an hour , compared with the ? 45 it can cost for face-to-face tuition . Plus perhaps ? 15 for a microphone headset . <p> As it happens , the rate Keystone charges for online tutoring is the same as it charges for the in-person kind : ? 40 an hour . But firms who are purely online can do it much more cheaply . <p> The company Home Tutoring Online , for example , has a two-tier charging structure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ professional tutor , and just ? 15 for a current university student . <p> Learn Spanish with 1to1 Languages , and for $12 ( ? 7.90 ) an hour , you get a real live native Spanish speaker sitting in Bogota , Colombia . Alternatively , Home Teach Online gives you 20 minutes with a student tutor for just ? 7.50 . <p> Astonishingly , others can take their prices even lower . At Maths-Whizz ( ages five to 13 ) , they charge ? 99.99 a year for unlimited hours , and at My Own Tutor ( maths up to A-level ) a mere ? 90 per year . <p> Mind you , the way they do this is by dispensing with the flesh-and-blood tutor altogether . At Maths-Whizz , they have created 1,200 on-screen , animated arithmetical exercises ( swirling snakes and chopped-up cheeses ) that are programmed to each child 's ability level . And at My Own Tutor - which also offers extensive live tutoring services - they screen pre-recorded video maths lessons that children can watch as many times as they want . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worry about their tutor getting cross , or impatient , " says Maths-Whizz founder Richard Marett , who claims that 90 minutes a week spent on his exercises will , in the course of a year , improve a child 's maths " age " by 1.6 years . <p> So what do parents think of online tutoring ? " I was very impressed , " says father of four Nicholas Wright , from Bexley , in Kent , who has used Home Tutoring Online for two of his children . <p> " From our point of view , we did n't have to keep taking the children to and from the tutor 's house , " Wright says . " We also got regular , detailed reports on how the children were progressing . With a real tutor , you only ever get rather vague feedback . <p> " Results-wise , the tutoring got our son up from a C in maths GCSE to a B , which is what he needed if he was going to achieve his ambition of doing maths at A-level . " <p> That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Britain is still done the traditional way . " The occasional online session might be useful if , say , the student wants the tutor to check their essay , " says Mylene Curtis , of teaching giants Fleet Tutors .

" <p> Hear , hear , says Hertfordshire father Mike Evans , who went to agency First Tutors to find a teacher for his 16-year-old daughter , Ellie .

The rice from the Yamanashi prefecture , west of Tokyo , is quite sticky ; two different varieties from the Yamagata prefecture , in the north of the country , have a stronger , chewier feel ; the one from Miyagi , east of Yamagata , is the most refined and an excellent foil for sashimi ; while the rice from Fukushima , further south , is so easy to eat that I could have emptied the bowl immediately but that would have left no appetite for the rice from Shiga prefecture , east of Kyoto , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making it a subtle accompaniment to grilled mackerel . <p> Yamaguchi tells me that each year he tastes about 80 of the 150 varieties of rice commercially available in Japan to create his rice menu , which is offered alongside a daily changing list of main courses . <p> He only buys unpolished rice , which the chefs polish the day before they need it . The rice is then washed using , in part , a softened mineral water and then kept overnight in water in the refrigerator . It is only cooked , boiled without any seasoning , as it is ordered . <p> Yamaguchi is a fine example of the obsession -- and I do n't think this is too strong a word -- that chefs or restaurateurs in Japan often have with a single ingredient or cooking style . <p> The other distinguishing factor is a concentration on seasonality .

@@1411231 <h> Mahler 's Fifth Symphony , Halle Orchestra , review <p> ANOTHER specially commissioned appetiser for Manchester 's Mahler series and , sadly , another dud . Uri Caine was a more than promising choice , given the inventive wit he has brought to crossover reworkings of Bach , Beethoven and indeed Mahler . But his Scenes from Childhood , a three-part cantata for children 's voices and orchestra , suggests that free composition is not his strength . <p> The fast outer movements -- settings of Blake and Dylan Thomas -- are not lacking in flair . But Caine does scant justice to the central poem , The Butterfly , by Pavel Friedmann , an evocation of the Prague ghetto written shortly after his deportation to Terez ? n . Even at its energetic best , the cycle is marred by the pointless presence of Caine 's aimless piano solos . <p> Turgid in its scoring ( against which the Hall ?

Laurence Rogers delivered magnificently firm horn solos in the central Scherzo , and the Adagietto was subtly and nobly shaped , with no hint of maudlin indulgence . <p> But there is a downside . On the rare occasions when the Scherzo wobbled -- as it almost always does -- the effect was more disturbing than in a performance that has courted danger from the outset . Elder does not do risk . Or venom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to shy away from those aspects leaves the impression of effect , albeit often superb , without underlying cause . <p> One way of understanding this symphony is as a journey from death to birth , more precisely from after death ( the opening funeral march ) to the vigour of youth .

If the host really wants his or her guests to notice an award , prize or achievement , the sitting room mantlepiece is nowhere near as effective as the cloakroom wall . <p> " I have noticed that the downstairs loos of unmarried people in their mid-thirties become hard-core ego walls , " reports Antonia Stewart , an interior designer based in west London . " What starts off with a couple of photos of the 1st XI in red and white rugby shirts turns into a gigantic display of the owner of the house Lycra-clad running in the Marathon de Sable , or sailing the Atlantic single-handed . Boys are definitely worse than girls on this .

" She wanted the cloakroom to feel sparkly and uplifting after a hard day . So I 've put in a chainmail rather than a crystal chandelier , and installed a horsehair blind with a sparkling metallic thread woven through it .

" <p> On May 22 2006 the Higher People 's Court of Beijing ruled at second instance on Zhuang Yu v Guo Jingming and ordered the defendants to pay Rmb10,000 in moral damages . The decision provoked severe criticism , as there were no provisions concerning moral damages in the Copyright Law at that time . The court made the decision pursuant to its Guidance on the Determination of Compensation Liability for Infringement of Copyright . Article 22 of the Tort Liability Law provides that " where infringement of personal rights results in serious moral damage to the victim , the victim may claim compensation for such damage " . This provision has elevated a local court 's practice into legislation , giving the courts a statutory basis for such a finding in similar cases . Where a copyright holder 's rights of publication , authorship , alternation and integrity ( or other personal rights ) are violated , Article 22 provides a legal basis for the rights holder to claim for moral damages . <p> Joint and several liability for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , including Louis Vuitton and Chanel , sued Beijing Xiushui Street Clothing Market Co Ltd for infringement of their rights in their registered trademarks . The defendant was accused as an accomplice of its tenants , rather than as a direct perpetrator of an infringement , and some commentators considered that it had been harshly treated . Article 50 of the Regulations for the Implementation of the Trademark Law states that " intentionally providing facilities such as storage , transport , mailing and concealment ... for the purpose of infringing another person 's exclusive right to use a registered trademark " constitutes an infringement of the exclusive right to use a registered trademark ; however , the idea of assistance in infringement amounting to infringement had not taken root at that time . Article 9 of the Tort Liability Law provides that " whoever aids and abets others in effecting infringing acts shall be liable jointly and severally with the infringer " . This unequivocal provision applies to all tort cases , including IP cases , and leaves IP infringement facilitators with no place to hide . <p> Joint and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States , the Digital Millennium Copyright Act contains a safe harbour clause which states that in respect of copyright infringement , an internet service provider ( ISP ) merely provides hosting services and does not generate content . When notified of an infringing activity being conducted through its online services , the ISP must remove the infringing material - failure to do so constitutes infringement . This safe harbour clause has two key elements : notification and removal . Its application has now been extended to search engines , web storage and online libraries . China 's judicial interpretation regarding copyright is derived from the Supreme People 's Court Interpretations of Application of the Law in the Trial of Disputes over Internet Content Copyright and from an administrative rule - the Ordinance on the Protection of the Right to Network Dissemination of Information . To some extent , China 's approach draws on the Digital Millennium Copyright Act . The Tort Liability Law couches the gist of the interpretations and the ordinance in Article 36 , which states that : <p> " Internet users and service providers that infringe others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liability . <p> Where an internet user takes advantage of online services to carry out infringing activities , the victim has the right to require the service provider to remove , block or disable access to infringing material upon notification . If the service provider fails to take necessary measures immediately after receipt of such notification , it shall be liable jointly and severally with the user for any extended damage . <p> If the service provider is aware of the user 's infringing behaviour through its online services , but fails to take any necessary countermeasures , it shall be liable jointly and severally with the user . " <p> This clause governs not only the violation of copyright , but also the infringement of all other online material , including other forms of intellectual property . <p> Article 36 of the law comprises three paragraphs . The first paragraph is concerned with general infringing acts - that is , circumstances in which the internet user and the ISP are directly responsible for infringement . The second and third paragraphs deal with circumstances in which the ISP bears liability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The third paragraph clarifies a key requirement : there must be evidence that the ISP knew of the user 's infringements independently of the victim 's notification , and that its failure to take corrective measures resulted in greater harm . In the situation posited in the second paragraph , the victim informs the ISP of the infringing activities that it has identified , but the ISP takes no action to remove the infringing material . In both cases the ISP is jointly and severally liable with the infringing internet user by virtue of its knowledge of the infringing activity , regardless of the rights owner 's notification .

@@1420230 <p> It 's been 30 years since the release of Judas Priest 's most acclaimed album , British Steel . With that in mind , The Quietus sent Joel McIver to talk to Rob Halford and KK Downing and look back at a classic slab of ear - and , on the cover , finger - bleeding metal . <p> Thirty years since British Steel , eh fellas ? What does that feel like ? <p> Rob Halford : It 's hard to believe . Y'know , you 're a different person in your teenage years , your 20s , your 30s , your 40s and your 50s , and whatever 's to come . That has to have some kind of relation to how you treat your work . The older you get , funnily enough , things seem to get less cluttered . You 've made sense of a lot of things : you do n't sweat the small stuff . <p> KK Downing : It was 1980 when we did it , and we 'd made a few albums by then . We were n't exactly floundering around , we were gaining momentum , but everything did lock in with British @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clothes . Everything consolidated who we were and where we were going . It was almost like a rebel 's almanac , for want of a better term . Audiences endeared themselves to it . <p> The New Wave Of British Heavy Metal was underway by the time British Steel was released . Did Iron Maiden make you feel that you 'd better up your game ? <p> KK : I 'd never heard of Iron Maiden until we were just finishing the mixes on the record , and someone told me that they were going to support us on the subsequent tour . I said , ' OK , fine ' and then they started to get mouthy in the press , saying they were going to blow the bollocks off Judas Priest and all this sort of stuff . I said , ' I appreciate the attitude , like , but let 's fuck ' em off and get somebody who appreciates us ! ' There was loads of bands who would have wanted that tour and appreciated it , and you just did n't need those sorts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did it and it was fine . I 'm glad that they emerged and became a force to be reckoned with , and gained their own identity , musically , visually and in every way possible . All credit to them : they 've done a fantastic job to be ambassadors of British metal all around the world . <p> Scott Ian of Anthrax said that British Steel was the first real heavy metal album , because everything before it had contained elements of blues . Does that make sense to you ? <p> KK : It kind of does , I guess . All the British musicians of our age were influenced by black blues , but I was just doing an interview with VH1 and they could n't understand why we dropped the blues and went on to metal . It 's just evolution : music that was destined to come about , know what I mean ? Like , if you do n't have eggs and milk and sugar you ca n't make , um , fuckin ' ... um ... you ca n't make , let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I mean ? Like , when people eat a dessert , they do n't think they 're eating a bunch of dairy products , do they ? Know what I mean ? They 're eating , like , profiteroles . There 's only one real true honest dessert in this world and that 's fruit , I guess , when you think about it . The rest is full of like , crap . <p> Interesting analogy . Now , the ' Breaking The Law ' video features you breaking into a bank and ' holding up ' the staff with your guitars . How does that clip stand up nowadays ? <p> KK : Well , I have to chuckle to myself really about how they got us to do whatever it was we were doing . But we were young and it was exciting and we were making probably the first ever heavy metal conceptual video . The director Julien Temple went on to do great things . What can I say ? I would n't change a bit of it , except it was freezing cold when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it reminds us that however big and powerful we were , we still did everything that people wanted us to do ... <p> Did any booze and drugs play a part in the making of British Steel ? <p> RH : Not really : my crazy years were around the Turbo time -- that was full-on . My alcoholism and my drug-ism was n't interfering at that time . Had that been the case , British Steel would probably have turned out a different record . I had clarity in terms of being able to compose and being cognitive of choices and decisions and strong ideas -- they were all in good nick . It 'll be 25 years of sobriety next year , which is a good feeling . KK : I got most of that out of my system when I was a teenager , really , with the LSD and everything . You had to try everything back then , did n't you ? I ca n't say I enjoyed acid , really . <p> Did it make you hallucinate that one day you 'd find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up with a pointy guitar ? <p> KK : Ha ha ha ! No , that was in someone else 's imagination , fortunately ... Music kind of saved me , in a way , because I was n't that great a player and I found that if I went on stage after a couple of pints I could n't play that well ! <p> Was it weird when Dave Holland , who played drums on the album , was imprisoned for the attempted rape of a teenage boy in 2004 ? <p> KK : Yeah , it was , totally . I do n't know the circumstances of everything that went on , but you know , a lot of innocent men have been hung and a lot of guilty men have gone free , and a lot in between , so I 'm not gon na make any judgments at all . <p> Are the Priest bandmembers still friends after all these years ? <p> RH : None of us have any common denominators outside the band . We love each other to death , but it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call that work ? ' Well yeah , it is work . A lot of people just see the show or listen to the music , which is how it should be , but you try tagging along with us and see what we do . There 'd be carcasses along the sidewalk ! It 's fucking tough , and it do n't get any easier the older you get . <p> What are the toughest bits ? <p> RH : The physical side can be really gruelling . Being on stage at 20 is a lot different to being on stage at 58 . Your intensity and your passion have n't changed , but there are certain things going on that you 've got no control over . So you try and do your best to stay in shape and have the strength to put on a great show four or five nights a week , including travel and promotion and everything else , with no sleep . You do have to be relatively superhuman . <p> The touring must be the most exhausting part , I imagine ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think about it now , I do n't want to go on a fuckin ' tour again for the rest of my life , but that 's not going to be the case . It 's gon na happen , and when you go out there you do n't want it to stop , because the biggest rush in the world is standing in front of the people who put you there in the first place . Connecting with the fans , whether they 're in Brazil or Japan or Italy or America or the UK , is the reason you do what you do . But we never get bitter , or cynical or regretful : all of the reasons why you want to be in a band and play in front of people and have a great night out , they 're still there . We 've got an unwritten agreement that we 're gon na keep doing it until one of us says , ' I 've had enough ' . <p> Does it still give you a thrill when you play a stadium ? <p> RH @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ press , after no sleep , you walk out in front of 15,000 or 20,000 people and blow their minds . You ca n't describe it : it really feels like that 's what you 're alive for . It 's what you 're on the planet to do : to stand there , to look out and get that reaction . <p> A lot of Priest fans were n't keen on the operatic sound of your 2008 album Nostradamus . <p> RH : It 's a wonderful record , but it 's a challenging record from the listener 's point of view because it 's an enormous amount of information . There are some fans that only want Priest to be Painkiller or Turbo , and that 's the passion that your fans have . We love our fans to death , but we 're in control of our own destiny when it comes to music . That 's the uniqueness of Judas Priest : we can be a band that does Painkiller one minute and Nostradamus the next . It 's still Priest . We 've never felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ box . <p> Will Priest ever spill the beans in a book ? <p> RH : We talked about it . When people read a rock'n'roll book , they want all the stuff in it like M ? tley Cr ? e 's The Dirt . It 's perfect : it totally fits with that band and their image and their stage show . Priest has been nowhere near that type of lifestyle : we 've certainly had our incidents , a lot of which have been documented and a lot of which have not . We 're very , very private people in Judas Priest : we 've always felt that anything outside of music is taboo and out of the public psyche . By the same token , in today 's world , it 's reality this , it 's reality that , it 's what 's under the carpet and sniffing the laundry , and I do n't think any of us in Priest are into it . It intrudes on the music , and the legacy and the merit and the value and the tradition and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If everybody in the band wanted to do a warts-and-all autobiography , we 'd all agree to do it . But we have n't agreed , and if we have n't agreed it 's not going to happen . I think it 's tremendous that we all value each other 's opinions rather than just saying , ' Let 's do it and make some cash ' . That 's the way Priest has always worked -- there 's no dominating force , it 's all collective . <p> Are you in a position , financially , where you could retire ? <p> RH : Yeah , and I think that 's another indication of why we do what we do . We 've got the best band in the world : it would be different if the fans were falling away , but they 're not , they 're consistently there . You walk on stage now and you see these teenage metalheads banging their heads to Priest : out of all the young bands that these metalheads could relate to , they choose Judas Priest . That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there 's a sense of responsibility . <p> We spoke for Metal Hammer five years ago and you told me then that you wanted to do an all-British metal festival one day . Any chance of that happening ? <p> RH : Well , I would have hoped that someone would have read that and made it happen ! Maybe they will this time . I still think it would be phenomenal to get all those bands jamming at a festival . <p> What do you do in your down time , Rob ? <p> RH : I do n't really have any down time . I 've always got something going on . It 's literally been non-stop since ... well , even before we reunited in 2003 . I 've got a record label and a clothing company , so there 's always fuckin ' emails to do and phone calls to make . I 'm not complaining . Here I am at 58 and you 'd think life would be slowing down a bit but it 's not , it 's gone in the opposite direction . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end everything has to come to an end . That 's the nature of living . <p> Which metal bands are going to be playing stadiums after Priest , Maiden and Metallica have all gone ? <p> RH : Well , that 's a really good question . There are a handful of bands that have been able to go on to the level that those are on , and can do these massive world tours and sell out major-capacity venues , but will there be another Judas Priest ? Will there be another Metallica ? Will there be another Iron Maiden ? Will there be another Guns N'Roses ? AC/DC ? Kiss ? I do n't know . All of these are still giants in the world . We came close to it with bands like Slipknot and Linkin Park or Rammstein -- there 's a handful -- but will they be able to maintain it for 30 or 40 years ? All of those other bands that I mentioned , even Metallica 's been around since 1981 . Maybe it does n't matter , I do n't think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ metal dominates completely in every part of the world , and it 's reassuring . Heavy metal is everywhere and it will never die . You have to appreciate that the music is bigger than you are . <p> Judas Priest 's 30th Anniversary Deluxe Expanded Edition of British Steel is out on May 10 <h> ADD YOUR COMMENT <p> I would love to see an authorized Judas Priest bio . I do n't need a gossip book like Motley Crue 's etc ... Judas Priest are the first true heavy metal band and stories on their beginning to where they are now are good enough for me . I do n't need to know if Rob was ever involved with male groupies , I do n't need to know about KK 's breakup with his longtime girlfriend .

Through the record label and publishing company Oval Music , which he co-founded with Gordon Nelki in the mid-1970s , he was instrumental in launching the careers of acts such as Ian Dury , Lene Lovich and Paul Hardcastle . <p> He also realised his teenage dream of becoming a radio DJ , in a somewhat stop-start career which began and ended on BBC radio . At first his series of highly influential programmes concentrated principally on American roots and popular music ; but from the mid-1980s until shortly before his death he turned his enthusiasm more and more towards world music @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a democratic on-air host , perhaps most fondly remembered in recent years for " radio ping-pong " sessions , in which guests would perform and/or alternate their records of choice in response to his . <p> He documented his own " discoveries " and listener favourites in a series of 10 double-CD compilations , beginning with World 2000 and ending with Otro Mundo in 2009 . To the end he maintained his sincerity and a passion for music often ignored by mainstream media , stating in the sleeve notes for the final compilation : " It is a scandal that all these artists are so completely and utterly sidelined and ignored by people who should know better ... What else do these artists have to do , for their work to be rightfully acknowledged ? " <p> In person , Gillett was warm , softly-spoken and generous with his time and advice , acting as a mentor to many young writers and musicians . In an interview with fRoots magazine in 2001 he explained how he had made his way in so ruthless a business : " When people ask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's my advice that you have to somehow see something that nobody 's doing that you could uniquely do .

He took a degree in Economics at Cambridge , and in 1964 married Buffy Chessum , whom he had met some years earlier .

The planning application has already taken years and will take at least another three for the first brick to be laid . <h> Related Articles <p> Most cool-headed analysts agree that Jerusalem suburbs such as Ramat Shlomo will be considered part of Israel under any negotiated two-state solution . <p> For Israel , Jerusalem is the heart of the Jewish people , established as our eternal capital by King David , some 3,500 years ago . Jews have lived , worked and prayed in the city from time immemorial . <p> Throughout the generations , Jews have been the largest community in Jerusalem . This was confirmed in 1845 when the Prussian consul conducted the first census in the city . By 1905 , out of a population of less than 60,000 , at least 40,000 were Jewish . In modern times , the only period when Jews were restricted from living throughout Jerusalem was between 1948 and 1967 . Under Arab Jordanian control , Jewish communities were ruthlessly and violently driven out of areas where they had lived for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government to restrict the rights of Jews to live in Jerusalem . Israelis disagree on nearly everything , but on the sovereignty of our capital city we are overwhelmingly united . <p> This has sometimes led to a difference of opinion between Israel and the US over construction . But that difference has never altered the basic reality of our friendship . Israel and the US are and remain close friends and strategic allies , united by shared values and common interests . <p> When PM Netanyahu last year agreed to an extensive freeze on West Bank settlement construction , Hillary Clinton hailed the move as an " unprecedented concession " . Yet it was clear even then that the freeze did not apply to Jerusalem , the indivisible sovereign capital of the State of Israel . <p> For over a year , the Netanyahu government has offered direct negotiations with the Palestinian Authority without preconditions . By making talks conditional on a total freeze on construction in Jerusalem , the Palestinian Authority has been given a golden get out clause . The Palestinian refusal to enter direct talks is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of direct negotiations with Israel . <p> As the media spotlight last week glared on Jerusalem , Fatah officials renamed the main square in Ramallah after Dalal Mughrabi , the leader of a PLO terror attack in 1978 which killed 38 Israeli civilians , including 13 children . There was no coverage , let alone criticism , of this symbolic embrace of terrorist atrocity , despite its timing . There rarely is . <p> Anyone casually observing the disproportionate recent media coverage might assume that a handful of apartment blocks in Israel 's capital is the most pressing issue in the world today , let alone the Middle East . If they are ever built , they will need exceptionally strong foundations . After all , they are being used as a peg on which to hang the world 's political baggage from Washington to Waziristan and from Jerusalem to Jakarta . <p> President Obama 's hope to engage the Muslim world is commendable but , as some analysts have observed , not without risk . In some instances , positions have hardened . Certainly , the strategy of rewarding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table with stronger criticism of Israel seems an unlikely recipe for success . <p> The media has long cast PM Netanyahu in the role of villain but he has refused to act the part . He embraced the two-state solution in his policy speech last June . He agreed to a West Bank settlement freeze of greater scope than any previous Israeli government . He has removed West Bank roadblocks and restrictions , easing access and helping to boost unprecedented growth in the Palestinian economy . <p> Frustrated , critics have elevated Ramat Shlomo to a position of disproportionate prominence . It is , apparently , more important than Iran 's imperial nuclear ambitions , the Taliban 's tightening grip on Pakistan 's border and the evolution of Iraqi democracy . Such thinking is an Achilles ' heel in conflict resolution . At one point I wondered whether this small Jerusalem suburb would be held accountable for causing undue tension to David Beckham 's Achilles tendon . <p> Israel is committed to peace . As we search for a comprehensive agreement , calm and sober voices are needed to acknowledge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ settlement " is unhelpful , historically flawed and undermines negotiations . We can not portray a host of global policy concerns as at the mercy of the Israeli equivalent of the council house waiting list .

@@1423230 <p> Like many countries around the world , Egypt started subsidising basic food items such as bread and rice in the aftermath of the Second World War . When President Nasser 's government overthrew the monarchy of King Farouk in 1952 , Egypt entered a period of modernization and social reform . Subsidies were fundamental to Nasser 's socialist economic model , but from the 1970s Egypt 's government recognized that an attempt needed to be made to cut subsidies as it was , and still remains , a large burden on the government 's budget . President Sadat 's attempts at liberalizing the Egyptian economy came to a head in January 1977 following a mandate set out by the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) and the World Bank declaring that state subsidized food should be terminated . The announced end to subsidies on flour , rice and cooking oil let to the ' Bread Riots ' resulting in the government 's abrupt cancelling of its plans to cut subsidies . <p> Subsidy Reform InitiativesA key component of the economic reform programme of 1991 was subsidy reform , again advocated by the IMF and World Bank . The Egyptian government set out to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ successful ; currently only basic food , energy , transport and medicine are still subsidized by the government . In recent years the government has strategized to address the gradual reduction of subsidies primarily on basic food items and energy provision with medical services not considered a priority for liberalization . The Egyptian government believes that it should continue to provide affordable medical services to all its citizens . In 2009 the government of Egypt spent an estimated total of US$ 8.4bn on subsidies , energy subsidies amounted to an estimated US$5.89bn , 70% of total subsidies . While this is a huge burden on the government 's budget , it is essential to keep in mind that around 43% of Egypt 's population live in deprived conditions . Almost half of Egypt 's citizens can not survive without subsidies unless they receive adequate monetary compensation should food and energy subsidies be eliminated in the future.Most economists would agree that the current state subsidies in Egypt do not add to the sustainability of its economy , especially in instances where lower domestic supplies lead to a strong increase in demand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would therefore lead to more cost-efficient market and Egypt 's move from a state-dominated economy to a free-market economy will evolve further . <p> Energy SubsidiesFrom 2004 the Egyptian government has significantly decreased subsidies on domestic energy prices and by fiscal year 2007-2008 all subsidies were removed from energy intensive industries such as the petrochemical , steel and cement production . In early 2008 the government formulated its plan to reduce domestic energy subsidies by 5% annually , the Ministry of Energy and Electricity has since 2008 increased consumer prices by 7-11% in several Egyptian governorates . Energy prices in Egypt increased by 5.8% for commercial enterprises , and 5.7% for the public sector . In May 2008 fuel subsidies were also slowly reduced . The aim of the government is to use revenue generated by the reduction of fuel subsidies to compensate for the social and economic effects of the rising food prices . <p> Food SubsidiesThe Egyptian government instated in 2004 is regarded as pro-business and works to gradually liberalize Egypt 's economy . While the country 's food and energy subsidies do n't align with the government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has proven challenging . In fact , early in 2004 the government increased the amount of subsidy to reduce prices of nine basic foods to their levels before the devaluation of the Egyptian pound in January 2003 . The government also maintains heavy subsidies on sugar . In May 2008 the food subsidy programme was increased to benefit around 70% of Egypt 's population . Egypt 's population is wary of any changes in subsidy of food items , yet many realise that food subsidies frequently benefit Egypt 's rich population more than its poor citizens . A case in point is Egypt 's subsidy on bread ; the government underlines that it is only the lowest quality bread that is subsidized and that the rich community will buy better products . However , as subsidized bread is cheaper than animal feed , many Egyptian cattle and poultry growers abuse the effort of the government to provide subsidized bread for low income groups . This creates bread shortages and brings to light the weakness of a state subsidized economic model . The government insists that people are aware of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ support for the economic ' restructure ' , the gradual removal of subsidies . Most prominent and controversial amongst restructuring plans for food subsidies is the transformation from the country 's ' in-kind ' system to a cash payment system that would directly target those in Egypt that need it most . Since its initiation in 2006 , pilot programmes for automated food distribution are now running in 19 governorates . The programme uses a ' smart card ' to monitor consumer acquisitions . The concept behind this is to monitor and identify where cash welfare payments need to go . The immediate problem of this programme is that the government will have difficulty reaching every citizen in need of subsidies as there is a severe lack of information on Egypt 's low income groups . At the same time both the government and public fear that transformation to a cash payment system will result in a high rate of inflation . <p> Effects of the Global Economic CrisisAs the world is dealing with the repercussions of the global economic crisis , Egypt 's government has had to re-evaluate its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economy . The high international prices and increasing domestic demand on top of the gradual removal of subsidies on fuel and increase in prices of some commodities had already led to a strong rise in inflation to 23% in September 2008 . Inflation is estimated to average 10.5% in 2010 and drop further down in 2011 but any decrease in subsidies logically presents a real risk to Egypt 's inflation rate . The main objective of the Egyptian government is currently to maintain economic and social stability . It is likely that Egypt 's fiscal reforms will be delayed by around 2 years . According to Finance Minister Youssef Boutros-Ghali , plans to go down to a 3% budget deficit by 2012 have now been pushed back to 2014 . Non-energy intensive industries ( industries that require less than 50kw/hr electricity or 66m cu metres natural gas per annum ) are enjoying a six-month freeze in energy prices ( started in January 2010 ) . <p> In Egypt 's continual development towards a free-market economy it is essential that the government gradually tackles its burdensome subsidy system . The current @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subsidies at a fast pace . However , ever increasing global prices will only strain the budget of the Egyptian government further should its subsidy system remain unaltered . Egypt will need to move to a more sustainable economic system while at the same time making sure its population does not suffer the consequences of strong subsidy reductions and high inflation . Cash compensation in the form of welfare payments is a viable option provided the government takes care in understanding and offers compensation to all of Egypt 's low income groups . The government will also need to find ways to encourage investment in order to increase local production of essential food and energy products , this will relief the burden of subsidy on the government 's budget . For example , 77% of edible oil is currently imported and subsidised which costs the government a staggering LE 2bn per year and is likely to increase to LE 2,5bn in five years . Changes in Egypt 's subsidy system will undoubtedly be a costly and lengthy procedure but crucial in its liberalization process . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 
@@1423232 <h> Easy Access <h> The Brasserie at 8 Kings Road - A Review by Liz Allen <p> Published : 21st March 2010 17:54 <p> I had long wanted to visit the Brasserie No. 8 King 's Road in Southsea , having been fascinated by the sight of the huge chandeliers inside this Grade II listed building that had formerly housed a bank . The opportunity finally came one Saturday evening in early March . I had n't celebrated my birthday in January because of the snow and a sprained wrist , and my sister-in-law had her birthday coming up the following week , so we decided a family dinner was in order . <p> On the previous Monday I rang Brasserie No. 8 to reserve a table for five at 7.30pm on the Saturday . We were advised to arrive promptly as they had thirty guests coming at 8pm and wanted to be able to take our order before that . I was the last of the family to arrive and I was escorted to the upper level by the gentleman who checked my reservation . The upper level is actually like a balcony from which you can look down on the ground floor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As you enter the restaurant there is a bar to the left and two beautiful floral arrangements , one of which I still had a good view of from upstairs . At the far end stands a grand piano , and I understand there is often entertainment on a Friday evening . <p> We had a table at the end of the balcony and were lucky that the smaller table next to us remained unoccupied throughout the evening . The tables have a marble effect and there is a reddish-purple runner along the middle that matches the colour of the walls . Cutlery is stylishly tucked into a fold in the linen napkins , and red candles are held in tall , slender glass candlesticks . As I was the last to arrive , menus had already been brought to our table . The waitress soon came to ask if we would like olives , bread and tapenade while we studied the menu , and she brought three servings of these ( ? 2.75 each ) . My brother was in a hurry for a gin and tonic ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orange juice ( ? 1.50 ) . My sister-in-law , my son and his partner ordered a bottle of Australian Shiraz to share ( ? 14.75 ) . <p> I did n't want to spoil my appetite with the olives and bread , but my sister-in-law persuaded me to try the tapenade , which was pureed red peppers with slices of garlic . It was certainly very good . We decided not to order from the full starter menu which included beetroot and goat 's cheese tart with mixed leaves and hazelnut dressing ( ? 5.95 ) or pan-fried scallops with black pudding and raisin caper gribiche ( ? 7.95 ) . Out of a total of seven choices , three were vegetarian . <p> We began to look at the main courses , of which there were again just seven . My son and I both chose corn fed guinea fowl chorizo and pistachio ballentine served with sweet potato dauphinoise ( ? 16.95 ) after listening to the waitress 's description of the dish . My sister-in-law order the grilled fillet of beef with creamed wild mushrooms , sweet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a side order of creamed leaf spinach ( ? 2.95 ) . My brother and my son 's partner both decided on duck breast accompanied by braised cabbage , prune and apple compote and Calvados sauce ( ? 18.95 ) with a side order of creamed potatoes ( ? 2.95 ) . Lamb and brill were also on the menu , but there was only one vegetarian option - spiced feta samosas with roasted vegetables ( ? 13.95 ) . <p> It was n't too long a wait before the main courses were served . The guinea fowl chorizo was beautifully presented , with two thick diagonal slices standing on end on a bed of spinach alongside a square of sweet potato dauphinoise . The meat was very tender and the pistachio filling added an interesting texture and flavour . I 'm not usually a great fan of sweet potato , but I loved it in the dauphinoise form . The dish was finished off with a sauce which I think may have been madeira . <p> The beef and duck were equally well appreciated , and when we had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Such food is far too good to waste . <p> We sometimes find that restaurants serve the main course promptly and then tend to forget that their customers perhaps ca n't wait hours before ordering desserts . At No. 8 , however , the waitress brought dessert menus not long after we had finished the main course . All desserts , including cheese , are ? 5.95 . My sister-in-law and I both picked the pineapple tarte tatin with cardamon yoghurt ice-cream . My brother and my son both ordered cherry bakewell tart with kirsch and almond ice-cream . My son 's partner decided he still had room for steamed chocolate fudge pudding with blood orange jelly and white chocolate ice-cream . Vanilla panacotta is also on the menu . At this point my brother also ordered a Budweiser ( ? 3 ) . <p> The tarte tatin was not the most impressive one to look at , but it was not lacking in taste or appetising smell . The pastry base was sweet and the pineapple fruity of course , but the cardamon ice cream had a fragrance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The cherry bakewell tart looked amazing , served with a crescent-shaped wafer that curled up in the air from under the ice cream . My son 's partner found the chocolate pudding very filling , but he did enjoy it . The jelly came in a slender glass with the ice-cream resting on top . <p> No. 8 offers a range of coffees and teas as well as hot chocolate , but none of us felt the need to order a hot drink . <p> Our bill came to ? 160.95 to which a 12.5% service charge of ? 20.12 was added , making a total of ? 181.07 . Friday and Saturday evenings are the most expensive times to dine at No. 8 , as there is no set menu offers on either of those evenings . <p> Brasserie No. 8 may seem to be in a slightly isolated location , but it is in fact in walking distance of Southsea 's Palmerston Road shopping precinct , Southsea common , Gunwharf Quays and Portsmouth and Southsea station . It is barely two minutes from Portsmouth City Museum and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ live in walking distance of the restaurant , so I ca n't give information about parking . Bus services 1 and 40 run along Kings Road , while the 5 and the 23 stop close by . <p> The restaurant is open every day for lunch from 12 noon until 3pm ( Sundays until 5pm ) . It is open in the evenings every day except Sunday from 6.30pm until 9.30pm . ( The bar closes at midnight . ) A two-course set menu is available at lunchtime for ? 9.50 per head . Otherwise prices for lunch main courses range from ? 5.95 for a classic club sandwich to ? 12.95 for grilled sirloin steak . For Sunday lunch there is a different menu including three choices of roast as well as sea bass or pumpkin risotto cakes . From Monday to Thursday you can ' dine with wine ' from a set menu in the evening ; two courses are ? 17.95 a head , whereas three courses are ? 21.95 . <p> There is a ramp over the two steps up to the front door and toilets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not a problem . <p> Although some people would be unhappy about the addition of the service charge to the bill and others not satisfied by the limited vegetarian options , I feel I have to award five stars to Brasserie No. 8 . The five of us all agreed that it was definitely the best culinary experience we have had in either Portsmouth or Southsea . We also felt that the setting itself and the design of the interior were unique and very special . The service was hard to fault , and other than one sticky menu cover the standard of cleanliness was extremely high . I hope I will be able to return to No. 8 King 's Road , although I would be happy to go for the set menu on a weekday evening or for lunch . I heartily recommend this restaurant to anyone visiting Southsea or Gunwharf Quays as an alternative to local chain restaurants . <p> AboutMyArea use cookies to enable some advanced functionality , including those used by 3rd parties such as Google Analytics and AddThis .

@@1424237 <h> Plan B - Strictland Business <p> Rapper-turned-singer speaks about his new direction ... <p> Photo : <p> In an upstairs room of a ramshackle old pub in East London , Ben Drew sits frantically rubbing his leg . Despite being kitted out in a thick woollen hat , pale denim jacket and jeans , it 's clear from the thickness of each icy breath that accompanies every word that even the hardiest of arctic explorers would do well to survive in this environment . Not even the army of heaters that his publicist has assembled on the floor seems capable of breaking through the impenetrable cold front . <p> While this uncomfortable environment would , you imagine , irk most musicians , for Drew - better known as the rapper Plan B - it presents little concern . After all , as someone who grew up only a handful of postcodes further east from here in Forest Gate , he 's experienced far worse . His debut album , ' Who Needs Actions When You Got Words ' , for example , ambitiously tackled the type of issues - from knife crime to underage sex - that Drew regularly encountered first hand . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the record 's coarse - and often angry - narrative , which was constructed around an acoustic guitar , proved too much for some , even managing to raise an eyebrow from British hip-hop 's most prominent exponent , Tim Westwood . Consequently , the then 23-year-old 's music career stalled somewhat , and he seemed to disappear almost as quickly as he had arrived armed with his self-styled mantra : " This is my time now , you get me ? Fucking cunts . " <p> It speaks volumes , then , that we 're here today braving the elements to discuss Drew 's forthcoming second album , ' The Defamation of Strictland Banks ' . Like his debut , the 13-track LP continues to explore Drew 's interest in the craft of story telling , only this time it 's based around the fictional character of Strictland Banks , a sharp-suited British soul singer who loses everything when he ends up in prison for a crime he did n't commit . It 's a vibrant , voluptuous-sounding record , which references Stax , Motown and , most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my love of soul music , " says Drew , of the album 's origins . <p> Now 26 , Drew says he 's been writing soul songs ever since he was introduced to Michael Jackson as a seven-year-old - it 's only now that he feels secure enough to actually sing them . " I was going to be a singer but I had a lack of confidence in everything - the way I dressed , the way I sung , " he admits . It was only when he performed his debut album with a backing band that Drew learned for the first time about the technical side to singing . " As soon as that happened everything just clicked , and I went from being just a songwriter behind the scenes to a singer-songwriter . " <p> This newfound confidence , Drew says , was aided by the fact that his new material was " just too good for me to fucking put on a shelf and let rot and not show to the world " . He stops to stimulate some more blood flow through his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he continues . " You make something that 's just good then why hide it because it does n't fit into your profile or how people perceive you . " <p> When I interviewed Drew shortly after the release of his first record , he displayed a similar level of courage towards overcoming stereotypes . He had then , after all , taken it upon himself to try his hand at mastering a music genre that 's still , in many people 's eyes , performed most successfully by black artists . Yet in 2006 , as the lyrics on his debut album highlighted , Drew 's bravado often manifested itself through his own anger . Talking to him today , however , he 's noticeably both physically and mentally more relaxed - the result of a year attending anger management classes . <p> " I was an angry guy was n't I ? " he admits , when I ask him if he thinks he 's changed . " You could hear it .

" And it 's not that at all - it just means that you 're emotionally ill and you learn how to control your emotions and how they affect your life . " He says his anger stemmed from his belief that " everybody 's got something that 's been broken inside of them because their parents put it there " and describes his 12 months receiving therapy as " the most unhappiest year " . But he would advise anyone with similar issues to get help . " I 've spent a lot of time trying to fix those things and I 've come out the other side . " He smiles . " Music is my therapy .

His credits so far include an appearance in BAFTA-award winning actor Noel Clarke 's directorial debut Adulthood in 2008 and , more recently , alongside Sir Michael Caine in Daniel Barber 's Harry Brown . The latter film , Drew says , " made people take me more seriously " and encouraged him to write his first full-length feature . <p> Entitled Ill Manors ( " Spelt Manors as in where you 're from , " he points out ) , the film , which is due to go into production later this year , follows " six short stories that all mix into each other , but come to a head at the end " . It is , he says more plainly , " the hip-hop musical version of Paul Haggis 's 2005 film Crash " . <p> Drew says he 's also hoping to shoot a featurette about his present alter ego , Strictland Banks . But first , he 's focusing on the album , which he poignantly describes as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I guess , that 's my aspiration in life , " he adds . " When people see the name Plan B or see my face it represents the way in which I express myself , which is an amalgamation of music and films .

" I 'm aware that there are fans out there that might feel alienated by this but I feel like I cater for them ; I feel like I have catered for them , they just do n't know it yet , " he replies enigmatically , adding that a hip-hop album , which " explains all the gaps " in Strictland 's story , will be released later this year on his own label , Pet Cemetery . <p> I had intended to ask Drew whether he was now a rapper or singer , yet , as another cold breath emerges from his mouth , its clear that he already sees himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a parallel to culture 's desire to evolve , as it always has done .

@@1424240 <p> Earlier this month , the Turkish Ministry of Health revised its regulations pertaining to assisted reproduction technologies ( ARTs ) . The new regulatory structure considerably extends the specifications and requirements for the practice of ARTs in Turkey , and introduces a range of additional prohibitions . Two new developments are particularly striking . The first stipulates that all women in their first cycle of IVF can only have a single embryo transferred , with a maximum of two embryos for women over 35 on their second and women under 35 on their third or subsequent IVF cycles . The second bans partaking in or facilitating travel in pursuit of donor gametes . <p> Although the former , with fears that it will significantly reduce IVF success rates and effect a large proportion of those seeking fertility treatments , has generated greater controversy and more adverse reactions from patients and practitioners within Turkey , the latter signals a more worryingly restrictive attitude towards the autonomy and rights of citizens which may have international implications . <p> Cross-border reproductive care ( CBRC ) , sometimes referred to as ' reproductive tourism ' or ' reproductive exile ' , is now a worldwide phenomenon . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ history ( namely in the pursuit of abortions , sterilisation and contraception ) , the more recent coupling of the forces of globalisation with the heterogeneity of ART regulations have facilitated and fuelled unprecedented flows of reproductive travel across national borders . As such , there have been concerted attempts made by various international organisations , including the ESHRE Task Force on Ethics and Law ( 1 ) , ICMART ( 2 ) , and the first international forum on CBRC convened in Canada in January 2009 ( 3 ) , both to address the legal and ethical issues involved and to gather accurate information . Increasingly debates are taking place at the national level , concerning the extent to which CBRC impacts national maternity services ( 4 ) and the duties or ethical obligations of practitioners and regulators . Indeed , a large portion of a recent horizon-scanning seminar organised by the UK 's Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority ( HFEA ) Committee on Ethics and Law was devoted particularly to issues surrounding CBRC . <p> Yet , opinions on whether CRBC is ' a problem ' per se @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrangement by which a few can afford to ' buy their way out ' of the ethical and moral choices provided in their own jurisdictions ( 5 ) , or as the slide down the slippery slope of de-regulation ( 6 ) , others argue that it is ' a pragmatic solution ' ( 7 ) . The central debate in CBRC ' is the question of the appropriate balance to be struck between the moral views of the majority and individual human rights and freedoms ; whether it is legitimate to restrict an individual 's reproductive autonomy and , if so , to what extent such restrictions may be applied . ' ( 8 ) <p> Until the introduction of the new regulations , Turkish citizens who needed ( and wanted ) donor sperm , eggs or surrogacy could bypass the national ban on all forms of third-party assisted reproduction by seeking ARTs elsewhere , most commonly in nearby Northern Cyprus . As a developing infrastructure of inter-clinic collaborations facilitated covert and seamless treatments , newspapers reported that ' around 2-3000 patients per year ' sought donor gametes in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ December 2008 , Turkish views regarding CRBC were divided . Some argued that the Turkish government and the Turkish public were ' not yet ready ' to legalise donation , but , since they saw it as a private matter , were glad to offer their desperate patients an alternative solution . Others criticised the practice as commercialised , deceitful , and unethical . One practitioner even assessed the former attitude of the government as amounting to systematic hypocrisy : ' It is like saying it is illegal to kill a man here , if you want , you have to go and do it in Cyprus ! ' <p> According to Irfan Sencan , the director of the Ministry of Health 's Treatment Services department , the new ban on reproductive travel was added in response to the growth of this phenomenon in recent years . ' It is a way of breaking Turkish law abroad , ' he argued . ( 9 ) According to Articles 18.6 and 18.7 in the new ART regulation , referring patients abroad for donor treatments is forbidden , and in the event @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prohibited activities , ' the person who has conducted this procedure , the persons who have referred patients or acted as an intermediary , the impregnated person , and the donor ' will be reported to the state prosecutor . Turkish clinics engaged in providing or facilitating CBRC with donor gametes will be closed-down for three months in the first instance , and indefinitely on subsequent instances , all professionals involved will have their practice certificates nullified . These strict prohibitions against CBRC involving donor gametes have been justified with reference to ( the existing ) item 231 of the Turkish Penal Code , according to which it is illegal to ' change or obscure a child 's ancestry ' , with a punishment of one to three years imprisonment . <p> Even if we put aside ( for the moment ) the moral implications of these amendments , it is clear that they create myriad regulatory conundrums . Several commentators have pointed out the impossibility of controlling and detecting such extraterritorial activities , particularly since , as Sibel Tuzcu , President of ? IDER ( Turkey 's prolific infertility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gametes as a last resort are already extremely secretive about this information ( personal communication ) . Some newspaper reports have suggested that the CBRC ban is a reference to two recent cases , both sensationalised and widely discussed by the media , in which an actress and a model respectively became ' single mothers by choice ' using donor sperm obtained from clinics abroad . While it is possible that these ' extreme ' cases acted as a catalyst for these amendments , I believe that in essence and in practice , the regulation targets Turkish clinics ' activities , rather than the activity of individuals . However , by effectively tying the hands of professionals , the ban on CBRC significantly curtails the resources ( to information , guidance and preparatory treatment at home ) of men and women who are already in an extremely difficult situation . <p> It is absolutely understandable that different countries will reach different regulatory conclusions regarding ARTs , based on a variety of factors including cultural attitudes , traditions , religious views , and the majority 's moral position . Yet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prohibited ' tolerance towards movement by minority members to other countries shows a healthy degree of relativism. ' ( 10 ) For Pennings CRBC is a safety valve that allows for dissent from majority opinion and demonstrates the absolute minimum of respect for the moral autonomy of individuals . Those inclined to agree - whether as members of the public , as concerned practitioners , or as individuals desperate to pursue donor treatments - are likely to experience increased pressure , as the valve is blocked while the regulatory heat rises . <p> The shortage of egg and sperm donors , and the cost of IVF in the UK , need to be addressed to reduce the number of people travelling abroad for fertility treatment , according to a report published this week .... <p> Zippi Brand Frank 's documentary ' Google Baby ' gives us a fascinating insight into the global business of making babies .

" When I announce today that short skirts have ended their reign , " he began , " and I prophesy long skirts , I produce feelings of anxiety and disquiet . I am told that I am mad . Women swear they will never again wear long skirts . " <p> He was n't wrong -- at least , not in his analysis of women 's attitudes to their wardrobes ; his fashion prediction was a little further from the mark .

And in these fleshy times , anyone who does n't show their knees is considered a prude . <p> So it was with a mixture of trepidation and disbelief that the fashion set noted the return of the long skirt for summer . There are always a few floating around the collections to be slung on over bikinis for beach holidays , but when the trend continued at the autumn shows , we knew this was different . <p> " The long skirt has made a welcome return , " says Topshop 's skirt designer Mary McCarthy , " and it looks stronger and more versatile then ever . Whether worn with a distressed crop T-shirt for a rocky approach , or you choose a Woodstock vibe with a pretty vintage vest , the long skirt looks new and fresh . " <p> But not too fresh -- the look needs to be more grunge than boho . As soon as a floor-length skirt resembles anything akin to pastoral , it starts to look dated and ridiculous . Keep things urban by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a low-slung satchel . Above all , do n't let it get too pretty . <p> The problem with long skirts is the fact that they never seem to be conducive to any sort of fashion nonchalance . It 's hard to feel cool in a long skirt , because they carry such strong connotations of forced naivety , of dressing up -- of looking a bit like the village idiot , really . They 're seen as hyperbolically romantic or overtly gothic , neither of which really marks you out as a Serious Person . <p> " The long and lean styles have been a surprise hit , " says Emma Elwick-Bates , market editor at Vogue . " From Alexander Wang 's ' T ' line , Acne and River Island , they 're an alternative foundation to a cool urban look and are great paired with a military parka or a fisherman 's jumper and a no-nonsense flat .

It 's hard to look like you do n't care when you 're trailing yards of chiffon and have more flounces than a suburban valance . <p> Catwalk versions of the trend tended toward the gothic , with darkly beautiful offerings from Rick Owens and Gareth Pugh , and the minimal , with subverted basics at Yohji Yamamoto and Ann Demeulemeester . Yves Saint Laurent 's wins top prize for cute , with a graphic strawberry motif on ruffled white cotton , but it might be a challenge to pull off down the high street . <p> Jersey is really the ideal fabric , as it has the requisite heaviness to create a drop which carefully moulds to your figure , without ( and it 's crucial , this ) sticking to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cling to keep them out of Sienna Miller territory , but they should n't be skin-tight : you still need to walk , after all , and tight column skirts tend to make all but the most sylph-like resemble a sausage . <p> It may seem an unnecessary tautology to also point out that a long skirt needs to be long : that is , covering-the-feet length . Sodden hemlines and a dusty tidemark are rather adolescent , but anything flapping at ankle height is ( sorry to be blunt ) for squares . Do n't confuse the long skirt with the mid-length skirt -- which should hit the calf halfway between your knees and your feet -- and make sure yours rests on the tops of your shoes . <p> Keep colours subdued and choose from every variation of grey , from slate via heather to marl , or try navy and black .

Kielland capsized in the North Sea <p> The present director-general of the Petroleum Safety Authority Norway , Magne Ognedal , personally experienced the sinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ safety of a secure office on dry land . At the time , the dimensions of the incident were simply so incredible and unreal that the whole population of Norway was in shock . <p> Engineers who worked on safety at the Norwegian Petroleum Directorate in those days promised each other they would do their utmost to prevent anything similar from happening in the future . Thirty years on , it is appropriate that everybody remembers and reflects on the Kielland disaster . <p> Today 's offshore installations unquestionably incorporate substantially higher standards of safety and the working environment than they did 30 years ago and that reflects in part the lessons learnt from the Kielland disaster . It is very unlikely that another accident with the same causes could have similarly disastrous consequences today . <p> The real worry is that the industry may be losing focus . Many of the young people entering the oil and gas business would have scarcely heard of the Alexander L Kielland and must be reminded of previous disasters and learn from the mistakes of earlier generations . <p> We must never forget @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and do our uttermost to prevent anything like the Kielland accident from happening again . <p> The Kielland disasterThe Alexander L. Kielland was a Pentagon-type semi-submersible located in the Ekofisk Field for Phillips Petroleum , acting as a floating hotel for workers from the Edda Platform . Around 1830 hours on 27 March 1980 , one of the main horizontal braces supporting one of the five legs failed due to gale force winds and high seas . The failure of the brace was later attributed to a fracture which had developed around a hole in the structure which a hydrophone , used to aid the positioning of the rig , had been installed . After the failure of the first brace , the remaining five braces attached to the leg failed in quick succession causing the leg to break off . The rig almost immediately listed to one side , partially submerging the main deck and accommodation block . <p> The initial collapse occurred within a minute but the Kielland remained floating for about another 14 minutes . During this time , a number of attempts were made to launch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ successfully . Three of the lifeboats were smashed against the rig 's legs as result of the storm winds and waves whilst being lowered , leading to a number of casualties . After around 15 minutes , as water flowed into another two of the rig 's legs , the last anchor wire parted and the rig rolled over completely with only the undersides of its legs visible above the surface . <p> On top of the high winds and waves , the men also faced near freezing waters with little protection . While some did manage to swim to the Edda Platform , which the flotel served , others were swept away by 10m waves and strong currents as they attempted to reach rescue boats or other rigs . <p> There were 212 men aboard the Kielland -- 123 perished and only 89 survived .

@@1444233 <h> Saab 's Mini rivalling 9-2 scooped by CAR <p> At last month 's Geneva motor show , new Saab owner , Spyker CEO Victor Muller , told CAR of his desire to build a new Saab 9-2 . Today we publish two new artist 's impressions revealing Saab 's Mini rival and a dossier on the latest news of the 9-2 project . <p> Muller has shown selected journalists , including CAR 's Gavin Green , his own hand-drawn sketch of the 9-2 he envisages -- and these are our interpretation of those drawings . Our CGIs depict a modern take on Saab design , mixing some cues from the past but a healthy dose of modern attitude . <p> So when is the new Saab 9-2 coming ? <p> Here 's the rub . At present , the 9-2 is a twinkle in the eyes of Muller and Saab Automobile chief exec Jan ? ke Jonsson .

It would be ' a small car , a quirky car , a Saab in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mini , in other words . It ' would be in the A-segment , slightly north of the Mini , ' said Muller . Let 's be very clear about this : I do n't think a Saab 9-2 would compete with the Mini . It will be as iconic a design as the Mini though ... A new Saab 9-2 would not be retro -- it would be a massive mistake to make it into a retro car . But to have all the Saab DNA in it and to be a very modern Saab -- that would be our wish . ' <p> What 's stopping them from building the 9-2 ? <p> The small matter of making Saab profitable again . The new management has a plan in place to achieve this through sales of the new 9-5 arriving this summer , the 9-4X coming in 2011 and the new 9-3 in 2012 . Those three product lines are keeping newly independent Saab , which built just 39,000 cars in 2009 , quite busy enough . It just does n't have the funds to commit to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ according to plan , expect to see the 9-2 approved for production .

The Swedes are talking to numerous groups on partnerships ; likely suitors would include GM ( a future Vauxhall Corsa matrix ) , Ford ( think Ka-500 co-opeartion ) and maybe even emerging Chinese partners looking to tap into Saab 's experience in turbocharging , green fuel tech and western production standards . <p> Muller said : ' The choice of a tech partner is imperative if we come to do a Saab 9-2 . There are so many things that need to happen before you have a proper design , a clay model , to an engineered product to a car in production . ' <p> The 9-2 would most likely be a small front-wheel drive hatch with limited bodystyles and a slew of downsized petrol and diesel engines . Saab 's entire range is turbocharged , so expect very low-capacity motors to help cut CO2 and serve up performance required for a Saab ; the Swedes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could we see the new Saab 9-2 ? <p> The current business plan runs to 2016-2017 , and the 9-2 sadly ai n't in it . If revenues recover and Saab sales head far north of 100,000 per year , then it could be approved with Muller eyeing 9-2 sales of between 30,000-50,000 annually . The breakeven point for the newly independent Saab business will be around 80,000 units by 2012 . <p> ' It 's wonderful to talk to you about the 9-2 , but other than this drawing it 's just a great plan , ' admits Muller . ' We have a business plan with three models which will bring the company into profitability . ' <p> Here 's hoping .

I found that out on a visit in 1996 , particularly when talking to local Red Army veterans at a retirement home in the run-down capital Bishkek . <p> They feared corruption and chaos with a Kyrgyz administration , fears that appear to have been fully born out . <p> This is not some **25;30;TOOLONG coup <p> Michael McFaulUS National Security Council <p> The Tulip Revolution of 2005 threw out the crony government of Askar Akayev and replaced it with the cronyism and nepotism of President Bakiyev @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been the motive behind this latest upheaval . <p> Not the Cold War <p> This is not old Cold War-style competition . <p> Russia is actually helping Nato to send supplies to Afghanistan . <p> Already occupied with its own Islamist problems , Moscow certainly does not want a Taliban victory there . <p> President Bakiyev played games over the base with the Russians and Americans last year <p> On the other hand , it wants to maintain as much influence as possible in the region , so the Russian pendulum swings from time to time between helping and hindering the US . <p> At the moment , relations are good . <p> The new nuclear arms treaty has just been signed . President Barack Obama has withdrawn the anti-missile defence system from Poland and the Czech Republic . <p> Michael McFaul , the director for Russian and Eurasian affairs on President Obama 's National Security Council , does not see the hand of Russia in the revolution . <p> " This is not some anti-American coup , that we know for sure . This is not some **25;57;TOOLONG coup @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Source of income <p> Nevertheless there have been hints from some in the group now taking control in Kyrgyzstan that they have their eyes on the Manas base . <p> One of them , Omurbek Tekebayev , who has taken over constitutional affairs , told Reuters news agency : " You 've seen the level of Russia 's joy when they saw Bakiyev gone . So now there is a high probability that the duration of the US air base 's presence in Kyrgyzstan will be shortened . " <p> This remains to be seen . <p> The leader of the interim government , the former Foreign Minister ( and ambassador to the UK ) Roza Otunbayeva , said there were no plans to review the Manas agreement . <p> The continuation of US operations from the Manas airbase is America 's only real interest in what is happening in Kyrgyzstan now <p> James NixeyChatham House , London <p> The new government , if confirmed in power , might find that the US base - formally called since last year a " Transit Centre " in deference to local @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President Bakiyev played games over the base with the Russians and Americans last year . <p> Announcing that Manas would be closed , he got Moscow to give him a $2bn loan and then turned round and got the Americans to increase their rent from $17m to $60m a year and extended the lease for another year until this July . <p> His parliament , having voted to close the base , promptly reversed its position . <p> The rent - plus extra direct aid from the US of $117m - is not to be ignored in a country where the income per person is a few dollars per day . <p> So the conclusion of many outside observers is that the air base will carry on . <p> James Nixey of Chatham House in London says : " The continuation of US operations from the Manas airbase is America 's only real interest in what is happening in Kyrgyzstan now . <p> " This concern is probably unfounded as any future Kyrgyz government will need the money and will shoulder the political flak .

@@1446232 <p> Two German women have been accused of trying to check the dead body of a 91-year-old relative on to a plane in Liverpool . I 'm tempted to say that this would make a great movie , but actually it is something of a cinematic clich ? already . As well as Weekend at Bernie 's and National Lampoon 's Vacation , to name two examples from the film world , it also crops up in sitcoms , such as Steptoe and Son and Fawlty Towers , and in the theatre ( well , Joe Orton was fond of the conceit ) . The point is that these were all comedies , and so , however macabre the alleged misdemeanour , you can not help but feel some sympathy towards the two women . <p> Also , assuming they knew a little about how bureaucracy works in this country , you can appreciate why they might have tried it on . The red tape involved in notification of a death is considerable . If you are planning to repatriate the body as well , you not only need a death certificate from a doctor , but also a " free from infection " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , finally , a valid passport . And German consular staff would have had to inspect the coffin before sealing it . <p> It is ironic that the body happened to be going back to Germany , once the most bureaucratic nation on earth .

The EU generates much of it , but we also bring a lot of it on ourselves , as with our over-managed NHS and BBC . <p> Sometimes the bureaucracy is more a bad habit than anything else . Our obsession with reference numbers is a case in point . Ring any utility company , shopping chain or bank and , after 10 minutes of going through options -- press 1 , press 2 and so on -- you will be asked to give your name and postcode , as well as your date of birth or mother 's maiden name , " for security " .

The paperwork from Defra has been unbelievable -- long forms that have to be filled out in triplicate , passports , holding numbers and so on . You then have to contact the local council , the vet , and some other agency in Reading whose name escapes me . And even after all this , I have had three visits from Defra officials , double-checking the information on my forms . <h> Related Articles <p> The problem was that the friend dropped the pigs off in a trailer one day without first filling in a transportation form .

These two Tests have been moved to England because of the security situation in Pakistan , which has prevented any country touring there since March last year . <p> There is no way of knowing what the Pakistani reaction will be if Kaneria , one of their two main bowlers , is publicly accused of wrong-doing in England . Yesterday he insisted that his career was " unstained " and was " surprised " at the allegations . <p> Relations between the England and Wales Cricket Board and the Pakistan Cricket Board have been cordial since the forfeited Oval Test of 2006 : hence the ECB 's offer to stage Pakistan 's two Tests against Australia , the first experiment with neutral Tests in this country since 1912 . <p> However , the Pakistan government -- especially the Senate 's sports committee -- has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , evidenced by one-year bans and fines slapped on several Pakistan players after their win-less tour of Australia over the new year . <p> A government that is practically under siege at home , and which is able to exploit the national sport of cricket to its advantage , is all too liable to make Pakistan 's schedule of six Tests in England a pawn in its current dealings with the West . <h> Related Articles <p> If a complete or partial pull-out this summer -- in defence of national honour and ' face ' -- is the worst-case scenario for England , then six Tests without Kaneria would be a minor disaster on the playing side , because it is almost inconceivable that Pakistan could win a Test without him . <p> Kaneria is the best wrist-spinner in international cricket , following the retirement of Shane Warne , Stuart MacGill and Anil Kumble .

In the background is the whole problem of the illegal betting industry in India , in which a large portion of India 's black economy -- estimated at half of the total economy -- is recycled , thus avoiding taxation . <p> The sums involved are beyond the imagination of those involved in legal betting . The International Cricket Council estimated that the equivalent of $1 billion was gambled in India on one game in the 2003 World Cup in South Africa , between India and Pakistan at Centurion . <p> In the popular film about India 's underworld , Slumdog Millionaire , one of the most chilling scenes in the original book , Q and A , was omitted from the film : a scene in which the hero works as a servant for a Mumbai gangster who makes his money out of illegal betting on cricket matches which are screened live on television . <p> The most interesting point so far about the alleged " match irregularities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ televised in Britain -- and ESPN Star had the rights to televise it in India too . <p> Knowledge is money -- serious money .

The trouble arose in the 1970s from fixture-scheduling : in the middle of a County Championship match a limited-overs game , usually a Sunday League match between the same two counties , would be staged . The temptation was there for the team doing better in the championship to come to an arrangement -- a tacit accommodation , or something worse -- with the team doing well in the Sunday League . <p> In the 1990s English cricket was assumed to be safe from the match-fixing for money that was rife in Asia , if not through some inherent virtue then because England did not tour India or Pakistan between 1993 and 2000 .

@@1446236 <h> Grand National : Picking a winner is easy as 1-2-3 <p> " It 's a bit of a lottery , in n it , " is the typical view of a novice punter when it comes to the Grand National . <p> Understandable enough when faced with trying to pick the winner from 40 horses who will be going hell for leather over a stamina-sapping four-and-a-half-mile course filled with frightening obstacles that look like great green tower blocks through the Beeb 's aerial camera . <p> But apply a few simple rules to your betting and the field can be rapidly narrowed down to a much more manageable number . Then you can stick your pin in or look for the name you like , if you really have to . <p> 1 . Pound for pound <p> Let 's start with weight . Not the stuff the girls on Ladies ' Day spend all year trying to lose so they can look good in a couple of square inches of fabric while braving the chilly wind blowing around Aintree . Rather , how much the horse carries . For several years the British Horseracing Authority 's chief handicapper , Phil Smith , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allowing them to run off a lower mark than their official rating suggests they should . To no avail . Only once in the past 25 years has a horse won the race carrying more than 11st . That was Hedgehunter in 2005 which carried , ahem , 11st 1lb . <p> 2 . Age of reason <p> Applying the weight rule knocks 15 horses out of the running , leaving us with a much more manageable 25 . Another three of those can be ruled out on the grounds of age . They say youth will have its day , but not in the National . The last time a seven-year-old won was Bogskar -- way back in 1940 . Seven-year-olds just do n't have the requisite stamina for the Aintree spectacular . Significantly , no seven-year-old has appeared in the top five in the last decade . So cross out Piraya and Palypso De Creek ( most have already , they 're long shots ) but also The Package . The David Pipe team , winners two years ago with Comply or Die , are unlikely to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the odds say . The stats suggest that the most likely winner will be aged between nine and 12 , but there 's been a smattering of eight-year-olds filling the placings in recent years and Bindaree in 2002 proved it could be done , so we should n't rule them out . <p> 3 . Preparation game <p> Eliminating the three seven-year-olds gets us down to 22 . The next step is to rule out anything that has n't had a prep run in the previous six weeks ( you have to go back to 1985 to find a winner that managed the feat without one ) . That takes out Royal Rosa ( off the track since 20 January ) , Flintoff ( off since December ) , Irish Raptor ( December ) Maljimar ( December ) and the well fancied State Of Play ( November ) . Which leaves 17 contenders . <p> 4 . On a run ? <p> From here it starts getting a bit more subjective . However , while a relatively recent run is a good thing , a recent win is n't necessarily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ definitely is n't . National winners tend to be trained specifically with the race in mind and so a relatively gentle preparation is a good sign . Winning races requires a horse to put in close to maximum effort and will ruin a handicap mark by putting a horse up in the weights . <p> Of course , Comply or Die gave the lie to this , winning the gruelling four-mile Eider Chase at Newcastle before his victory . One of the problems with following statistics is that horses ca n't count . Still , with 17 runners we need to trim the field a little so ( maybe controversially ) let 's take out Eric 's Charm , Beat The Boys , Ellerslie George and Ballyholland , each of which have been expending energy in winning lesser races this season . <p> 5 .

@@1449238 <p> I 've put the words " American professor " in inverted commas , not because he is n't really American or really a professor , but because it 's a direct quote from the news story . It 's a funny thing that being a professor -- of any subject , at any university -- seems to make you an authority on anything at all . So Prof Philip Haseley , a professor of anthropology at the Niagara County Community College in New York State , is now held up as an expert on alien life . <p> Let 's be clear : I 'm not saying a belief in alien life per se is ridiculous . The debate over whether or not we are alone in the universe is huge and ongoing . The most famous tool we have is the Drake Equation , which -- using estimated figures like how many stars there are in the universe , how quickly they 're formed , how many planets they have on average , how many of those planets could support life ( and how many of those then do ) , and so on -- attempts to work out how many extraterrestrial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ communicate with . <p> One set of current figures puts that number at two , but that is highly controversial ; a few minor tweaks to the estimated inputs can easily raise it as high as 20,000 or as low as 0.000065 , which would imply that we are almost certainly alone in our stellar neighbourhood . This continuing argument is the basis of SETI , the Search for Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence , which for 50 years has scanned the skies for signals which could only come from intelligent life ( and there is , of course , a further argument over what that means ) . <p> But even if we assume the 20,000 figure , the nearest alien civilisation would probably be about 1,500 light years from Earth . So what Professor Haseley is proposing we take seriously is the following : <p> 1 ) That one or more alien civilisations have either developed vastly faster-than-light propulsion systems or flown for a minimum of 1,500 years across space to find us2 ) That having done so , they neither make contact with our leaders , nor annihilate us in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ technology3 ) That instead they appear to some not-always-stable individuals in remote communities , either bearing confused messages of generic peace-and-goodwill or briefly kidnapping them , usually for bizarre semi-sexual purposes <p> And there is no such evidence .

" It 's reminiscent of creationist logic -- " you ca n't explain this chemical pathway/complex organ/unfound fossil , therefore God did it " , and like creationist logic it cheapens what it wants to promote . <p> It is a weak and attenuated religion that hides God in a dwindling supply of feeble , unexplained details , instead of seeing God in the whole glory of the universe ; and it is a sad misrepresentation of the serious and important search for alien life to reduce it to conspiracy theory and nonsense . <p> I do n't know Prof Haseley , or the Niagara County Community College .

@@1453232 @ @ now your mortgage &amp;ndash ; and be free earlier <p> As savings rates continue to offer poor returns , many people are turning to mortgage overpayments as a way to save money . The potential benefits are enticing but it 's essential to check the small print before you rush to overpay as early repayment penalty charges can be costly . There 's also the risk of locking cash away when you may suddenly need it if you were to lose your job or were unable to work . <p> But first the benefits of overpaying . It cuts back on the overall interest a borrower has to pay over the term of the mortgage and actually cuts the length of the term , meaning further savings and a chance to be mortgage-free much more quickly . <p> Such savings have tempted many savvy homeowners to capitalise on the current record low interest rates to overpay their mortgages , according to latest figures from the Bank of England . UK property owners injected ? 4bn of equity into their homes in the last three months of 2009 . <p> Most mortgage lenders will let you overpay by up to 10 per cent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made the decision to allow up to 20 per cent overpayments on variable rates . Recent research conducted on behalf of Lloyds by Opinion Matters shows that around one in four consumers are already choosing to overpay their mortgage . Around half say they overpay their mortgage to reduce the term while just over a fifth say they overpay in order to pay less interest . <p> Michael White from the online mortgage broker Email Mortgages believes those who can afford to overpay should be doing so right now . He says : " In the current situation it is important to overpay where possible because when rates do eventually rise , and this is only a matter of time , borrowers who have overpaid and therefore have more equity in their property will be in a much better position to access more competitive mortgage deals . <p> " Lenders are still offering the best rates to those with greater equity and if borrowers can get their loan-to-value down below 60 per cent they will be seen as much more attractive to lenders and will be able to pick up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Coventry Building Society has just launched two fixed-rate mortgages -- Flexx Fixed -- that allow borrowers to overpay as much as they like with no penalty . Meanwhile the UK 's largest building society , Nationwide , will let you overpay by up to ? 500 a month . <p> Overpaying can particularly benefit first-time buyers if they have any spare cash . Hannah-Mercedes Skenfield from moneysupermarket.com says : " Flexible loans with an overpayment facility , such as HSBC 's 4.49 per cent term tracker , which allow unlimited overpayments , can also be beneficial for borrowers requiring a high loan-to-value ( LTV ) loan but wish to make additional payments . This kind of deal will allow a first-time borrower to purchase a property with a lower deposit before house prices increase and also chip away at their LTV in readiness to remortgage to a better , lower LTV deal in future . " <p> But borrowers should check with their own lender 's rules concerning mortgage overpayments . Pay more than the lender allows and borrowers will be penalised for doing so . And the penalties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter of a few pounds can trigger the early repayment charge which is normally charged as a percentage of the mortgage amount or can be as much as six months ' interest . <p> Melanie Bien , director of the mortgage broker Savills Private Finance , says those constrained by the terms of their current mortgage should carefully do their calculations before jumping ship to a more flexible deal . <p> She says : " If your lender will not let you overpay , or you are thinking of switching to a lender who is more generous in its overpayment terms , make sure you do your sums carefully . If you have to pay an early repayment charge to exit your existing deal and end up switching to a higher mortgage rate , work out whether it is in your interests to do so in order to increase your overpayments . <p> " You may be better off staying put for now , overpaying by as much as you can and keeping any extra cash in a savings account ready to clear a further chunk off the mortgage when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be aware that it is unlikely they will be able to access the money after they have overpaid , so they must be totally sure they can afford it . While in the past lenders have allowed overpayers to also underpay , take payment holidays or draw down from the amount that has been overpaid , this is now rarely the case . <p> Also , in the current market , securing new borrowing facilities is more difficult , and the chance of being rejected is much higher . It is wise to retain a larger amount of spare cash before overpaying the mortgage as an extra safety net , especially with the increased risk of redundancy since the onset of the credit crunch . <p> Ray Boulger from the broker John Charcol advises borrowers to be level-headed about their total indebtedness before rushing to overpay their mortgage , when other strategies could be more financially beneficial . He says : " The general principle should be to pay down the most expensive debt first from any spare cash or surplus savings , providing this can be done without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with credit cards but probably not with an unsecured loan . Therefore , before overpaying on the mortgage , credit card debts should be paid off unless they are on a 0 per cent balance transfer rate . " <p> Boulger points out that while most lenders now calculate interest daily a few , of which Leeds Building Society is the largest , still calculate interest annually on most of its mortgages . He says that borrowers with a daily interest mortgage will see the benefit of a lower interest charge as soon as they make an overpayment but anyone with a mortgage where interest is calculated annually needs to be careful when they overpay . <p> " They probably wo n't get any benefit until the end of the lender 's financial year on small overpayments , but larger payments , say a minimum of ? 500 or ? 1,000 , may be credited for interest calculation purposes at the end of the month or possibly straight away , providing certain conditions are met , " he says . " Anyone with a mortgage on annual interest should check @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of any overpayments . " <p> Michael White stresses that there are alternatives to making overpayments , especially for borrowers who are likely to need that money in the future . He says : " They are best advised to save it in an ISA , effectively keeping the cash liquid , while an ISA wrapper will ensure they do not pay tax on interest earned . Of course those with an offset mortgage have the best of both worlds in that their savings are being used to overpay plus they are able to access those savings at any time . Therefore , those serious about overpaying on a regular basis and using their savings to help should consider an offset mortgage , although they should be prepared to pay a slightly higher mortgage rate to access this type of product . " <p> With offset mortgages , instead of earning interest on the savings , the borrower offsets the interest they would have earned against the mortgage itself . An offset mortgage makes it possible to overpay without actually overpaying any more money each month ; simply by placing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> While an offset mortgage offers the highest degree of flexibility , many lenders ' mortgages are flexible and allow any overpayments to be used for payment holidays or to make underpayments . Conditions to be able to do this vary from lender to lender and so it is important to make sure any conditions imposed by the lender you propose using are acceptable before taking out the mortgage . <p> Ray Boulger says that many borrowers have this level of flexibility on the mortgage without realising it : " Some lenders , such as Alliance &amp; Leicester , offer an extra flexible feature on some mortgages in that overpayments can also be borrowed back as a lump sum at the mortgage rate . This degree of flexibility means that one can afford to make bigger overpayments than without this facility , as effectively the overpayments can become the savings account . " <p> One other option to overpaying for anyone who is permanently able to commit to higher regular payments is to shorten the term if on a repayment mortgage or if on interest-only switch to repayment . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to interest only if you subsequently want to reduce payments . Similarly , while all lenders will allow you to shorten the mortgage term they may not allow you to subsequently lengthen it again , even to the original term . <p> Overpaying : How the savings add up <p> The moneysupermarket.com website calculates that if an average borrower on the best standard variable rate available in November 2008 ( first direct at 5.69 per cent ) continued to make mortgage repayments at the same level , they would be overpaying by ? 105 a month , after the rate fell to 3.69 per cent . After 13 months with base rate at 0.5 per cent , such a borrower will have already saved themselves ? 772.32 in interest in the last 12 months alone . But over the term of the mortgage this additional payment of ? 105 would equal an overall saving of ? 14,519 in interest and would cut the mortgage term by six years and two months . @ @

A sort of musical equivalent of Brian Clough - the legendary football manager who took a Nottingham Forest team of misfits and miscreants to win the European Cup , twice - Smith 's core philosophy was " creative tension " or , as ex-members put it , a cross between a real life chess game where the musicians were the pawns and an extreme psychological warfare version of the carrot and the stick . <p> I heard of rapturously received gigs being followed by Smith 's complaints that his musicians were " Playing like a fuckin ' pub band " ; dressing room inquests that went on for hours ; band members being held hostage in dressing rooms and even being kidnapped and blindfolded . Some stories were inspired - how Smith could record a hit record in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - the great man falling asleep in a hotel lift and spending the night going up and down between floors to the bewilderment of American tourists making their way to breakfast ; some were both comical and disturbing - members being abandoned at foreign airports , tour bus drivers being drenched with beer while driving ; drummers being fired Mafiosi style with a fish 's head outside their door and guitarists being turfed out of the van in Swedish forests . I heard of drummers being fined a fiver every time they hit a certain drum ; bass players who were so traumatised by their time in The Fall they turned to acupuncture , transcendental mediation , free jazz or even training to become a travelling minstrel . For Smith , The Fall 's continued relevance relies on constantly " freshening up " the line-up .

When The Fall had a hit with the Kinks ' ' Victoria ' , I was dating a Victoria . Suzanne , my partner of 17 years , sealed her status as the love of my life when she moved in clutching Live at the Witch Trials .

She revealed how she 'd once been caught by the current in the Caribbean and heard Smith 's voice in her head telling her never to turn her back on the sea . She told how 1986 's ' Terry Waite Sez ' had predicted the Church Of England 's Special Envoy 's kidnap ; how ' Powder Keg ' had warned about the forthcoming Manchester bombing ; how 1992 's ' Free Range ' had warned of the " trouble " about to sweep Europe in the form of the Bosnia-Herzegovina ethnic cleansing ; how ' Kicker Conspiracy ' predicted the gentrification of football two decades before Roy Keane 's infamous " prawn sandwiches " rant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : cross Smith and you may end up cursed .

Two days later the journalist had been in a phone box when it was hit by a car . Was it now my turn ? Had my quest to find the Fallen got too close to Smith 's guarded " secrets " and resulted in him psychically giving me a Curse of The Fall ? <p> There 's been a few signifiers : weird solitary eagles hovering above me as I tried to find Karl Burns and a car suddenly appearing in my remote village bearing the number plate " MES " ( obviously , since Smith ca n't drive , it must have been driven by a secret Fall agent ) .

Most painfully of all , Suzanne - my partner of 17 years , since before the Extricate album - announced she was leaving me , her dissatisfaction having apparently started when I was " finding all those people in The Fall " . Inevitably , she dumped me for a trucker , a ' Container Driver ' , the title of my favourite Fall song . <p> Last year 's publication of a paperback version as The Fallen - Life In And Out Of Britain 's Most Insane Group ( containing even more ex-members ) seems to trigger another bout of the Curse .

The first garage I took it to botched the repair completely and expensively , the next one sorted it out but drained my wallet . Needless to say , within hours of receiving it back running as good as new , I 'd hit a concrete block on the motorway and managed to write off two wheels . <p> I 'd actually stopped looking for the Fallen after failing to find Karl Burns , a drummer who 'd been in the group for various spells before disappearing off the face of the earth after punching Smith onstage in New York in 1998 , when Smith lost virtually an entire line-up .

@@1454233 <p> Although Roman Polanski 's new thriller does n't exactly crackle with up-to-the-minute urgency , it does have a certain gossipy timeliness -- though perhaps not as much as it did in February , when it premiered at the Berlin Film Festival . <p> Tony Blair -- on whom one character might or might not be " based " , if it please the court -- had just appeared before the Chilcot inquiry on Iraq . And Polanski himself had recently been placed under house arrest in Switzerland , pending a decision on whether or not he 'd return to the United States to face his long-standing legal issues . If the spectre of Polanski 's 1970s sexual misdemeanours had n't been hovering , I doubt The Ghost would have been quite such news : the attention it drew in Berlin is testimony to the PR value of a director not turning up to promote his own film . <p> For British audiences , there 's a special curiosity value to The Ghost , which was jointly adapted by Robert Harris from his own novel . In this political mystery- ? -clef , Ewan McGregor plays a journalist who signs on to polish the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) after a previous ghost writer has met a mysterious end . McGregor flies to an island on America 's East Coast , where he sits down to grapple with Lang 's blandly indigestible slab of text . He must also grapple with the ego of the charismatic Lang -- played by Brosnan not as a smiley Tony-clone , more as a raffish , volatile matinee idol . Meanwhile , controversy is hotting up over Lang 's complicity with US renditions of suspected terrorists , and on the sidelines , Lang 's wife Ruth ( Olivia Williams ) is bitterly grinding her teeth -- which are altogether unlike Cherie Blair 's -- over her living conditions ( " It 's like living with Napoleon on St Helena " ) . <p> The Ghost is a polished entertainment , with a modicum of racy edge and much ominous atmosphere , German locations standing in for the rain-soaked Eastern seaboard . Harris 's plotting provides some taut Hitchcockian business : in the cleverest sequence , satnav gives McGregor the wherewithal to follow his predecessor 's ghostly path . There are some juicy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cagily respectable ; Kim Cattrall , crisply modelling a glassy English accent ; the rarely-spotted veteran Eli Wallach ; and , grabbing the film with both hands , a superb Olivia Williams , spiky and knowing . <p> Blair allusions notwithstanding , you 'll spot certain parallels with Polanski 's own situation . Facing the prospect of war crimes charges , Lang moans that he may never again be able to leave the US ; Polanski has long been unable to set foot there . Lang is temporarily exiled in a luxury villa , but Polanski ca n't have anticipated himself languishing behind locked doors in Gstaad . So it goes . <p> Still , these anecdotal points of interest do n't in themselves make The Ghost any more substantial . The film starts off drab and fusty -- a scene featuring a tweedy old-school publisher suggests that Polanski is n't getting out much these days , but then I suppose he is n't . By and by it all warms up , in its chilly way , but the solution to the mystery has a terrible " who'd-have-thought-it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Herg ?

In fact , his work for the past three decades has largely been routine , at best academic . The Ghost is one of his more accomplished recent films , but to claim that Polanski deserves concessions because he 's an above-par thriller director -- well , perhaps that 's a less compelling argument . Still , The Ghost is intelligent , reasonably engrossing fun , and would pass the time nicely if you watched it on a plane -- between Switzerland and LA , say . <p> Sterner stuff comes from Chinese director Lu Chuan , whose City of Life and Death is a grimly imposing evocation of the 1937 Japanese invasion of Nanjing . The same theme was explored from a European angle in the German film City of War @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago , about the German official who helped shelter refugees . Lu Chuan 's version , told from both Chinese and Japanese perspectives , has been a major success in China but has also got the director into deep trouble there . While painting a picture of horrific atrocities by the Japanese army , Lu tells his story partly from the point of view of a somewhat na ? ve Japanese sergeant ( Hideo Nakaizumi ) . This alone has earned the director hostility , even death threats , from Chinese viewers who have objected to him humanising the invading force , but it undoubtedly gives this stark film a more nuanced dimension . <p> Several key figures emerge : among them , Rabe 's secretary Tang ( Fan Wei ) , foolishly confident of his family 's safety ; a young Chinese woman press-ganged into prostitution ; and a doomed Kuomintang officer . Rabe is also prominent , but presented as ineffectual , ready to ship out when instructed by his Nazi masters .

An especially nightmarish sequence shows various styles of summary execution : different groups dispatched by bayonets , grenades , being buried alive or forced into the sea . <p> The film is precise in its recreation of time and place , but the severe sweep of the black-and-white photography also suggests an abstracted essence of war 's horror . Unashamedly harrowing , the film does n't need its occasional splashes of poignant orchestration to underline the emotion . Overall , this is a strikingly unsentimental and unglamorous production that looks and feels quite different from the grand-scale Chinese historical drama we 're used to : a sobering reinvention of the modern war epic .

She pushed aside nurses at the hospital who feared the hideous physical state of her husband would be too much for his wife . " It 's my husband , his blood , his brains are all over me , " she said . <p> Jackie put her wedding ring on to her husband 's finger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She refused to remove her blood-stained pink wool suit , even for the swearing in of Lyndon Johnson on Air Force One . She told the new president 's wife : " I want them to see what they have done to Jack . " <p> She was reluctant even to wash the blood from her face or from her white gloves . In her interview for Life magazine she said : " I saw myself in the mirror my whole face splattered with blood and brains . Later I said to Bobby Kennedy , what 's the line between histrionics and drama ? I should have kept the blood on . " <p> Rachel Weisz won the Evening Standard theatre award last year for her portrayal of Blanche DuBois in A Streetcar Named Desire . Her fragility and dignity in the role were remarkable . Here is a beautiful woman haunted by a marriage , fighting against mental disintegration . <p> Although Jackie Kennedy told her priests that she wanted to die to join her husband , there was no collapse , not even public tears . Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the greatest show of class . She put her blood-splattered pink suit into a box with her white taffeta wedding dress . She withdrew from public life to care for her two children , John and Caroline . But first she called her friend Theodore White from Life magazine to give an interview . As a sceptical American writer observed : " She wanted to take control of history . " <p> White was criticised by some for his unquestioning acceptance of Jackie Kennedy 's narrative of events , but what an interview . They talked until 2am and White dictated his piece from the Kennedy kitchen . Jackie Kennedy was both graphic in detail and determined in larger purpose . " His head was so beautiful ... I 'd tried to hold the top of his head down , maybe I could keep it in . I knew he was dead . I kept saying Jack , Jack , Jack . Jack . Jack can you hear me ? I love you , Jack .

" So all the seat was full of blood and roses . " <p> Then she spoke of the magic of Camelot . To stress the point , she scribbled beneath White 's notes " and it will never be that way again " . <p> Last week it was revealed that Caroline Kennedy had given permission for the release of a further six hours of interviews recorded in 1964 with Jackie by family friend Arthur Schlesinger . These interviews , to be published in 2011 , will illuminate further the Kennedy magic . <p> Rachel Weisz , like all actresses , is a woman in search of a great part . Fiction has nothing to match the moment that a president 's widow had the presence of mind to embalm her husband in the myth of Camelot . 
@@1454239 <h> From Macbeth to Watergate , it 's not the act that leads to nemesis , but the attempts to ' trammel up the consequence ' , writes Christopher Booker . <p> If you were faced with by far the biggest bill of your life , would you not want to be confident that there was a very good reason why you should pay it ? That is why we need to know just how far we can trust the science behind the official view that the world is threatened with catastrophe by global warming -- because the measures proposed by our politicians to avert this supposed disaster threaten to transform our way of life out of recognition and to land us with easily the biggest bill in history . ( The Climate Change Act alone , says the Government , will cost us all ? 18 billion every year until 2050 . ) <p> Yet in recent months , as we know , the official science on which all this rests has taken quite a hammering . Confronted with all those scandals surrounding the " Climategate " emails and the UN 's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change , the political and academic establishments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to show that the methods used to construct the official scientific case are wholly sound . But as was illustrated last week by two very different reports , these efforts to hold the line are themselves so demonstrably flawed that they are in danger of backfiring , leaving the science more questionable than ever . <p> The first report centred directly on the IPCC itself . When several of the more alarmist claims in its most recent 2007 report were revealed to be wrong and without any scientific foundation , the official response , not least from the IPCC 's chairman , Dr Rajendra Pachauri , was to claim that everything in its report was " peer-reviewed " , having been confirmed by independent experts . <p> But a new study put this claim to the test . A team of 40 researchers from 12 countries , led by a Canadian analyst Donna Laframboise , checked out every one of the 18,531 scientific sources cited in the mammoth 2007 report . Astonishingly , they found that nearly a third of them -- 5,587 -- were not peer-reviewed at all , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ propaganda leaflets and press releases put out by green activists and lobby groups . <p> In its own way even more damaging , however , was the report from a team led by Lord Oxburgh on the scientific integrity of the East Anglia Climatic Research Unit ( CRU ) . Two sets of evidence have been used more than anything else to drive the worldwide scare over global warming . One is a series of graphs showing how temperatures have suddenly shot up in recent decades to levels historically unprecedented . The other is the official record of global surface temperatures . For both of these , the CRU and the key group of top British and American scientists involved in those Climategate emails have been crucially responsible . <p> Lord Oxburgh himself is linked to various commercial interests which make money from climate change , from wind farms to carbon trading . None of the panel he worked with on his report were climate " sceptics " ; and one , Dr Kerry Emanuel , is an outspoken advocate of man-made global warming . Even so , it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be , based on two brief visits to the CRU and on reading 11 scientific papers produced by the research unit in the past 24 years , chosen in consultation with the Royal Society ( which is itself fanatical in promotion of warming orthodoxy ) . <p> The crown jewels of the IPCC 's case that the world faces catastrophic warming have been all those graphs based on tree rings which purport to show that temperatures have lately been soaring to levels never known before in history -- thus eradicating all the evidence that the world was hotter than today during the Medieval Warm Period , long before any rise in CO2 levels . Best known of these graphs , of course , was Michael Mann 's " hockey stick " , comprehensively discredited by the expert Canadian statistician Stephen McIntyre and Professor Ross McKitrick . But the IPCC was able to defend its case with the aid of another set of " hockey sticks " , based on different tree rings , produced by Mann 's close allies at the CRU . <p> The most widely quoted of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Philip Jones , saying that he had used " Mike 's Nature trick " to " hide the decline " . If there was anything in the CRU 's record which a proper inquiry should have addressed it was the story behind this email , because what it highlighted was the device used by the CRU to get round the fact that its tree-ring data hopelessly failed to show the result the warmist establishment wanted . When their Siberian tree rings showed temperatures in the late 20th century sharply dropping rather than rising , the " trick " used by Prof Jones and his colleague Dr Keith Briffa , copied from Mike Mann 's own " hockey stick " , was simply to delete the downward curve shown by the tree rings , replacing them with late 20th-century temperature data to show the dramatic warming <p> they wanted . <p> The significance of this sleight of hand can scarcely be exaggerated . Why , in using this misleading graph , did the IPCC not explain the trick that had been played by its leading scientists ? If tree rings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they be relied on to reflect temperatures in earlier centuries ? Why , when fresh Siberian tree ring data came to light , making a nonsense of the CRU 's earlier temperature reconstructions , did the CRU simply ignore the new data ? <p> Anyone who has followed the meticulous analysis of this curious story by Steve McIntyre on his Climate Audit website might well conclude that we are looking here at a complete travesty of proper scientific procedure , matched only by the bizarre methods used by Mann himself to construct his original hockey stick . Yet these are the men , Mann , Jones and Briffa , who acted as the " lead authors " of the key chapters of the IPCC 's 2001 and 2007 reports . <p> They quite shamelessly promoted the rewriting of history produced by themselves and a small group of colleagues -- the so-called Hockey Team -- which the IPCC in turn used as its main evidence to convince the politicians that the world faces unprecedented warming . <p> Yet scarcely a hint of this hugely important story is contained in the Oxburgh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appease critics by throwing in a few vaguely critical comments about how Jones and his team were a trifle " disorganised " in archiving their data . It ignores the utterly damning critiques of the CRU 's methodology produced by McIntyre and McKitrick . It does not even begin to question the way the CRU has compiled its global temperature record , relied on by the IPCC as the most authoritative of all the official data sources for surface temperatures . <p> Yet this in turn has given rise to all sorts of controversies , not least when Prof Jones last year admitted that much of his data had been " lost " ( following his repeated refusals of applications to see it by McIntyre and others ) . More damaging still was the charge by senior Russian scientists that , in compiling its global record , CRU had cherry-picked the data supplied from Russia , suppressing that from most of the country while retaining the data from the vicinity of cities which , thanks to the " urban heat island " effect , showed a warming trend . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called seriously in doubt , although one would never have guessed it from Oxburgh . <p> As is reflected in so many political tragedies , from Macbeth to Watergate , it is often not the original dark act itself which leads to nemesis but the later attempts to " trammel up the consequence " . Nothing will do more to reinforce suspicion of the CRU 's conduct than the failure , first by those MPs , and now by the team led by Lord Oxburgh , to address properly the way in which it appears to have abused the principles of true science -- a scandal which should be of concern not just to us here in Britain , who paid for it , but across the world .

@@1460230 <h> James Marple , TD Economics , Toronto . <h> Key Concepts : Housing Markets House Prices Tax Stimulus <p> After nearly three years of falling home sales , plummeting house prices and moribund construction activity , 2009 saw signs of stabilisation and recovery in the US housing market . Key housing market variables have been so volatile in recent years that it is easy to lose track of what a recovered housing market would look like . Home prices rose by 42% between 2003 and 2006 , then fell by 30% between 2006 and 2009 . Housing starts peaked above 2.0 million in 2005 then fell to 550 thousand in 2009 . Not one of these numbers is anywhere near long-run sustainable levels . <p> At their current value , home prices are more likely to be modestly undervalued than significantly overvalued and at just over 500,000 , housing starts are running not only below the long-run pace of household growth , but barely enough to keep pace with depreciation . <p> US New &amp; Existing Single Family Home Sales <p> US New &amp; Existing Home Months Supply <p> The outlook for the housing market in 2010 will be struggle between forces pulling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hindering this movement . <p> Supporting growth will be renewed job creation and the improvement in housing affordability , while obstructing growth will be the unwinding of temporary stimulus and the looming supply of foreclosures . Under the weight of these countervailing forces , the housing market is likely to move sideways in 2010 , before beginning a multi-year recovery in 2011 . In a recovered housing market , home price growth should return to roughly 5% annually -- a pace consistent with growth in income and the cost of new construction . New housing construction should rise to 1.5 million , in line with the growth in households . <h> How Much of a Boost from Tax Stimulus ? <p> The homebuyer tax credit contributed to the rebound in home sales over the course of 2009 , but after a last minute extension by Congress in November , the credit is set to expire in April of this year . Baring another extension , the expiration of the tax credit will become a drag on home sales in the remainder of 2010 . How much of a drag in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ credit provided . Because the tax-credit is temporary , it draws forward sales that would otherwise have taken place later in the year ( or subsequent years ) . Since the original tax credit applied only to first-time homebuyers ( buyers who had n't owned a home in the past three years ) , one approach to estimating the impact is to look at the change in the share of new homebuyers in total home purchases . First-time homebuyers typically represent 40% of the housing market according to the National Association of Realtors ( NAR ) , but represented 45% of the existing homes purchased in 2009 . A five percentage point swing in the share of new homebuyers , if fully attributable to the first-time homebuyer tax credit , implies an additional 230,000 home sales . <p> Since the tax credit acts like a price cut , another way to quantify its impact is to consider how housing demand responds to a change in price ( holding all else constant ) . An $8,000 tax credit is equivalent to close to a 5% reduction in the median priced home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home prices results in less than a 1% change in housing demand1 . However , given higher down payment requirements , the tax credit also acts to alleviate an important credit constraint on homebuyers . Loan-to-value ratios have fallen dramatically over the course of the housing bust due to more cautious lending behavior . An added 5% to 10% down payment , in this environment , is likely to cause a larger demand response than a simple 5% reduction in price . <p> Given the direct price impact and the additional liquidity driven boost , the tax credit likely led to additional 250,000- 300,000 home sales over the course of 2009 . The extension of the tax credit until April ( and its expansion to include existing home owners ) , could therefore lead to an additional 30,000 to 60,000 home sales in the remaining months before April . Once the tax credit expires , the additional home sales that it stimulated will drop off . If December and January 's sales declines are any indication , this could happen fairly abruptly in the months that follow . <p> Mortgage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Delinquent Mortgages <p> 30 Day Delinquencies &amp; Employment <h> Foreclosures - Housing Inventory 's Dark Shadow <p> The unprecedented rise in the rate of home foreclosures has made the current housing bust unique . As of the fourth quarter of 2009 , more than 4.6 million mortgages were at least 30 days behind in their payments and more than two million were in foreclosure . Foreclosures are particularly acute in the regions of the country that saw the worst lending excesses over the course of the boom . The states of California , Florida , Arizona , and Nevada alone represent 40% of seriously delinquent loans ( loans in foreclosure or more than 90 days delinquent ) . The Obama administration has recently announced a $1.5 billion program to help housing finance companies in these states hit hardest by the crisis . Delinquencies and foreclosures are also highest among the riskiest mortgage types . As of the fourth quarter of 2009 , 42.7% of all subprime adjustable rate mortgages ( ARMs ) were seriously delinquent , compared to 5.0% of prime fixed rate mortgages . <p> Fortunately , there have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regions , as well as the worst performing mortgage types . Foreclosure filings , according to RealtyTrac , fell by 10% in January and fell by even greater percentages in both California and Florida2 . In California , months supply of unsold homes fell dramatically over the course of 2009 to under 4.0 months by December , and median home prices ended the year 8.4% higher than a year earlier . <p> Month Supply - California <p> Ratio of Foreclosures Started To Loans 90 Days Delinquent* <p> In terms of loan performance , the rate at which subprime loans are becoming seriously delinquent has also slowed over the last several quarters . Stabilisation in the lower quality loans is a good sign since these are the most likely to have been purchased at the peak of the housing boom and are therefore the deepest underwater . <p> The main force behind a household falling behind in their mortgage payments is conditions in the job market . The 30-day delinquency rate has fallen in each of the last two quarters , reflecting a much slower pace of job losses than earlier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the next few months , the number of mortgages entering the initial stages of delinquency will decline further . Nonetheless , the heightened supply of delinquent loans implies that there will be more foreclosures in the pipeline in 2010 . In several states , moratoria on foreclosure proceedings has led to an increased pipeline of loans delinquent 90 days or more , which could well become foreclosures in the next year . In fact , the real problem in terms of foreclosures is the deterioration in mortgages once they have entered delinquency . Prior to 2006 , for every one mortgage 60-days delinquent there were roughly 4 mortgages 30-days delinquent . By 2009 , this ratio had risen to 1 in 2 . The rising ratio implies a higher proportion of loans entering delinquency are remaining in delinquency ( and eventually foreclosing ) . At 49% of the total , mortgages that are at least 90 days past due are now leading the pack . <p> Seriously Delinquent Mortgages by State <p> HAMP* Mortgage Loan Modificiations <p> US Headship Rates by Age Count <p> Headship Rates of Persons Aged 25-34 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ growth through 2009 was the Obama administration 's $75 billion Home Affordable Modification Program ( HAMP ) . By the end of 2009 HAMP had led to trial loan modifications on close to 1 million mortgages . The program has two main elements . The first is to offer refinancing on mortgages owned by government-sponsored enterprises , Fannie-Mae and Freddie-Mac , where the loan-to-value ratio has risen above 80% . The second part of the program is to offer incentives to lenders to lower interest rates on mortgages where monthly payments exceed 40% of monthly income . While the initial uptake of the program is promising , so far only a small portion of these modifications have been made permanent . However , this too is improving , and in January the number of permanent loan modifications nearly doubled to over 116,000 , or roughly 12% of total loan modifications . <p> The Treasury has also initiated a program to incentivize borrowers and loan servicers to engage in voluntary " short sale " or " deed-in-lieu " agreements when a loan modification is not possible . In a short sale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proceeds to the lender . Even without the Treasury program , short sales are in many cases the best option for both parties involved . Most foreclosed homes are eventually owned by the lender and often lie vacant until a buyer can be found . In these conditions , homes deteriorate and sell at a larger discount . For borrowers , a short sale avoids the pain and credit woes of a full foreclosure . While it remains uncertain how effective the plan will be in stemming the tide of foreclosures , a number of mortgage lenders have announced plans to offer short sale options to delinquent borrowers in recent months . <p> While the sheer size of the pool of delinquent loans can seem overwhelming , it is important to note that a portion of foreclosures and short sales can be absorbed by the market . In fact , according to NAR , of the 5.1 million home sales in 2009 , more than 20% were foreclosed sales , and more than 12% were short sales . The improvement that took place in home prices in 2009 showed that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sales ( roughly 1.5 million ) , home prices could still stabilize . <p> Currently , there are 4.6 million homes in delinquency , of which close to 2 million are 90 days or more past due . Given that there are currently 3.6 million homes for sale , the addition of 4.6 million homes on the market would more than double the inventory of unsold homes . Even allowing for the pace of sales to rise in 2010 to its pace in the late 1990s , such an increase would push the month 's supply of unsold homes well past its peak in late 2008 . This would , in all likelihood , lead to a further significant decline in home prices from their current level . In a best case scenario , foreclosure mitigation efforts and an improved job market remove the majority of the currently delinquent loans from the pipeline and home prices continue on an upward trajectory driven by rising demand . <p> Perhaps the most likely scenario is in between these two extremes . Should the pipeline of potential foreclosures be cut in half , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . While some month-to-month volatility should be expected , prices in this situation would more or less stabilize around their current level . <h> Seeing the Forest Through the Trees <p> The current housing market downturn is without a doubt the longest and deepest in modern times . In amongst the carnage it is easy to lose sight of the fact that Americans still need houses to live in and that the number of Americans grows by close to 3 million every year . Of course , what matters for the housing market is the growth in the number of households ; which , in addition to population growth , is determined by conditions in the economy . According to the US Census Bureau , there were 398,000 new households formed between March 2008 and March 2009 , down from 772,000 over the same period in 2008 and 1.6 million in 2007 . The fall in the growth of households in 2008 and 2009 was due to both an outright decline in the number of households headed by younger aged individuals as well as to a slowdown in the growth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both these groups continued to grow ) . As shown in the chart , the propensity to form a household ( often referred to as the " headship rate " and calculated by dividing the number of households in each cohort by its population ) rises with age , with the biggest increase occurring in the 25- 29 age cohort . Even smoothing out some of the year-to-year volatility , the headship rate of younger cohorts has fallen over the last few years , and this has shown up in terms of a slower pace of household formations . <p> The decline in the headship rate , especially of younger cohorts reflects the deterioration in income and job prospects that has taken place over the course of the recession . As we argue in our report , " US Wo n't Have a Jobless Recovery , " positive job growth is just around the corner . We expect the US economy to add 2.2 million jobs over the course of 2010 . While the unemployment rate will remain relatively elevated , it fell below 10.0% in January and remained there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the labor force , the unemployment rate will likely move further downward as the year progresses . <p> The swing from negative to positive job and income growth will go a long way in pulling the rate of household formations towards its long run growth rate of 1.4 million . We do not expect new home sales to rise to 1.4 million in 2010 , but given the current level of housing construction , sales need only rise a portion of this amount in order to move the month 's supply of new homes to historical levels . Home builders have cut back housing construction to the point that even at the current rate of sales , inventories of unsold new homes are declining . Currently there are only 230,000 new single-family homes for sale -- the lowest inventory in over 40 years . Despite the setback in January , given our outlook for jobs , new single-family home sales are likely to rise to half a million by the end of 2010 . <p> The majority of homes are bought and sold on the existing housing market . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ratio of existing home sales to the total stock of homes -- rose considerably over the course of the housing boom , reaching 7.4 home sales for every 100 homes in existence in 2005 , before falling to a low around 5.0 in 2008 and 2009 . As the job market improves through 2010 , it will allow more homes to change hands again . Nonetheless , it should be remembered that the heightened turnover of the boom years was also due to speculative buying and selling and sales are unlikely to reach these highs again . In all likelihood , the rate of housing turnover will return to its late 1990s level when market conditions were relatively balanced . Taken together with our forecast for employment and new housing construction , this implies existing home sales of just under six million in 2010 . <p> Housing Starts &amp; Household Formations <p> Change in New Single-Family Homes For Sale <p> Another factor in returning housing demand to more normal levels is the relationship between home prices and household income and between home prices and rents . In the long-run , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the future stream of housing services it provides . The higher are household incomes , the more housing services households will demand . In relatively competitive market , this will also equal the value of rents . By both of these metrics , home prices were dramatically over-valued over the course of the housing boom , but with the decline in prices since 2006 , prices have since returned to at least historical fair market value . This gives us confidence that while there may be some volatility in home prices due to the unwinding of stimulus and the supply of foreclosures on the market , as long as the broader economic recovery continues , home prices are unlikely to see further significant declines going forward . <p> The other factor for housing affordability is the outlook for mortgage rates . After holding relatively steady through most of 2008 , 30-year fixed rate mortgages finished 2009 at 4.9% , a drop of nearly a full percentage point . Federal Reserve purchases of mortgage backed securities and agency debt were an important element of this decline . <p> By early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 10-year government bonds had fallen by more than 150 basis points ( 1.5 percentage points ) . The Federal Reserve has announced that it will cease its mortgage purchases in the second quarter of this year ; however , it is unlikely to begin selling these assets in the near future . Given our expectation for government bond yields and a movement in mortgages spreads towards more normal levels , mortgage rates will move upward over the course of 2010 , likely giving back the percentage point decrease that took place over 2009 . <p> Taken together with a stabilisation in home prices , further improvements in affordability will depend on rising income growth . <p> Existing Home Turnover* <p> Mortgage Interest Rate Spread* <p> 30-Year Fixed Term Mortgage Interest Rate <h> Bottom Line <p> While it is difficult to determine how many distressed sales will enter the market in 2010 , we can say with a fair degree of certainty that the number of homes entering delinquency is likely to fall in 2010 as the job market improves . Loan modifications will also help to stem the tide of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the market until the home price outlook improves . The unwinding of tax stimulus and rising mortgage rates will take some wind out of home sales through the second half of the year , but by then the main force behind the housing recovery will be renewed job creation and income growth . Importantly , the 30% decline in home prices has eliminated the gap that rose during the housing boom between the price of homes and its underlying determinants of income and rents . Moreover , the drastic cuts to housing supply mean that it is only a matter of time before underlying demographic driven demand begins to exert upward pressure on prices . <p> All told , while headwinds are likely to slow the housing recovery through 2010 , they are unlikely to be strong enough to derail it altogether . By early 2011 the stage should be set for a fairly vigorous housing recovery . As a result of the low base from which it is starting , residential construction is likely to rise by close 20% from 2010 levels , adding close to a percentage point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 
@@1460232 <h> Against <p> Once you 've tried a compact camera that has successfully shoehorned in a big zoom whilst maintaining pocket-sized dimensions , going back to using a regular 3x or 5x zoom model will leave you feeling creatively short-changed . <p> Pulling off that Tardis-like feat this time around , and offering more scope when it comes to how you frame your shots , is Casio 's Exilim EX-H15 . Its dimensions are 102.5 x 62.1 x 29.3mm and it weighs a robust 206g with card and battery on board . <p> Justifying the " H " in the model name , the manufacturer describes the camera as a " high speed , high zoom " - the former courtesy of a zippy fifth generation Exilim Engine processor , and the latter by virtue of the integral 10x optical zoom ( 24-240mm in 35mm film terms ) . Wide-angle vistas , group shots or intimate portraits can therefore be yours with a toggle in either direction of the zoom switch encircling the shutter release button on the top plate . <p> The EX-H15 's other headline features are 14.1-megapixel effective resolution , plus 1280 x 720 pixels high-definition video with a maximum 29 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a one-touch record button top right of the camera back , saving the need to tab through menu or mode options to otherwise select the feature . Disappointingly , as the zoom itself is rather noisy in operation - with a definite mechanical buzz as it moves through its range - its use is disabled when shooting video , with only a digital zoom to fall back on by way of concession . <p> Shame also that there 's no HDMI output for playing back footage directly on an HD TV as with big zoom competitors from Kodak and Canon ; here we get a shared single port for USB 2.0 and standard AV output and the relevant cables in the box . <p> Further allowing for user friendly point-and-shoot operation are some 40-odd Best Shot scene/subject modes and not one but two auto modes , regular and " premium " auto , the latter Casio 's take on the Smart Auto and intelligent Auto functionality of Canon and Panasonic respectively . Among the " BS " modes are some Art Shot digital effects filters , including an impressionistic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ style of Van Gogh . <p> For those who like to get up close , macro focus can deliver sharp shots up to 7cm from your subject . There is , in addition , a dedicated button on the top plate for alternating between blemish smoothing " Make Up " and " Vivid Landscape " modes . We felt this button would have been of more use if given over to the Art Shot effects , rather like the Art Filters on the Olympus Pen series have their own quickly selected mode dial setting . <p> Its manufacturer is also very proud of the camera 's battery life , and at 1,000 shots from a full charge it should be , most competitors in its class struggling to manage 250 pictures . These are written to SD or SDHC card , with the option to also utilise Eye-Fi media for wireless download , plus there 's an internal 73.8MB capacity as back up . <p> Available in a quartet of different coloured bodies , we had the traditional yet not unattractive silver version for review . Pick the EX-H15 up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wider in depth than more modest zoom compacts . This is not in itself a bad thing , as it helps in holding the camera good and steady in both hands , though because most of the back plate is swallowed up by the 3-inch , 460,800-dot resolution LCD , said screen quickly becomes covered in thumb prints . As a concession to an actual grip , at the front there 's a narrow stylish sliver of raised metal and plastic over to its left hand edge , while four small raised nodules forming a square at the back stop your thumb from slipping . <p> Switch the camera on via the dedicated button next to the shutter release and the EX-H15 powers up in just under 2 seconds - fast for this class of camera . Even in single shot auto mode full resolution stills are committed to memory in around a second , when the average is 2 or 3 . Good work Casio . <p> Helping achieve a greater proportion of sharper shots when shooting handheld , Casio has thoughtfully included image stabilisation of the CCD-shift variety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ However at maximum telephoto we still got the occasional soft shot , even in broad daylight . <p> Otherwise when given ideal conditions , photos are bright and colourful though display a loss of sharpness towards the corners at 24mm equivalent wide-angle setting . Pixel fringing is also visible on very close inspection . As far as low light photography is concerned , the EX-H15 offers a respectably broad ISO range , from ISO64-3200 and delivers noise free results up to and including ISO400 , detail only moderately softening at ISO800 . Though by ISO3200 we 're losing edge definition and the photo is beginning to take on a painterly aspect , ISO1600 is useable at a push . In the main the EX-H15 affords a wider selection of photo taking than most amateurs will be used to , so is worth the modest premium . <h> Verdict <p> Until the last couple of years , if you wanted a non-interchangeable lens camera with a big zoom , you were pointed in the direction of a bridge model - so called because it formed a link between point and shoot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bulky and unfathomable for beginners as a DSLR itself . <p> Now , thanks to the likes of Panasonic and its pioneering TZ series the same range is offered by a compact that will fit in your pocket . That 's to say any disadvantages of using the EX-H15 - even the inability to use the optical zoom when recording video , something its direct competitor in Canon 's PowerShot SX210 IS manages - do n't outweigh the advantages of its broad focal range within compact dimensions . If we had the choice and money was n't an issue we 'd go for the Canon over this Casio , but with the EX-H15 retailing for a cool ? 100 less , it has to be worth further investigation .

@@1460240 <h> Whatever happened to Gheorghe Popescu ? <p> Eastern European countries have always been there or thereabouts when it comes to their representation in major tournaments and producing quality players . Romania 's Gheorghe Popescu is one player that had a distinguished career and can be considered one of the best players to come from that part of the continent . Popescu , who was born in 1967 , was said to have a tactical knowledge for a defender that was useful to every club he played for . To this day Popescu still remains Romania 's most capped player with 115 appearances for his country . As well as his numerous turn-outs for Romania , he will be remembered by English football followers for his brief spell at Tottenham . So whatever happened to Gheorghe Popescu ? <p> His professional career started in 1984 with a club called Universitatea Craiova , where he played 103 times and scored 22 goals . In the early part of his career Popescu was capable of mixing his defending skills with the ability to display a great technical side to his game ; therefore he could play as a defensive-midfielder but with the advantage of being more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fact that he would probably be supporting his attackers more than his fellow defenders , thus enabling him to scored goals at every club he went to , as seen with his 22 for his first club . <p> After learning his trade with Craiova , he moved to his first major European club- PSV Eindhoven . He spent four years at the Dutch club , from 1990-1994 , and once again at a health goal-scoring ratio for a defender/defensive midfielder . In just over 100 games , he found the net on 24 occasions . He won the Dutch league in each of his first two seasons and played under the legend that was Sir Bobby Robson . However , when Robson left the club , the title did n't come to Eindhoven again and the new coach struggled to create that winning formula and Popescu soon found himself on his way to Tottenham for the start of the 94-95 season . <p> The Romanian moved to White Hart Lane for just under ? 3m , at specifically ? 2.9m . He was a 26-year-old at the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Popescu played 23 times for Spurs and scored three goals in the process , but found that he could n't enjoy the same success as he did on the international stage , on a personal level , and left the club after just one campaign . Even then , the move away from England still resulted in him joining another major force in Barcelona . <p> In his two years at the Nou Camp he helped the Spanish giants win the European Cup Winners ' Cup in 1997 and had the privilege of captaining the team during a period of his time there . Winning the cup in 1997 was his last act before he moved to his last major club , Turkish side Galatasaray . In the four years Popescu spent there , 97-01 , he made 110 appearances and was apparently labeled as the greatest foreign defender in Turkey . His ability to read the game made him shine , and it came as no coincidence that he would time his tackles perfectly . Arsenal fans will remember him as the player that scored the winning penalty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their side . <p> In between 2001-2003 Popescu would go on to play for three more clubs before retiring . These were Italian side Lecce , followed by a return to his home country to play for Dinamo Bucharest and ending his playing days with German side Hannover 96 . <p> Popescu 's longevity at international level shows in his personal accolades , where he was never outside the top four of the Romanian Footballer of the Year awards in each of his 13 years and won the title six times .

@@1462231 <h> Volcano crisis : Sense vanishes in a puff of ash <h> The closure of our airspace casts a highly disturbing light on the way we are governed , says Christopher Booker . <p> Last week , for the second time in a decade , a major crisis erupted out of the blue that cast a highly disturbing light on the peculiarly contorted way in which we are now governed . The Icelandic volcano shambles had striking parallels with the foot-and-mouth crisis of 2001 . <p> Both episodes involved a massive system failure in a complex new structure of supranational governance which was being put to the test for the first time , Both were made much worse by over-reliance on an inadequate computer model , which ended up causing unnecessary chaos and misery for hundreds of thousands of people and costing not millions but billions of pounds . <p> What turned that shower of abrasive volcanic dust from a drama into a crisis was the central flaw in a new international system for responding to such incidents , which was put in place only last September . As everyone now recognises , the emptying of the skies which plunged Europe 's airlines into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ risks involved . <p> Within two days , the amount of ash over northern Europe was at barely one per cent of the official danger level . But the authorities were locked by international rules into a rigid bureaucratic system , based on a computer model , which gave them no alternative but to close down air traffic for days longer than was justified . The real flaw in the system was that it made no provision for testing that crude computer model against actual real-life data , which could have shown that the computer was vastly exaggerating the risk . <p> Responsibility for responding to the Icelandic eruption lay with a bewildering hierarchy of national and international authorities , starting at the top with a UN body , the International Civil Aviation Organisation ( ICAO ) , working down through the European Commission and Eurocontrol ( which is not part of the EU ) , to national agencies , such as our own Civil Aviation Authority , the National Air Traffic Service and , last but not least , the UK Met Office , owners of the relevant computer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ICAO last September , as soon as the Met Office 's computer simulation of air flows around Europe indicates that a particular wind-borne dust cloud might theoretically be a danger , it automatically triggers an exclusion zone for air traffic . What the computer can not show is the density of the dust , and whether it thus poses a genuine hazard . <p> A properly designed system should have allowed for immediate sampling and monitoring of the ash cloud to see whether it was at the danger level . As a spokesman for the International Advisory Committee on Flight Safety put it , " military and transport aircraft should have been sent straight up to determine the nature of the ash cloud . The density and the make-up of the cloud is what matters , and that information has just not been available . " <p> But somehow the need for this had been completely overlooked by all the international officials involved in devising the new system ( which was endorsed on our behalf by the European Commission ) . Because no one had been made officially responsible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out that there were very few planes left in Europe specially equipped to do it ( the only dedicated aircraft in Britain was sitting in a hangar being painted ) . It was thus left to the beleaguered airlines to carry out their own test flights , which they began to do last weekend , finding that the quantities of ash in the air were negligible . <p> With losses soaring towards ? 2 billion , the airlines , led by British Airways , acted to break the official blockade . BA 's Willie Walsh told the authorities that he had 22 aircraft already in the sky , heading for Britain -- and the serried ranks of officialdom buckled , rushing to explain that they had only been doing their jobs in acting by the rule book . It was , of course , that rule book which was at fault , because it gave exclusive authority to a computer model not up to the task . <p> This was reminiscent of what happened in 2001 , when our Government tried to tackle the foot-and-mouth epidemic within a new straitjacket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experts who were urging it to contain the disease by vaccination , it handed over direction of the crisis to a computer modelling team with no experience of animal diseases , who came up with that truly disastrous policy of a " pre-emptive cull " . The result was that millions of healthy animals were killed unnecessarily , the appalling damage inflicted on Britain 's countryside was infinitely worse than it should have been , and the cost rose into billions . <p> It is especially ironic that a Met Office computer model was at the centre of this latest fiasco , and that , thanks to successive Government cuts over the years , it no longer has any aircraft capable of testing whether its model 's data are reliable . Over the past 20 years , our Met Office has received some ? 250 million to allow its computer models to predict future climate change . If just a tiny fraction of that money had been spent on aircraft of the type that the Met Office used to have at its disposal to sample dust clouds , airlines and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Met Office has frittered away on its obsession with global warming .

But being in London , it 's also a really inconvenient place to buy a computer . <p> Luckily , there are many alternatives -- Macs are available these days from a greater variety of outlets than ever before . So where should you shop , what should you choose , how can you buy safely and -- perhaps the most topical issue here -- is there any way to shave a few quid off that exquisitely typeset Apple Store price tag ? <p> Wonder no more . We open the doors to the world of Mac retailing and invite you to browse ... <p> Where to buy <p> Apple is unusual in selling its products every which way at once . You can buy a Mac direct from the online Apple Store ; from one of the growing number of bricks-and-mortar Apple Stores around the country ; from official ' Apple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Solutions Consultants ; and from hundreds of independent Apple Authorised Resellers and Premium Resellers , variously selling online , on the high street or both . <p> The bigger independents buy direct from Apple , while others go through a network of distributors , listed here . What seems weird at first glance is that Apple is competing for your custom against its own dealers . <p> But according to Neil Saunders , Consulting Director at retail analysts Verdict Research , everyone seems to win . " Apple Stores are expensively fitted out and well staffed . They would n't make money outside big cities , so Apple could n't attain the type of coverage it needs without an independent dealer network . " <p> From the retailers ' point of view , " in some ways , Apple Stores are n't even competition .

Authorised Resellers may knock a few pounds off Apple Store prices , and can also sell you other kit at competitive prices . <p> As Computer Warehouse 's Jonathan Cole points out , " We can pioneer new products -- things you wo n't find at the Apple Store . " ( CW has just opened a new 15,000 sq ft store in West London . ) Although you may find fractionally lower prices online , by choosing a local dealer you could get the benefit of trying before you buy and having someone on hand to answer questions . Either way , Mac resellers tend to be very knowledgeable and keen to help . <p> There are a couple of other ways to cut the cost of a new Mac . Business buyers can save a fortune by reclaiming the VAT and offsetting the purchase against tax . If you 're not eligible , you may still qualify for a discount from Apple .

It 's a treasure trove of cut-price kit , with some clearance items and many described as ' refurbished ' . This usually means someone 's bought a Mac , then changed their mind or found a problem and sent it back . <p> Industry insiders tell us these returns often have absolutely nothing wrong with them , and in any case they 're fully tested and any faults fixed before they 're resold . They 're guaranteed for a full year and extendable up to three years via AppleCare .

" Sir , it will save your career because any kind of straight sex seems to be OK in the GOP . " <p> It was funny , as Colbert invariably is . But it was also cruel and tinged with a certain retro quality . Graham did n't deserve it any more than Kagan did . It was hypocritical too - there was no comedy prompted by Kagan 's outing ( effectively by the White House , in the bizarre form of a denial ) . <p> But laughing about gay conservatives has long been a practice enjoyed by many ostensibly tolerant liberals .

@@1465232 <h> Bringing an outsider in to run the Civil Service should be the first action of any new government , says Andrew Haldenby . <p> The election campaign has been so fascinating and unpredictable that it is odd to think it will be over in just over a week . But very soon , the winner -- or winners , if there is a coalition -- will have to make that remarkable and immediate transition from campaign to government . So it is time for them to pay at least a little attention to that transition ; to consider the first steps that would give themselves the best chance of governing effectively for the rest of their term . <p> Britain faces mountainous challenges . To address them , these new ministers will need to draw on every ounce of Whitehall 's expertise . Yet while the politicians might think they will inherit a Rolls-Royce machine , what they will actually find is a Civil Service with its own agenda , with a predilection to spend rather than save , and with great experience in talking ministers out of their " brave " attempts to reform government . <p> Many politicians have tried to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen them off . In fact , the self-interest and basic lack of competence within Whitehall is one of the reasons why the country is in such a financial hole . The key watchman of Whitehall -- the National Audit Office -- has shown beyond doubt that central government makes insufficient effort to manage its staff , understand its costs or buy things on behalf of the public at good value . <p> Just before Easter , the outgoing MP responsible for the NAO , Edward Leigh , reported that the Civil Service was just as institutionally wasteful this year as 10 years ago . He summed up his decade in the post : " We have been impressed by some talented people who know what they are doing and are determined to do it well , but more frequently we have been shocked by the failure to apply basic management disciplines to major projects and programmes . " The Civil Service 's internal judgments , the Capability Reviews that have been published since 2006 , have identified major weaknesses in every department . <p> This is why I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : to replace the head of the Civil Service , Sir Gus O'Donnell -- formally called the Cabinet Secretary -- with an outsider , one with a track record of management success at the highest level . As with any organisation , the Civil Service 's leader is the person best placed to change its culture . The new PM should to be bold , and aim very high : Sir Terry Leahy , of Tesco , Sir Stuart Rose , of Marks &amp; Spencer , or someone with similar expertise of managing a vast enterprise and delivering results . <p> There are , of course , many civil servants motivated by genuine public spirit who would like nothing more than to reduce waste and improve efficiency . But just as many will protect their own jobs , and those of their friends , at the expense of front-line services . Senior officials also know that new ministers will want to announce new programmes , and will use this to divert the pressure to achieve value for money . A prime minister has far less power to address this than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hire , fire or manage their officials . But the ability to move the Cabinet Secretary is a priceless weapon . <p> Tony Blair certainly realised this : after thinking long and hard about the practical challenge of getting results out of Whitehall , he concluded that he should start his second term by choosing a new kind of Cabinet Secretary -- someone who did not come from within the " magic circle " of permanent secretaries , who had spent their lives in Whitehall . <p> Mr Blair wanted Michael Bichard , who had been a hugely successful permanent secretary at the then Department for Education and Employment under the Blair and Major governments . But Bichard had spent his life outside central government and was considered an outsider by his peers . Senior civil servants closed ranks , and pressured Blair to appoint someone more clubbable . He gave in , and is said to regret it to this day . <p> Sir Gus O'Donnell has been notably obstructive to reform . A basic principle of good government in countries like Australia and New Zealand is that ministers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for their performance and can be moved if they are no good . When my own think tank published research on the subject last year , Sir Gus caused a diplomatic incident , telling the press that the US civil service was slow and bureaucratic -- just as Gordon Brown was concluding his first meetings with the newly elected President Obama , and weeks before a G20 summit at which a unified Anglo-American front was vital . In other words , he judged the defence of the Civil Service to be more important than the Prime Minister 's relationship with our most important allies . Sir Humphrey would be proud . <p> Whitehall always offers new governments a Faustian pact : we will support you ( to some extent ) as long as you leave us alone . The next government should resist the temptation . Choosing an outsider as Cabinet Secretary would be an extraordinary departure -- but it could be just the thing for these extraordinary times .

The company never ran a focused marketing campaign that would try to impress on potential customers why the Nexus One was worth considering . <p> The result has been that few potential customers have had a chance to hear why the phone may be special . <p> 3 ) In mobile phones , Google is a startup <p> The search giant 's web products draw in millions of users , which means even half-baked ideas such as Google Wave get a full workout from people eager to try the company 's latest new thing . <p> But in the world of consumer electronics , Google is a rookie , and the company will have to fight hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relationships that companies such as Research In Motion ( RIM ) and Motorola have created over the years . <p> Google also has to build relationships with mobile phone networks . In the mobile world , networks are extremely powerful , and with good reason : Without a good data network , using even the most high-end phone becomes an exercise in frustration . A typical consumer 's choice between a Nexus One and an iPhone may come down to which network offers it . Google needs to craft its retail strategy with that in mind . <p> 4 ) The mobile phone ecosystem is complex <p> With Android , Google is trying to do with mobile phones what Microsoft did with Windows on PCs . Instead of having a proprietary operating system tied to hardware made by the same company , Google wants to separate the two . <p> Handset makers such as Motorola and HTC are buying into the strategy . But to help them give up their older operating systems and use Android , Google needs to understand how phones are designed , developed , priced and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use these products and the challenges they face . Listening to its hardware partners talk about this with PowerPoint presentations is one way . Getting your hands dirty to do it yourself , is another , and that 's what Google did with Nexus One . <p> 5 ) Earning developer goodwill is the key <p> The success of Apple 's app store has spurred rivals to launch their own versions . But with the exception of Android , few other app stores -- including BlackBerry World and the Palm app store -- have come close to becoming a viable competitor to iPhone 's App Store . <p> One reason is that Google has been generous in seeding the developer community with the Nexus One . A significant portion of the Nexus One sales went to programmers , and that 's not by accident . Google has also been handing them out . <p> Having its own Android device helped Google take control of this feedback without having to rely on the HTCs and the Motorolas of the world to do it . <p> For Google the handset experiment is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of engineering and Android tsar , has said that the company plans to come out with a series of Google phones . <p> Make no mistake , there will be another Google handset . But it is not likely to repeat the mistakes of the Nexus One , and future Googlephones phones will get better . <p> Just do n't expect a stunning blockbuster phone from Google , because Google understands it 's not in the business of just selling a phone .

For further information please read our Cookie Policy . <h> Newsletters <p> On February 24 2010 the Court of Milan convicted three Google executives for violating data protection law . The case was brought in connection with a video on the Google Video website that showed a boy with Down 's syndrome being bullied by his classmates ( for further details please see " Google executives convicted for data processing violations " ) . In addition to violation of data protection provisions , the defendants were charged with defamation , but were acquitted on the latter charge . <p> The publication on April 12 2010 of the full text of the decision sheds light on this potential landmark case . This is the first decision worldwide in which Google executives have been convicted for a violation of local data protection law . <p> On reading the full text , it seems clear this is not a decision against internet freedom . Rather , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over content posted on their websites ; nor do they have a duty to prevent the posting of defamatory content by users . Nonethless , the judge found Google 's executives liable for not having provided a clear and proper notice to users for data protection purposes . <p> Sensitive data and unlawful processing <p> The executives were convicted for the unlawful processing of sensitive personal data , which is punishable by between one and three years ' imprisonment under Sections 167(1) and ( 2 ) of the Data Protection Code . According to the code , the term ' sensitive data ' includes data relating to health issues , such as the medical condition of the boy being bullied in the video . <p> Unlawful processing of personal data occurs when : <p> sensitive personal data is processed ; <p> the data subject 's written consent is not obtained ; <p> the data subject suffers damage as a result of the processing ; and <p> the data processor intends to profit from the unlawful processing . <p> With these criteria in mind , how was the crime assessed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? <p> Facts <p> Public prosecutor 's interpretation : Google Italy as content provider The public prosecutor considered Google Italy to be a content provider in connection with the processing of the personal data . <p> In the public prosecutor 's view , the processing of the boy 's data was carried out in Italy by Google Italy , although the videos available through Google Video were managed by Google Inc on servers located abroad . Google Italy 's position arose from its commercial relationship with Google Video , which was managed by Google Inc . The public prosecutor argued that this relationship allowed Google Italy to use the Google Adwords system to make related profits from parties that paid to appear on the Google Video website through the use of keywords . <p> In the public prosecutor 's view , this demonstrated ( i ) Google 's role as data controller in respect of the videos on Google Video , and ( ii ) its intent to profit from the unlawful processing of personal data . In respect of the data disclosed through the Google Video service , Google @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hosting services , but acting as a content provider . <p> On this basis the public prosecutor argued that the Google Italy executives and the user who had uploaded the video were guilty of unlawful data processing , as Google Italy had processed the boy 's sensitive data without first obtaining his consent . <p> Defence : Google Italy as hosting services provider Counsel for the defence challenged the public prosecutor 's interpretation and maintained that the code did not apply to Google Italy , as the relevant data processing had been performed in the United States - Google Inc 's US servers process all personal data contained in all uploaded videos worldwide . Furthermore , it was claimed that there was no link between Google Video and the Google Adwords system . Therefore , there was no intent to profit from the unlawful processing of personal data . <p> As a result , counsel argued that Google Italy should be regarded merely as a hosting services provider , which would imply that it had no general duty to monitor content uploaded to a website . Hosting services providers are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the EU E-commerce Directive ( 2000/31/EC ) ) , according to which an internet service provider is not liable for content posted on its website if it removes offensive content on receipt of notice . Google Italy had received notice from the Postal Police and had removed the video under Section 17 of the law . Therefore , only the user who uploaded the video should be held liable for the unlawful processing of personal data . <p> Decision <p> The court based its analysis on two points : the boy had not given express consent and had suffered damage as a result of the data processing . Therefore , it sought to establish whether the duty to obtain a data subject 's express consent should apply only to the user or whether such duty should extend to Google Italy . The court held as follows : <p> No general duty to monitor uploaded content should apply to Google Italy . However , the judge agreed with the public prosecutor 's construction of the facts , which was aimed at demonstrating Google Italy 's role as a content provider ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and for the absence of prior monitoring of the videos ) . <p> Hosting providers have a general duty to ensure that only appropriate information is made available to website users . <p> Therefore , Google Italy should have made clear in its information for users that before uploading a video , the express consent of third parties appearing therein was required . <p> The information on data subjects that was available on Google Video 's homepage and was viewed during the registration process ( which users had to complete in order to upload videos ) made no reference to the need to obtain consent from third parties . <p> Google Italy 's executives with control over Google Video were liable for the unlawful processing of personal data due to the infringement of duty in respect of information . <p> The public prosecutor also sought a conviction for defamation . The court acquitted the defendants , stating that a general duty to monitor uploaded content does not apply to internet service providers ( ISPs ) , such as Google Italy . <p> A conviction for defamation could not have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's intent to defame . The fact that the video had been published on the website for two months and had been added to the ' funniest videos ' category by the user constituted insufficient grounds to find the executives guilty of defamation . <p> Comment <p> The decision raises several significant issues . Its presentation of the facts , in which Google 's internal processes and structures are analyzed in detail , gives an unflattering view of a company beset by bureaucracy , unwieldy superstructures and a failure to assign personnel to cover certain key issues ( eg , managing responses to potentially unlawful content flagged by users ) . <p> The legal grounds for the decision have been widely criticized as a threat to the freedom of the Internet . However , this view appears to be incorrect : the judge clearly stated that the principle of non-liability for hosting providers is safe and that the law does not make them subject to a general duty to monitor content posted by users , nor to a duty to prevent the posting of defamatory content from users . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the code 's scope of application . The code applies to processing carried out by controllers that are either established in Italy or established outside the European Union , but using equipment located in Italy . The court regarded Google Italy as the controller of the personal data , but it did so solely on the grounds that the company benefitted commercially from the sponsored content available through the Google Video service . This seems to be a weak justification for regarding Google Italy as the data controller ; moreover , it is not arguable on a correct interpretation of the code . <p> The court stated that as a hosting services provider , Google Italy was not subject to a duty of prior control over the content posted by its users , but was bound to comply with the code in connection with the personal data contained in videos uploaded by third parties . The judge clarified that the data subject 's consent should have been obtained by the video 's creator and that a hosting provider can not be expected to obtain written consent from the data subject @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , its executives - had allowed the video to be uploaded without the relevant third party 's consent , as users were given no clear and proper information on the need for such consent . Therefore , the executives were guilty . <p> This is arguably another weak point in the decision . To what extent should a hosting services provider be expected to inform users that they must obtain consent from the data subjects in their home videos ? Does anyone believe that the video would not have been uploaded and that Google 's liability would have been excluded if Google Italy had provided such information ? <p> A few days after the publication of the final decision , the chairman of the Data Protection Authority gave an interview that in which he referred to a technical mistake in the court 's decision . The chairman stated that under Section 13 of the code , the information for a data subject must contain information on the ISP 's own specific means and modalities of processing , without reference to the processing of third parties ' data , which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ video . <p> The materials contained on this website are for general information purposes only and are subject to the disclaimer . <p> ILO is a premium online legal update service for major companies and law firms worldwide .

@@1468235 <h> Employment Appeal Tribunal issues TUPE judgment on contract wins <p> The first case to reach the Employment Appeal Tribunal concerning a dispute between two law firms over the employment law implications of winning a client contract from another firm has provided ' much-needed clarification ' on the issue , experts have said . <p> The EAT upheld an earlier tribunal decision that Transfer of Undertakings , Protection of Employment ( TUPE ) regulations do not apply where a law firm wins a contract from another firm if there is a substantial ' run-off ' in the handing over of the files . <p> Advertisement <p> This means that , where a client terminates its contract with a firm in favour of another firm , the new firm will not be obliged under TUPE to take on the staff who worked on the file at the old firm , provided the client allows the old firm to complete any ongoing work on existing files , rather than transferring these to the new firm . <p> In the ruling last month , the EAT found that TUPE did not apply when Newcastle firm Ward Hadaway lost the Nursing and Midwifery Council ( NMC ) contract @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ argued in the employment tribunal that the transfer of the NMC contract in its entirety signalled a ' service provision ' change between the two firms .

The team also went 10 matches without a win between October and December . <p> A club statement said : " The board stressed that the decision was not a knee jerk reaction to Sunday 's match but was made after assessing the last two years and reflected the fact that the team 's form deteriorated rapidly towards the end of the season for the second year running . <p> " It is true I enjoyed a very close working relationship with Chris and it 's been a pleasure to work with him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

@@1478234 <h> The new source for concert and opera reviews , articles and interviews on the web <h> Ivanov , Orchestre National de Belgique/Minczuk <p> Bozar , Brussels , 8 May 2010 <p> The Orchestre National de Belgique 's concert at the BOZAR Centre for Fine Arts had something of the feel of a Flemish carnival . Local violin player Yossif Ivanov starred in Samuel Barber 's Concerto , the concert opened with an overture from Antwerp composer Luc van Hove , and the crowd featured an assortment of schoolchildren and chaperones , the former not seeming too bored , at least not uniformly bored , somewhat gratifyingly . <p> And nor should they have been . Even if the thunder crashes , alluring wind playing , pin sharp thematic pivots , and shattering climaxes that visiting conductor Roberto Minczuk drew out of the closing Tchaikovsky Fourth Symphony guaranteed at least periodic amusement for sceptical teenagers , the rest of the programme provided enough variety to at least interest those willing to make the effort . <p> After a shaky start where indiscipline marred unison string pizzicati and sforzandi , and not enough was made of the starkly contrasted pianissimo sustained chromatic chords and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's reading of van Hove 's Ouverture La Sfida matured into a poised , purposeful account . Van Hove 's compositional aesthetic involves , in his own words , ' building up logical and coherent networks of basically harmonic relationships , in which every second of the music can either point back or forth to other moments of the piece ' . In this the composer echoes peers such as Magnus Lindberg and Brett Dean who use traditional formal models in new contexts and with new content . Van Hove 's piece in fact suggested Bartok and Ives in form and contour and Sibelius in harmonic colour , with perhaps a sprinkling of the twenty-first century , more than it does any more recent music . The basic idea of the piece seemed a little thin initially , with atmospheric molten chords substituting for substance , but as the sequence progressed and motivic and harmonic development took the composition into compelling areas of tension and detail , twice unleashing to teeming , Lutoslawski-esque freedom , van Hove showed a smart handling of argument , pace , and displayed also a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those that stayed with the performance , the final harmonic ( ir ) resolution proved an impressive solution to the implications of the opening idea . <p> Barber 's heart-on-sleeve , jazzy and loose-limbed Violin Concerto contains characteristic moments of beauty and invention , not least in the capricious but compelling formal design that sees soloist and orchestra swapping materials and roles at an unexpected rate ( the long oboe solo at the opening of the slow movement is a particularly arresting example of such ) . Ivanov 's performance was committed , if a little nervy . He possess a formidable fullness of tone which often played into his favour here , ensuring a steely soloistic presence in the exchanges with the ensemble , but there was a tendency in his playing to an exaggerated firmness in phrasing and accent , which tendency often led him into misalignment with the rest of the musicians . His playing in the slow movement , though often fulsomely beautiful , I felt could have been done with a little more sweetness , though his vociferousness translated well into the head-spinning moto perpetuo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . After a warm reception , Ivanov 's encore provided suitable thrills and spills ( and some nifty sul pont. playing ) for a keyed up audience . <p> The highlight of the evening undoubtedly came with the aforementioned Tchaikovsky Symphony , though . Minczuk steamrolled right into the famous fate motif , with brass thundering above the excited sonic conurbation below . The heady pace , wild volumes , and emotional intensity ( compensating for the lack of same in the material ? ) of the performance continued into the latter movements , with the skipping scherzo given real pizzazz , agile enough to blend seamlessly first into a pastoral trio , and then into the crushing drum crashes of the finale . For sheer , unhinged musical indulgence , Tchaikovsky takes some beating , and Minczuk and his musicians absolutely did justice to the composer 's distinctivly overwrought sense of tragedy . Highly enjoyable .

@@1478236 <p> When Darryl Duffy put Rovers ahead shortly after the restart you could sense the fear of failure - the nagging , horrid , unwanted feeling - among the vast majority of the 38,234 inside Elland Road that their team would have to settle for a play-off place . <p> It would have not been much of a consolation because Leeds have failed in the play-offs three times in the last four years ( the other year ended in relegation ) , hence the sheer , spontaneous exhilaration as Leeds belied their numerical inferiority to score twice in four crazy second-half minutes . <p> Chairman Ken Bates had spent all week warning about the harsh consequences of a pitch invasion but that particular episode of tough talking was always destined to fall on deaf ears and Beckford 's winner saw fans spill on to the pitch and the final whistle prompted a full-scale invasion . <p> I was surrounded by joyous scenes . A man in late middle age sat slightly to my right punched the desk I was sat at with primal abandon , while friends and families hugged and jumped up and down . <p> Some supporters sang the club 's anthem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line " we 've been through it all together , we 've had our ups and downs . " <p> It has been more or less all downs for Leeds since the turn of the millennium but that ended on Saturday . <p> Manager Simon Grayson paid tribute to his players after the match , applauding the way they held their nerve as form wilted and pressure mounted in the final months of the season . <p> He said that dealing with the huge expectation was the reason why this promotion meant more to him than the one he achieved at Blackpool . <p> Grayson , a Leeds fan as well as their manager , also discussed the possibility that his team might challenge for promotion next season . He does not hide from the fact that he wants to take United back to the Premier League and said there was a " possibility " of back-to-back promotions . <p> Part of his rationale is that Leeds had suffered in League One because they were a notable scalp and teams playing at Elland Road often raised their performance level . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ John Charles to score 30 in consecutive seasons and the team have relied on his goals . <p> Luciano Becchio scored 17 in the season , Robert Snodgrass was the third highest scorer in the campaign with 10 . Grayson will need more artillery in the Championship and replacing Beckford will not be easy or cheap . <p> Bates said in his programme notes that Leeds will be " looking for opportunities to improve our current squad " but he also made it clear that the club , so troubled by financial problems for most of the previous decade , would not spend what they can not afford . <p> The manager would not be drawn on his budget but , to an extent , its size will determine how realistic a promotion push is next season . <p> I would be very interested to know which areas Leeds supporters feel Grayson needs to strengthen - and how far they feel their team can go next season . For now , however , they are more concerned with celebrating a successful end to this campaign . <h> Comment number 2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be happy with mid-table or above . Obviously challenging for promotion would be great but I do n't want to ask for too much . It 's great that we 're now beginning our journey back to the top of the football elite and I 'm prepared to take that journey nice and slowly . <p> Therefore , couple of fresh faces such as another striker , central midfielder with a bit of determination and possibly another right back . I do n't want to spend what we do n't have but I trust Grayson to make the right shots . <h> Comment number 3 . <p> " I would be very interested to know which areas Leeds supporters feel Grayson needs to strengthen - and how far they feel their team can go next season . " <p> Well , ideally , one striker if Beckford stays , two if he goes ; a holding midfield player and possibly a winger ; a goalkeeper and the entire back four apart from Kisnorbo ( and as a backup the mysteriously out of favour Marques ) . I think Howson , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if he can maintain fitness ) and for that matter Beckford can make it at a higher level . Gradel possibly if he can calm down . This is n't meant to insult players like Naylor , Becchio and Hughes who have worked their socks off for the club this season , and I hope roles can be found for them . There is also a swathe of loan players , who will mostly ( hopefully ) go back to their owners . <p> As to how far they can go ... If you look at the Championship this year , the top two were premiership clubs bouncing back up . The next five , including Swansea , who almost made it , and with the exception of Cardiff , were all relatively recently in League One . I ca n't see this year 's relegated teams from the Premiership dominating the Championship next year . Whichever of the League One playoff candidates goes up , I think all three promoted teams ( Norwich , Leeds and one of the others ) could be formidable in the Championship , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least make the playoffs . <h> Comment number 6 . <p> Well done Leeds ! ! ! !

Usually the relegated Prem teams make up the automatic and playoff spots but the look of Hull , Burnley and Portsmouth wo n't frighten this Leeds team.It was great to see Beckford leave on good terms with the fans , whatever about his loyalties , his goals got us this far . He 'll be another great premiership player that we can say ' You know he used to play for Leeds ' next season . <h> Comment number 12 . <p> Firstly lets be relaistic , getting out of L1 after 3 seasons is hardly the height of achievment for our club , Bates put us there in the first place with bad managers and even worse financial dealings and showed very little committment to helping the post Wise managers to getting us out ! <p> In terms of strengthening we will need a whole team , goalkeeper , full-backs , defenders , ball passing midfielders and strikers . Only Howson , Snodgrass and Becchio ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of players is championship standard . Even Beckford wo n't cup it up a division and can take Gradel with him on departure ( that was a disgraceful act by Gradel and he should pay dearly in bans and fines ) .. <p> 21st will do me next season if it is accompanied by a change of ownership . <h> Comment number 13 . <p> It 's interesting to note that the size of their ground will be the biggest in the Championship also , so clearly they are not currently existing in the way of a Bolton Wanderers , a Wigan Athletic or a Doncaster . <p> But there are many clubs with capacities of 27,000 - 35,000 in the Championship , so if they think they 'll walk the Championship , they 're in post-euphoria pissed-to-the-gills cloud cuckoo land ! <p> It has to be said though , that if they get the footballing side right , that they should be in the Premier League . Their city warrants it , their tradition warrants it and the fact that there is no team from Yorkshire in the EPL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if they win football matches . And if Blackpool , Burnley , Barnsley , Swansea or Preston North End win more , then good luck to them . You get promoted on how many points you get at the end of the season , not on how many fans go through the turnstiles . <p> Except if the players , the managers and the media collude to ' arrange ' things differently . <h> Comment number 14 . <p> flooch , are you honestly suggesting we should be punished by the FA for celebrating promotion after three hard years in L1 ? ? ? Yes the pitch was invaded , but look at the scenes on BBC - no violence at all - just extreme relief at finally getting promotion . To even compare this with Hillsborough is frankly disgusting and you should be ashamed of yourself ... <p> Do you want to fine Grimsby too , after their relegation and pitch invasion ? ? <p> Or are you one of these armchair supporters who 's never been to an actual game to experience the passion and emotions they create @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next year is potentially one of the easiest to succeed in for some years , since you do nt really look at the three teams coming down from the Premier League as automatically having a strong outing next year . Burnley maybe , since they did nt blow the club accounts out of the water . This means that the playoff race could well be wide open , and a club with strong fan support and the right signings could well make a big push . <h> Comment number 19 . <p> James beattie sounded out today as a possible intake to deal with the departure of beckford ... My view that would be the signing of the season . beattie is a perfect chamionship player . strong , poacher loads of stamina . <h> Comment number 20 . <p> I am pleased that Leeds has gotten promoted to the Championship .

All the best ! <h> Comment number 22 . <p> No - if you read my post , I did say that Leeds were by no means alone &amp; that the FA should find a means of deterring pitch invasions , particularly those while a game is still going on as these can often intimidate opposition teams &amp; put pressure on referees to end games early . <h> Comment number 23 . <p> Flooch has a point .

Most clubs are not blameless , I remember people running on the pitch after we stayed up against Wimbledon years ago . After the game in celebration is not I suppose such a big deal but while the game in in progress it is wrong and potentially dangerous and could incite trouble . This is where mentioning Hillbrough is appropriate , it was due to that tragedy that the fences came down and the trust was given to fans to behave appropriatly . Do nt abuse it ! <h> Comment number 26 . <p> Wow what a game ! I was watching it on the internet and simply could not believe what I was seeing when Gradel refused to leave the pitch , even looking like he would fight Beckford rather than leave . He should n't play for Leeds again after such disgraceful actions in one of the biggest games we 've played in years .

Fantastic ! ! ! <h> Comment number 28 . <p> Taking nothing away from the season as a whole for Leeds but there is a wide spread feeling here in Bristol that the Rovers players sort of ' let ' Leeds get that second goal yesterday as they had one eye on the crowd . I 've never seen some of the players run so fast as they did at the final whistle . Ca n't really blame them either , I would n't have wanted to be on the pitch denying them promotion . <h> Comment number 29 . <p> tonbar do nt alienate the boy becuase he made a mistake , he reacted because he knew how much that game meant to the all of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quality in our team . I am still not sure that Bates will invest in the team to bring in the quality we need to make us contenders . We got to be a more attractive prospect for a new investor , our fans base is in the top 10 . Marching on together . <h> Comment number 30 . <p> Congrats to Leeds for finally getting themselves out of League 1 and into Championship football , I hope that your fans wo n't be expecting an immeadiate return to the Premier for the 2011-12 season , the Championship is a notoriously hard league to get out of .... <p> With Burnley and Hull coming into it with parachute payments ( Do n't think Portsmouth will get theirs ) and next season all the Championship clubs ( Expect for Norwich , Leeds and the playoff winner ) will get Newcastle and West Broms 2nd and 3rd year parachute payments split between them . <p> Will be tough but I wish Leeds all the best , would be good to have you back in the Premier , I remember how intense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot back in the 80's/90 's <h> Comment number 32 . <p> Thanks for the comments . Interesting to see fans from Chelsea and Man Utd offering what looks like sincere congratulations . <p> I reckon that although plenty of people say they can not stand Leeds , some of their traditional rivals quite miss them and would welcome playing them more often . <p> As for next season 's Championship - I agree with all those suggesting it will be a tight league . The teams coming down do n't look like they will be in great shape to bounce straight back and a couple of teams will no longer have parachute payments . <p> It is the reason why Sheffield Wednesday chairman Lee Strafford was so keen to avoid the drop . He made it quite clear in the week before their crunch game against Palace that he felt next season 's Championship would be a league of great possibility . <h> Comment number 33 . <p> We 'll take the thanks from Man U and Chelsea with goodwill , even though ( in the past at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many cracking games between them and us during the 90s ( most recently ) and of course in the times of Bremner , Charlton and Harris with atmosphere that was out of the top drawer . <p> Thanks for your coverage Paul , which was objective as you can hope for from a neutral ! <p> In terms of replacements we need much strengthening . The defence has been a weakness , esp . since Kisnorbo got injured . We need some defenders who are n't 5 years past their best who are dominant in the air and who concentrate fully to avoid leaking a large number of late goals at set pieces and are n't burned off by even moderate pace , full backs who can defend and get forward and supply some crosses , a midfield general like David Batty , who are dominant in the tackle and also use the ball well , plus at least 2 strikers proven at Championship level to replace Beckford and give us more options . I like Becchio but ca n't see him scoring 15 goals in the CCC . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other players saved his bacon by showing such character a man down and a goal down , but until his dismissal , he was the next best player to Beckford on the field and had done well in the last half a dozen games . I think he will be forgiven and can maybe prove he 's up to the CCC next season . <h> Comment number 34 . <p> It certainly was nerve wrecking.Beckford stepped up to the role of captain something I did n't think he coukd do.Yesterday was one of his best games of the season.Some strengthening will need to be done for next year but let 's not worry about that for the moment . <h> Comment number 35 . <p> As a life long leeds fan , I want to first say well done to the lads and grayson ... as usual , they put the fans through it right to the very end .

Was the lack of activity in the January transfer window due to lack of funds , lack of judgement or a desire to obtain different players fit for the championship at the end of the season ? Why were out of form players picked and others overlooked week after week ? <p> Of course certain players are not of championship standard and others will prove better than they were in Division 1 .

Now we just need Bates , or whomever , to pony up some money and for Grayson to spend it wisely . <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family told us on Friday that he would get the boot if we did nt gone up this year . Also , he has no confidence that he will receive any financial backing for next season . So it does nt bode well . <p> In many respects Mr Bates will be disappointed by the promotion , as he was raking in large sums playing in this division . Work out what he made this season , with average gates of 22,000 ( at 25quid a ticket ) , 4 cup games vs Man Utd away and Spurs home and away , and Liverpool at home , add on the Delph transfer fee of up to 8million . He literally creamed over 20million in profit . Probably a lot more . He chose not to buy Thorp Arch back , ludicrous and short sighted , and shows he does nt have the long term interests of the club at heart . <p> He will need to spend more next year , and even though we will be a division higher , his profits may drop . <p> Leeds desperately need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us to the next step , ( like at Southampton ) rather than an old man padding his retirement funds . <p> Grayson needs to quit with his tinkering and loan signings , as this destroyed our season ( and does EVERY year ) . The base of our squad isnt bad , but certainly we need at least 4-6 players . Main priorities should be a central midfielder , forward , right back , centre back . <p> I 'm honestly impressed by the Man U and Chelsea fans and their congratulations . Thanks guys , its very noble of you . <h> Comment number 46 . <p> This article could had been much better had it also acknowledged that another but very different football team made this such a good game . Rovers could had been uninterested , intimidated or had played not to lose but chose to make it a cracking game very worthy of the English third division . A contrast of the clubs would had been more interesting I am sure . <p> Rovers have never been in the top tier or are they likely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to others . Rovers sold Ricky Lambert at the start of the season to born-again Southampton weeks after the Saints had come out of administration . Southampton reportedly doubled Ricky 's wage which was our club record ; why can clubs like Leeds , Bristol City ( 1982 ) , Cardiff and Southampton ignore the rules of normal businesses ? <p> Perhaps Rovers should borrow ? 20 million for their new stadium , not pay it back and go into administration and then be deducted 10 points ( seems a good deal to me ) . <p> Bitter .... yes .... but it takes two teams to create such a good passionate atmosphere and there were certainly two teams out there , something this report omits . Good luck Leeds ( particulary against the 1982ers ) next season but do n't get carried away again . <h> Comment number 49 . <p> Leeds deserve it ? Why ? I recall a post earlier saying they deserved to go up as champions too ... er , no . We ( Norwich ) won the league , on the basis that over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Looking at post-January form , this lot would be mid table at best .

I suspect that many " neutrals " who wish the opposition to win against Leeds United are not really neutral at all ! Or maybe they are just neutral in the same way that many Scots are neutral in matches where England are playing ? <p> Be that as it may , I 've read many good wishes from football fans who might be expected to be enemies of Leeds United . <p> One of my enduring memories of those times is that Leeds teams were very inclusive in that as well as English players , they also seemed to have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> Comment number 51 . <p> As a Leeds fan living in Australia I had to answer lots of questions this morning as to why the huge grin . <p> Well done the lads , Grayson and everyone working behind the scenes to make this possible ; you 've all made a lot of people happier .... and almost as importantly just as many people un happy ( looking at you Damienmarc666 , so sorry the lads stole your thunder ) . <p> For next season , I 'll be happy for mid table and above , and would absoluetly dread promotion . we 'd get hammered silly . If anything Leeds 've proved they can take the long haul , and in Grayson we have a capable manager who wo n't jump ship . <h> Comment number 52 . <p> To go from sweating out the final game of the regular season in hopes of avoiding the playoffs , to looking at immediate promotion from the CCC within one season seems very optimistic . Especially with a new set of players as is being suggested by many.Nevertheless , here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United , Ipswich , and the three teams who came down from the PL . <h> Comment number 53 . <p> Most Norwich fans I know , plus who posted on the Leeds 606 forum were actually congratulatory and sincere in expressing their good will towards us . Most Leeds fans are very complimentary about Norwich ( and some other clubs such as Charlton and others ) on the forums too . <p> The MEDIA and a few very optimistic/bordering on over confident fans are the ones who peddled all the rubbish about us walking the league , mostly on the back of being top at Christmas and especially after beating Man U. Most real Leeds fans knew it would never be that easy after we then almost immediately lost to Exeter ( deservedly so ) , when Grayson did nothing except pick up a couple of dubious loan signings in January ( no thanks to Ken Bates here ) , when Beckford got seduced by the media who had him going to about 12 different PL or Championship clubs and whose performances dropped off for the next 3 and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best defender by far got a long term injury and then when we struggled badly against Walsall , Hartlepool , Swindon , Wycombe and Brighton etc in the coming weeks after the FA Cup game . <p> Leeds and Norwich enjoy good relations , so I do n't worry what the odd dissenting voice says - for Heaven 's sake , I sat in the Drysalters pub with Norwich fans after Carlton Palmer scored a late goal years ago which condemned Norwich to relegation and had 2 pints bought for me by fans who were devastated but fair . Most Norwich fans do n't have silly biases against anyone but the Tractor Boys and Colchester AFAIK . <h> Comment number 54 . <p> I know there 's a lot of talk about us getting back to back promotions and I fully believe that we 've joined the championship at a very good time , no stand out teams , no teams of the Newcastle , West Brom standard of this season . I do n't want to get too far ahead of myself and say " oh we 'll definitely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they have us at 7/2 to win the championship and 10/11 to be promoted , Im not sure how good an Indicator that is and I 'm not going to count my chickens but I think it does show how open it could be next season . A couple of good signings and I think we could be in the mix , here 's hoping MOT ! <h> Comment number 55 . <p> " Leeds deserve it ? Why ? I recall a post earlier saying they deserved to go up as champions too ... er , no . We ( Norwich ) won the league , on the basis that over the course of the season we were the better team . " <p> You 've answered your own question , we deserve it because over the course of the season we were one of the top 2 teams . <p> As for hoping we go down again , you 'll not be the only one , but we 've never really cared for the opinions of others anyway . <h> Comment number 57 . <p> From the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sunday I 'd log onto the internet to see how Leeds had done and was happy when they sat at the top of the league for so long . This was going to be our year ! Then we started to slip and feared only getting into the play-offs which we have n't done well in , in the past . However that is now all history and we are in the Championship league.When I logged onto the internet on Sunday 9 May and saw Millwall had won , Charlton had won my heart dropped but scrolling down the page to the Leeds result was heaven - well done lads ! I bet the atmosphere at Elland Road after the final whistle must have been pure mayhem - we 've finally escaped League One and look forward to the start of next season . <h> Comment number 58 . <p> Beckford is n't even close to being good enough to make it in the Premier League , let alone at a club as good as Everton . The media really need to actually watch the bloke rather than just look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Becfords pace running onto it might work in League 1 , but would not work in the Championship never mind the Premier League . Leeds have some decent players in Kisnorbo and Snodgrass especially , and need to start building to play better football than they have this season , which they will probably do . Although as a Town fan I hate them , I ca n't see them dropping back down , and think it is far more likely they will be going up again in the next few years . <h> Comment number 59 . <p> The good wishes from rival supporters is much appreciated . As far as new signings are concerned , I see Beattie has been mentioned . He would be good . If not , could we tempt Kevin Phillips from Birmingham ? He would be dropping down a league , but would he be prepared to do that for a more regular place in a team ? <p> I 'm not sure what Simon Grayson has against Andy Robinson . On the occasions I have seen him play for us ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had a certain spark , and he appears to have lost weight recently too . <h> Comment number 60 . <p> " I would be very interested to know which areas Leeds supporters feel Grayson needs to strengthen - and how far they feel their team can go next season . " <p> In Grayson we trust ; Simon has the backing of the fans and his decisions are always respected . Making Beckford Captain on Saturday was a brave and brilliant decision . Beckford led from the front and was arguably man of the match . <p> Next season we will not be going into every game expecting to be guaranteed the three points . Whilst most supporters felt Leeds were too good to be in League One , I do not think the majority of fans will be expecting promotion next season . Hopefully this will take a bit of pressure off the team , particularly at home where the expectation soon turns to anger and frustration if we go a goal behind . <p> As for fans travelling from far and wide to watch Leeds , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were lots of passengers wearing Leeds shirts and scarves in the many different check-in queues . I flew back to Oslo and there were at least forty fellow supporters on the same flight . <h> Comment number 62 . <p> Cmr-OAfc - can you tell me , honestly ... why do YOU not like Leeds ? If you have a good enough reason I will let you be ! Serveral other big spending teams ? So that suggests that the cup final excuse is n't a good one this year ? Maybe that would imply we should have gone up this season then ? Oh ... Look , we did . Looks like your comment has only cemented the opinion that the cup final excuse is a great one ! <h> Comment number 64 . <p> Staying in the championship next year will be a lot easier than getting promoted from League One , so I think Simon Grayson will be in a no lose situation . Most fans and the chairman will settle for a season of consolidation . <p> However if Leicester can get in the championship play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see no reason why Leeds can not do the same . <h> Comment number 65 . <p> Well after 3 seasons in League One , the team showed us what we knew they were capable of doing and got us up . The last 2 months have been a rollercoaster for all Leeds fans and we have gone through every emotion possible . Now we look forward to next season , lets not get carried away we are stepping up in quality and I believe that we need to add 4 -5 quality players to start to build a team to get us into the premiership.I am glad its over , have a great summer and we will all march on together in the championship . Kudos to the other fans who would like to see Leeds playing in the Premiership . <h> Comment number 67 . <p> Grayson- His resume is enough to justify his presence at Leeds , his love for the club is enough to allow for a margin of error- despite the criticism he recieved post-december . Fact is , he said he would get us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the goodwill fro those who gave it , no offense but with our history and tribulations , promotion means something special for us . The media gives us enough flack that it seems fair to have our day . <p> Squad- General comments- Beckford ; I 've consistently had the same criticism and praise no matter how he performs . His heart is n't with Leeds , but we paid for him to play and he 's done that . I do n't see any way he will stay- why would he ? But he had a noteworthy exit , and a great season which is the reason we are getting promoted .. He nearly tripled Becchio this season in goals . So godspeed to the Everton bench . <p> We need to overhaul the squad , I love every one of em but our Cup performances just showed that we can compete , not beat the best week in week out . Graysons signings/loans have about broken even for the season , McSheffrey and Dickov were a waste of money , and signing Somma was respecful but a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Despite his lack of goals , Snodgrass is consistently the most unselfish playmaker on the field . Becchio is a great partner up front for anyone , and is only going to get better . But we need two more strikers , Gary Hooper and Rickie Lambert or poaching a Championship player . <p> I do n't think our midfield is nearly as bad off as some have been saying ... Johnson , Hughes , and Kilkenny are decent , Gradel is ok , Howson is staying anyways . But it would be great to strengthen up if possible . <p> Defense ... Kisnorbo is a rock , paired up again with Rui would be great . Ben Parker ( when fit ) is solid . Bromby has certainly had his moments , but we obviously need the most work here . <p> Keeper- I may be one of the only people who thinks Casper should be in front ... Higgs is an exceptional player , but Casper has done phenomenally well all year , and in all our big games . I do nt think we need anyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Not knowing who owns the club is in Ken Bates 's top ten worst things he 's done to the fans , and the most stressful now . I just hope whoever holds the wallet can give us the resources to put us in the Premiership ASAP . But we have a team with loyalty and heart , and thats worth more than Messi . <h> Comment number 68 . <p> Great article Fletch . Two things immediately spring to mind regarding next season for Leeds . Beckford MUST stay . Where else is he going to be guaranteed first team football in front of 35,000+ fans every week ? ? He needs to sack his agent , sit down with Grayson and Bates , and sort his future out . For all his faults , the guy is well on the way to becoming a Leeds legend . I believe he 's capable of hitting 30 goals in the Championship and he should do it for us . If he wants Prem ' football - get there with us - he 's still young.Secondly , ( and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next season looks tougher than the Championship ! ! I 'm so pleased we 're out of it . Southampton , ( 3 from ) Millwall , Charlton , Hudds and Swindon , + Plymouth , Sheff Wed , Posh ! ! ! Hard division.Me ? I 'd settle for a nice cosy 8th/10th place all season long !

The Doctor has moments of anger at the way people behave and his inability to help , whilst Amy has the right mixture of awe and level-headedness . This is further enhanced when the Doctor and Amy are separated and the characters , particularly Amy , are allowed to develop . Amy becomes friendly with the Sittuun Charlie , whilst the Doctor finds himself prisoner of the human leader , Django . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from strong character development over a plotline that has a number of holes in it .

It has a well developed sense of adventure and humour , interesting characters and a setting that is at once believable and amazing to consider . The relationship between the Doctor and Amy , the Sittuuns and the humans , and the arrogance of Dirk Slipstream are never overplayed , remaining well balanced by the use of humour that never becomes unwelcome or slapstick . <p> All-in-all , it is definitely a fantastic addition to the Eleventh Doctor Adventures .

Could not subscribe , try again later <p> DEPUTY First Minister Ieuan Wyn Jones will today attempt to convince the new Conservative and Liberal Democrat Government that the main rail line from London to Swansea must be electrified . <p> He wants the administration to commit to the electrification of the Great Western railway and to hold a meeting with new Transport Secretary Philip Hammond . <p> His call comes against a backdrop of concern that Wales will miss out on high-speed rail and find itself in competition with cities such as Leeds if electrification does not take place . <p> Speaking at an Institution of Civil Engineers conference in Cardiff , the Plaid Cymru leader will stress that electrification is vital for the economy . <p> He will say : " I want to see Wales equipped with fast , 21st century rail links . Electrification of the Great Western railway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to our economic development . <p> " As transport minister for Wales , I want to ensure that the needs of Wales are on the radar . The outgoing government in Westminster committed themselves to making sure electrification went through to Swansea by 2017 and I know that Network Rail has already made a start on scoping the project . <p> " I will now be pressing the new UK government to make the same commitment . Electrification of such routes is essential for the Welsh economy -- and I will now be calling for a meeting with the new Transport Secretary to discuss the issue . " <p> Professor Stuart Cole , a leading transport expert at the University of Glamorgan , warned that Wales is likely to miss out on the next generation of high-speed rail travel if electrification does not take place . <p> This , he warned , would put Wales at a competitive disadvantage to other regions . <p> He said : " Once the high-speed rail is built we start to be in competition with Leeds . It 's a very pleasant city and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ journey times , not distances . " <p> Mr Cole hopes that the electrification will not halt at Bristol but continue through to Wales . <p> He said : " If we do n't get it now we are not likely to get it in the future . That 's a major concern to us in Wales . " <p> The Welsh Conservatives had a manifesto commitment to support the " electrification of the Great Western line to South Wales " . <p> The manifesto also stated : " We will turn the rail regulator into a powerful passenger champion and reform Network Rail to make it more accountable to its customers . And we will introduce a moratorium on building on disused rail lines still in public ownership , so they are available to be re-opened .

The better the railway service you have , the more people use trains and leave the cars at home . " <p> Russell Lawson of the Federation of Small Businesses said improvements to the line were essential both to business and the image of Wales . <p> " It does make us look a bit backward if we have only just got around to electrifying the railways which much of Europe has achieved . It does make us look a bit ridiculous .

@@1492233 <h> Album : William Fitzsimmons -- Derivatives <p> William Fitzsimmons , the son of two blind musicians from Pittsburgh , announced his arrival last year with his official debut The Sparrow And The Crow . Filled with the sort of gentle folk-rock that quickly racked him up a series of US television soundtrack appearances , the album saw Fitzsimmons earn comparisons with the likes of Joe Henry and Nick Drake . <p> But fans hungry for a proper follow-up are going to have to wait a little longer . Instead , Fitzsimmons has returned with Derivatives , a series of re-mixes and re-recordings of those original songs . <p> It may take fans of the original a while to get their heads around . The Sparrow and The Crow was a documentary of divorce . In using electronica to brighten up these tracks , Fitzsimmons has deliberately caused a huge mood shift . Derivatives opener I Do n't Feel It Anymore was among the sad points on the original album , but here it is reimagined as a pop song with Brooke Fraser helping out on the vocals . <p> It 's one of two versions of the song included here , along with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is one new composition , So This Is Goodbye , featured twice , once in an original form that would have fit on the main album , and then with a Pink Ganter remix .

Not all Fitzsimmons ' fans will appreciate the different sound , and even for those that do , this will only hold us over for so long while we await the follow-up LP.

" <p> Asked whether she works better with female staff on her films , Duffy replies : " I 've had some truly fantastic experiences working with women on set , but I 've also had some truly shocking experiences working with women - including on this film . " <p> Kate Kinninmont , from the organisation Women In Film and Television , says statistics show that more women than ever are going to film school , but they are still not getting credit they deserve . <p> " It 's very frustrating because when Kathryn Bigelow won the Oscar this year I was asked to go on Channel 4 News to defend the story that the Academy had voted for her to spite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Academy waited for 82 years to give a woman an Oscar just because they did n't like her ex-husband . <p> I just asked him for ? 25,000 and the guy actually gave me a book of signed chequesAlicia Duffy on how she funded her first short film <p> " People are starting to understand that Bigelow 's film could have been made by a man or a woman . We 're not just little girls making girly things . We 've really got to get rid of the whole gender thing . Alicia is a bloody good director and then she 's a female director . " <p> Kinninmont pays tribute to Bond producer Barbara Broccoli , who is supporting a scheme to provide aspiring female film-makers with a mentor . <p> Duffy was an early beneficiary of the scheme , and spent two years shadowing David Yates , as he directed Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix . <p> " Just watching him direct this monster machine was amazing , " she says . <p> " I could see people wanting to give him things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see . " <h> Finding funding <p> Directing was not always Duffy 's ambition . Originally , she was a musician and trained as an opera singer .

Then when you say you 're going to be a film director , everyone laughs at you , " she says . <p> She finished her first short film , Charmed , just days before the deadline closed for applying to film school . <p> The film came together almost by accident while Duffy worked as a receptionist . <p> " I would literally sit in reception and write all day and answer the phone every two hours , " says Duffy . <p> " Then one of the partners asked me what I was doing and I told him I was writing a script . I did n't realise he was a partner at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then he rang me about half an hour later asking me how much money I needed to make the film . " <p> She admits that this may have given her a " false view as to how easy it is " to get a film made . <p> " I just asked him for ? 25,000 and the guy actually gave me a book of signed cheques . " <p> The director concedes that working on her first feature film was " exhausting " and has made this year 's trip to Cannes a very different experience to her earlier trips - with Crow Stone , which won a Cinefondation award in 2001 , and The Most Beautiful Man in the World , in 2003 . <p> " The big leap that I 'm experiencing now is , once you go into features , you 're actually in the business of film .

I even made her do one in her bikini - which sounds kind of dodgy - but I knew she was going to be exposed and I had to tell her she was going to kiss a boy , which she was fine about . <p> " She was extraordinarily professional throughout and was really quite something , " she says . <p> Image caption All Good Children was funded in Belgium , France and Ireland <p> Duffy also recalls another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tame fox . <p> " This went on for months - trying to find a fox - and we finally found a man who had a pet fox , " she says . <p> " Anyway , the fox ran away during the shoot and I do n't know if they ever found it . <p> " I actually cried about that on set . " <p> Despite the problems she encountered on her first feature , it has not put Duffy off . She says she is already planning her next film . This time though , she wants a writing partner . <p> " I 'm sure some people really love the process of writing but I find it quite difficult .

Sorry about these adverbs , by the way -- if you 've just been reading or rereading a Martin Amis novel it can be hard to help falling into his style , or at any rate a puny imitation of it ) . <p> What makes this passage so enjoyable is not the action but the richly vivid comic lyricism with which that action is described . For example : <p> " His opening serve I did n't see at all . It fizzed past me , losing its definition for a moment on the centre line , before thwacking first bounce into the green canvas behind my back . The passage of the ball seemed to leave a comet 's trail of yellow against the artificial green of the court .

I toppled backwards and my racket fell with a clatter . For several shocked seconds I lay there like an old dog , an old dog that wants its old belly stroked . " <p> The pleasure is all in the language . But if you 're making a TV version , and you 've decided not to use this narration as a voiceover , then all you 've got to offer the viewer is the action . And what is the action , really ? It 's just a fat guy v a fit guy . Basic , hackneyed slapstick . Nothing clever or witty about it . The cleverness and wit were in the words . And on screen the words are n't there .

But it 's not just the eye-pleasing shape which has drawn attention to it . The intersected concentric pattern has been decoded by experts as a " tantalising approximation " of a mathematical formula called Euler 's Identity ( e ( i * Pi ) + 1 = 0 ) , widely thought be the most beautiful and profound mathematical equation in the world . <p> The design ( pictured above ) appeared beside Wilton Windmill late on Friday night .

" <p> The average person finds such complex mathematical talk utterly confounding , so The Independent Online asked Dr John Talbot , a maths research fellow at University College London , for his take on the matter . He said : " Looking at the crop circle , the link with Euler 's most famous identity seems to make perfect sense . However , the way the formula has been executed is partially incorrect . One of the discrepancies is that one part of the formula translates as ' hi ' rather than ' i ' , which could be somebody 's idea of a joke .

As Francine Blake of the Wiltshire Crop Circle Study Group , explains : " The difficulty is that we do n't know the answer . It 's something that needs to be treated with great respect , but is too often talked about flippantly in the media which , I think , closes the subject rather than opens it .

Pringle says that 93.8 per cent of crop circles are made on chalk , " a worldwide phenomenon " recorded in 54 different countries . She says the significance may be connected to underground springs called aquifers commonly found in chalk : " It is thought that the originating force probably originates in the ionosphere ( an area of atmospheric electricity ) . The force then spirals to earth in the form of a vortical plasma and hits the ground with some 100 of 1000 's of volts per metre for just a nano second only , else the crop would be burnt . Occasionally we do see evidence of scorched flattened crop inside certain circles .

Reports of strange mists creating the complicated patterns in a matter of minutes , their connotations with little green men and Midwich Cuckoos and elaborate hoaxes have fostered a widespread unwillingness to take the idea seriously .

@@1497237 <p> On 24 March 2010 , the Qu ? bec Minister of Health and Social Services published two sets of regulations related to assisted reproduction . One specified how the government will supervise clinical and research activities ( e.g. IVF ) ; the other laid out the terms for publicly funding these activities . These regulations complement Bill 26 ( adopted in June 2009 ) that approved the public funding of assisted reproduction , a promise by the Liberal government in the last provincial election . <p> Once the regulations were posted , there was a 45 calendar-day limit for the posting of comments . Such a limited ' consultation ' period could guarantee neither dialogue nor concrete change . And , to date , no true public debate has occurred over whether or not assisted reproduction services should be publicly funded . <p> The F ? d ? ration du Qu ? bec pour le planning des naissances ( FQPN ) is - among other groups - opposed to the adoption of the proposed regulations for a number of reasons . Perhaps the most important of these are concerns about how they will divert public funding from essential medical services and further privatise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as it was planning to allocate $80 Million per year ( after the first year ) of public funds to assisted reproduction - a service that relies on high-technology-based practices to benefit the few - the Charest government was suggesting the possibility of imposing retrogressive user fees for basic health services on all Qu ? becers . The government 's willingness to divert taxpayers ' money into assisted reproduction services is especially baffling when scarce funding means pregnant women across Qu ? bec increasingly lack access to family practitioners , obstetricians , and midwives . Moreover , the government has not even proposed funding for less **25;150;TOOLONG ways of preventing infertility . We must ask if the government 's choice to finance IVF for some is truly a priority when the health of the general population will be put at risk if the proposed user fees are enacted . <p> The published regulations also suggest that public funding will cover a much broader set of activities than originally announced when Bill 26 was passed . In 2009 , the government said that public funds would cover up to three cycles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , depending on the techniques used , public funds will cover up to six cycles of IVF as well as all related services , such as freezing sperm for an indefinite period of time . They also include funding for poorly-defined research activities and experimental techniques . Worse still , the measures to be used for supervising all of these activities are fragmentary and gravely incomplete . <p> Secondly , as written , the proposed regulations threaten the separation of public and private health care , something fundamental to the integrity of our universal health care system . For example , the ambiguity in the regulations suggests that there could be public payment for IVF performed in a private facility by physicians who do not participate in the public regime ( RAMQ ) . In other words , non-participating physicians could be fully insured and compensated using public funding . If so , this would seem to contravene the law on health insurance which precludes the use of RAMQ funds to pay non-participating physicians .

While I saw this I was n't really prepared for how far they 'd take that idea as presented in Chuck Versus The Subway . <p> The previous story left us with the rather daunting prospect of Chuck going up against a new Intersect powered by a certainly alive Daniel Shaw , while The Ring holds his sister . Except Chuck knows nothing of these things at the outset , and he 's having issues with what the Intersect is doing to his brain ! <p> This soon changes when he sees Shaw and follows him down into the subway , and luckily , the station 's TV surveillance proves he 's not having a delusion . This is all pretty serious stuff . And while they do counterpoint it with some broad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and then telling Awesome , it does n't really balance the darker tone of this story . <p> However , the reappearance of Shaw causes the entire Chuck story to take a massive leap off into the deep end , in one of the most brilliant pieces of writing we 've yet seen in this show , and actually much better than many serious spy adventures . Every minute , for at least the next ten , I kept shouting ' Alias ' at the screen , as it was revealed that Daniel had masterminded an impressive subversion of the CIA with Ring agents , but that his objectives were the destruction of Chuck , and just about everyone he knows ! <p> That includes a new character they 've added , Alex , the daughter of Casey , who moves rather abruptly from being a waitress to a potential Ring target . <p> There 's a marvellous elevator of threat that is developed here , where I kept thinking that things could n't get worse , but they then did substantially . <p> Very shortly , all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neutralised , and the last hope for all the agents becomes those who are just civilians .

I ca n't think of many ostensibly ' comedy ' shows that have the balls to kill a character , but this one certainly has . It made me think about The A-Team where people used automatic weapons with total abandon but nobody ever got killed .

Gary McKinnon 's battle against extradition has caught the public , as has the now notorious " Pathway Students " terrorist deportation case . An examination of three recent decisions highlights the various ways in which the courts approach the human rights arguments in such cases . <p> There have been a steady stream of high-profile deportation and extradition decisions in the past few weeks , none more controversial than the " Pathway students " case , where two suspected terrorists were saved from deportation to Pakistan as they were thought to be at risk of torture or death upon their return . The Daily Telegraph reports that the Human Rights Act is being invoked in a growing number of asylum and immigration case , although it does not say whether the number of successful uses of the Act has increased . <p> Gary McKinnon 's case has rumbled on since 2002 , and he may finally be saved from extradition to the United States on computer hacking charges by the new Government . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Coalition Government 's plans to " review the operation of the Extradition Act -- and the US/UK extradition treaty -- to make sure it is even-handed " . <p> Unpopular but clear law <p> However controversial and unpopular such decisions are , the current law is clear . Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights prohibits " inhuman or degrading punishment " . The article has a long history , expressly evoking the 1688 Bill of Rights , which prohibits " cruell and unusuall punishments " . <p> Unlike other rights , Article 3 is unqualified , which means that a State is not permitted to justify a breach on any grounds . It is now uncontroversial ( in the courts , at least ) that to return a person to a country where there is a real risk that they will be in danger or torture , loss of life or inhuman or degrading treatment would breach Article 3 . Therefore , the courts have no choice but to prevent any extradition or deportation which would put a person at serious risk . <p> Last chance for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a complete bar to deportation or extradition , in practice it is difficult and relatively rare to successfully invoke it in court , as Gary McKinnon has found out to his detriment in a series of judgments against him since 2002 . <p> One of Teresa May 's first acts as Home Secretary has been to announce an adjournment of McKinnon 's extradition case , providing him with a last-minute reprieve against extradition . McKinnon was indicted by a US court in November 2002 for hacking into 97 computers in the US Defence Department and NASA . He has fought a 7-year legal battle , arguing that he should n't be extradited as his Asperger 's Syndrome caused an obsession with UFOs . <p> McKinnon 's legal battle has included a number of appeals to the Administrative Court , which is often the court of last resort in extradition claims . In July 2009 Lord Justice Burnton rejected his claim that due to his mental condition , his detention would involve inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment which would , if committed in this country , infringe Article 3 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treatment had been set high in previous cases , and stated that <p> if I compare his condition with those considered in the authorities to which I have referred above , even taking full account of the ( in my view undesirable ) possibility of his being prosecuted in this country , his case does not approach Article 3 severity . <p> McKinnon also claimed under Article 8 , the right to private and family life , but this was also rejected , as his extradition was found to be a lawful and proportionate response to his alleged offending . Unlike Article 3 , Article 8 is a qualified right , which means that it can be overrided if there is a strong public interest in doing so . <p> The case has now been adjourned by the Home Secretary so she can consider the medical evidence afresh . Geoffrey Robertson QC calls this a test case for principles and suggests that the Home Secretary 's " main difficulty will be to override her Home Office advisers who have for years fought an unremitting , expensive and merciless battle against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ signs are good for McKinnon , as in opposition Nick Clegg called the case a " travesty of justice " and David Cameron said that he saw " no compassion in sending him to America " . Some say that the case highlights the unfair and unbalanced extradition agreement that the UK has with the US . <p> However , if McKinnon is spared extradition , it is likely to be through extra-judicial intervention , and as such may neither help nor hinder other such cases of alleged inhuman and degrading punishment in the future , except to demonstrate the importance of a well fought publicity campaign . It may well lead to a change in the law , as foreshadowed by the new Government . <p> Russian justice system not up to scratch in Dudko <p> Another way of fighting extradition is via Article 6 , the right to a fair trial . The UK can not allow a person to be sent back to a judicial system which is likely to breach their rights to a fair and public hearing . <p> Lord Justice Thomas was presented with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on the grounds that the judicial system in Russia was too corrupt , and would not guarantee the claimant a fair trial if he were to be extradited . The judge decided the case on a separate technical point , but had sympathy with the corruption argument . <p> A District Judge had previously examined the facts of the case , and had expressed serious concerns that the claimant 's business was targeted " at best involving mixed motives " , that the official involved attempted to exhort him and had possibly acted in league with the case investigators . He held that the extradition could only take place if the system allowed for the claimant 's allegations of corruption to be considered in full . <p> Lord Justice Thomas explained that in order for the claimant to succeed , it was necessary to show that " the deficiencies in the process were such that the trial he would face on his return would be so fundamental as to amount to a nullification or destruction of the very essence of the rights Article 6 guaranteed . " <p> Mr @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that a prosecution could not validly be brought if it was based on trumped up or fictitious charges or rooted in the corruption of the prosecutor in that case , and that a legal system which denied the right of a defendant to raise that issue in the trial of charges where there was credible evidence of corruption of was a system where there would be a flagrant denial of justice . <p> The court held that the most worrying aspect of the Russian system was that it was not possible to seek documentation in relation to the trumped up nature of the charges and the corrupt nature of the prosecution nor to raise those matters at all in the trial of the charges . The judge concluded that , contrary to the arguments put by the Russian state <p> There would appear to be no public interest grounds that could be advanced as a justification for withholding information . The question would arise as to how there could be confidence in the reliability or truth of evidence presented by the prosecutor where there was no right to examine whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was acting in bad faith or who was corrupt . <p> Ultimately , the case was decided on other grounds , but the judge made a strong statement which will be useful to anyone being extradited to Russia in the future , observing that <p> These questions raise important issues in relation to the role and accountability of the prosecutor in relation to the fairness of a criminal trial which requires more detailed examination than was possible . In the light of my conclusion the appellant be discharged because the offence was not properly specified , it would not be desirable to express a view on whether on the facts of this case , the Russian system violates Article 6 or does so in such a way as to amount to a flagrant denial of justice . <p> Khan -- difficult to show abuse of process <p> The judge in Dudko was sympathetic to the Article 6 arguments in relation to the Russian justice system . But attempting similar arguments in respect of more established legal systems , such as the US , is much more difficult , as can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Government of the United States of America2010 EWHC 1127 ( Admin ) ( 19 May 2010 ) . <p> Mr Khan had been indicted in the US on offences of conspiracy to export cocaine to the UK . The Government of the United States of America requested his extradition . He argued , amongst other things , that the courts should stay his extradition as it was predicated on the misconduct of foreign police officers acting in the UK , who had entrapped him . The misconduct , it was argued , constituted an abuse of process and breached the defendant 's Article 6 Convention rights . The judge rejected the abuse of process argument , stating that <p> Authority is clear -- the abuse of process jurisdiction is residual in nature ; it applies only when the issues raised can not be addressed by the statutory protections ... It follows there are no grounds for distinguishing Symeou.It matters not that the misconduct alleged took place in this jurisdiction rather than the United States .

Up to ? 100,000 ( about ? 85,000 ) is totally guaranteed -- this compares with ? 50,000 under the FSCS . <h> Any catches <p> The rates on most easy access accounts are variable , while ING 's is fixed for the first year . This could be a good thing as it is guaranteed not to fall over the next 12 months . However , it is also guaranteed not to go up which means you may lose out if interest rates start rising . <p> If you are an existing ING Direct savings customer , you wo n't qualify for this deal . <h> Verdict <p> The reason why this account is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the fact the rate is guaranteed not to fall during the first year . Given that variable rate savings accounts plummeted as a result of the Bank of England base rate falling from 5.00% to 0.50% between October 2008 and March 2009 , it 's not surprising that people are attracted by the certainty of the ING Direct Account . <p> However , think about where we are in the interest rate cycle : base rate is at a historic low of 0.50% and wo n't fall any lower . Therefore , just how valuable is a 12-month rate guarantee ? Most variable rate savings accounts are n't directly linked to base rate so in theory could fall even if there is no change in the Bank of England rate . This is a risk , but in the vast majority of cases it unlikely to happen in the current environment . <p> Conversely , we know that base rate will start to move upwards at some point -- we just do n't know when . Some economists think it will rise before the end of the year . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you definitely wo n't benefit from a higher savings rate as a result because the rate is fixed . <p> Therefore , the guarantee is arguably not as good as it first appears . That said , this account is one of the most competitive easy access rates currently available and of course , you have the peace of mind that the rate wo n't drop for a year . If interest rates do start to rise in the next 12 months and it loses its competitive edge in comparison to other easy access accounts , you can always move your money as there are no withdrawal restrictions . <p> You should make a note to move to an alternative account after 12 months as the rate will drop substantially at that point . <h> Top tip <p> Get into the habit of regularly checking your savings rate . The easy access savings market is highly competitive but the leading deals tend to include introductory bonuses or 12-month headline rates . Providers know most people will forget to move their money once the introductory offer ends , so make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ returns you can get on your savings by getting into the habit of moving your money every year . <h> Please note : Any rates or deals mentioned in this article were available at the time of writing .

Thankfully she did not . <p> Inside the dusty envelope were contact sheets of a young Brigitte Bardot in braids and ballet pointes , sucking her thumb , playing with her dog and pulling faces . <p> The exclusive photos , never before seen in Britain and not seen in France for more than half a century were thought to have been lost . They were taken by Mrs Boulat 's late husband , the French society photographer Pierre Boulat , who was living in the same apartment building as Bardot , who was then just 16 or 17 years old . <p> They reveal Bardot as an ingenue schoolgirl lacking artifice and playing the fool in the early 1950s , before the film And God Created Woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a blonde bombshell and an international celebrity . <p> At the time Bardot , whose ambition since she was seven years old had been to become a classical dancer , was a rising ballet star at the respected National Superior Conservatoire de Paris for Music and Dance , where one of her classmates was Leslie Caron . <h> Related Articles <p> Though her celebrated hourglass figure is evident from the photos of her in her leotard and satin ballet pointe shoes , the other pictures of Bardot in baggy pyjamas in bed with her dog and sucking her thumb , are a portrait of soon-to-be lost innocence . <p> Pierre Boulat , who worked for Life magazine , and died in 1998 at the age of 73 , sold the negatives to a French newspaper that later closed down . <p> " My husband always spoke about having photographed Brigitte Bardot but we could never find the photos or the negatives , " Mrs Boulat , 72 , told The Sunday Telegraph . <p> " Then recently I was sorting out the cellar at our home and throwing lots of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

@@1502236 <h> Euro crisis : how will it affect me ? <h> What caused the European debt crisis , how long will it last , and how worried should Britons be ? <p> Europe is in crisis . Austerity measures have been announced in several countries including Greece and Spain , the euro is under pressure and stock markets across the globe have fallen sharply from their recent highs -- and it is all due mainly to sovereign debt . <p> But what is sovereign debt and why has it caused a crisis ? And should people in Britain be worried ? <p> We have spoken to the experts to help answer these questions . <p> Q I keep hearing about sovereign debt . What is it ? <p> National governments issue bonds as a way of borrowing to help meet their spending on education , health , defence and so on . Just like any bond , a sovereign debt bond pays investors interest over its term and the bondholder gets his money back on maturity . In Britain , these bonds are better known as gilts . <h> Related Articles <p> Andy Howse , investment director for fixed income at Fidelity , said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The strength of the promise is a function of the size of the debt compared to the economy in question and the cost of servicing that debt . This can change over time and between nation states . " <p> Q What has caused the debt crisis ? <p> In a word or two , over-borrowing . Sovereign debt is fine so long as the governments have no problem repaying the debt . But several countries have borrowed beyond their means -- the ramifications of the financial crisis have left them struggling to repay their debt . This is why the IMF has agreed a financial package to bail them out . <p> " Greece and other countries will struggle to pay off these debts . This has led to a dramatic spike in borrowing costs for these countries , exacerbating the problems further , " Mr Howse added . " Investors have begun to question the future of European Economic and Monetary Union and whether the crisis may spread beyond the peripheral European countries . " <p> Q Which countries are affected ? <p> Before last week the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Portugal . Last week it was the turn of Spain to announce austerity measures , while Ireland has problems too , although it is trying hard to cut its deficit . <p> Q Will it spread to Britain ? <p> Only Rip van Winkel would be unaware that the UK also has a huge deficit , and so there are concerns that the crisis could spread to these shores . This was why the new coalition moved swiftly by announcing ? 6bn worth of cuts . This has assured investors , for the time being , that Britain will be able to reduce its deficit and repay gilt investors . <p> " We have more flexibility and it was very important for George Osborne to reassure global markets that our deficit is being tackled , " said Azad Zangana , European economist at Schroders . <p> Mr Howse agreed : " A weaker pound should boost the economy by making exports more competitive , and interest rates should remain very low for an extended period . But we ca n't ignore this debt crisis in Europe because of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ activity . " <p> Q Should I be worried ? <p> The good news is that Britain has some advantages over the likes of Greece and Spain . The main one is that it does not belong to the euro and so is able to manipulate the pound to try to boost our economy via interest rates . " We can devalue our currency , which makes the borrowing cheaper . Greece ca n't do that because it belongs to the euro , " said Mr Zangana . <p> But do n't get too complacent . Britain 's position is still precarious -- ? 6bn worth of spending cuts wo n't be enough to clear our ? 156bn deficit , and remember that our economy is reliant on its trade links to Europe . " The UK is in a relatively good position . It can set its own interest rates and has its own floating currency , which are important mechanisms for managing economic growth , " said Mr Howse . <p> " However , the UK is not insulated from debt problems and it is in our interest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , IMF and other central banks . " <p> Q How big an impact could the crisis have on the UK ? <p> Half of all of Britain 's exports go to the Continent , so if Europe 's economy grinds to a halt we will feel the impact . Companies could struggle to increase sales , our economic recovery could hit the buffers and , ultimately , jobs could come under pressure . <p> Howard Archer , an economist at Investec , said : " There is increased pressure on Britain . The FTSE has been hit already , there are concerns of a double dip , and it 's bad news for exporters , which could have a knock-on effect of the wrong kind on our domestic economy . <p> " The June 22 Budget is key . If the measures do n't work there will be a loss of confidence in UK assets and that could store up other problems such as higher interest rates . " <p> Q What about my investments ? <p> You wo n't need reminding that every time a dark cloud hangs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ partners , stock market investors run for the hills , causing share prices to fall . This is what has happened over the past fortnight or so -- the FTSE100 has tumbled from 5,700 to under 5,000 , although this week share prices recovered despite the eurozone crisis worsening . <p> But , again , do n't be complacent . Most experts agree that markets are likely to be jittery for a while yet . <p> Q Is there a danger of a second banking crisis ? <p> This is something that the markets have been speculating over during the past few weeks . Greek , Spanish and Italian bonds are widely held by governments , banks and institutions worldwide and this is why bank shares have been particularly hit in the recent turbulence . <p> Mr Howse said : " Central banks and governments have learned tough lessons from the financial crisis of 2008/09 and are very unlikely to let these problems go so far as to break the global banking system . " <p> Q I bank with Santander . Should I move bank accounts ? <p> Santander @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cash from British savers to back loans to British borrowers , and does not require capital from its Spanish parent . Santander 's British subsidiaries are regulated by the Financial Services Authority and individual savers are protected by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme . <p> The FSCS , a statutory safety net , can pay out 100pc of the first ? 50,000 lost per saver per bank or building society . Up to 90pc of pension and life assurance savings are also protected by the FSCS safety net . <p> A Santander spokesman said : " Customers need not be worried as both Santander and Santander UK are strong businesses focused on retail banking with no exposure to toxic financial products . Our UK business is strong and has a standalone credit rating of AA . " <p> Q Will the crisis go on for much longer ? <p> Most likely . The Greek bailout is over three years , which suggests there is no quick fix . " I think we will have a bumpy ride for a few years . There is a real sense of uncertainty on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Zangana . <p> Mr Archer added : " It is very , very fragile and the eurozone crisis is deep-seated and so will not disappear overnight . We need the bailout package to be implemented as soon as possible and for the affected countries to get their act together . " <p> Q I 'm worried about losing money . What should I do ? <p> Fund managers will talk about market blips throwing up buying opportunities while economists will make predictions that are wrong as often as they are right . It comes down to your attitude to risk and your financial goals . <p> It 's your money and if you are of nervous disposition then invest in safe assets . The safest is cash , of course .

' <p> ' Well , go and catch it , ' he retorts heatedly . <p> Sadly , we are not in some swanky London restaurant frequented by the decadent glitterati , sipping champagne before our seafood platter arrives . Jeremy catches his seafood platter by hand - every day of the week except Sundays . <p> We are on his fishing boat , the Free Spirit II , navigating the choppy emerald seas off Cornwall . The wind is stinging and I have just been nipped by a crustacean . My job is to measure the lobsters to determine if they are large enough to sell and then put rubber bands round their claws . <p> Firm friends : The Fisherman 's Friends are all old salts from Cornwall who remain sceptical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Frankly , this is not my idea of being a groupie . But then Jeremy 's ten-strong group , The Fisherman 's Friends , is not your average boy band . For a start , they have a combined age of 562 . Some of their songs , which are traditional sea shanties , are even older than they are . <p> They may have just signed a ? 1million record deal with the company that brought us Abba and U2 , been on prime time television on three continents and have netted the best slot at the Glastonbury Festival this summer , but fame , it appears , has yet to spoil these old salts . <p> The group , whose members are aged between 46 and 76 , consists of Jeremy , his brothers John and Julian , Chris Scott , Trevor Grills , Nigel Sherratt , John Lethbridge , Jon Cleave , John McDonnell and Peter Rowe . <p> All are Cornish born and bred and live and work in the thimble-sized village of Port Isaac . Three are fishermen , five past and present members @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the ex-harbourmaster . Jon Cleave runs a village shop called The Boathouse , which sells nautical clothing , and Nigel Sherratt has an icecream-coloured tearoom , Cupcakes . <p> There does n't seem much chance for louche living - if The Fisherman 's Friends keep odd hours it 's because of the fish . The Brown brothers put out to sea at dawn ; just when most pop stars are falling into a stupor . <p> Yet , to the group 's collective astonishment , Ealing Studios in West London has just announced its intention to make a film about them , and Jon has just been informed that their lives are to be the subject of a book . <p> ' Du n no why , ' he says , scratching his balding pate and hugging a beer . ' I ai n't taken no drugs .

At least one of the band is conforming to rock-star type . ' Making home improvements already ? Installing luxury fittings ? ' I shout . <p> ' Yeah , ' he admits . ' Only this is n't my house . I 'm being paid to do this for a client . I have a small carpentry business . It 's a family thing . ' <p> I stare at him . Surely , he is joking ?

My hand is hovering nervously by the lobster pot . ' Look , ' yells Jeremy . ' There 's a big ' un . Grab it . ' <p> The lobster has gargantuan claws and a nasty gleam in its eyes . I pick it up by the tail . ' Do n't do that , ' Jeremy sighs . ' It will flip its claws and take off your fingers . Put your hand underneath its middle . ' <p> I hold the beast at arm 's length .

Apparently they enjoy attacking each other . <p> In half an hour , though , I have measured and banded seven lobsters .

@@1502240 <h> Younger women talk of the wisdom of having children earlier , writes Jenny McCartney . <p> The departed forces of New Labour may have been terrible for savers and social mobility , but they were evidently good for one thing : older mothers . In the decade since 1997 , it emerged last week , the number of babies born to mothers over 40 has doubled . Cherie Blair herself embodied the trend by having baby Leo at the age of 45 , after her " contraceptive equipment " was famously omitted from her overnight holdall in Balmoral . <p> The study does not state whether the late babies are comprised of longed-for first children , Cherie-style slip-ups , or last-minute siblings being squeezed in before the curtains threaten to come down on female fertility forever . Whatever the reason , it is true that older mothers have certain advantages , such as patience . They are probably also more exhausted , more of the time . I only say " probably " because -- having had two babies in my thirties -- I sometimes wonder if I would have been more sprightly at the baby 's 5am wake-up call had I got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my abysmal energy levels at university , and shudder .

If I had had a baby any younger , there 's every chance that the enforced wakefulness would have propelled me into a nervous breakdown . <p> It is not simply motherhood that is being put on the long finger , however , but adult independence itself . Grown children are living at home for much longer , paying off their enormous university debts . The average age at which women in the UK have their first baby is now 29.4 ; that of first-time property buyers is 31 , although it rises to 37 for those who are purchasing without help from relatives .

The sitcoms of the time celebrated the wit to be wrung from communal living , the amusing dissection of your flatmates ' choices in boyfriends or girlfriends , the wine-soaked nights and ostentatious hangovers . Then , as the charms of someone else 's dirty washing-up in the sink began to pall , many of those approaching 30 suddenly looked up to find that social shifts had conspired to trap them in sitcom-land forever : they began screaming to get out . <p> The expected rhythm of life for the generation born just after the war was to get married and have children in their twenties , give up working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comfortable retirement thereafter .

I have noticed that younger women , perhaps cowed by all the stern warnings about IVF failure rates and leaving it too late , are beginning to talk of the wisdom of having children earlier : they aspire to emulate domestic goddesses such as Jools Oliver and Tana Ramsay , who live in large houses bursting with ruddy-cheeked children and organic vegetables . <p> If they succeed in that , good luck to them ; if not , I hope they remember to enjoy their twenties and thirties to the full .

Then the Israeli @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among the dead civilians -- totally untrue , but who cares ? -- and then came the second Qana massacre in 2006 and then the 2008-09 Gaza slaughter of 1,300 Palestinians , most of them children , and then ... <p> Well , then came the Goldstone report , which found that Israeli troops ( as well as Hamas ) committed war crimes in Gaza , but this was condemned as anti-Semitic -- poor old honourable Goldstone , himself a prominent Jewish jurist from South Africa , slandered as " an evil man " by the raving Al Dershowitz of Harvard -- and was called " controversial " by the brave Obama administration . " Controversial " , by the way , basically means " fuck you " . <p> There 's doubts about it , you see . It 's dodgy stuff . <p> But back to our chronology . Then we had the Mossad murder of a Hamas official in Dubai with the Israelis using at least 19 forged passports from Britain and other countries . And the pathetic response of our then foreign secretary , David Miliband @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the murder of the guy in Dubai , mind you , just the forgery of UK passports , a highly " controversial " matter -- and then ... Well , now we 've had the shooting down of nine passengers at sea by more Israeli heroes . <p> The amazing thing in all this is that so many Western journalists -- and I 'm including the BBC 's pusillanimous coverage of the Gaza aid ships -- are writing like Israeli journalists , while many Israeli journalists are writing about the killings with the courage that Western journalists should demonstrate . And about the Israeli army itself . Take Amos Harel 's devastating report in Haaretz which analyses the make-up of the Israeli army 's officer corps . In the past , many of them came from the leftist kibbutzim tradition , from greater Tel Aviv or from the coastal plain of Sharon . In 1990 , only 2 per cent of army cadets were religious Orthodox Jews . Today the figure is 30 per cent . Six of the seven lieutenant-colonels in the Golani Brigade are religious . More than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ religious in some infantry brigades . <p> There 's nothing wrong with being religious . But -- although Harel does not make this point quite so strongly -- many of the Orthodox are supporters of the colonisation of the West Bank and thus oppose a Palestinian state . <p> And the Orthodox colonists are the Israelis who most hate the Palestinians , who want to erase the chances of a Palestinian state as surely as some Hamas officials would like to erase Israel . Ironically , it was senior officers of the " old " Israeli army who first encouraged the " terrorist " Hamas to build mosques in Gaza -- as a counterbalance to the " terrorist " Yasser Arafat up in Beirut -- and I was a witness to one of their meetings . But it will stay the same old story before the world wakes up . " I have never known an army as democratic as Israel 's , " the hapless French philosopher Bernard-Henri L ? vy said a few hours before the slaughter . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @

When it 's cold and wet in London , you can guarantee the sun will be blazing there -- and you 're only five hours away with no jet lag to worry about , either . There 's diving at the Red Sea , cruises on the Nile , adventures in the Sahara and tombs and temples just about everywhere . What more could you possibly want ? <p> Well , my needs were actually more limited .

In fact , let 's be honest , it 's grindingly ugly . The pollution is bad . The traffic is worse . <p> The heat ( 41C/106F degrees when I was there in May ) is stifling . What maniac allowed them to build the Grand Hyatt Hotel in such a prominent position on the Nile and then hired an architect who had clearly trained at the Heathrow Airport School of Architecture back in the Sixties ?

What is it with these people ? <p> But I think I do vaguely get the idea . You have to look for the boxes within the boxes . That is , walk through Islamic Cairo , Coptic Cairo , Fatimid Cairo -- it 's just modern Cairo you 've got to avoid . The souk at Khan al-Khalili is undoubtedly fun ( and a great place for a chase with Alex using the various souvenirs -- stone pyramids , spices , copper plates -- as weapons ) , but the streets around the Wikala of al-Ghouri , an ancient hostel , are quieter and just as interesting .

The whole site really is awesome and whispered something of the power of civilisation , the ambition of those ancient dynasties . But an hour later , a thousand coaches and taxis had arrived , turning the place into a glittering car park and rather defeating the point . Modern Cairo again .

There are huge lakes so full of salt that strange , crystal formations stretch themselves over the shorelines . You can swim in the lakes , but because of all the salt you can more or less sit on them , too . The town of Siwa itself is small and sun-baked , spread out beneath the ruined Berber city of Shali , which gives the appearance of having partly dissolved -- which is actually exactly what it did , in 1926 , after three days of heavy rain .

All in all , I was partially successful . Being driven at high speed in a four-by-four over vertiginous sand dunes is an exhilarating experience -- not for nothing is this area known as the Great Sand Sea .

There are no straight lines , no right angles . Nothing is regular . It has been designed to be part of the landscape , and everything about it is discreet . Even the large , freshwater swimming pool is supplied by an underground well ( with a stone spiral staircase leading down into the depths ) . It has no electricity .

@@1510230 <h> BP 's rivals rally round as industry faces turning point <p> Usually they are rivals , but this weekend nearly 90 organisations are in Houston working around the clock to help BP stem the Gulf of Mexico oil spill . The catastrophe , which analysts at Credit Suisse have estimated could cost BP up to $37bn , has led to feverish speculation that the grand old oil major could soon be a takeover target . <p> Yet technical experts from oft-speculated potential buyers ExxonMobil , Royal Dutch Shell and Chevron are among those trying to prevent the escalation of the costs and environmental consequences of the Deepwater Horizon spill . <p> That BP could come into play as an acquisition target becomes ever more possible as the share price collapses , but the idea that a Western major is actually priming itself for a bid is really quite far-fetched . BP 's rivals are more concerned about the wider impact for the oil and gas industry than they are about shelling out for a business empire . <p> The costs of oil projects are set to soar as governments insist on tougher environmental safety standards in the wake of the spill . Already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plans at its Kashagan development , meaning that the current $136bn budget is likely to be busted . <p> " It 's clear that we need the consortium members to take seriously the signals from the Gulf of Mexico event , " Kazakhstan 's minister of oil and gas , Sauat Mynbayev , was quoted when warning Shell last week . What this tragedy -- which killed 11 men after pressure a mile beneath the seabed finally broke through a well -- will lead to is a fundamental reconstruction of both BP and the entire industry . <p> Oil and gas bankers who have worked on some of the biggest acquisitions of recent years say that BP 's suitors will rule out any immediate move . " Everybody at this stage just wants to be seen as helping , " explains one banker . " If it came out that anyone was talking to advisers at this stage about a takeover there would be public outrage . " <p> In other circumstances , a one-third dive in BP 's share price would result in bankers pitching immediately and incessantly at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The BP attitude is ' we do n't think we 're vulnerable to a takeover , we 're totally focused on what we 're doing to control the spill , so leave us alone ' , " says an industry source . <p> However , BP 's regular adviser , Goldman Sachs , is rumoured to be dusting off the company 's defence playbook . Should a bid materialise from China , which would be far less sensitive to the public relations implications of bidding for BP during the greatest ecological disaster of the century so far , the company will need a far bigger defence team . <p> The Goldman link is a result of the previous management regime , as both former chief executive Lord Browne and former chairman Peter Sutherland held senior positions at the bank at the same time . <p> And that historic link presents its own difficulties . Already President Barack Obama has taken to referring to BP as " British Petroleum " , simultaneously distancing his administration from an overseas company and using the full name in the manner of a teacher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most unpopular companies in the US would only reinforce the president 's message . In a US poll last month , Goldman had but a 4 per cent approval rating , partly a result of the Securities and Exchange Commission 's recent charge of fraud against the bank -- allegedly committed in the build-up to the financial crisis . <p> As the pressure builds on BP , so the situation becomes almost unbearable for Hayward . Already he has committed the huge public-relations error of declaring that he would " like my life back " , having based himself in the US since the explosion on 20 April . <p> His position is considered very much in the balance , but industry insiders believe that Hayward is safe in the short-term as he has , at times , successfully reassured investors . <p> For example , US senators Chuck Schumer and Ron Wyden hurt the stock price by calling on BP to suspend its dividend , potentially devastating to UK pension funds that get one-in-six pounds of all such payouts from the company . Hayward announced that the dividend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ firm . <p> Also to his advantage is perception . Firing the top man in the middle of a crisis would only spook the markets when they have just regained a little faith in the company -- shares rose 4 per cent on news that BP had temporarily lowered a cap on to the leaking well . <p> " Why would the board fire him now ? " says a source . " They need him to take the rap and sort it out . " <p> A little further into the future and Hayward is in trouble . Bookie William Hill says Hayward is odds-on to be out of the job by the end of the year . <p> A former oil chief executive says : " I 'm not a great fan of the way that this is playing out for Tony . He 's a very open and candid guy and has boyish looks that do n't give him gravitas . Those are probably attributes that you do n't need in these circumstances . " <p> He is also critical of the BP chairman , Carl-Henric Svanberg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crisis . " Although Tony has n't covered himself in glory , Svanberg has been laughable . You need your chairman to step in and talk to the newspapers while the CEO gets on with the task of sorting out the problem . " <p> While it seems inevitable that there will be regime change , a new management team could find itself in a relatively strong position as a result of fundamental changes that the industry will now go through . <p> Perversely , majors might reassert their market dominance . President Obama has announced a six-month moratorium on costly , potentially dangerous deepwater drilling in the area while the clean-up continues . <p> This could cost up to 6,000 jobs in Louisiana and will hit the pockets of the oil majors . But the likes of BP and Shell can afford the hit . " BP can probably handle $20bn to $40bn , " says an industry expert . <p> " All those medium-sized players will look at the spill and have to admit that they would go into bankruptcy if they suffered a similar event . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't have market values in excess of $100bn -- might pull out of deepwater activities . Only the big boys of the industry would remain in these lucrative waters . <p> Also , the majors might take many key operations back in-house as contractors grow concerned over potential liabilities . For example , Transocean supplied the Horizon rig and hired the contractors on the project . <p> This would pass more of the risk on to industry giants , but also give them the bulk of the rewards . With so few companies in this part of the market , consolidation would become even more difficult as there would be more competition issues . <p> BP looks likely to retain its independence , though its reputation will take a long time to restore . However , rehabilitation can be achieved . Twenty-one years on from Exxon Valdez and Exxon is still one of the world 's biggest oil companies . <p> But this is likely to come at the price of the heads of the top executives and a total realignment of the oil industry . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 
@@1510232 <h> The Killer Inside Me ( 18 ) <p> Lou Ford , the anti-hero of The Killer Inside Me , is a nasty piece of work , and Michael Winterbottom 's film is a nasty piece of work too . <p> It should be : it 's based on a 1952 novel by American writer Jim Thompson , whose stories ( film versions include The Grifters and Clean Slate ) are famously the darkest and most relentless in the hard-boiled thriller genre . Merciless in their desolate psychological insights , they earned Thompson the sobriquet " dime-store Dostoevsky " . <p> Thompson 's The Killer Inside Me is a superbly crafted exercise in unreliable first-person narration : its teller and protagonist is a psychopathic killer who is also the much-liked deputy sheriff of a small Texan town . Played on screen by Casey Affleck , Lou Ford is everybody 's buddy , clean as a whistle and twice as cheery . But get him alone , and he 's a serpentine betrayer and a vicious thug : de Sade among the sagebrush . <p> We first see Lou 's dark side when he 's asked to politely lean on newly arrived prostitute Joyce ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rougher . The pair begin an S&amp;M-style liaison , but then things get complicated and the violence stops being quite so playful . <p> You would n't think that British director Michael Winterbottom had a natural affinity with Thompson 's transcendental grubbiness .

His adaptation is a polished , elegant affair , but with the essential Thompson sleaze never far from the surface . It looks terrific : the design by Rob Simons and Mark Tildesley beautifully evokes the dust and the shine of 1950s Texas , while Marcel Zyskind 's photography has the sun-bleached look of a paperback which has languished in Woolworths ' window too long . <p> The casting is nearly flawless . Character actors include Elias Koteas and Ned Beatty , incarnating seediness and sweat . As Lou 's trusting girlfriend , Amy , Kate Hudson is note-perfect ; halfway between blowsy and schoolyard wholesome , she has the perfect period manner of a good girl trying on vampdom for kicks . The hitherto bland Jessica Alba @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looks do n't quite fit : she 's too airbrushedly modern for that tackier , Fifties edge . <p> As for Casey Affleck , his distantly whiny voice and precise cleanness suggest a blank slate , but there 's also something fragile , oddly girlish about his Lou , an unsettling fussy edge recalling Anthony Perkins in Psycho . Lou may be too controlled and assured to be a Norman Bates but he 's close kin , for sure ( and his family background is quite as murky ) . <p> Affleck 's delicacy saves the part from overstatement . Winterbottom follows the novel 's leads about Ford 's well-concealed genius , his penchant for psychoanalysis and maths , but it 's an overstatement to show him brooding to Mahler . That makes Lou too obviously 1950s America 's paranoid nightmare of the European intellectual as pervert . <p> Now we come to the film 's shock element , and its big problem : Lou 's violence , and in particular , his vicious assault on Joyce . In the book , the scene occupies about half a page , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the stakes are naturally raised by the fact that we see the violence , which goes on and on -- and you do n't stop flinching . To make it worse , the camera hovers at length on Joyce 's battered , bloodied face . The effect is both horrifying and unnecessary : you feel you 're witnessing a morbid exercise in virtuoso special-effects make-up . <p> But the casting of Alba makes the effect very different from the violence you might see in a piece of low-budget realism : an extra perverse charge is derived from the simulated mutilation of a Hollywood sex symbol famous for her plastic prettiness . This is not only a scene about psychopathic violence , it also offers a sinister taboo thrill of seeing Jessica Alba 's perfect features mashed up : do n't think that this footage wo n't become a YouTube favourite with people who enjoy that sort of thing .

The period soundtrack of country swing fits the milieu -- and Lou 's phoney bright side -- but it often undermines the prevailing darkness . The horror of one murder , late in the film , is scuppered by setting the subsequent chase to a zingy steel-guitar rag : it 's not the right moment to show us a good time . <p> Lou Ford and Jim Thompson are masterful manipulators . Winterbottom is simply a very smart operator , and that 's not quite enough : his film lacks the ruthless control and irony that the story demands .

He sees himself as ' The Chosen One ' , and believes his destiny on earth is to win the World Cup as a player , and as a manager . But so far he has clearly not been successful as a manager . We qualified for these World Cup finals by the skin of our teeth , and with plenty of luck . <p> That is not reflected in the players we have available . Yes , Diego was the greatest player in the history of the game . I know , I played with him ; but that does not excuse the glaring omissions from Argentina 's squad . <p> Key players , leaders on the pitch like Javier Zanetti , Esteban Cambiasso and Juan Riquelme , to name just three of several , have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ World Cup without a specialist right-back , when our Achilles heel is clearly the defence . <p> I 'm disappointed with Maradona , because there is no rationale behind those decisions . There has been unrest behind the scenes . Maradona had a public falling out with Riquelme , after comments Maradona made about the player on television . Riquelme should have been conducting the orchestra on the pitch at this tournament . Instead , they no longer talk to each other . <p> It makes no sense at all to me that Zanetti is missing . He 's had a wonderful season as captain of Inter Milan , they completed the treble , with League and Cup in Italy , and took the Champions League . <p> Zanetti 's a versatile , vastly experienced player , who can play at right back . For the last two games , Maradona improvised with Jonas Gutierrez , who plays as left wing/left midfield in Newcastle . <p> That 's irresponsible of Maradona to be perfectly honest . Leaving out top players is giving far too many advantages to the opposition . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the team 's general manager , and the manager of Argentina at the ' 86 World Cup , have been at each other 's throats . Behind the scenes , they were trying to get rid of each other . It was so bad , the president of the Argentine FA had to step in to resolve the dispute . <p> Maradona has said he wants Bilardo nowhere near the dressing room , even though he is general manager in South Africa . <p> Maradona surrounds himself with ' Yes , Diego ' men , and that has been Maradona 's problem all his life . Then Maradona fights with everyone . <p> My view is that Maradona sees the World Cup as his salvation . Yet he was ' damaged ' after not being selected for Argentina in 1978 , the year we won the World Cup . He and I have spoken about this . He always compared himself to Pele , wanted to be the youngest player to win the World Cup , and it left him deeply hurt . He was 16 , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted to beat Pele in everything , and his dream was destroyed . <p> My view , by the way , is that he should have played in ' 78 . <p> Johan Cruyff , Franz Beckenbauer and Jurgen Klinsmann proved they could be both great players and great managers . But it does not always translate . As a player Maradona was a natural leader , did the unexpected for his team , but as a manager , I 'm not so sure . The team does not belong to Maradona , but he acts as if it does . <p> Forget technical , tactical or psychological methods with Maradona , none of these things are what move him . What he has is a certain voice inside him that says , boom , go for , this , boom , go for that ; only a sense of destiny and that is what drives him . <p> Look at Argentina 's qualifying -- one of the worst ever . The country was on tenterhooks . Brazil beat us at home -- very hard to accept ; Bolivia beat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The level of the international team has dropped tremendously . <p> The jury is out on Maradona at the moment . They nearly got rid of him , and remember he is thought of as a God in Argentina . Because we are third in the betting , Maradona is getting the benefit of the doubt at home . <p> We might see some kind of craziness from him in the pressure cauldron of the World Cup , which has defined Diego 's life . <p> After his non-selection in 1978 , his World Cups have been huge ups , huge downs . In 1982 , he finished the World Cup by being sent off against Brazil . In 1986 , he was everything -- he was the figure of the World Cup . <p> In 1990 , in Italy , he was injured and could n't play but it finished in triumph for him because they were runners-up with a pretty poor team . In 1994 , it ended for him in disgrace because of the drugs . <p> I do n't want to be completely pessimistic . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very good squad . And Maradona has the best player in the world in Lionel Messi . <p> The biggest question mark about Argentina is the manager himself and that will only be resolved in the coming six weeks . Argentina 's fortunes in this World Cup could mirror those of Maradona 's history in the tournament . Ecstasy and glory , or agony and ignominy .

@@1510238 @ The innovative Stradivari Trust has come up with a clever scheme that combines philanthropy and hard-headed commerce , recognising that culture is a business as well as a recreation , says Simon Heffer <p> I was asked the other day to take part in a debate about the case for state funding of the arts . I rather regretted that a diary clash prevented my doing so , because it is one of the few subjects upon which one can have an interesting debate : in other words , it is one of those rare issues upon which I have always found it hard to make up my mind . <p> I can entirely see the logic of the position that bus drivers and dinner ladies should not be expected to subsidise seats at the opera for people who can already afford to pay ? 180 a pop for them . However , I also fear for a country whose state turns away from serious culture altogether , thereby contributing to the further dilution of what used to pass for intelligence and sophistication here . <p> Rather too many " artists " make a living solely or largely because of state funding ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three years ' time , once public spending is forcibly brought under control . There are composers who write music that almost nobody wishes to listen to , but who get pay days from orchestras who are given Arts Council money precisely to encourage the creation of works that nobody in his or her right mind would willingly pay to listen to . <p> Admittedly , this was much worse 20 or 30 years ago than it is now : I think of concerts in the 1980s during which I had to sit through the nerve-grinding premiere of some particularly shocking piece of atonal music sandwiched between two rather good works that I genuinely did want to hear . These were works that in many cases , so far as I am aware , still await a second performance , and which will be recorded only when a record company is seeking a tax loss for accountancy purposes . You will know the genre : one of those works that defies the listener to understand why it begins and ends where it does , why it has a middle , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " three farts and a raspberry , orchestrated " . <p> A little bit of reality -- though arguably not enough -- has flitted in since then , especially with the economic downturn of the last couple of years . Concert audiences are shrinking -- some auditoria are now so embarrassingly empty that the performances almost seem like a very good rehearsal -- and likely cuts in the arts budget mean that certain indulgences will have to end . This has several consequences . First , if orchestras wish to survive , and virtuosi wish to make a decent living , they will have to rely , for a time , more on repertoire that people will pay to hear than on performing works that do a favour only to the composer . Second , and despite the absence of the serious tax incentives that American corporations enjoy when they sponsor opera at the Met , or orchestral concerts at Carnegie Hall , those in the arts world who wish to keep our cultural life going are simply going to have to find more privately funded ways of doing it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ struck by the purpose of a charity concert of popular works being given in Cambridge on June 14 by the Stradivari Trust to raise money for research into motor neurone disease . Founded in 2004 by Nigel Brown , the High Sheriff of Cambridgeshire , the trust supports music and literature both locally and nationally . Its most interesting activity , however , is that it seeks to ensure that the country 's most brilliant young string players are able to use an instrument that would normally be far beyond their reach to develop their potential and reputations . <p> The scheme works like this : the trust secures a fabulous instrument -- such as a Stradivarius violin or viola -- and invites subscribers to buy shares in it to fund the purchase . It then gives exclusive use of the instrument to a virtuoso who has it for concert performances and recordings . The concert in Cambridge next week is being given by 30 young musicians who have been helped by the Trust to compete in the international concert arena , thanks to being given access to a world-class @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrangement is that it is not so much a handout as a business deal . On the anniversary of the arrangement each year , the player is offered the chance to buy his or her own shares in the instrument . The work the Trust does in this respect was for nearly 20 years previously done by Mr Brown 's own Syndicated Instrument Trusts , and supplied instruments to some of the most famous names in British string playing : Nigel Kennedy , Steven Isserlis , Natalie Clein and Jennifer Pike . <p> The idea is that the more successful the player becomes -- the success helped by the quality of the instrument being played -- the more shares he or she will be able to afford to buy . Eventually , usually within 10 or 20 years , the instrument becomes his or her own . The shares each year are offered at a price based on the current value of the instrument , so will usually become more expensive . However , this is good for those who have put the money up in the first place . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the backers get a decent return on their investment . <p> The Stradivari Trust also acts as a conduit for charitable donations from philanthropists who want to give money to a virtuoso to help them purchase their instrument more quickly ; the donations are used to buy shares for them . This sort of combination of philanthropy and hard-headed commerce recognises that culture is a business as well as a recreation . In other parts of the arts world , where the tap of public funding still , for the moment , continues to drip , such perceptions are still rather rare . <p> The depths of an international financial crisis are hardly the best circumstances in which to try to shift so much of the funding of the arts from state handouts to business and private individuals ; but the very existence of that crisis is what may make it necessary . I have always believed that private philanthropy is a more reliable way of ensuring quality , too , than the state is ; it can not be a coincidence that the era of private patrons in music @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mixture of art and welfarism has created a generation of mediocrities who will wait centuries for acclaim and still be disappointed . <p> If the model used by the Stradivari Trust in one dimension of arts funding could be translated elsewhere , and this unfortunate form of welfare dependency reduced , then our cultural life would at least have a future .

" There certainly is n't anything I have n't done . " <p> Wojas , who died on Sunday from cancer at the age of 53 , was musing over the 21 years he had spent as a barman , and later proprietor , of the Colony Room Club , a debauched drinking establishment frequented by artists , dandies , thinkers , wits , pimps and whores which came to symbolise both the heart -- and the eventual demise -- of London 's Soho . <p> Until its closure in 2008 , when Wojas suddenly announced to the surprise of his patrons that he had sold the club 's lease , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's thirstiest , rowdiest and most outspoken wits . <p> Throughout the 1950s and 1960s it became Francis Bacon and Lucian Freud 's favourite drinking hole , a place where the two artistic titans could row , lunge , battle and then embrace in the comfort of an establishment that adored eccentricity and eschewed the mundane . <p> A literate fly on the club 's nicotine-stained walls could have published the sort of no-holds-barred memoir of London 's literary elite that would have had scandal-lovers and publishers alike foaming at the mouth in anticipation . <p> One only had to glance upon those frighteningly green walls to get an understanding of the type of clientele that came to call 41 Dean Street their home . Behind the bar stood an enormous mural painted by Michael Andrews depicting a typical night in the rooms . At the centre was the bar 's founder Muriel Belcher , surrounded by scions of Soho such as great wit Jeffrey Bernard , Henrietta Moraes -- a Bacon muse -- and flamboyant aristocrat Lady Rose McClaren . <p> A Birmingham-born Jew and proud lesbian , Belcher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was to hire Bacon , through the medium of a healthy tab , to invite his friends . He acted as a sort of Pied Piper of unusual drinking companions attracting , as Wojas later remarked , " a mixture of people from Lord and Lady Muck to the barrow boys from the market where Muriel bought her vegetables " . <p> Belcher opened her club in 1948 and was rarely seen without a cigarette and glass in hand . She was famed for referring to all her clients in the female form . At a time when pubs were forced to close in the afternoon , the Colony Room offered its parched guests a place to drink until the sun went down , and then some more . <p> Journalist and writer Geoffrey Wheatcroft spent many afternoons at the club in the Seventies .

" <p> At first glance , Polish-born Wojas might have seemed an unlikely character to take over such a gregarious venue . Quiet , slim and almost luminescently pale , he studied chemistry at Nottingham University arriving in London two years after Belcher 's death in 1979 . Ownership of the club had passed to Ian Board , an even louder -- and brasher -- version of Belcher who was renowned for getting drunk , hiding the night 's takings and then forgetting where he had put them the following day . Wojas would spend the first few hours of the morning looking for buried treasure . " I thought I 'd work for a couple of months before I figured out exactly what I want to do -- that was 24 years ago , " he once recalled in 2005 . " I did n't realise at first that I 'd found my home .

" There were so many extraordinary funny occasions and nights there , but they all blend into one big night at the Colony Room . " <p> Sebastian Horsley , one of London 's most delightfully dysfunctional and outspoken wits , was known to spend weeks at a time propping up the bar at the Colony Room . " I first visited it when I was 20 because I 'd read that that was where Francis Bacon used to hang out , " he said . " I ran up the narrow stairs and was promptly told to ' fuck off ' by Ian Board .

" It was minute on the outside but huge on the inside and you went there for love , which they served by the glassful . " <p> But love was in short supply during the gruesome decline of the Colony Room , which , in many ways , came to symbolise the purification of Soho , once London 's seedy , beating heart . By the mid-2000s the club and Wojas were in deep financial trouble . Artists of all different hues pitched in to save their favourite drinking den by donating their work . But the mood soon turned sour with accusations that the club 's proprietor had begun treating the paintings as gifts , sold off for his own personal gain , rather than for the greater good of the favourite venue . <p> Wojas sold the lease for the Colony back to the building 's landlord and took a backstage role in the Soho scene . The camaraderie that once bound the club together was shattered as Wojas 's detractors and defenders went to war , even in the courts . Horsley , who was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ publicly with him over a campaign to save the club , said the Colony 's closure represented the wider demise of Soho tradition . <p> " Soho has gone down hill immeasurably , " he said . " Ten years ago , on a good night here , you could get your throat cut . The air used to be clean and the sex used to be dirty . Now it is the other way round . Now it 's full of boutiques , ' weave-your-own-yoghurt ' establishments , wall-to-wall coffee shops and gay hairdressers . There is even a health club . A health club in Soho , for Satan 's sake ! Can you imagine ? That 's like having a brothel in a church . " <p> But others say Wojas did the best he could to sail against prevailing winds and remember the club before rancour took over .

" When no one else would listen , he embraced the young British and brought live music to the Club .

In addition , the assets will not be treated as part of their estate on their death for inheritance tax .

Allegations of bullying and intimidation are swirling around the corridors and 20 disaffected consultants met last week at the British Medical Association ( BMA ) .

The trust was severely criticised in 2009 over Baby Peter , who died in 2007 under the care of Haringey social services after suffering prolonged abuse .

But she said she had " not been forwarded the letter referred to in the media " . She added that Dr Collins and her management team " have the complete support of the Board " .

@@1523235 <h> Nasa 's 2013 solar flare warning : how much do we need to worry ? <p> So , do we really need to worry about a huge solar storm burning out the electrical systems of half the world in 2013 ? Masochists that we are here at the Telegraph , we love to shoot down our own stories , and I was cracking my knuckles for this one . It 's got all the ingredients -- white-coated authority , grave warnings of impending doom , exciting sciencey nuclear nemesis in space . NASA ! Solar flares ! Planes falling out of the sky ! Etc . <p> But I read the piece , and spoke to the reporter , and -- while always remembering that I am no more an astrophysicist than I am a black belt in tae kwon do -- it sounded pretty solid . Dr Richard Fisher , the director of Nasa 's Heliophysics division , is very clear in the quotes , and our reporter , Andrew Hough , was very careful to check his facts with Dr Fisher before publishing . It sounds like a lot of serious people think that this is a real danger . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reach a stage of its cycle when these large events are more likely . This might strike you as a bit strange , as you 've probably heard ( as have I ) that the sun has been especially active for the last half-century or so and is expected to die down in the next couple of years -- I spoke to Marcus Chown , the physicist and author of We Need to Talk about Kelvin , who said " Solar activity has been abnormally high for the past 50 years , but the extremely feeble start to the latest 11-year cycle suggests this activity is coming to an end and things are going to be quiet on the Sun for quite a few years . " Dr Ruth Bamford , a plasma physicist at the Rutherford-Appleton Laboratory , agrees : " The sun has been particularly quiet for the last few years in a protracted solar minimum . It has just woken up , as it were , and started its usual 11-year cycle a bit later than most . " <p> So what 's going on ? Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ huge solar storm burned out telegraph wires across Europe and the United States . Dr Stuart Clark has written a book , The Sun Kings , about when that happened . He says that the " Carrington flare " , as it was known , " smothered two-thirds of the Earth 's skies in a blood-red aurora a night later , and crippled all of global navigation and global communication , such as it was at that time . Compasses span uselessly and the telegraph network went down as phantom electricity surged through the wire . " <p> The sun had indeed been running at a record high for the latter half of the 20th century , and has now died down to its lowest level for a century . But Dr Clark warns that " average levels of solar activity has fallen does not mean that the Sun is immune from large flares or even giant ones . Low average levels of activity may even promote the giant flares . <p> " Perhaps like earthquakes , when there are constant flares/tremors the energy is dissipated evenly over long periods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ energy can build up and then suddenly be released in a giant event . This remains speculation , however . " <p> 2013 is when the next peak in the sun 's cycle of activity is expected , and while we can not predict individual flares , Dr Clark says that the largest flares are often shortly after the peak . <p> Of course , if a proper " Carrington event " happens again , it has the potential to be far more problematic now than in 1859 when electric communication was barely in its infancy . Dr Clark says " There is absolutely no reason to believe that we are heading for solar armageddon in 2013 , but sooner or later we should expect there to be another Carrington event and that is what these scientists at NASA are trying to prevent . Legislation in the US has just passed Congress to help harden the grid against solar flares . " <p> So -- it 's a real thing , and we should be concerned . But preventive measures can be taken -- satellites can be sent offline during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shielded against electromagnetic radiation and so on . As Dr Bamford says : " The extreme events like the 1859 Carrington Event are 1-in-100-year probabilities , about the same probability as a storm of the level of Katrina hitting New Orleans -- and New Orleans did not build their defences to withstand the extreme-but-unlikely magnitude . 100 years is n't that long . <p> " But the end of the world it is not . Maybe as disruptive as an ash cloud , but not as protracted I 'm sure . " She gives examples of precautions , like a GPS backup system called eLoran , or active mini-magnetosphere shielding for astronauts and satellites that her team have designed . <p> Of course , if those precautions are taken , and actually work , and no damage is done , then everyone will cry that it was all a big fuss over nothing , like they always do . So the scientists ca n't win , really . But that 's just how it is . <p> Edit : Dr Ruth Bamford got in touch , with a few extended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Have changed accordingly .

At 6ft 1in I am not a small man and at 30 years old a lifetime of dance training means I am light on my feet . <p> Having been raised in the suburbs of the capital , nobody would describe me as a country type . I am more likely to be seen foxtrotting with Nancy Dell'Olio or attending the Olivier Awards with Kim Cattrall than joining the Barbour-and-wellies brigade . <p> Nevertheless , I grew up surrounded by animals .

I can remember that night as clearly as if it was yesterday . <p> Arriving home after a jolly supper , I pulled up outside my house with a boot full of shopping . Stepping over the threshold laden with bags , I switched the light on and left the front door open while I made two more trips to and from the car . <p> The entire process took under five minutes , yet as I closed the door I had a feeling of unease . I started to climb the stairs , feeling even more unsettled , almost as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ferocity , a screaming ball of fur and teeth came flying towards my face .

All I could see were a pair of yellow eyes , fixed on mine , and a row of teeth . <p> Savaged : Nicholas Koupparis outside his Hackney home with baby Lola , who was hospitalised by a fox attack <p> Suddenly the fox - a rather mangy-looking male - shot down the stairs and into the sitting room . I hauled myself up and sat on the stairs , shaking uncontrollably . Meanwhile , the fox was creating a cacophony of crashes , bangs and unearthly screeches . <p> It was so late at night that I did n't know what to do , so I went to fetch a broom and slowly crept into the sitting room . The first thing which hit me was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shelves , had been swept clear by the rampaging fox - and there he was , squatting on my sofa and soiling it .

So I continued my chase around the house . <p> It was only after two hours of cajoling that he finally left . All of a sudden he simply turned around and padded calmly out into the night . <p> Exhausted , I set about cleaning the house , but barely managed to make a dent in the carnage . Eventually , I fell into bed , still unable to escape the vile stench left by its droppings around the house , and lay there sleepless until dawn broke . <p> Mauled : Isabella and Lola Kouparris , who were attacked in their beds by a fox at their home in Hackney <p> By the morning , the foul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had to have the house industrially cleaned . <p> But , silly though it may sound , nothing could shift the conviction that I was no longer safe in my own home . <p> Never again did I leave even the smallest window open , even on the hottest of nights . The fox seemed to have no such lasting fears from our encounter . <p> Over the following weeks , I saw him dozens of times - sunbathing on a shed roof here , trotting down the pavement there . <p> He has a tuft of hair on his head and a distinctive strut - there was no mistaking the identity of my night intruder . <p> As I drove home one night , he crossed the road in front of me and stopped , staring directly at my car .

His family in Kent is being protected by police after receiving threatening mail and phone calls . <p> A series of gaffes by the 53-year-old geologist has made yet harder the difficult job of convincing the US that BP is doing its utmost to stem the Gulf leak and compensate the southern coastal states . The New York Daily News called him " the most hated and most clueless man in America " and no one disagreed .

Now it seems that his powers of inspiration have extended into the world of football . <p> National hero : an inspirational pep talk from tennis champion Roger Federer could have helped Switzerland to their shock win against World Cup favourites SpainPhoto : AP <p> Speaking at Wimbledon on Friday , the defending champion described how he had delivered pep talk to the Swiss team who shocked Spain 's World Cup favourites in Durban . <p> Federer made his intervention in September 2008 , after Switzerland 's footballers had suffered a humiliating 2-1 defeat to Luxembourg -- their lowest point in more than 80 years of internationals . It must have worked , because since then they have gone unbeaten in eight games . <p> " The coach Germany 's Ottmar Hitzfeld invited me to come to see the players because we had lost to Luxembourg , " Federer said . " I hope it helped -- we made the World Cup @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd told Hitzfeld if you ever need me I 'd love to come by and say hi to the guys .

" <p> As the most successful player in the history of tennis , you might not imagine that Federer would have much in common with Hitzfeld 's men -- a team who were forced to soak up wave after wave of Spanish attacks before scoring an unlikely goal on the break . <p> But even Federer has had matches when he is forced on to the defensive , notably when he is playing his Spanish rival Rafael Nadal .

Federer lost to Lleyton Hewitt in the final at Halle -- only his second defeat in 78 grass-court matches over the past eight years -- while Nadal was one of many high-ranking players to stumble in the AEGON Championships at Queen 's . <p> " Queen 's was a big surprise , " Federer said on Friday .

But it could turn out to be normal and we can all be in the semi-finals .

Seen in children , after the first sunny spells of the year , usually from March onwards . The rash occurs between eight and 24 hours after exposure . <p> Why it happens : A chemical in the skin or blood that absorbs UV radiation and then reacts , resulting in the rash . It occurs in about ten per cent of children and affects mainly boys -- they usually have shorter hair than girls so their ears are more exposed to the light . <p> What to do about it : Treatment includes steroid creams , which work by reducing inflammation , and moisturisers .

Sometimes , raised blisters and even acne-like spots . The outbreaks occur in covered areas -- usually the chest and back , but it can also flare up under the arms and around the groin , the hands and feet . <p> Why it happens : Also known as heat rash or miliaria , it is the result of inflammation of the sweat glands that occurs when sufferers sweat more than usual .

Steroid tablets and injections can also be given but side effects include weight gain , bone thinning and immune suppression , so these are not long-term options . The best way to avoid it is by using a UVA filter sunscreen and staying out of the sun .

The juice itself is harmless but UV light causes a chemical reaction . <p> What to do about it : Over-the-counter hydrocortisone cream or calamine lotion will soothe itching .

Last year my son Jimmy Joe was lucky enough to come to Kenya with me on safari . He loved it , of course , but there was something about the disconnected distance of watching animals from a truck that meant that he had n't really , really loved it . <p> A few months later , we went to Cornwall . It was a wet , green , early summer 's afternoon , and the children and I joined a nature walk with reptile specialist Gary Zammit . We were exploring a very ordinary field , with the pounding presence of the sea in the distance and a strip of sand bordered by jet-black rocks . Gary had left some strategically placed pieces of corrugated iron in the long grass , which he invited Jimmy Joe to lift , to see what he could find underneath . <p> " Snails ! Look !

The visitor centre at Land 's End is n't really worth a visit , but there is something enduringly exciting about the austere landscape of this farthest toe of mainland England , where odd , imposing granite farmhouses rise from the windy fields , and a sense of eternity blankets the land .

As he leaps from one tortured metaphor to another , his pomposity and grandiloquence know no bounds . His rhetoric , as one commentator observed , turns politics into a " national melodrama " . <p> " Our country advances only in crises and in tragedy , " writes Mr de Villepin .

His other heroes after de Gaulle are Alexander the Great , Julius Caesar and Napoleon . <p> Mr de Villepin often refers to himself and France as if one and the same thing , a regal belief that has sustained him during moments of " depression and despair " he is said to have suffered since Mr Sarkozy won power . <p> The president is a complex man with obvious insecurities that manifest themselves in facial tics , stacked heels and demands for short bodyguards .

@@1527239 <h> There is a positive , and socially important , drinking culture in our countryside that is focused upon the rural pub , writes Simon Heffer . <p> I am always distressed to read reports of people killed by drunk drivers , and feel the law can not be brutal enough with such fools . But I wonder how many each year are killed or even injured by someone who has only drunk one-and-a-half or two pints of weak beer , the amount that ( depending on one 's size and other factors ) constitutes being within the legal limit ? I would imagine very few , if any . Yet there is a proposal before the Government to reduce the legal limit for driving to under a pint of beer , or its equivalent . <p> Since many of the cases one reads about concerning drunk drivers are about criminals who have got behind the wheel when two , three or four times over the limit , I fear we may be losing a sense of perspective . I fear even more , however , the final undermining of one of the most praiseworthy and significant parts of our rural culture : the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was banned in public places , and when the illiberal decision was taken not to allow smokers-only bars with staff ( possibly themselves smokers ) who would be paid a premium to volunteer to work in them . I have mentioned before in this column how I drive around my part of England and keep seeing places where last summer , or the summer before , we would go out for a drink on a sunny evening , now turned into private houses . <p> I know that drink is cheap in supermarkets and that that , too , deters some people from going out to a pub . But ask any landlord what has been the greatest setback to his trade in the past couple of years , and he will tell you it is the smoking ban . At this time of year , people will of choice stand outside a pub , or sit in its garden , and smoke . For six or seven months of the year , that becomes uncomfortable or downright impossible ; and having friends round to smoke at will indoors , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this , making it impossible for someone to drive to a pub and have a drink once there would put thousands more of our great British boozers in the hands of the builders . <p> Some of you may ask : why should this matter ? To me , the answer is simple . I have lived in the country all my life and I know what a pub means to a village or a hamlet . When I was a student , I used to work in a country pub , which I still think -- thanks to the charismatic personality of the landlord -- was perhaps the best I have ever set foot in . It was truly the centre of the village 's life ; it had the atmosphere of a rather good club , though one without a waiting list or any sense of social exclusivity . <h> Related Articles <p> It was important , too , for the way in which it socialised people . It is all very well to speculate , as I just have , that the activity of pub life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fear that it has not always done so . People sit alone drinking and smoking ; they meet fewer people ; they talk less ; they engage less ; they start to undergo that isolation that surveys tell us has become such a feature of 21st-century life . I knew what Mrs Thatcher meant when she said that there was no such thing as society , and I know how misrepresented she has been on that question ever since . But if we do away with pubs , a very important cohesive force in a society where individuals ( as opposed to the state ) have a care for each other will simply die . <p> Great historical and philosophical works have been written on the effect of the secularisation of the Western mind in the last two centuries . In our own culture , it seems that what was itself displaced to the pub was a life that , until the 19th century , centred upon the village church . I am well aware that in the life of many villages , the church remains important , albeit with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others share an incumbent with up to 10 other parishes , and have ceased to be the focus of village life . <p> I know some communities where , despite being populated by prosperous and busy people , the church hardly functions and the pub has closed . These places are merely rather pretty dormitories . They could be anywhere . There is little or nothing to distinguish them from other such villages anywhere else . There is no focal point for them that means anything to more than a small and dedicated handful of people . These villages are not the norm , even now : but if the pub goes out of business , who is to say that in 10 or 20 years ' time , life in our villages will be anything like it is now ? <p> For it is village life that seems , still , to retain the atavistic soul of this country . In cities , many people live next door to others for years without ever meeting them or being introduced . The whole point of villages is that they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of community , that one did not expect to find in urban Britain but that was one of the jewels of our rural life . <p> I never expected the last government , which understood life in the countryside just about as well as I understand brain surgery , to do anything to help such communities . We should expect this one , both of whose constituent parties have wide rural representation , to stop this insane and unnecessary proposal on alcohol limits to be brought into law . <p> I know drinking gets a bad press in other contexts these days . Anyone who ventures into our town centres on a weekend evening will see that it is justified . The establishments that service the binge-drinkers are not , in my definition , pubs : they are impersonal drinking factories where no conversation is possible , and where you will certainly not see men in cloth caps playing cribbage or dominoes . I wish the government would persecute these people instead of the harmless , moderate social drinkers . Let them sate their desires by imposing routine four-figure fines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remove the licence from , and fine , any establishment that serves them when drunk . The problem would soon stop . <p> Just as tyrants like Hitler created the impression that all nationalism was racist and evil , so binge drinkers and alcohol abusers offer apparently convincing evidence that all drinking is harmful and must be curtailed . Yet there is a positive , and socially important , drinking culture in our countryside that is focused upon the rural pub . I do hope that no government will be stupid enough to damage that , and rip the heart out of our villages .

The workload is reduced . <p> WORK LIKE AN ITALIAN <p> In the shadow of a frugal Budget and in trying economic times , most employers , in the capital at least , are n't making special arrangements to let staff watch the crucial match lest they risk a drop in productivity , a survey suggests . <p> Workers showing a drop in productivity risk irking the boss <p> Of the 140 firms interviewed by the London Chambers of Commerce , two thirds were n't planning to change their routine to indulge fans . <p> But this emphasis on keeping noses to grindstones is misplaced , argues Dr Batey . <p> The latest productivity figures , from the Office for National Statistics in 2008 , show UK @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and even French and Italian counterparts in terms of gross domestic product per worker . <p> How so when the British work comparatively long hours ? The British fill up so much of our time with work , says Dr Batey , that its quality and speed is compromised . <p> The answer ? Cut that culture of presentee-ism by working shorter hours , he says . <p> Stopping at 1500 BST may not be seen as such a sin if it actually boosts productivity in the long run . <p> DO N'T WASTE A SECOND <p> The witching hour <p> Absencecare , a company which helps firms manage staff , predicts the number of absentees on Wednesday could be at 8.3% of the nation 's workforce , a rise of about 56% on the average day . <p> But taking the day off is an overreaction to the problem , according to workplace psychologists , when just a few changes can increase productivity and bring deadlines forward . <p> Turn off , they argue , those nonessential communication streams that impinge on concentration at work . So , finesse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those opposable texting thumbs , and pull the plug on any TV or radio in the background .

" It feels like stepping naked out into the world , but it works . " <p> The design of the working environment can also have an impact . Open plan offices mean the free flow of information , but also conversation . Shutting oneself away in a quiet space is likely to increase productivity for introverts , say psychologists , but it wo n't save the extroverts . <p> STAY IN THE LOOP <p> There are other ways to stay in touch with events in South Africa without needing a television , says Mark Howard of the Imperial College Business School . <p> " Unless you are an absolute dyed-in-the-wool England fan who wants to watch every kick of the match , a lot of people will be content to get updates and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were watching ball-by-ball analysis on the BBC or newspaper websites .

Become your own boss : " Then you 'll be really busy but can ignore all the rules yourself .

Selfless runs were made by all the midfield players who , while knowing that a majority would not result in them receiving the ball , also knew they attracted defenders . <p> The above two facts meant that easier passes were available , more space was created and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wide player that could deliver the ball properly . The clich ? that all defenders fear pace means little on its own .

In the previous two games you would have been pushed to see anyone run an extra inch for the cause . <p> A sober look at what England have done thus far has to record that they failed to top a relatively easy group and scored just twice . Nothing Capello 's men have shown will cause angst for their forthcoming opponents . <p> It is difficult to predict confidently that England will build on a much improved performance , but the fact that they have recorded a win should not be underestimated . <p> They came into the Slovenia game with a welter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their ears and had heaped greater pressure on themselves than necessary . Victory means they will not have to contend with the psychological handicap of humiliation lurking at the back of their minds .

The truth is that while talented , most of England 's players are not truly world class and it was foolish to contend they were in the first place . <p> However , given that many England fans and much of its media seem not to concur , there may still be a lot of recrimination to come .

The enormous chandeliers are eye-popping and the abstract mural interesting , but not necessarily to my taste . <p> However , it was n't enough to distract and the tables with their pristine white linen , looked classy and smart . <p> While , there seemed to be waiters everywhere , they were attentive not intrusive . We had the seven course tasting menu with accompanying wines , so there 's always going to be a lot of contact with the waiters and it definitely added to the experience . <p> By the way , a five-course tasting menu with wine is ? 89 , and the seven course ? 119 .

Blasone has a very sweet tooth and the rather delicate and intricate creations were incredible to look at and pretty tasty to eat too , especially with the glass of 2006 Recioto della Valpolicella , a sublime red , dessert wine , which was n't too sweet at all and was a perfect partner for the rich puddings . <p> Finishing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ petit fours that could n't be done justice , my dinner guest and I reflected on the meal .

Not a single GM seed or artificial fertiliser was used . The system was self sustaining based on good old-fashioned care , and in this case creation of , a fertile soil . Local food varieties have developed over millenia to cope with local conditions and with a bit of support the knowledge of local people can be used to improve the environment for themselves and the biodiversity .

There is no end to this madness Dr Sam Slattery , Providenciales Turks and Caicos Islands <p> The'developing world ' has to a greater extent been using sustainable ( domestic ) agricultural methods for centuries . When foreign capital by way of outside companies look to ' develop ' and ramp up production in these nations the problems of irrigation , disease , energy ( fuel ) can occur plus labour may be ' forced ' used . Unfortunately many of these countries are so poor the governments by way of the World Bank and United Nations have no choice but to service debt.e.g Haiti 's banana production ' replaced ' by western companies.As long as internal governments are not corrupted and support their populations , all the best to them.Rupert Rols , Elgin <p> There are conflicts of interest in Africa and of course just about everywhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's particularly acute where deserts are expanding , seas are losing their productivity and forests are vanishing . Simply saying ' old fashioned revolution ' about land use management does n't address grazing rights of one through the family garden of another . It does n't stop a government official out for himself or for what benefits his tribe . Zimbabwe was a good example of why land use management must follow a logical road to change rather than fall to the ravages of mismanagement and lawlessness . Somalia and their reliance on the sea not to mention the spread of weapons stands in stark contrast to places where forests are easier to plant and gardens to grow . Some places are too dangerous to work and some too hot to grow . Religion too often seems at odds to getting plants to grow and good health for many . Perhaps the garden that needs to grow is in the minds of men and women of the world to work together and stop tearing up the planet on which they live .

It 's crazy not to help each other and to quickly swing the world from a corporate path to one that recognizes the need to keep the Earth alive.Dale Lanan , Longmont , Colorado USA <p> At the point where we are on Earth , I do not see an alternatively more ecological method than that presented here . The solution to a greener world lies in Nature itself ! Armoogun , Mauritius <p> It 's absolutely true that " good old fashioned farming " , in Whelan 's meaning , is better for these regions . But the next problem is that people using these practices are powerless . Illegal logging is a good example . Local people almost universally oppose it ; but in the face of corruption and machine guns , they can do nothing . The current theft of African " farm land " by external countries is another example . Corrupt officials are leasing huge tracts of their country 's best farm land to other countries , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ productivity of the land ( for public relations purposes ) ; but in reality , they are there to make a profit ; with two inevitable outcomes . As much land as possible will be plowed , wiping out any trace of biological diversity ; and the local people will be " relocated " - where they will die . We know this . Any solution including encouragement of traditional agriculture really MUST include some pathway for the local people to acquire , and keep , the power to protect themselves and their lands . Or it will be wasted effort.Philip Rutter , Canton , MN , USA <p> The vital thing for Africa is to bring education for local people , they have to be prepared to create own future and not only be dependent on aid from developed countries . I am affraid the continent was not designed to feed so many mouths and the Africans must understand that their mission is not to give a birth to as much childern as possible but to save the environment including many endangared species and always go for sustainable development @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If the Rainforest Alliance is sincere about farming it will promote methods of feeding people by bringing back into productive use the 15% of tropical forest land globally now depopulated of needy people under a wilderness ' concept imposed and funded from developed countries . One way of doing this is through forest gardening : another the age-old and widespread and very sophisticated shifting cultivation . Both technologies are prevented in reserves , some of which are vast . Dave Wood , Fyvie , Aberdeenshire <p> Yes , I grew up on a family dairy farm and I truly believe the only way to sustain healthy ecosystems is to be a functioning part of the ecosystem . Hi tech farming is not and overuse of fertilizer have led to damaged ecosystems in India , must we make the same mistake with Africa ? If the warring factions would work together there would be plenty for all of Africa . This is just another excuse for greedy corporations to make money at the Earths expense . The Earth was not meant to be used so . Mary Jo Kasprzak , Iron @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Whelan . Besides , sustainable agriculture presents an opportunity to rethink the importance of family farms and rural communities . Economic development policies are needed that encourage more diversified agricultural production on family farms as a foundation for healthy economies in rural communities . In combination with other strategies , sustainable agriculture practices and policies can help foster community institutions that meet employment , educational , health , cultural and spiritual needs . Now I would like to say that organic and the ancient plant medicine and the modern management concepts can work magic . At the same time , new policies and institutions must be created to enable producers using sustainable practices to market their goods to a wider publicEngr Salam , LGED , Bangladesh <p> People may not think technology will bring about some sort of panacea but there are plenty of people who are coming to the realization that technology will be necessary to keep the Earth alive .

The West and growing economies dependent on natural resources would do well to put huge efforts into respecting and supporting the efforts of small scale farmers who use good management practices to restore the soils and vibrant watersheds of their lands.Dale Lanan , Longmont , Colorado USA <p> There is a lot to be said for ' good ' old fashioned farming . The problem is that there is an awful lot of ' bad ' old fashioned farming out there . Even before the evil capitalist Western agri-chemical empires moved in , local farmers were more than capable of completely trashing their environment . The solution is a mix of good practice , incentives , and keeping the thieving hands of the local government out of anything you try to do . Throughout the developing world , the urban elites see the farmers as ignorant peasants to be ripped off . Any capital intensive equipment will be stolen and sold . MFM , Minas Tirith <p> Cleverly put together ! Who could dare to disagree ? Yet the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the obvious . In summary : " A green revolution created and developed at the expense of ... will ... be a disaster ... " ; and " ... using ' good old fashioned ' farming techniques ... leads to an improvement ( and ) delivers ... Benefits " . Technology brings about new solutions that are , as such , neutral ; it is their use which is ( like that of ' old-fashioned farming techniques ' ) proper or improper . The ' green revolution ' is designed to contribute to sustainable crop production and resource management with new material , tools , and methods . The good point with the Rainforest Alliance is that it does not share and , worse , promote and spread the hysteria of some other entities about fertilisers , pesticides , etc . Its experience may well show that the practices it recommends " deliver clear economic , environmental and social benefits " , the point is that the right combination of ' old ' and ' new ' delivers MORE benefits . Africa needs both.Andr ? , Thonon , France <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " soil , water , biodiversity and human resources " and farmers " able to compete in the global market " , is that the wealth produced by healthy people and environment stays with the people . Global wealth extraction - that is , transnational corporations siphoning value from all corners of the Earth into the pockets of a few individuals - is the single greatest cause of poverty . The values Ms Whelan takes as good , such as those above and others like preserving great apes , are not the values of these corporations , and they are powerful . How can people do this work ? How can farmers win out over Monsanto ? By joining together and giving each other voice . Thank you , Rainforest Alliance.Leslie Breakstone , Middlesex Vt USA <p> I have been driving the zero till farming initive in Tanzania with great success of improved crop performance . this is without increased fertilizer or new seed ...

Crops grown for millenia in a particular area are successful for a reason . Finding ways to grow traditional foods better with the aid of new technology is the proper use for said technology , offering new " superfoods " , with dramatically different requirements ( like chemical fertilizers ) to an alien landscape is not . Most of my experience in sustainable agriculture comes from living in the US . Granted , New York probably does n't hold any lessons in particular for an area like Darfur , and maybe even the Arizona and New Mexico deserts are n't equal in conditions to Chad or Ethiopia , but the lesson learned is that you can take the concepts and apply them to any area if the local variables are taken into consideration . The question of how to promote this philosophy , and fund it , can be answered by re-directing NGOs focus to sustainable farming , individuals earmarking donations specifically towards that objective , and the highly promising theory of providing microloans.Tom Cunningham , West Haverstraw , NY , USA <p> the trouble with this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk , is that increasing productivity encourages ever more tedious population growth . when will everyone face up to it . we need population reduction urgently as a central guiding policy of every government , so we do nt have to constantly increase productivity in a world thats actually overshot human carrying capacity by about 7 times already . oil has allowed us to have short term ' phantom ' carrying capacity which will soon evaporate . we will then know how very far we have overshot . we need to break the ' productivity increase - population increase - productivity increase - population increase ' vicious circle immediately , before hard ecological limits are reached ( that go beyond ' mere ' mass extinction and mass poverty of a billion humans ) . andyuk , coventry <p> Tensie , we should not surrender ourselves to the things you mentioned in the beginning of your article ' with pressing development needs ' and ' with growing population ' . There is lot of scope of improvement on these two subjects . Development must be restructured and we must ensure a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Back to Basics ' part .

Technological solutions are trying to accommodate more and more human populations and their aggressive activities on the planet.Sanjay Singh Thakur , Indore , India <p> Tensie Whelan has a point ; " good old-fashioned ' farming techniques can help .

@@1539239 <p> Go to your room , Naughty Bear : The game is ultimately let down by repetitive gameplay and patchy graphics <p> For the first hour or two of Naughty Bear , I thought I was having fun . Lured in by a honeytrap of cartoon violence and one-more-go score chasing , it felt like I was enjoying myself . Perhaps that 's a little unfair . I was enjoying myself , even if at the back of my mind I was questioning why . People talk about Bungie 's claim that Halo 's game play is based around ' 30 seconds of fun ' , short bursts of enjoyment coming fast and furious . Three episodes into Naughty Bear , I realised the same principle applied here . The difference , however , was that the game featured the same 30 seconds of ' fun ' repeated ad nauseam . <p> The premise of the game is that its hero , the titular Naughty Bear , is naughty . Not in a cheeky Russell Brand way either , but in the same way you 'd class Ted Bundy as naughty ; in short , a homicidal maniac . Due to his violent disposition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . Not that they 're any less violent than Naughty , they 're just violent and judgmental , so poor Naughty -- with his mottled fur and chewed off ears -- does n't stand a chance . It 's the typical tale of a bullied outsider , ostracised by his peers and encouraged by a voice in his head -- in this case a fake-British narrator -- to kill , kill and kill some more . Artificial Mind and Movement could have done something more with this scenario , made some kind of point perhaps , but they do n't . And that 's fine , the game sounds a lot darker and more dramatic on paper than it comes across in practise . And contrary to what the numerous pre-release trailers might have suggested , Naughty Bear does n't really have a narrative . Sure , it has cutscenes that set up each episode , but they never extend beyond ' Trembles has become an oil baron and wants to kill Naughty , punish him for this ' or ' Sunbeam accidentally called down a horde of aliens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scenarios form the basis of the game 's 7 levels . Each level is set on the Island of Perfection , which is made up of three small sections -- four if you count Naughty 's hut which , given that it 's literally just a hut in a tiny clearing , barely qualifies . Every episode uses two of these sections ( and Naughty 's hut ) , each of which is locked off until a certain number of points have been accrued , and passing from one area to another leaves the previous area inaccessible . If something like Red Dead Redemption is a sandbox , Naughty Bear is one of those tiny flowerpots you get miniature cacti in . This kind of works at first ; the small areas are more conductive to the tight , combo-based nature of the gameplay -- every ' naughty ' act gives you points and raises your combo , and chaining your behaviour into one long spree of mayhem is the key to the elusive in-game Platinum trophy . This would n't really work in a huge sprawling area , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see your behaviour , for one thing . For another , you frequently need to sprint across the area to prevent a bear from calling for help/escaping in a car/fixing a mixer . At first , this works , and it 's a glorious whirlwind of mayhem and naughtiness as you barrel about the island , smashing things up and driving bears insane . <p> A few episodes in , though , things start to fall apart . Every mission is basically the same , with only new enemy variants to break up the monotony , most of whom appear to be the regular bears with little to no AI programming . Zombies , robots and the like are surprisingly less exciting than they should be , especially when they 're the only things between you and the exact same level you 've played numerous times before . By the final episode , which introduces aliens and an obnoxious green mist covering the forest , it feels like nuking the site from orbit is the only viable way forward . To make the tedium worse , each episode contains four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set of certain conditions . Killer and Insanity are fine , they require you to kill all bears and drive all bears insane respectively , something you 'll naturally do anyway if you 're attempting a high score . Invisible challenges are also surprisingly good , demanding you cause chaos without being seen , and the required points threshold actually makes these quite an enjoyable set of challenges . Top Hat Challenges are just the main levels made harder and Friendly , in which you ca n't hit your rival bears , is simply dull . Speed Run is a pointless , overly harsh time attack mode where scoring high is just a case of getting lucky and Untouchable , a challenge in which you ca n't take a single hit , is one of the most abysmal , tiresome gameplay variants I 've ever encountered . <h> Related Articles <p> If the game was technically competent , they 'd be more tolerable , but Naughty Bear suffers from some horribly glitchy animations , a camera that flips and spins , breaking almost entirely if you go inside a building @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times the controller input for the gun just failed to work , refusing to fire even if I had full ammo or changed to another gun . That 's not even touching on the frequent bugs I encountered , always near the end of a mission , where Naughty Bear and his peers would freeze in their tracks . The game itself continued around them , but nothing would make them move . Even managing to avoid all these glitches , there 's still a chance the mission will hang on its final loading screen , perhaps Naughty Bear 's ultimate act of naughtiness in which you 're never quite sure if it 's going to count your score . The fact that the challenges require certain numbers of trophies to unlock means that replaying levels over and over is the order of the day , whether due to missing the target , failing or simply because the game decides to break . <p> The actual act of completing the main missions is enjoyable at first , but after sabotaging the same barbecue 35 times , even the most diehard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ screaming at bears , punching statues and shooting birds all add to your score . Punishing bears until they 're hurt enough for you to perform an Ultra-Kill , a weapon-specific finishing move , is fun at first until you 've seen everything the shonky animations have to offer ( or not , if the camera decides to misbehave as it 's wont to do ) . Make a bear miserable enough and he goes insane , at which point you can scare him into suicide with whatever weapon he 's holding . Rather than being a sinister , controversial mechanic it 's all a bit flaccid , a means to an end which after a few occurrences you wo n't even stick around to watch . And the bears seemingly resurrect between levels anyway . It 's all far too limp to be shocking , and although perhaps the PEGI 12 does n't quite resonate with the ' knives and guns are fun toys ! ' narration , it 's all a bit too underwhelming to take seriously . <p> Naughty Bear also has multiplayer . The modes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Capture the Flag .

Even if Naughty Bear 's multiplayer is a sensational thrill-ride , it 's little use when you ca n't actually play it . <p> Naughty Bear , then , is fun for about an hour . It 's not good , the virtually identical sections are hardly exciting , and there 's a lot less variety in the mayhem than you might be led to believe , but it is an enjoyable , compulsive score-chaser . But it 's deceptive . It lures you in with promises of something it never delivers . You could quite feasibly play a few missions of episodes 1 and 2 and see every good thing the game has to offer . Perhaps if this had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ atrocious challenge modes removed and some of the glitches ironed out , it could be recommended for an hour or two 's enjoyment .

@@1542231 <h> Christian martyrs for the Islamic world <p> Fr Martin McGee OSB recalls the remarkable bravery of Christian de Cherg ? and his fellow monks who suffered martyrdom in Algeria <p> In 1996 , on the night of March 26/27 , seven monks from the Trappist monastery of Tibhirine , south of Algiers , were kidnapped by Muslim fundamentalists . Fifty-six days later on May 21 all of them were beheaded . I tell their moving story in my book , Christian Martyrs for a Muslim People , the story of their love for their Muslim neighbours in Algeria . The heroic witness of these martyrs of love has now been made into a film , Of Gods and Men , winner of the Grand Prix at this year 's Cannes Film Festival . <p> The decision of the seven monks to continue to live at Tibhirine despite the grave danger they faced can best be understood by looking at the story of Fr ? re Christian de Cherg ? , their prior . Christian , the second of eight children , was born into a strongly Catholic family on January 18 1937 in Colmar , France . He became a monk in 1969 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Algeria where he would be rooted for the rest of his life . Christian wished to live out his monastic commitment in Algeria as a sign of his love for the Muslim people and to deepen his understanding and appreciation of Islam , to become a man of prayer alongside a people of prayer . <p> Christian de Cherg ? , like all other foreigners in Algeria , had been put under sentence of death in October , 1993 by the Armed Islamic Group ( GIA , from French Groupe Islamique Arm ? ) , an armed Islamic group seeking to impose sharia law on the country . Christian had committed himself to service of the Algerian Church and the Algerian people . He was unwilling to turn back as they faced their moment of greatest need . Christian knew that he almost certainly did n't have much time left to live and that the wisdom of his decision to stay on in Algeria and face the possibility of execution would be questioned . On Christmas Eve 1993 , the monks had their first visit by an armed group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his testament on January 1 1994 and sent it to his nephew in France to be opened upon his death . This short document was a summing up of his long spiritual journey and of his love for God and for the Algerian people . <p> It read : " If it should happen one day -- and it could be today -- that I should be a victim of the terrorism which now seems to want to embrace all foreigners living in Algeria , I would like my community , my Church , my family to remember that my life was given to God and to this country . " <p> Here , Christian draws attention to the mindless violence which was plagueing Algerian society in those terrible years of civil war starting in 1992 . An estimated 100,000 to 200,000 Algerians were brutally murdered , among them 19 priests and religious and about 100 lay Christians . There were also deeply personal reasons why Christian should be willing , if necessary , to lay down his life for his friends . While on national service in Algeria in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had befriended a local policeman , Mohammed , a father of 10 and a devout Muslim . One day an attempt was made on Christian 's life . Luckily Mohammed managed to shield him and save his life . The following day , however , his friend was found assassinated by the roadside . This incident left an indelible mark on Christian . He could never forget that an Algerian Muslim friend had sacrificed his life for him . <p> The GIA had issued an ultimatum to all foreigners to leave the country by December 1 1993 or face execution . Twelve Croats were assassinated on December 14 , at Tamesguida , two and a half miles from the monastery , because they were foreigners and Christians . These immigrant workers used to attend midnight Mass at the monastery and were well known to the monks . When the GIA leader Sayah Attia invaded the monastery on Christmas Eve 1993 , Christian knew he was speaking to someone who had already cut the throats of 145 people , a person referred to in the press as " a filthy beast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ biblical teaching that " in every person there is something of the eternal " , that each person shows forth the face of God . He tells us that in this encounter he was not only the guardian of his monastic community but also the guardian of God 's image in Attia . Even in the worst of people there is a glimpse to be caught of the face of God . He entrusted Attia to God 's mercy . <p> The first reason why the Tibhirine monks stayed was to show solidarity with the villagers who had no means of escaping the encircling violence of the civil war . The monastic community had developed a very close relationship with its Muslim neighbours , even to the extent of allowing them to use one of the monastery rooms as a temporary mosque . A second reason for staying was the monks ' wish to show solidarity with the beleaguered and fast-dwindling Christian Church in Algeria . <p> Mgr Henri Teissier , Archbishop of Algiers from 1988 to 2008 , was well placed to meditate on this difficult question of how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was constantly under threat and he had to learn to live with this on a daily basis .

It is so much in harmony with what we meet in the life of Jesus and with what we celebrate in the Eucharist . " <p> Like Jesus , their master , the monks of Tibhirine knew that to lay down one 's life for one 's friends was the supreme expression of love . And since their arrival in Tibhirine in 1938 they had forged an unbreakable bond of friendship with the villagers , their co-workers , neighbours and fellow believers in the one God . <p> On the night of March 26 -- 27 1996 Christian and six of his fellow monks were abducted by a fundamentalist group and beheaded 56 days later on May 21 . Christian knew that such a violent death was very likely and he had written @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the last moment , who will not have known what you were doing .

And may we be lucky enough to meet again , happy good thieves , in paradise , should it please God , the Father of both of us . Amen ! Insha'Allah ! " <p> Christian here expresses the essence of the Gospel in his attitude to the Islamic fundamentalist , the " friend of the last moment " , who would kill him , namely , love even of our enemies . The message of the martyrdom of Christian and his six fellow monks of Tibhirine is one of love and forgiveness , especially of one 's enemies . <p> Reflecting on the almost total destruction of the Church in Algeria , Brother Paul of Tibhirine wrote in January , 1995 : " Nevertheless I believe that the Good News is being sown , the seed is germinating ...

@@1542232 <h> Why Europe rose , and why it is now declining <p> Hagar , one of my long-established commenters , asks why I have n't written up the Open Europe debate in which I took part last week . Well , Mary Ellen Synon of The Daily Mail has written an embarrassingly generous pr ? cis here , and Mats Persson has now produced a slightly more thorough report here . <p> Mats " summarises " my case rather better than I remember putting it at the time . The argument against European integration comes down to systems competition . Five hundred years ago , the Oriental empires -- Ming , Mogul and Ottoman -- were technologically far ahead of the scattered tribes at the western tip of the Eurasian landmass . They had gunpowder and canals , ocean-going ships and paper money , advanced mathematics and astronomy . Mediaeval Europeans , by comparison , were primitive and poor . <p> So why did their children come to dominate the planet ? Why did n't the Chinese , as one might have expected , sail around Africa to discover Portugal ? Because , to cut a long story short , the Oriental monarchies became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , never became a single state , but remained a nexus of competing states , each striving to outperform its neighbours , each able to copy what worked elsewhere . <p> I do n't pretend that this is an original thesis . I lifted it from Paul Kennedy , who had in turn lifted it from the Australian historian E L Jones . Mats provides a rather more comprehensive supporting bibliography . But the argument is a remarkably simple one . External competition is an important check on state power . A government can raise taxes only up to a certain point before wealth-creators move to more friendly jurisdictions , and start paying their revenue to other exchequers . It can regulate social policy and employment law only up to a certain point before businesses and jobs relocate . Diversity , in short , stimulates competition and innovation . <p> The EU is , in a sense , a reaction to this process : a powerful , if ultimately futile , attempt to regulate international markets . At the moment that the Asian powers are discovering the benefits of decentralisation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In consequence , the 15 nations of " Old Europe " ( that is , the EU as it stood prior to the 2004 enlargement round ) have seen their share of world GDP decline from 36 per cent in 1980 to 24 per cent today , with a forecast drop to 15 per cent in 2020 . The USA , over the same period , has kept its share of world GDP steady . <p> The absence of political unity brings political as well as economic advantages . Many European advances were driven by the phenomenon of the refugee . As long as there was somewhere to flee to , the power of the autocrat was checked . As long as there were competing states , no dictatorship would be secure . Edward Gibbon put it like this : <p> " The division of Europe into a number of independent states , connected , however , with each other by the general resemblance of religion , language , and manners , is productive of the most beneficial consequences to the liberty of mankind .

" <p> Although Gibbons ' arguments were echoed on the panel by a Brit ( me ) a Swede ( Mats ) and a Belgian ( Pieter Cleppe ) , the pro-Brussels speakers still attacked us as " Europhobes " . Which goes to demonstrate one of this blog 's long-standing contentions , viz that a certain kind of Euro-enthusiast will dismiss any criticism of the EU , whether it is based on history , economics or democracy , as intrinsically xenophobic .

It has been something hugely significant and important to him . Dad came from a respected family from the eastern borders of Poland .

It also meant that over the years people have sent him little jigsaw pieces of his life . Recently someone sent a photo she had of him as a child . <p> Of course dad must have told us things about his life when we were children but when you are young details do n't really register . Now his story has really affected me . I feel deeply upset he went hungry for so long in Siberia . <p> Imagine being 12 or 13 when y ou 're growing like the clappers and having nothing more to eat all day than a scrap of bread or a potato or when you 're in temperatures of minus 20 or 30 without warm clothes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the war .

He must have thought we were totally spoiled as kids . <p> Dad lost all material possessions but maintained a deep sense of who he was . That has been passed on to me along with a strong pride about where I come from . Dad has also instilled in me a need to make my mark in life and I hope that some day we get to prove ourselves . <p> There is definitely a strength in all of us as a family .

The world collapsed for me in 1939 and everything was gone . The rest of my life has been a process of reconstructing and collecting bits and pieces of my past . <p> As a father I tried to give my kids as much materially as I could , I suppose because I had so little but I had to work and , as a consultant to developing countries , I was away a lot .

@@1546231 <h> I 'm sorry , but breast-feeding is a bit creepy <p> A former breastfeeder says of course mums should be free to nurse in public , but why do so many of them want to ? <p> I <p> 5 July 2010 <h> Get spiked by email <p> It 's going to be a long summer . It 's only June and already there have been three breastfeeding rows . Here in the US there was Kim Kardashian 's controversial tweet about her disgust at seeing a woman doing a bare-breasted feed at a Los Angeles restaurant . Next up , Denver mum Sandra Snow was harassed by security guards while breastfeeding her baby at a Colorado Rockies Game . Coors Stadium later apologised . And finally Kathryn Blundell , deputy editor of the UK 's Mother and Baby magazine , wrote an article calling breastfeeding ' creepy ' . <p> Breastfeeding is one of those issues guaranteed to stir things up . Career in the doldrums ? Criticise breastfeeding , or defend it from your high horse , and things might start looking up . Need a few more eyeballs to bolster your magazine circulation ? Call breastfeeding ' creepy ' . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrong , like Coors Stadium , and it 's a PR nightmare . <p> But why does the breastfeeding issue continually cause such a storm ? Is it something about the act of breastfeeding itself ? As a formerly breastfeeding mother , I have a theory about this . Breastfeeding , unless you are doing it or have done it in the past or have been intimately acquainted with someone who has done it , can be a little creepy . <p> I remember receiving a book about breastfeeding while pregnant with my first child . It was recommended by a friend , who gave me her guarantee that it was a low-key book : no gushing , no poems ; just the mechanics . And yet it was still a completely jarring experience to open a book with photo after photo of latching , nursing , expressing , etc . Intellectually , I was on board with giving it a try , but the impending actuality felt surreal . It was n't just the oft-discussed shift from **26;60;TOOLONG to breasts-as-baby-food . It was more profound and all the more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was happening at the same time as the impending arrival of my first baby was turning everything else upside down . <p> With the birth of my son , breastfeeding became mainly exhausting . I spent a great deal of time worrying about the whole enterprise : ' Why is n't he gaining weight faster ? Is this thrush ? ( No . ) Will tea bags help ? ( Yes . ) Why the craving for oatmeal cookies ? ' But there was a moment in the dead of night when , in my sleep haze , I had an insight . I was thinking that nursing my baby was like something a dolphin or a cow would do . ' I 'm a ... ' I hesitated , grappling with the thought . ' I 'm a mammal ! ' Obvious yes , but it struck me then how rarely we 're confronted in a such a personal way with this odd peculiarity of our own humanity : the fact that we are of the natural world and yet apart from it , too . <h> Related categories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beings that the biology of breastfeeding is n't the whole story . Instead it is about something more than nutritional values or ounces consumed , whether through breast milk or infant formula . Breastfeeding is a natural process , yes , but it is filtered through our cultural outlook . How do we value women 's time ? Do we want fathers to be able to be primary caregivers for their infants ? All these factors and more help to determine what is best for any given family . It is all about the people involved , which is why it is impossible to generalise about what is best in any particular case and to say , for example , that all mothers have some natural duty to breastfeed . <p> One reason why people get so hot and bothered about breastfeeding is because we invest our lifestyles with so much importance these days . There was a time when no one cared very much how a baby was fed , just so long as he or she was well-nourished and healthy . But breastfeeding is about much more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a means to an end . It is a statement about who you are and what you value . To breastfeed is to be authentic and uncorrupted by the trappings of modernity ( one reason , perhaps , why it loses some of its charm when it involves spending quality time locked in a room at work with a breast pump ) . It is the mark of a good parent . It says you want the best for your baby . <p> This is why public breastfeeding has become so contentious . Because breastfeeding is no longer just about feeding baby , and rather has become bound up with mum 's identity , it can no longer exist in a vacuum . Unless it 's done in public , as publicly as possible in fact , then there is no chance for social validation . There is nothing unusual in understanding who we are in relation to other people , of course , but when the source of our prestige and social standing shifts from the things we do in public to the things we do in our private @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ private activities in public . <p> In other words , just breastfeeding in private does n't count -- it does n't make The Statement . Of course it is perfectly possible for mothers out in public to feed their baby breastmilk from a bottle , or to keep the act of breastfeeding fairly low-key or finding a quiet place to nurse -- but then it would n't be obvious what a good parent the nursing mother is . Even worse , if you fed breastmilk from a bottle , someone might think the bottle contained infant formula ! Let 's face it , nothing says ' I 'm breastfeeding ' -- and in essence ' I 'm a good mother ' -- like doing it Boadicea-style . <p> This begs the question : why has breastfeeding become synonymous with being a good mother ? Why are we assailed with campaigns to get us to breastfeed exclusively for the first six months ? Breastmilk is good for babies , certainly , but as Joan Wolf , Hanna Rosin and others have pointed out , both the benefits of breastfeeding and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The reason why breastfeeding is now taken as a sign of good motherhood is probably related to the point about breastfeeding highlighting humanity 's peculiar nature . We are both creatures of the natural world and also the creations of our own cultures . In society today , women are generally considered to be equal -- or in some cases superior -- to men . The problem , however , is that we have not found a good , systematic alternative to the jobs women have traditionally done in the family setting . The organisation of those aspects of life still falls to individuals , and more often than not women take on most of the responsibility . They pay the price , whether it 's actual loss of income , damage to their career or simple exhaustion . Poll after poll highlights women 's ( and men 's ) dissatisfaction with this state of affairs . <p> This lack of certainty about how we raise the next generation seems to contribute to a sense of uncertainty amongst policymakers , too . The instinct of people who deal with these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crucial role of parents -- in doing everything from basically raising children to helping to solve future social and political problems by raising children in ' the right way ' -- and while it is unusual to hear anyone proclaim that mothers should be the ones with the primary responsibility , choosing to campaign for breastfeeding on the basis that it is ' best for baby ' does emphasise the biological aspects of motherhood over everything else . <p> Is breastfeeding creepy ? Yes , sometimes it can be . It can also be lovely and rewarding , depending on the individual . Breastfeeding is a great way to feed babies but it is not the only way , and it certainly should n't become some sort of civic virtue . As for breastfeeding in public , it 's probably just a fact of life that until women habitually go about bare-breasted in the normal course of events , many people will be a little uncomfortable seeing bare breasts in public -- even , or perhaps especially , if they happen to be nursing . That does n't mean women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made to skulk around toilets in order to feed their babies . Ideally , we should not allow these issues to be politicised in the first place , so that breastfeeding in public becomes a badge of honour , but rather cultivate a culture of genuine tolerance in which people can negotiate these situations with empathy and common sense .

That says a lot about the soundness of the original concept of a luxury 4x4 - but even more about the way Land Rover has developed it . <p> There have been just two completely all-new successors to the original car , which stayed in production for the best part of a quarter century ; the only way Land Rover has been able to keep up with , or for the most part , stay ahead of , German and Japanese rivals with much shorter model replacement cycles , is by constantly upgrading the cars during their entire production lives . The last version of the original " classic " Range Rover , with its four-door body shell , long wheelbase , air suspension , automatic gearbox and lavishly-trimmed interior , is quite different to the rather bare 1970 original , even if they are still recognisably the same car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which probably makes it one of the older current models on sale , but it is very difficult to identify any area in which it is really showing its age . That 's partly because the 2002 car was such a big jump forward compared with its predecessor -- and most of the competition -- but also because of that process of constant upgrading , which for the 2011 model year has mainly been focused on the diesel version . <p> Diesels have been available on Range Rovers since 1986 , but it was only three years ago that Land Rover 's top car finally got a diesel engine that delivered the same sort of power and refinement as the big V8s that have been fitted to petrol-driven versions since the beginning . That engine , too , was a V8 , whereas previous diesels had been smaller fours and sixes , often bought in from other suppliers . It had a capacity of 3.6 litres , and was a superb match for the Range Rover ; it provided the car with a lot more performance , of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which it delivered that performance that really impressed . <p> But the pace of development in diesel technology has accelerated during the last decade , and by last year , a big revamp to the smaller V6 diesel fitted to Land Rover 's other big cars had cut away most of the V8 's performance edge ; this year , however , the V8 has undergone its own big programme of improvements , similar to that carried out on the V6 , and also benefits from an increase in capacity to 4.4 litres . This improved engine is now paired with an eight-speed ZF automatic gearbox and the results are predictably impressive ; the 2011 diesel Range Rover operates almost silently most of the time , but when the engine needs to work hard -- which is rarely , given the amount of power on hand - it sounds and revs more like a good petrol V8 , rather than a diesel . <p> There are a number of other changes besides the new diesel powertain -- a rotary gear selector similar to that found on cars built by Land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in most other areas , the 2011 Range Rover is the same extremely appealing package as before , delivering very high standards of comfort and on-road behaviour , as well as the outstanding off-road abilities that really give Land Rover 's cars their edge over competitors ; it is , perhaps , a pity that most customers wo n't experience this side of the Range Rover 's performance directly , even if they are reassured by its presence . This thing really will climb apparently impossible gradients or wade deep streams with rock strewn beds , and simply soaks up the sort of general cross-country punishment that would surely break some other manufacturers ' cars . <p> So even after forty years , it appears that the Range Rover story still has plenty of life left in it . Once just the icing on the Land Rover cake , Range Rover has for years now been the main focus for the company 's development , becoming in the process a premium automotive brand , rather than just the name of a single model . The first big move to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the introduction of the less expensive Discovery-based Range Rover Sport . The Sport has been highly successful in attracting new classes of buyers but still belongs in the same size and weight category as the original car . <p> Perhaps of greater significance was the unveiling last week of the Evoque , a baby Range Rover designed to appeal to an even wider audience . Roughly the same size as the existing Land Rover Freelander , the Evoque carries into production next year , almost unchanged , the dramatic styling of the LRX concept car . The Evoque will be available with a two-wheel drive transmission as an alternative to a full all-wheel drive system , a move that would probably have been unthinkable only a year ago , before other manufacturers such as BMW with the X1 and Kia with its latest Sorento started offering a 2WD option on their SUVs . That raises the question , of course , of whether with the continuing expansion of the luxury Range Rover brand , Land Rover might eventually move too far from those rugged off-road roots that have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of SUVs .

There was no career ladder to climb then , only trees ; the size of your conker was more important than the size of your car engine and you drew doodles not pension plans . <p> An enlightened group of people based in Bristol are trying to bring back a little of that cheap and cheerful fun that filled our youth and they would love you to get involved . I met up with Jo Tinsley and Steph Wetherell , co-founders of the website The Love Of It to find out a little more . <p> So how did it all start ? " I was visiting my brother in Japan , " says Jo .

" And so she set about making one . <p> What started as an idea for a magazine , became a website where people could go to get ideas for creative things to do , find events to go to and generally get involved in " good wholesome fun " . <p> Despite only launching in January , there are already " chapters " in Wales and the North of England and they have been contacted by people from over 70 countries . It seems they have tapped into the deep longing that surely lies in everyone : to enjoy simple pleasures with good friends . <p> " All sorts of people have got involved , " Steph tells me .

I can barely get a word in edgeways as they tell me about their plans for taking part in this August 's Green Man Festival in the Brecon Beacons and their excitement for the re-launch of the website later this year . <p> " It 's going to be more like a social networking site , " I am told . " Where people can still find events but also contribute more .

Their main motivation is to help people have fun . That and the hope that one day they will have a tree-house for an office . <p> So , if bog-snorkelling is not your thing , then perhaps rock-pooling is ?

@@1553231 <h> Nvidia GeForce GTX 460 768MB Review <p> Not content with launching the GeForce GTX 465 roughly six weeks ago , Nvidia has launched two more today . Or rather it 's launched one more , though there are two versions of it -- the GeForce GTX 460 1GB and the lesser GTX 460 768MB . The aim is clear -- Nvidia has had a bad run of late , and it needs to halt the succession of poor reviews with something that 'll make people sit up and care about the name GeForce again . <p> The GTX 460 looks like the card to do it , if only on paper , as the specs are more than we 'd expected . Typically the mid-range GPU of a family has about half the resources of the top-end GPU , but the GTX 460 has roughly 70 per cent of the stream processors of the GTX 480 at 336 versus 480 . To understand why we were surprised , and why there are two models of the GTX 460 , we need to recap on the unusual way that Nvidia has designed it DX11 GPUs . Alternatively , if you already know your Raster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the architectural updates in the new GF104 GPU . <h> Fermi 101 <p> All modern GPUs are structured around a basic layout -- there 's a front-end that accepts work from the CPU and splits into a load of separate work threads . These threads then get fed into a bank of stream processors , and after being processed by these , are sent to the frame buffer via the ROPs and memory controller . <p> In a Fermi GPU , the stream processors are organised in clusters ( called SMs , or Streaming Multiprocessors , in Nvidian ) and these SMs are organised into groups of three or four to make the basis of what Nvidia calls GPCs . GPCs are more than just groups of SMs though , they 're pretty much mini-GPUs . Each GPC has a Raster Engine , which does the basic setup elements to the data given to it by the GigaThread dispatch engine , ready for the stream processors to work on . Each stream processor cluster has its own PolyMorph Engine , which contains a tesselator unit , again an element that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GPU . The GPCs output to , and communicate via , a Level 2 cache that runs through the centre of the chip . <p> Manufacturers were keen to send us their GTX 460 cards , which is usually a sign that a product is rather good . Click to enlarge . <p> The benefits of this design are two-fold : there 's a degree of modularity , as you can just cut GPCs from the full-fat GF100 design to produce lesser versions to hit lower price-points more keenly , and there 's a distributed design that Nvidia claims is ideal for tessellation . The reason for this claim is that , as tessellation is a vertex operation ( tesselation adds extra geometry detail on-the-fly for less angular objects and characters ) the results of a tessellation operation need to be fed back through a setup stage for the stream processors to be able to work on them . If the tesselator units were in a large monolithic front-end , tessellation could lead to the front-end refusing new work and the GPU stalling . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @

So can we finally call it Jason Bonham 's Led Zeppelin Experience ? <p> " Yes , that 's the working title . The name works on a few levels , because it basically tells people what it is , that it 's about Led Zeppelin , the band . But it 's also about my life , as well . It 's going to be quite a multimedia spectacle , with film clips and photographs , great lights and sound .

I 'll surround myself with a bunch of great players , a terrific singer - it 'll be fantastic . ' " <p> PAGEBREAK <p> " The whole concept started to grow in scope .

Musically , we 'll cover all the periods of Led Zeppelin , so fans will definitely get their money 's worth there . " <p> Now , when you say ' storytelling , ' are you going to be talking to the audience in an anecdotal manner ? <p> " There will be a prerecorded narration throughout the show during the changing or the sets and various things that will be happening .

" <p> Well , I wo n't ask you to reveal your setlist , but let me ask you this : Do you have a favorite Zeppelin song to play ? Also , is there one that has always given you problems , one you feel you have n't quite mastered ? <p> " Oh , they all give me problems ! laughs But I would say my favorite Zeppelin song to play is Kashmir . I have a great time playing that one . The hardest one , the song that I always find difficult to do properly , is definitely Rock And Roll .

You hear a lot of people play it and you go , ' That does n't sound quite right . ' Because they 're just going ' boom-bap-boom-bap ! ' - very straight . To do it right , you have to add the grace notes on the snare . I 'll be honest : the intro I can get right , but the rest of it still gives me problems to this day .

For the Led Zeppelin Experience , or any of the one-off concerts you 've done with the band , how do you prepare ?

I went through a lot of shows the band did and sort of analyzed what my father was playing and how the rest of the group played as well . Different eras , different tours - I 'd pick and choose and go , ' Well , I like what he did here on this tour , and on that tour I like what he did there . ' Yeah , a lot of work goes into it . And for the show I 'm putting together now , I 'm doing the same thing . " <p> PAGEBREAK <p> " That said , because it 's called Jason Bonham 's Led Zeppelin Experience , I 'm going to change around pieces here and there and do some things my own way . I think people will like it . If it 's fun and exciting for the person who 's playing it , chances are the audience will pick up on that and feel the same way .

The big difference between us , of course , is that my father passed away and his is still alive . We have two totally different perspectives . <p> " It 's interesting . I think to myself , How would things be for me if my dad was still alive ? Would we get along ? Would we argue ? You know , we never got to the falling-out stage with each other . He 'll always be my dad , but we never experienced a lot of those things that go on as you get older . <p> " As far as being a drummer , to me it 's a positive that he 's my father .

No , I 'm just hyper-sensitive to modern life ... <p> One in five of us struggles to cope with the frantic nature of modern living , says a new book . <p> Are we becoming increasingly intolerant , or is it the case that up to 20 per cent of us fall into the category of Highly Sensitive People , who are overwhelmed by the hurly-burly of modern life ? <p> A few days ago , I was sitting at my desk at home . It was a boiling hot day , so I opened the window . In the next garden , some children were lightly splashing in the paddling pool . Somewhere over the road , a hedge trimmer whined and the scent of meat drifted from a distant barbecue . <p> To most people , it was a lovely summer day , full of happy sounds and smells . To me , it was a nightmare - my heart was pounding with tension , I felt sick from the smell of sausages and I was seconds away from screaming : ' Shut up ! How can I think when you 're all making such a racket ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out by the sights , sounds and smells of modern life <p> Friends and family have long accused me of intolerance . If my environment is n't calm , silent and smelling right , I find relaxation impossible , because there 's always a distant noise , or a strange scent , or a bright light in my peripheral vision . <p> The sound of a TV booming in the living room is unbearable , whereas no one else seems remotely aware of it . I hate the car radio jabbering away . I find it impossible to think with music playing . And when the people next door are cooking their blameless dinner , of chicken or baked potatoes , I have to fling open the windows , even in winter , to disperse the smell . <p> The other day , my son left in a hurry and applied deodorant in the bathroom with the door open . I had to work downstairs all day because the lingering hint of Right Guard was making me feel violently sick . <h> Share this article <p> Share <p> Until recently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fusspot - a nightmare to live with , completely overwrought , and inexplicable to anyone except the handful of fellow over-reacters I 've met in my life . ( My grandma was one , one of my best friends is another . ) <p> But realising the desire to hurl abuse at my neighbourhood simply for going about its business was n't normal - and nor is my terror of pine-scented body-spray , or hatred of noise over three decibels - I decided to seek advice . And it turns out I 'm not an intolerant freak after all . <p> I am simply a member of the fifth of the population that 's described by psychotherapist Dr Elaine Aron as ' highly sensitive ' . In her book , The Highly Sensitive Person : How To Thrive When The World Overwhelms You , she offers the theory that some people are born with a more sensitive nervous system - and are more easily stimulated to panic , intolerance and general over-reaction to modern living . <p> ' It means you are aware of subtleties in your surroundings , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easily overwhelmed when you have been out in a highly stimulating environment for too long , bombarded by sights and sounds until you are exhausted . ' <p> Even the eminent psychologist Carl Jung developed the theory that certain people suffer ' innate sensitivity ' - or are , as our frustrated mothers would have said , ' very highly strung ' . <p> I took Dr Aron 's HSP quiz , to discover whether I am indeed in that group of genuine HSPs . Ticking statements including : ' Other people 's moods affect me ' , ' I am particularly sensitive to the effects of caffeine ' and ' When I must be observed performing a task , I become so nervous that I do much worse . ' It seemed pretty clear that I 'm one of them . <p> Dr Aron suggests that HSPs share a fear of violent films , a dislike of loud noises , and a regular need to be alone . Well , that would be a resounding yes to all of the above . <p> I once stupidly watched Kubrick 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a month . <p> If I drink a single cup of tea after 5pm , I 'm awake all night . <p> And I failed my driving test three times despite being perfectly capable of reverse parking - because the moment the examiner climbed in beside me , my body flooded with dread and I could barely turn the key in the ignition . <p> As for other people 's emotions , I can feel myself changing colour like a mood-ring , depending on whether my husband 's had a good day or has returned from work grumpy . <p> Frankly , it all sounds rather pathetic , and reminds me of my elderly cat , Edna , who flinches whenever biscuits rattle gently into her bowl . <p> But Dr Aron insists that HSPs also embody plenty of positives . There are suggestions of a ' rich , complex inner-life ' and ' being moved by the arts and music ' . ( Then again , this would imply that the other 80 per cent of the population are lumbering farm-hands , shrugging at Da Vinci and turning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) <p> Our hyper-vigilance to danger means we 're less likely to get hurt or ill . In 39 years , I 've never needed more than Nurofen Plus to get by . Our sensitivity to our environments makes us marvellous communicators who can defuse arguments . <p> We 're great at developing intimacy with others and are excellent problem-solvers thanks to our highly tuned imaginations . This all sounds great , but I recall sobbing every day as a child because I had to go to school , and being petrified by anything scarier than Mr Benn on TV . <p> Other kids thought Dr Who was great . I had only to hear the theme tune for my legs to turn to jelly - and bear in mind this was rubbish , Seventies Dr Who , when everything was made of cardboard and pasta . <p> According to Jenna Forrest , author of HSP memoir Help Is On Its Way : ' HSchildren pick up subtle signals , thoughts , moods and other sensory energies from home , TV or school - and they do n't know what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Women are twice as susceptible to stress than men due to an excess of corticotropin , produced at times of anxiety <p> I developed a reputation for being a cry-baby , as sadly , the HSP concept had n't reached Manchester in 1976 . I thought it was just me , but a bit of research among my female friends reveals I 'm not alone in my disproportionate reaction to mild stimuli . <p> One friend said : ' I can not bear the smell of cooking salmon . I have to leave the house if I get the slightest whiff of it . ' <p> ' Oh , ugh , the sound of milk being poured , ' shudders another . ' It sets my teeth on edge . I do n't let my partner have cereal because of it . ' <p> It surely ca n't be the case that every one of my fortysomething friends fits into the HSP bracket , so perhaps we 're simply getting less tolerant . <p> Modern life offers so much stimulus , with its constant demands and barrages of information @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our peace , from planes , cars , TV , music and mobile phones . <p> ' I do n't know if I 'm an HSP , ' says my friend Jenny , 35 , ' but I feel murderous when someone gets on the train with tinny earphones turned up too loud , or when my husband watches football - the cheering makes me want to scream . ' <p> Jenny believes she 's become more hyper-aware since having children : ' I think it 's because with a new baby , you 're constantly attuned for their cries in the night . So now , the slightest noise wakes me up and I instantly feel tense . ' <p> Perhaps my fellow HSPs and I resemble nothing so much as the weird kid in The Sixth Sense , attuned to some dog-whistle frequency that normal people ca n't hear . <p> Being an HSP is not curable , but , says Dr Aron , it 's not an illness either . It 's like having a musical ear , or an allergy to raspberries . You 're stuck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could hear a cat wake up two streets away - stress-related , or due to excess cortisol , the stress hormone . But there are tips to help prevent a constant state of red-alert , the most important being : ' Avoid over-stimulation . ' <p> HSPs can be sociable , but too much excitement usually means we need to lie in a darkened room . Calming bedtime rituals are also useful , and a soothing sleep environment is essential . <p> You should also learn to say no , warns Dr Aron , so never take on too much , because you 'll feel overwhelmed . <p> Being an HSP can be wearisome - especially for long-suffering family and friends . But ultimately , we 're a better bargain than we appear . Because at least we 'll always wake up when the house is being burgled - and our kitchens will never smell of frying fish .

@@1554236 <h> Andres Iniesta , the unassuming superstar <p> The reluctant superstar has overnight become the one of the most famous sporting faces on the planet . <p> As Andres Iniesta controlled Cesc Fabregas 's pass in the 116th minute of the World Cup final , Spain 's destiny lay in the hands of its pocket-sized midfield playmaker . One sweet sweep of his right foot and Iniesta , for so long the quiet prince of Spanish football , was suddenly its king . <p> No more just the sublimely talented creator who lives in the shadows of supposedly more illustrious team-mates , now it is the boy from Fuentealbilla near Albacete in the east of Spain who reigns supreme . <p> In order to see this content you need to have both Javascript enabled and Flash installed . Visit BBC Webwise for full instructions . If you 're reading via RSS , you 'll need to visit the blog to access this content . <p> But just who is the 26-year-old who has now won every major honour in the game ? <p> Iniesta 's rise to stardom has not been without a struggle , although sometimes often it seemed that maybe he himself was the biggest obstacle to success . <p> Painfully shy as a youngster , Iniesta joined Barcelona 's youth academy , La Masia , when he was 12 . He was often homesick and kept himself to himself , a rare sign of his personality showing through with the posters of Barca captain Pep Guardiola that adorned the wall in his room . <p> But soon it became clear the Catalan club had a special talent on their hands . Invited to train with the first team one day when he was 16 , it has gone down in Barcelona history what Guardiola , now coach of the club , said to midfield colleague Xavi when he first laid eyes on Iniesta : " You 're going to retire me , " whispered the then 29-year-old , " but this kid 's going to retire us all . " <p> Iniesta made his debut under Louis van Gaal in 2002 , eventually establishing himself in the first-team squad with Van Gaal 's successor , fellow Dutchman Frank Rijkaard . But with the likes of Xavi , Ronaldino , Lionel Messi , Deco and Mark van Bommel around , Iniesta could not bed down a regular place in the team , instead calmly filling in a variety of positions as the club used his versatility to good use . <p> Left out of the starting XI for the Champions League final in 2006 , it seemed as though Iniesta was destined to remain a bit-part player . But , gradually , he became indispensible - not through shouting from the rooftops about how good he was , simply by being so good that people began to start championing his cause . <p> It was not hard to see why . Playing in a midfield three at Barcelona in tandem with Yaya Toure and his footballing soulmate Xavi , Iniesta 's class shone like a beacon . It was n't just that he could move the ball around with the ' tiki-taki ' accuracy and verve of Xavi , it was also that his lightning-quick feet and ability to dribble past people were at times eerily similar to his team-mate further up the pitch , Lionel Messi . <p> Before long , the fact Iniesta kept himself to himself and shied away from the limelight did not matter . He had plenty of people queueing up and tell the world how good he was . <p> Xavi reckoned the only thing holding his colleague back was the press . " Iniesta is easily Spain 's most complete player . He has everything . Well , nearly everything - he needs media backing , " said Xavi . Samuel Eto'o went a step further : " Iniesta is the best player in the world , whenever he 's on the pitch he creates a spectacle . " <p> If Iniesta did n't do himself any harm with his assured displays as Spain captured the hearts of a continent by winning Euro 2008 , what has happened since has ensured he will go down in the annals of the game he so effortlessly graces . <p> In fact , you can probably trace the exact moment he shook off the shackles of anonymity and finally announced himself to the world : 2135 BST on Wednesday 6 May 2009 , when he set to one side the " receive , pass , offer , receive , pass , offer " Barcelona education he had been schooled in and smashed a 20-yard right-foot shot into the top corner of the Chelsea net to send his team into the Champions League final . <p> From there on , the praise became deafening . After Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson warned that " Xavi and Iniesta get you on this carousel " , the 5ft 6in Iniesta put on a footballing masterclass to help Barca beat the Old Trafford outfit 2-0 in Rome . <p> Sitting in the vanquished dressing room after the match , Wayne Rooney told his team-mates - including a certain Cristiano Ronaldo - that they had just lost to a team directed " by the best player in the world " . He was n't talking about Xavi or Messi but Iniesta . Eto'o was delighted that he had been proven correct : " When I said Iniesta was the world 's best , you laughed . Now you can see I 'm right . " <p> Yet coming into the World Cup in South Africa , as the likes of Rooney and Ronaldo decorated posters and billboards all over the country , Iniesta was nowhere to be seen . <p> The man sometimes called ' El Anti-Galactico ' in Spain could hardly be more different to the stereotypical modern footballer , eschewing as he does the partying , tattoos and the usual headlines that are so common among his peers . " Discos are not my thing , " he once said . <p> In the mixed zone at the Camp Nou after Barcelona beat Real Madrid in ' El Clasico ' in November , I gathered around as a group of Spanish journalists questioned Iniesta . Wearing jeans and a plain white T-shirt , he immediately stood out from the rest of his team-mates . He also spoke so softly even the guys at the front were straining to hear him . <p> But the most interesting thing was that Xavi , standing about three feet away from Iniesta , stopped talking twice to his interviewers so he could hear what his ' tiki-taki ' twin was saying . He might not say much but when he does people listen . <p> Before Sunday 's World Cup final , Iniesta challenged his Spain colleagues to improve , suggesting the level they reached in the 1-0 semi-final win over Germany would not be good enough to take the trophy . He also gave a hint of the excitement he felt at helping his country to a first appearance in the final : ' ' We have all dreamed of this moment but we have to finish the dream . The last step is the most difficult and the most beautiful . " <p> How prophetic . In a brutally physical game of football in Johannesburg , Iniesta was left in no doubt as to how the Netherlands were going to try to stop him after Van Bommel clattered into him from behind early on to pick up a booking . <p> Van Bommel 's gamble appeared to pay off as a subdued Iniesta struggled to get into the game , giving the ball away with a regularity that borders on sinful where he comes from . But as the second half wore on and the Dutch began to tire , he began to take the game by the scruff of the neck . <p> A jinking run into the box was only denied its deserved finish by a super sliding tackle from Wesley Sneijder . Then , in extra-time , it was from Iniesta 's cute through ball that Fabregas found the legs of Maarten Stekelenburg instead of the far corner . <p> In order to see this content you need to have both Javascript enabled and Flash installed . Visit BBC Webwise for full instructions . If you 're reading via RSS , you 'll need to visit the blog to access this content . <p> But Iniesta was not to be denied his match-winning moment . A few minutes after he was hauled down by John Heitinga following an umpteenth one-two with Xavi - the Dutch defender was sent off as a result - Iniesta 's crowning glory arrived as he slammed home . <p> As the final whistle went , Iniesta slumped to his knees and shook his fists on the turf , more than 700 million people around the world watching this most reserved footballer enjoy a very rare public display of emotion . <p> The truth may have been somewhat closer when Fabregas , Carles Puyol and Gerard Pique burst into the room moments later shouting " you 're the best , you 're the best " at the man who saved them from going to penalties . <p> After Iniesta 's goal at Chelsea last year , Guardiola revealed some of his midfielder 's frustration . " Andres always moans that he does n't score enough , as if with everything else he does , he has to get goals , too . Tonight he settled his debt forever . " <p> On Sunday , Iniesta 's World Cup winner ensured Spain would be forever in his debt . <h> Comment number 3 . <p> Im ' glad you think that , but if you honestly believe that chasing the referee , waving imaginary cards to try and get people sent off and generally falling over at the slightest contact is the way that this ' superstar ' should behave on a football pitch , then it does n't say much for the rest of the game does it . <p> As for football - yes he is capable of brilliance , but nobody would no it from this world cup , all he has achieved is ana mazing ability to pass the ball sideways for 90 minutes and score the winning goal in the world cup final , which last time I looked was n't really good enough to get to be player of the tournament ! <p> I really did n't want Spain to win last night because I am fed up of the media hype about them . there was nothing about them last night that was ' beautiful ' in anybodys eyes yet still I had to put up with commentators and pundits alike waxing lyrical over them . <p> Next time theres a match on , can you comment on what is happening in the game , rather than your preconceived ideas of what they would like to happen <h> Comment number 5 . <p> What makes it all the more remarkable is Iniesta has been battling depression for a year now after a injury ravaged season which made him question if he could continue playing and worst of all the death of 2 friends . One of which was the Espanyol player Dani Jarque whose name Ini bore on the vest he showed to the world , and got a booking for it . Ini is a legend and has done a great job overcoming all he has to win the world cup . Viva Iniesta ! <h> Comment number 6 . <p> Iniesta is no doubt talented . It 's a shame poeple have only just realised . I have watched this fella closely for about 7years now nad I think he just needs to score more goals for an attacking midfielder . <h> Comment number 7 . <p> He is a sublime talent , problem is that he will also always be remembered along with his partners in crime Puyol and Xavi for hounding every ref over every foul commited by an opposition player to give a card . It was like watching Barcelona how they all surroundedf the ref every possible moment . Makes most of us fools for complaining how bad United were at one point , but they have nothing on these guys . <h> Comment number 10 . <p> Good blog , but I do n't think we can keep talking about Iniesta as if he 's some kind of ' unsung ' hero . The football press have been banging on about how good he is for a good couple of years now . We know what he 's all about and we know how important he is to both his club and country . <p> In all honesty I found Spain only marginally more exciting to watch than Greece at Euro 2008 . I am a football purist of the highest order , but even I find Spain 's so-called tiki-taka ( note to Stevo : not tiki-taki ) keep-ball tactics utterly tedious . <p> Yes , their technique is flawless and their close control is at times jaw-dropping , but to me it 's akin to sitting and watching someone like Ronaldinho ball-juggle for 90 minutes . Entertaining in small doses , but it 's not long before you pray for someone to just hoof it into the box and stick it in the net . That is the aim of the game , after all . <p> Agree with 11giggsy11 as well - Iniesta is up there with the worst of them when it comes to diving . Not something to be proud of . <h> Comment number 11 . <p> Regardless of all the negative comments mentioned so far that could apply to the majority of players in the game today - and the fact I was supporting Holland - I could n't have been happier to see Andres Iniesta score the winning goal . <h> Comment number 14 . <p> Class player without a doubt , and we ( England ) do n't have anyone to compare . But he 's no angel - how many times did he wave imaginary cards in the air to try to get the ref to book a Dutch player ? And most importantly , dived to get Heitinga sent off . The blog said " hauled down by John Heitinga " - you 're having a laugh ! The merest touch on his shoulder and he hit the deck as though he were shot ! Arjen Robben would have been proud of that one . Not even a foul , yet it led to the game-turning dismissal.Yes , a great player , but why must the Spain-obessesed BBC " experts " only see the good side of their play ? <h> Comment number 17 . <p> Well , it 's always a joy to watch him play . The partnership he has with Xavi is second to none . Unfortunately , in a world where people always look at those who score instead of those who mastermind , he wo n't win World Best Player - though he deserves it . <p> Also , I would like to state that I 'm greatly disappointed in Capello 's inability to play Lampard and Gerrard together to dominate midfield . To me , if Capello should have been able to do this , even Iniesta and Xavi partnership wo n't come close . I always wonder how can England have the best of midfielders and not dominate . Football is always won in the midfield and England has always fallen short of that . And until , this is sorted out , there is no way England can win a major trophy ! <p> Whilst so many fans in England talk about Gerrad and Lampard being world class and the likes of Cole and Rooney , I feel like people do nt take the time to watch other leagues and realise how far behind the English players are . <p> Iniesta and xavi compliment Messi so well and when the theree of them are on the pitch for Barcelona its irresistable , Chuck Villa in to the mix and its hows you how good they are . <p> England being left very far behind if Rooney is the best we have to offer . <h> Comment number 19 . <p> The BBC " experts " seem blinkered at best regarding SPain 's performances . I had to switch over to " the other channel " at half time and full time because I could n't listen to Hansen et al 's brown-nosing a minute longer . <h> Comment number 20 . <p> ' To me , if Capello should have been able to do this , even Iniesta and Xavi partnership wo n't come close ' <p> Gerrard-Lampard would n't even come close because they do n't know how to pass or keep the ball at international level . They are too ' hollywood ' ( direct and too tempted to go for the long pass ) in their style for the international stage in central midfield . <h> Comment number 21 . <p> 9 .

" <h> Comment number 23 . <p> Typical english football fans ! ! ! Know nothing about football . Xavi and Iniesta are considered 2 of the best midfielders in the worl ...... for a reason . Their country is World and European champion , their club has won about 8 trophies in 2 seasons . And why , because they keep position , pick out the correct passes and execute them with near 100% standard.And half the comments so far have been about how they dive and harrass the referee ...... De Jong was auditioning for the next Karate Kid film , Van Bommel nearly broke Iniesta 's leg with that challenge and you want them to politely talk to the ref and not ask for cards ? If Howard webb did his job the Dutch would have 8 men on the pitch before hal-ftime and Spain would 've won 5-0 . Please give credit where credit 's due . <p> Look at England . Gerrard has nothing on iniesta , lampard has nothing on Xavi and rooney has nothing on Villa . maybe we should try and emulate the Spanish rather than put them down ? <h> Comment number 24 . <p> I notice you did nt ' make any mention of his throwing a dutch player to the floor which resulted in his yellow card ! Does n't fit with the glory piece I suppose , but yes , you are telling us what we all know , and have known for at least 2 years . <h> Comment number 26 . <p> i agree with some of the posters about the hype and bias towards spain especially from the bbc pundits ! .. Especially when they made up excuses for anything bad done by spain ! ! lol laughable at some times . I am sooo glad Forlan was crowned player of the tournament , modest and never once saw him falling to the ground at the slightest touch and rolling around screaming in agony , led by example its what footballers should be like ... Round off applause for one of the most underrated players in world football .... Oh and the funniest moment was at the end of BBC 's coverrage when linekar announces Forlan was the player of the tournament , Hansen and co laughed and saying it should have been iniesta ! ! ... Hmm .. a spain team without iniesta would have still reached the finals easily .... a Uruguay team without Forlan would have been knocked out at the group stages ... work it out who has achieved more and who was more pivotel in thier team performances ? ? ? ? ... Hansen and Co your thoughts please ? ? <h> Comment number 27 . <p> " hauled down by John Heitinga " - having read this blog and Paul Fletcher 's , I am truly astounded at the one eyed nature of BBC ' journalism ' . I have to admit to being an Everton fan , but I ca n't believe that anyone who watches football in the world could say with a straight face ( or worse , put into print ! ) that Heitinga hauled Iniesta down by gently resting his hand on his shoulder for a microsecond . Iniesta , the unassuming , principled superstar that he is promptly threw himself to the turf in an impressively dramatic fashion ( arms flung out , the natural reaction to being hauled to the ground ) , only managing to somehow regain his footing to brandish an imaginary card repeatedly at Howard Webb . When did trying to get other players booked stop being a bookable offence , and start being the sign of the virtuous ? Iniesta - great player , but come off it , he 's not the second coming , nor is he any different from the bulk of the top players , who are willing to dive , cheat , and bully the ref in order to win . <h> Comment number 29 . <p> Do n't get me wrong , Iniesta would get into any national side or club team in the world right now but in my opinion he 's solid and consistent with very good technical ability but he 's not good enough to run a game for 90 minutes without Xavi or Fabregas in the midfield with him . Honestly I think it 's a reflection of the falling standards in football that such articles are being written about him and a Spanish team that just won probably the worst world cup ever by scoring 8 goals in 7 games ( yes they were the best team but that says more about their defence than anything else ) . When I think about a recent creative midfielder who graced the Nou Camp with his genius and who did n't score enough goals to ultimately get the recognition he deserved I think of Michael Laudrup and Iniesta is not a patch on him . Oh and just to add , he was a gentleman who never dived . <h> Comment number 30 . <p> Have to agree with some of the other comments about his diving ( or , more accurately , hie exageration , as he is usually fouled ) and the imaginary cards . It is unbecoming of a man who is undoubtedly a great player . <p> Having said that , I think that people criticising him for only passing the ball sideways need to take a step back . Yes , a lot of his passes are simple , short balls to Xavi or another team-mate , however that does n't tell the whole story . The point is that he retains posession better than any other player in the world . And if the opposition do n't have the ball then they ca n't hurt you . I agree that Spain can be dull to watch at times but this is largely because they 're so good at what they do and Iniesta is at the heart of this . <p> Someone has already mentioned about his 1st touch , which is sublime , but I think his greatest asset is his speed of thought . The majorty of players have the skill to do what Iniesta does . The difference is that they 'd usually take twice as long to do it and those fractions of seconds are what leave opposition midfielders trailing in his wake . <h> Comment number 31 . <p> I live in Spain and follow the incredible Spanish football team . Quite simply the best football team I have seen in my 30-odd years of life . They have lacked a cutting edge in this tournament but they were playing a little more reservadly than normal as Del Bosque thought this was the best chance ever of winning th World Cup , they missed Torres ' influence and all seven teams they have payed have " parked the bus " . On the news here this morning they mentioned that there is only one country in the whole world that are criticising this team , the UK ! Now why may this be ? I can only think it is jealosy when recognising that England is now THE worst major football nation in the world and that its fans feel impotent when they see Spain play as they know that English players are incapable of such technique and skill.The last 4 Spain 1-0 games werent classics but they were full of drama and when Spain dominated them , they were bordering on football lessons which all kids should watch.For those who say Spanish players behaviour is disgraceful I disagree . Whenever I watch the Premierleague I see players legs and angles getting snaped in two , that is disgraceful behavour from inferior sportsman who are nt up to it.Anyway , Iniesta is a legend and an icon for Spanish football . That Spain has won the European Championships and World Cup with four or five 5ft6 , 10st weaklings is a welcome paradigm shift for football . I predict more rewards for this team to come , except for Puyol and Capdevila , the team is still young ! <h> Comment number 32 . <p> " If Howard webb did his job the Dutch would have 8 men on the pitch before hal-ftime and Spain would 've won 5-0 " <p> By the same token , if Webb had sent off Van Bommel and De Jong in the first half , he would have been accused of being too strict and ruining the spectacle . He was in a lose-lose situation from the off and I think he did a great job given the circumstances . <h> Comment number 33 . <p> " why must the Spain-obessesed BBC " experts " only see the good side of their play ? " <p> - You make a very good point , the BBC are slavishly sycophantic when it comes to Spain . There were three clear narratives which were always going to be said about this game : ( 1 ) Spain are amazing and to question them is to question football itself ( 2 ) that Mark van Bommel and his Dutch compatriots are a bunch of cheating , talentless thugs ( 3 ) that Howard Webb was always going to have a good game <p> There is merit to the assumed position on ( 1 ) . Spain are an excellent side and Xavi and Iniesta are certainly two of the worlds best . However , this side is nowhere near as beautiful to watch , or as effective , as the 2008 side , which crucially had Marcos Senna in its ranks . ( 2 ) The physical approach of the Dutch has been massively overplayed by a media searching for a pantomime villain - in van Bommel , they found just that . Holland 's approach was physical but it was far from the kind of assault that the media would have you believe - football is a contact sport . Granted some of their tackles were mis-timed but I think that only the de Jong one merited a straight red ( it was inexcusable ) . Why is Puyol not similarly derided for his cynical foul on Arjen Robben ( who is oft criticised for diving yet stayed on his feet for once and got no just reward ) ? As for ( 3 ) , Webb got the Heitinga sending off wrong ( Iniesta took a tumble ) ; got the De Jong incident wrong ( should have seen red ) ; got the corner/goal kick decision wrong in the lead up to the Spanish goal wrong ; got the blatant foul on Elia in the build up to the goal wrong ( he was sandwiched ) ; and , all in all , struggled to cope with the occasion . If that was a good game , I 'd hate to see a poor one . He got nearly all of the key decisions wrong <h> Comment number 34 . <p> First off i would like to say that any person out there that is silly enough to write that Iniesta or Xavi are overrated , should really think about watching another sport , or if not should definately not make a habit of writing rubbish like that . <p> Were talking about 2 players who embarrassed Schweinsteiger last weekend , arguably one of the best midfielders of the tournament . A player who completely embarrassed Lampard and Barry a couple of weeks ago . <p> It makes you appreciate why Messi scores so many goals for barcelona , becasue you have Xavi and Iniesta passing and walking through teams . An example of a pass would be the one iniesta laid on last night for Fabragass one on one . Beautiful pass . <p> Their patient build up allows them to make passes like that . they wear people down , their movement within the spanish team ( All round ) pulls people out of positions , and the holes they leave Xavi and Iniesta drop balls in to . <p> Really , anyone that questions their ability must need the head looked out . We are not talking about players that do it over hackney marshes on a sunday . We are talking about players that continuously play at their level week in week out , and embarrass the worlds finest . <p> I cant believe some of the rubbish some people put on here , they really have no idea about football . <h> Comment number 35 . <p> Iniesta shoen way above Ronaldo , Rooney , Messi and Kaka at this World Cup ; all of these players were tipped to set the competition alight , but they did not succeed . Iniesta did . <p> Everyone goes on about how he and other players surrounded and hounded the referee as if it 's the first time it 's been done . Well , in reality , it 's not . You get it all over the place , unfortunately . There are some on here , who 's team and players they support have been culprits of doing exactly what they are criticising Iniesta for . <p> Basically , it 's alright when your own team does it , but not so good when someone else does it ! <h> Comment number 36 . <p> I live in Spain and follow the incredible Spanish football team .

I have literally just choked on my lunch at the second point . Xavi hernandez and Iniesta have utterly dominated games for thier sides , which is the cornerstone of their domination . Lamps just runs late into the box against mediocre opposition and Stevie couldnt hold a candle in terms of controling , passing and moving a ball . <p> Witness what these two have won over the past 4 years as opposed to both lamps and gerrard and you will see . 2 European cups , 2 spanish league titles , european championship and world cup plus the super cups they contest and the world club championship ........ now what have stevie g and lamps won ? ? ? ? ? 1 league title , fa cup and a league cup between them . <h> Comment number 39 . <p> ' On the news here this morning they mentioned that there is only one country in the whole world that are criticising this team , the UK ! ' <p> Huh ? ! The media in the UK are all lovey dovey over the Spanish team and negative over the Dutch team <p> Do n't believe everything you read/hear in the news/media ; ) <p> There was a article on here a few weeks ago with a interview with a German journalist , prior to the Germany-England game , and he was implying how out of the touch/out of sync the UK media are with the UK people . <p> Just because the media say something , does n't mean its what the people think <h> Comment number 40 . <p> The assertion that Heitinga " hauled down " Iniesta for the second yellow is an utter falsehood , to the point of wilful dishonesty . Iniesta took a blatant dive , the worst of many such moves on the night , and should have found himself on the receiving end of a yellow card once he stopped rolling around . Not only did this colour the final result ( remarkably even less deserving than Italy 's assault on sportsmanship throughout the previous campaign ) , but it 's also shown yet again that the BBC had a narrative written for the final a week ago and were determined to stick to it regardless of the result . Shameful . <h> Comment number 41 . <p> Nice tribute to Iniesta , Jonathon but is n't it always the way that the match-winner seems to garnish all the plaudits ? Reading up on stats of the game it appeared Xavi out-played Iniesta by quite a bit . Spain have certainly been blessed with central midfield talent in recent years in the likes of Guardiola , Xavi , Alonso , Iniesta and Fabregas but do you you notice that none of them are the big muscle men we all seem to crave in most of our teams in England especially in the centre of the park ? Maybe lessons to be learned ? <h> Comment number 44 . <p> I 'm sorry but we wo n't stop bringing up this point , as it is very IMPORTANT . <p> There is much more to being a football player than just skill , and for most British football fans , the spirit of how a game is played is equally important ( hence the number of Chelsea fans who despaired at Drogba 's continual diving/going to ground easily - read the 606 boards ! ) . Such great , talented players should n't need to dive ( and cheat ! ) <p> FIFA have , over the years , changed the game to remove the ' physical ' aspect of the game , mainly to protect players like Iniesta , Ronaldo and Robben , but have done nothing to stop the ' unsportsmanlike ' aspect of the game , which is mainly perpetrated by these exact same players ! <p> For me , its been a poor WC . Great atmosphere from the Africans , but ultimately spoiled completely by players diving to the ground at the slightest touch , constant shirt pulling , deliberate handballs , and card-waving by players . <p> It is NOT in the spirit of the game , and hopefully one day FIFA may learn from Rugby and allow the referees to move the point of the free-kick or foul 10 yds further on for all this bad-mouthing/card waving that the referees get . <h> Comment number 46 . <p> FoxForever : " Funny how people always spot the bad things about the good people . " <p> Didier Drogba , perfect example . Everyone know what he is capable of , absolutely no denying his talent . But he also has an extremely ugly side to his game that prevents many fans from truly embracing him . <p> To me , it 's a bit like spotting an incredibly beautiful woman at the bar but then seeing her get out a cigarette and start smoking ( when people could still smoke in pubs , of course ) . She 's clearly amazing but has a repulsive habit that stops you from *really* liking her . Clearly , a lot of 606-users are n't so selective with either their women or footballers ... but that 's how it works for me . I guess that means that in a bizarre way , Lionel Messi is the ideal woman . Wo n't dwell on that for too long but you see what I mean . <p> Incidentally , where Pompey fans are concerned it 's not " alright when your own team does it , but not so good when someone else does it ! " We take a dim view on players who dive and sulk when things are n't going well . Players like that never stick around for very long , thank goodness . <h> Comment number 47 . <p> Funny enough I think constant fouling to disrupt the rythem of the game is even more unsporting . The only team that did nt foul constantly against Spain was Germany , credit to them , even though they werent particularly adventurous <h> Comment number 48 . <p> Good point about Iniesta diving though , a prime example was that 10/10 swan dive he took when Van Der Wiel got booked towards the end of the match . I will never understand why that side of the game exists for them , they are already so good , do they really need it ? <h> Comment number 49 . <p> Hmmm .... how does a hand on ones shoulder for a fraction of a second makes a player throw his hands in the air arch his back and fall FORWARD rolling on the floor atleast twice ? ? ? Hmmmm ... If he was being held back should he not be falling backwards on his back instead of leaping forwards ? ? ? ... Iniesta .. So good defies the laws of physics lol <p> By the way do nt get me wrong he IS one of the greats , it may not have been a dive because there was contact , but he did make a lot of it lol . Hence way i was very pleased that Forlan was awarded the golden shoe/boot/slipper/sandal whatever it 's called ... Once again a jolly well done hurrah for Forlan lol <h> Comment number 50 . <p> well said cricketman . I really do n't understand all the criticism of Iniesta and Spain here . Ok so he dives every now and then which is bad but who really cares when they absolutely deserved to win . I 'm English and I am really getting fed up with people that saying Spain are boring champions and that last night 's game had no excitement . Even pundits are saying it , it 's just not true . So many of my friends who think they know about football and watch A LOT of the premier league say that passing it around like Spain do is boring . OK when it stays in their own half it can get a little bit tedious but seriously I think many people in this country have been so blatantly brainwashed by all the stupid sky sports bbc and itv hype about every UK team and the English " style " of play that it has led to intelligent people making underhanded jealous remarks about a team who is without a doubt ten times better than England . We really need to get some international perspective in this country and stop picking teenage pubic bully freaks for our academies . <h> Comment number 51 . <p> peggers123 spot on , could n't agree more with you . Nice to have someone talking some sense for once . Iniesta 's performance last night was one of the most intelligent shows i 've seen in years . Can believe some people refuse to appauld this guy and " say he passes it sideways " absolute rubbish . He embarrases some of the best teams in the world whenever he plays . He ability to find space against a team who put 9/10 men behind the ball for 120 mins was a joy to watch , cleverly finding little pockets of space , he must be amazing to play with always giving you an option even if he 's got a man up his backside cuz he can turn you and pop it back off first time . And oh the the worlds current best players , managers and pundicts saying how good he is , so these people are all wrong are they ? ? Plus i would be asking for cards if i got kicked for 2 hours solid . He was the best player on the pitch last night by a mile . FACT . And off the back of a season when he 's barely played due to constant knee injuries , including get injured right before the start of the world cup makes him even better . GROW UP and get real <h> Comment number 53 . <p> Iniesta stepped up where Spain 's strikers went missing , but this praise is a bit over the top . Without Xavi controlling midfield , Spain would 've capitulated long ago . Even Jonathan admits Iniesta lost the ball more times than not , but even in the difficult times Xavi was almost flawless . He and Casillas are underrated , if that 's possible , and the unsung heroes while everyone crowds around the goal-scorer . But I guess that 's part of the game . <h> Comment number 54 . <p> Got to say I think he is an amazing layer but one thing this world cup highlighted for me was quite how underappreciated Diego Forlan is over here . That includes by myself . <p> His game is so far removed from what he showed at United which we should have been able to assess from the scoring record he has in Spain but at this world cup he has shown that to be honest he is probably the finest out and out striker in world football with the ability to score from range and great reactions close in . <p> He actuallyreminded me a lot of Batistuta in the way he played , man of the tournament ! Fifa got that right unlike the Beeb <h> Comment number 56 . <p> Ye he may go around waving imaginary cards but so would I if one of my teamates had just had a boot stuck into his chest . As Guardiola said , he does n't need to score as many goals as he easily makes many more . They pass the ball alot in midfield but they do it better than anyone else in the world . Teams such as England and Italy could barely string a pass together . Least they still managed to play football even though they were getting kicked to shreds . <h> Comment number 57 . <p> Here here spot on mate ... mind you did you see the 17 goals he scored for united ? ? worth checking out on youtube .... unbelieveable goals ! ! ... Agree with the best striker in the world right now - past two seasons even . <h> Comment number 58 . <p> So you socre the winnig goal in the world cup final and your shot to instant imortality around the globe . Fiar enough really as football is fundamentally about socring goals and it does n't get much bigger than to score the winner in the world cup final to be honest , so fair play to Andres . And he is pretty damn good . <p> Now the plaudits will rain down on his large head and somewhat rightly so but this confirms what every avid fan has known for years , and many for the last decade , see your note of Guadriola 's comment when Inesta was merely 16 , that he is very much the real deal . <p> However what does get my goat is that his goal has overshadowed everythig else in this world cup . There is no way on god 's green earth that he was the best player in this tournament , and in general I think he had an average tournament by his standards , as did Spain as a whole . <p> To hear the BBC pundits ' cliched verbal dry humping of him after the final whistle was quite frankly embarrassing from a panel of so called neutral experts . They are like a bunch of housewives caught up in world cup fever professing total knowledge as they now understand the off-side rule and banging on as if they had just scouted inesta from a Sunday Pub league . <p> To laugh off Forlan 's deserved Godlen Ball in comparison to Inesta as he scored the winner is beyond a joke and they should be ashamed of their school boyish giggles . Forlan scored 5 goals for a very average , massively written off team and helped them to a 4th place finish . Mueller for Germany still has less than 10 caps for his country yet wins the golden boot at 21 . Ozil . Schweinsteiger . Sneijeder . Villa . Xavi and maybe even Robben all had better impacts on the tournament than Andreas Inesta . <p> However as I said before he did score the winner in the final but take off the tinters - these good articles on great players should be written in general instead of the subjective spasmodic tripe that we get with every day footballing BS . <p> Side note to Capello : Gernmay , Spain , Holland ... three of the top 4 in the world all play with ONE UP FRONT ! <h> Comment number 59 . <p> Whilst i do nt think Iniesta should be player of the tournament as he did nt carry Spain to the finals in the way Sneijder did for Holland who without Sneijder probably wouldnt have been there , i do still think Iniesta is a grand player . <p> Yes he s not perfect , he has his negative points , but his football is majestic . And those critisising him and Spanish players here , especially those saying Lampard and Gerrard are better - you remind me of the fat girl who keeps turning up at the X factor auditions , trying to convince the world she can sing ... <h> Comment number 60 . <h> Comment number 61 . <p> @28 -- Most of the comments here are negative , just like English fans . Most of the comments are by English people , since its an English website .. They play too much playstation . They want the likes of Walcott to come out of his nappy and start scoring hat-tricks every week . When he does n't they say he 's rubbish . If he scores a couple of goals in the first game of next season you will all say that he 's " redeemed himself " , he " will go on to rule the world " . The likes of iniesta , xavi , Alonso , villa , puyol etc etc gained reputations from around the age of 22/23 . In England you want all players to be like rooney . You expect it ! <p> Just to show how out of touch England fans are ..... you all thought you had a chance of winning the world cup ! ! ! ! <p> Forcing the ref to make a decision by going down under a light challenge is not cheating , asking for a card when someone has just gone studs up down the back of your leg is not cheating either . <h> Comment number 62 . <p> A very talented player but an incorrigible diver and incredibly unsporting , with his constant pleas to referees to send off opposition players . I ca n't admire a player who has such a cynical side.His passing is overrated too , it is nowhere near as good as Xavi or even Alonso or Frabregas . <h> Comment number 63 . <p> Iniesta has been brilliant for years , that is why on a visit to the Nou Camp I picked up his shirt rather than join the queue of people buying Messi shirts . It is an insult to the guy that the British media only pick up on him after he scores the winner in the WC final . <p> However , he is a bit of a diver , referee baiter , card waver etc. just as almost all Spanish-based players are . It is ingrained in their football culture just as much as the ' tika-taka ' or whatever it is being called now . <p> Last night ( after he was already booked ) he took out Van Bommel off the ball which could easily have given him a second yellow . <p> I am all up for applauding him as one of the world greats , but please do not ignore his ' darker ' traits . The media love to report on Rooney 's faults so please have the decency to be consistent across the board . <h> Comment number 65 . <p> Those readers who have stated above that the playing style of Spain in general and Iniesta in particular is somehow ' boring ' or impossible to watch : are you saying you want to see the kind of crash-bang-wallop 100 mph fare that is served up week after week in the Premier League ? It might be worth your while to consider just how effective this style is on the international scene . Yes , it is truly exciting and fascinating to watch , especially for a TV audience , which is most likely why the English Premier League is the most popular league in the world , and the one which generates the most revenue from broadcasting rights sold in foreign markets such as Asia . But look at the results for England at international level and the questions have to be asked : what type of player and/or playing mentality does it create ? <p> Honestly , how many players of a similar type to Iniesta ( ball-playing attacking midfielder more intent on making successful passes over any distance than smashing in 30-yard piledrivers ) do you think would be created by an English club 's academy in the current circumstances ? There are n't many that I can think of operating for top English clubs , in fact the one that stands out in my mind is a certain Paul Scholes . And why do you think Mr. Capello was so keen on coaxing him out of international retirement for this tournament ? If he has half the football brain required to be an international manager of his standing and reputation , he surely would have realised that the extremely direct , Premier League " lump it into the box " mentality would n't be nearly as effective at a World Cup as tiki-taka , whatever shortcomings that system may also have . <p> On a purely personal level , during this tournament Iniesta has gradually become my favourite player , certainly midfielder , to watch . Might be a sign of the times that it used to be Steven Gerrard . . . <h> Comment number 66 . <p> The media seem to be absoloutely falling over themselves in awe of Spanish football . Obviously they 're a great side , you do n't win the Euro and World Cup being a poor footballing side , but it 's really annoying that because of their so-called " beautiful football " journalists and pundits alike totally overlook their on-the-pitch antics . <p> Iniesta was " fouled , " then jumped up in a heartbeat and kicked van Bommel . Not one mention of this was made during or after the game , it 's like people are too scared to criticise anything the Spanish do because they play good possession football . The Dutch hardly played the cleanest of games but it does n't make the constant diving and crowding of the referee any more acceptable . Get a grip people and get off the tabloid bandwagon . <h> Comment number 67 . <p> ' are you saying you want to see the kind of crash-bang-wallop 100 mph fare that is served up week after week in the Premier League ? ... ' <p> Funny how people resort to the same old limited anti-PL/English comments whenever someone dares to criticise Spain . <p> Spain were far more entertaining &amp; attacking in Euro 08 and none of it resembled stereotypical PL football . <p> I hope Brazil go back to their more adventurous style ( a stereotypical Brazil style is adored by many and does n't resemble stereotypical PL style ) in the WC as that is the kind of entertainment and style i want to see at a WC from the big teams . <h> Comment number 68 . <p> I watch barcelona every week and to be honest I do nt see Iniesta dive at all . Typical of people who only watch 1 tournament then make a judgement . <p> Gazza was the nearest England came to an Iniesta type . <p> Xavi &amp; Iniesta are the best midfield partnership in club and world football . <p> I loved that analogy about fat girls from X factor . <p> Xavi , Iniesta , Busquets , Alonso , fabregas . . . England would like a midfielder just half as good as one of these . Spain manage to get them all very experienced by a young age . Iniesta is 26 , Busquets is 20 I think and Fab is 22 I think . . . . <p> name an English central Midfielder under 25 with more than 5 caps ? ? ? ? ? <p> Have you ever watched a rugby match ? ? ? Sorry but to say we ' routinely gouge each other 's eyes out ' is ridiculous - I played for 17 years and never saw this once , but of course please astound me and tell me I 'm wrong with your obvious ' in-depth ' knowledge of rugby ... <h> Comment number 75 . <p> OK , so entertaining football does n't necessarily mean Route 1 , I admit . But all the same , even if you think Spain 's playing style last night was a cure for insomnia , it clearly got results , as it had done throughout the tournament . My point was more about how England , with their faster , more direct play , did n't get anywhere near the results that Spain ended up with , and how some seem to think that going straight for the jugular is the best way for England to operate . It was n't very effective this year at any rate . <p> Anyway , I would like to know just why Spain are so dull to look at , it 's not like they " parked the bus " with 10 men behind the ball or anything . <h> Comment number 76 . <p> ' are you saying you want to see the kind of crash-bang-wallop 100 mph fare that is served up week after week in the Premier League ? ...

They took people by surprise to an extent . At the World Cup , every team parked the bus against them , but they beat them all ( except the now meaningless 1st game ) . This is a crucial distinction and one that I 'm surprised more people have n't picked up on . <p> That said , having read a lot of the comments on this and other blogs that have featured Spain , I should n't be surprised by the level of numbskullery shown by many . <p> I can understand why Spain wanted to get people booked in the final , because De Jong and Van Bommel should 've been in a UFC contest rather than a football pitch . <h> Comment number 77 . <p> @4 , 26 , et al.British TV pundits having rose tinteds WRT their favoured teams ? 1 . England in the world cup ( until they got knocked out ) 2 . Spain3 . Man Utd or Chelsea in PL 2010/2011 , depending on who is looking most likely to win.Nothing will ever change ! <h> Comment number 78 . <p> I think everyone is forgetting that the only reason Spain got to the latter stages is because of David Villa . He was the real star man for them , but people will obviously forget that because Iniesta scored the winner in the World Cup final . Had Torres scored the winner he would be hailed as an instant Spanish legend and noone would have cared about his poor form and the fact that Villa was miles better in the tournament . <h> Comment number 79 . <p> Iniesta is nothing without Xavi , but that does n't take away the fact he 's a brilliant , brilliant footballer . A lot of people seem to want to say negative things for the sake of it . And the diving thing ? What footballer , nowadays , does n't ? Unfortunately it 's become part of the game overall . Every player wants to win an advantage for their team , though I seriously doubt they might think ' okay , I can see an opposition player coming towards me , so I 'm going to dive ' . It 's just done on impulse , in a fast-paced , blurred moment . Think Suarez ' successful goalkeeping . That moment happened in the blink of an eye , again reaffirming my point that these things happen on un-thinking impulse . And as much as we may complain , of course they 're going to pester the Ref . How many people at various points in this tournament , or indeed watching any football , anywhere , have not screamed ' REFEREEEEE ! ! ! ' when a player they support has tumbled , however innocuously . <p> And for the love of God can everyone stop mentioning Rooney in the same breath as Messi and Kaka etc . He is categorically NOT in league with them . He looked bored and laboured in England 's matches . Capello got it all wrong . A team should be decided on who is on form . Not household names . Being left on the bench might give the incentive to work harder on the pitch . <p> Give credit to where it 's due . To Iniesta and Xavi who could run rings around England on their own . <p> As for the Dutch display last night ? I credit that to Octopus-induced anxiety . <h> Comment number 80 . <p> I think our own Stevie G could learn a lot from this man . His passing and movement are unquestionably second to none and not sure how he does it but the man simply does not give the ball away . He is the complete midfielder and i 'm glad the whole world now knows . <h> Comment number 81 . <p> All of the Spain players had a good tournamnet other than Torres . However Torres scored the winner in 08 and assisted last night so when it counts he will be in the history books . <p> Iniesta was quiet for the first few games but is always a joy to watch . Barcelona will never sell him . <p> i went to see Joe Cole play for West ham when he was 18 and he played just behind the front man , he looked like Iniesta plays now . Dropping short to get the ball , gliding past players , good with both feet , good skill . Then I remember Mourinho moving him to the left wing and making him do more work defensively that offensively , tehn all of a sudden he was playing left wing for Chelsea &amp; England . <p> For me he was the best English player of the last 15 years and his skill and imagination was booted out of him . Had he been spanish or brazilian he would of been encouraged to play in the middle and show his skills off . Learn England Learn . We would rather have 11 grafters than risk having a potential maverick in our team . <p> Wilshere is potentially that man but Im sure we will not see him for years and years because of one excuse or another <h> Comment number 82 . <p> people keep saying he is nothing without Xavi . . . . anyone who knows their history will remember that Iniesta cemented his place in teh first team at Barcelona when Xavi was out for 6 months many years ago . he made the midfield his own and ran teh show . <p> Yes they are better together but to say he is nothing without Xavi is ignorant . <h> Comment number 83 . <p> Good blog , it has everyone talking on here . You have to love football , it makes people have such strong opinions and its why I love the world cup . Iniesta and Xavi are a class apart than most of the midfielders at this world cup apart from mueller and schwiensteiger . With villa ... all three and puyol/casillas helped win Spain the cup but Spain are generally a great team who can keep the ball well all the time from back to front whereas Forlan had a lower standard of team and shone out so well . He deserves the golden boot ... just and Spain deserve to be champions by miles . <p> Generally all the players in the world cup dive and try to get players booked so he is no different to the others , it seems to be part of the game and has been for a long time now . Although the Spanish really did n't need to try and get the dutch booked they were doing a very good job of that themselves with some horrible tackles that were all intended to put Spain off there game . They still won though ... they are European and World champions , they are the best team in the world with some of the very best players in the world ... simple as . <h> Comment number 84 . <p> Well , it 's always a joy to watch him play . The partnership he has with Xavi is second to none . Unfortunately , in a world where people always look at those who score instead of those who mastermind , he wo n't win World Best Player - though he deserves it . <p> Also , I would like to state that I 'm greatly disappointed in Capello 's inability to play Lampard and Gerrard together to dominate midfield . To me , if Capello should have been able to do this , even Iniesta and Xavi partnership wo n't come close . I always wonder how can England have the best of midfielders and not dominate . Football is always won in the midfield and England has always fallen short of that . And until , this is sorted out , there is no way England can win a major trophy ! <p> **88;140;TOOLONG <p> Lagogo i cannt fanthom how you believe that Gerrard &amp; Lampard can dominate the midfield like Xavi &amp; iniesta , and to suggest that Capello should be able to do this in2years on the job with players who he only gets to train to gether for a maximum of 4days in a row ? Xavi 7 Iniest started developing their skills from the age of 11 , and play togethere week in week out for the same club , while Gerrard and Lamparf if you hve not realised play for different clubs.I sincerely do think the media hype reaaly got to you , for you to believe that " England have the best of midfielders " , in Gerrard &amp; Lampard , when the likes of Ronaldinho , Kaka , Ronaldo , are still very active footballers . One thing we should all have learnt from this wc is that , we certainly do not have great players , but we certainly have media-hyped ones . We do need a new mix of players who should be given the opportunity to play with freedom , and not go all out patronising the press with their cooked-up hype and stories , in other for us to get some pride back as a footballing nation <h> Comment number 86 . <p> ' At Euro 2008 Spain had a fit Torres and did n't have to play opponents who parked the bus in every single game . ' <p> Not really a good enough excuse , considering the talent they got . Secondly , Spain have put in plenty of good performances with the lone striker system in the past before WC , whether it be Villa or Torres . <p> Secondly , why play two holding midfielders against teams who you say park the bus ? ! <p> Thirdly , Spain of Euro 2008 only played with one holding midfielder , Senna . Spain of WC 2010 play with two holding midfielders , Busquets and Xabi . Also take into consideration , Xavi played deep as well , so making it a very conservative and passive three-man central midfield . <p> More to do with Spain 's tactics than opposition 's tactics as to why Spain are more conservative than Euro 2008 . <p> When playing the lone striker system in this WC , it was ridiculous how many times the striker was the only player in the box , whilst the three central midfield just played deep and offering no support to the front man . At Euro 2008 , Spain were more adventurous . Against Russia in Euro 2008 , in the second half , they played with the lone striker ( Villa was taken off injured ) with midfielders playing with more freedom and Spain were a lot more adventurous than the lone striker system that Del Bosque has used in WC . <p> Spain of Euro 2008 were far more attack-minded than Spain of WC 10 , mainly because of Del Bosque 's relatively more cautious use of the Spanish midfield <h> Comment number 87 . <p> I 'm sorry , he has one good touch in the game ( actually Fabregas did all the hard work ) and now he 's suddenly the best player in the World Cup ? Where was his brilliance through out the game ? He was barely there .... oh wait actually , did n't he dive ? It 's funny , when any other player does that , everyone , including media and pundits , hold it against them forever . But Iniesta is actually literally applauded for it ? Double standards much ? Actually that goes toward the whole Spanish team . Ramos got away with two fouls against Germany . Puyol got away with what he did to Robben . And when Heitinga clutched onto that players shirt for a fraction of a second , he gets sent off . And no , I 'm not a Dutch fan , I have not supported either of these teams . The media hype and praise of Spanish has disgusted me though . <h> Comment number 89 . <p> The plethora of Nazi like comments proclaiming that people cant have an opinion is frankly alarming ( you know who you are ) but the truth of the matter is , Iniesta has been a top player for many years now and im amazed that the media is only just waking up to it now . <p> You couldnt slide a ruler between Xavi and Iniesta when they marshal the Barcelona midfield and thats been the case for nearly 4 years now . <p> oh , and there was a comment about Lampard and Gerrard being as good as the above mentioned ? Thats hilarious . Neither player is half as good as these 2 top midfielders and deep down , we all know it . <h> Comment number 90 . <p> Completely agree , I know when you say " unsung " you do nt mean " unheard of " like some of the comments mean to think , simply that he does nt get the praise the likes of ronaldo and rooney get like been on every poster , advert and piece of merchandise going . Id level Iniesta with Messi as the best player in the world , and these are the sorty of players we need to set as role models for the next generation of footballers coming through . <p> This world cup has proven what I have said for a long time , Wayne Rooney is good , perhaps very good , but he isnt even close to world class , no matter what the FIFA games and sky pundits would have you believe ... <h> Comment number 91 . <p> I do n't see why people have to reply back to criticism of something non-English by resorting to criticising England/PL . Just take it as what it is , a criticism about Spain , not a criticism about Spain because England is better ! <p> I found it boring at times , mainly because of the conservative nature of their central midfield . Were n't ambitious enough , Spain . Spain like to play the game centrally , but they were n't that attack-minded with it . <h> Comment number 92 . <p> Iniesta has been one of the best players in the world for years , it did not need this world cup to make people realise this . Or maybe it did for those who only watch the premiership . <p> Iniesta was brilliant last night so to say he did nothing is showing that u either did not watch the game or u have no understanding of the role he plays in the team . <p> Spain might line up on paper with 2 defensive midfielders but they interchange so much throughout the game taht its impossible to tie them down to a formation . <p> Spain won the world cup by being more cautious than in 08 , yes thats true but what does that say for them . . . it says they can play defensive or offensive and still win , What does it say for other teams . . . that they cant keep up with this generation of Spain players <h> Comment number 94 . <p> Im surprised that no one has pointed to the impact that Fabregas had on the game . Although Spain had recovered possesion in the second half it wasnt until his introduction that they started to pose a genuine goal threat . <h> Comment number 95 . <p> " This world cup has proven what I have said for a long time , Wayne Rooney is good , perhaps very good , but he isnt even close to world class , no matter what the FIFA games and sky pundits would have you believe ... " <p> At last someone has said it . Rooney is overhyped and showed it at the world cup . very good in a strong united team but only very good and this was shown by World player of the year award for 2010 - where was Rooney . . . . . <h> Comment number 98 . <p> Spain are a brilliant team , and Iniesta is an incredible player , and both fully deserved the result . <p> Spain have come up against teams in 2008 who did nt know what to expect and dismantled them , and teams who knew what to expect so parked the bus , and still dismantled them . No tactic has worked against spain in the last 3 years , and that is echoed by their results . There is no way of stopping Spain , because of how comfortable every single player is in possesion . They are not the quickest side , but because their control is instant , and their passing so accurate , and movement so untrackable , they beat all comers . <p> Their defence should be applauded too . only conceded 2 goals all tournament . Pique and Puyol have been immense in defense , as has busquets and alonso protecting them . Ramos and Capdevilla have been solid in defense and also add something in attack . Every outfield player closes the opposition down when they have the ball , limiting the oppositions possession , and maximising theirs . they all work extremely hard , and fully deserve it . <p> As for the diving and imaginary card waving , name a big team that does nt do that at club level ? and havnt done it for years ? Man Utd , Chelsea , Arsenal , Liverpool , Man City , Real Madrid , barcelona , Atletico Madrid , Benfica , Inter Milan , Fiorentina , AC Milan . all big teams with the best players in the world playing for them and they all do it . Yet suddenly Spain are the bad guys for it . <h> Comment number 99 . <p> Oh what dribble . Many people have been saying it . Jeez , theres more people saying it than people saying anything to contrary on the 606 boards . But hey , some people seem to think what the media says is what the majority of people think <p> ' this was shown by World player of the year award for 2010 - where was Rooney . . . . . ' <h> Comment number 100 . <p> spain without Iniesta is what happened in the confederation cup ........ Iniesta is soo good , u do nt see it , his personality and his looks do nt look like a player , yet he run through defenders like a sickler who has drunk some magic powers , for me he is Up there with Ronaldo brazil , better than Xavi , Xavi is mostly playing beautiful on a comfortable spot , and Iniesta dare run into enemies line , dazzling them ... look how he is constantly moving the ball inside defenders ...... in Ghana we call him the professor <h> About this blog <p> Hi , I 'm Jonathan Stevenson , but you might know me as Stevo from the live texts .

This landscape has a cutting edge . <p> There are two exhibitions this summer , in the vicinity . There is Familiar Visions at the Towner Art Museum in Eastbourne . It concentrates on his Sussex works , alongside the photography of his son , James Ravilious ( 1939-99 ) , taken in Devon . And then there are his Ravilious Woodcuts at Charleston , the well-known Bloomsbury farmhouse . Both shows have a too narrow focus . <p> The son 's photographs are dull .

These scenes declare forlorn , hopeless , gone . Fair enough . But if there had n't been any connection with the father , who would care ? <p> And as for Eric 's woodcuts , these images are very high craftsmanship , but again they are minor creation . They are essentially book-plate emblems , with at best an antiquarian charm . They are heavily blacked in , decorative , heraldic , cramped and neat . The figures are wooden .

So is this a modernist scene ? Well , it is and it is n't . The land is almost cast in abstract or geometrical forms . There are echoes of Paul Nash , and he learnt from him . <p> You can imagine the landscape shaped into solid hummocks , in which everything is rounded and reduced , and using the modernist language . But Ravilious ' views are never quite streamlined or cut out . The profiles of the hillside are sensitive . The gentle slopes are particularised . You can feel along the horizons ' edge . <p> Or take The Wilmington Giant , one of his chalk figures series , cut into the hillside . Perhaps there 's a suggestion of a real deep ancient power , with a ritual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a touristic attraction . Ravilious does n't seem to worry either way . He 's more interested again in play -- between the broad , smooth uniformity of a view and the chaos of minute detail . <p> See the black barbed wires and the rusty fences , strung across the grass and sky . These knotted , twining , wiggling lines crawl over the landscape -- and make a contrast , too , against the fat white rounded drawing of the hill figure . Elsewhere , there are telegraph poles with lines running across the skies . Or in the earth , there can be similar marks , in threaded ruts , curves , kinks . The contours are peacefully pregnant : against them , there are bits of jagged stuff , trash , junk . <p> In nature itself , Ravilious puts smooth against rough . The broad soft land is dotted with spikiness . He seldom shows branches thickly filled with leaves . He prefers bare twiggy trees sticking up . And for a quite different smooth-rough effect , look at Beachy Head . The dominant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the middle of the white cliff , a long zigzag edge snaps off . <p> Of course , there is nothing alien in these views . There is nothing troubling , in terms of strong realism or streamlined modernism or weird hauntings . This world is perfectly homely . But there is a kind of fiction here , suggesting characters . The Waterwheel , for instance , holds an individual . At the front of the scene there 's a piece of machinery -- tall , upright , solitary , spare -- a kind of pylon , turning and catching the wind . It is a standing figure , with a determined head . <p> And there is also a more subtle individual . The whole background is a recumbent character , a complex dance of interweaving fields , rising up , dipping and swelling , almost like origami . Likewise , there is the dance of Cuckmere Haven . This river sits flat and wide in its valley , a convoluted , undulating bending-winding channel of the waters . With its sharp s-edges , it 's like the elaborate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face . <p> Most of Ravilious ' views are man-made -- including fences , machines , buildings , clumps of trees , posts , roads , waterways , ploughs , fields . And even when they 're not , these entities are very clear , very shaped , and like something from a story-book . That 's to say , these elements of a scene are almost personified . It is a trim and innocent vision . <p> But then there is another else , another dimension , simultaneous with his images and his shapes . It emanates from the making of his painting . It 's the subliminal presence of his work , whose effect is all over -- and it 's something intense , radiant . It 's the way that most of these watercolours are created out of streaks . They 're scored , striated , cross-hatched in separated paint strokes . The world is never blurred and never solid . <p> You can feel it as breathing , the ventilation of this surface coming through . Or you can see it as brightness breaking out , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very subdued colours , drab , stone , moss , of course , and they 're beautiful , but they 'd be tasteful if they were fully filled in . The streaks open out these colours , and illuminate them . But more than that , these streaks give a sense of cut , fracture , incision . The grain goes through it like a knife . There is a hint of violence . <p> The landscape , the ground itself , is not made of substantial earth , but of air and light . And maybe you may say that here 's a revelation on the Downs , another familiar English vision . But the technique has an extra turn . The white page is there . It lies visibly beneath the image . It appears through the scene from behind . This landscape is thin , see-through and vulnerable . One expects mother-nature Sussex to be lovable and safe . The surprising thing is , it 's not . There is a fierceness in his painting . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @

@@1560234 <h> You are here : <h> Solomon Kane DVD review <h> Just how good is Michael J. Bassett 's Solomon Kane ? Duncan gives ten reasons why you should own the movie on DVD ... <p> As my third anniversary writing for Geek fast approaches , it would appear that Solomon Kane is the first film I 've ever reviewed twice ( the first review can be found here ) , which , in itself , has proved to be an interesting challenge . <p> Whenever I find myself reviewing a film , I can get incredibly caught up in my own head about judging a film based on the first emotional reaction I have to it , as circumstance can make all the difference to how it 's perceived , such as a bad day at work , good news , the weather , or even alcohol . Yet , there it is afterwards in print , for the whole world to see . <p> So , along comes Solomon Kane again , a film that I praised so highly at the start of the year . It also proved to be an inspiration to me , after a small discussion took place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but more on that soon . And how has the film faired after a second viewing ? Outstandingly , I 'm relieved to say . <p> I now officially love Solomon Kane , so here are ten good reasons why I think you might too : <p> James Purefoy <p> Purefoy , in my opinion , is still far too underappreciated . Sometimes I seem to develop an affinity for actors before I 've even seen them in that much on screen . For example , when I heard that Viggo Mortensen had been cast as Strider , I was convinced he 'd be perfect , despite mostly going on his small part in the incredible Walkenfest that is The Prophecy . ( I 'd prefer not to mention Daylight or G.I. Jane . ) <p> So when casting for a new Bond came around , the same thing happened with my support for James Purefoy , this time based on a small part in A Knight 's Tale ( and forgetting Resident Evil ) . He did n't get the role that time around , but I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is every bit the grizzled hero , managing to embody the vicious and the heroic in equal measure . Purefoy shares a commentary with the director on the DVD , as well as appearing on a ' making of ' feature/being interviewed alone , in all of which he comes across as incredibly likeable and dedicated to his character . The enthusiasm he has for Kane is obvious , so when he talks about making more of the films , I ca n't help but agree that it should happen . <p> The soundtrack <p> Going back to the 80s again ( as is so often my way ) , movies certainly never lacked for a decent theme tune . John Williams aside , just take a moment to think about films like Willow , The Last Starfighter and , of course , Hawk The Slayer , and there was always a rousing theme tune behind them , something to get the blood pumping and to convey an epic and heroic journey . <p> A hero 's theme tune is sorely lacking from a lot of contemporary films . Just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a respectable film adaptation , but stripped of the cartoon TV series ' catchy intro music . In Solomon Kane , Klaus Badelt redresses the balance , presumably drawing on his previous experience scoring Pirates of The Caribbean ( no harm in mentioning Equilibrium here either ) , giving the entire film exactly what it needed . <p> Badelt gets his own six and a half minute feature on the DVD , in which he nicely ties in to my above point by saying that he looked at Purefoy 's performance and eyes to get most of his inspiration for the music . <p> The look <p> Whenever a film has a more modest budget , it 's important to make sure that it looks as realistic as possible , so location scouting and set building can really make or break how a film is perceived . What amazed me about Kane the second time around is how fantastic it looks from start to finish ( one CGI beastie excluded ) , making the whole period feel so much richer . <p> It helps that director Michael J. Bassett chose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the temperature , resulting in Purefoy telling how the combination of rain on a freezing cold day actually froze him to the spot , mid-movement , during the climatic final battle . <p> Proper monsters <p> There can never be enough monsters in a fantasy movie for me , be they the Uruk-hai and Orcses in The Lord Of The Rings , to the squealing , slug headed Slayers from Krull . Director Bassett utilizes his background in horror movies to deliver us a masked rider , some demonic zombie types and even , in one scene , a witch that might just as well have worn an ' I love Evil Dead ' t-shirt such was its obvious homage to Sam Raimi . <p> There are more monsters than mentioned above in the film , so you never can tell what Kane will encounter next on his journey , but having seen a glimpse of what could lie in store for future films , consider me hooked . <p> The emotive impact <p> Unusually for a film of its type , Solomon manages to produce a couple of especially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scene in particular losing its impact the second time around , or perhaps from not being seen on a cinema screen , but it remained as brutal as I remembered . <p> If anything , upon the second viewing I was more invested from the start , so found myself getting pre-emptively excited about some scenes before they happened and rooting for Kane from the start , which is n't , perhaps , ideal when he 's a cold blooded murderer to begin with . <p> The direction <p> That this is only Bassett 's third feature film is quite impressive . I 've seen both Wilderness and Deathwatch that came before , enjoying both despite some flaws , but the leap from those two productions to Kane is quite substantial . His direction seems so assured now that his love for the material has clearly taken his work to the next level , as the larger cast , more epic scale adventure , action and spectacle ( including the CGI work ) , made me go back to check he had n't directed more films . <p> According to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and stars Jeffrey Dean Morgan . While I 'm on the subject of Morgan , though , I really ca n't recommend The Losers enough after it vanished without a trace at the cinemas , a travesty when the film was so much fun and when the woeful Prince Of Persia made infinitely more money . Since both Bassett and Morgan seem to be on the rise I ca n't wait to see how the film turns out . <p> The special features <p> Now that 's always a good reason to own a DVD , especially anything with substantial effects or make up , and there is plenty of insight on the disc , even if some are a little short and fragmented . <p> There 's the commentary with Bassett and Purefoy , a standalone commentary from Bassett , as well as a trailer , video introduction by Michael J Bassett , The Making Of Solomon Kane and Special Effects : The Creation Of The Fire Demon features , artworks by Greg Staples , interviews with producers Samuel Hadida and Paul Berrow , director Michael J Bassett , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scene : Cave Fight and a Montage Clip , and who does n't love a montage ? <p> The re-watch value <p> In desperation to get this review done on time ( which failed in the end due to some life hiccups ) , I ended up putting it on late on a Sunday night , which meant my better half lasted all of ten minutes before passing out . Upon waking up half an hour later , she apologised and said she really wanted to see it properly from the start , so would I mind going back . In my keenness to finally share the film with someone , I did exactly that , but what amazed me was how easy it was to watch the beginning again and how quickly the time passed . I even spotted a minor detail I 'd missed only half an hour before . <p> Back when I saw it at the cinema , I was keen to show it to a lot of my friends , but the rare occurrence above means that I 'll no doubt be happy to watch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cinema you could all come round tonight , but alas , maybe one day . <p> Proper violence <p> Oh , yes indeed . With the potentially spectacular The Expendables out in a month ( at long last ) , there 's no better time to celebrate a love of 80s-style cinematic violence , and Kane seems to ooze with it . In the ' Cave Fight ' deleted scene , Bassett reveals that he loved the scene but could n't find a way to work it into the narrative , and more 's the pity . It 's shown during the stylised end credits , but is a rarity amongst deleted scenes , one which is sadly missing from the main film . <p> Still , there 's plenty of limb loppage and sword swinging in the final edit , so I ca n't really complain . <p> I want more <p> Yes , I know it 's hardly a critical point , but allow me a little moment of selfishness . There simply are n't enough films like this being made , so unless we support them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ substandard blockbusters , while all the interesting films fall by the wayside . As one of our readers , capt1tens0 , stated at the end of my cinematic review , " I 'd much rather watch 100 Solomon Kanes over most of the tepid action/sci-fi/fantasy shit coming out of Hollywood .

But as our belts have tightened in the current economic climate , brands have responded in different ways ; some have upped their prices to accommodate rising production costs , others have slashed them in an attempt to keep themselves afloat . <p> But H&amp;M has chosen to occupy the middle ground . It has stuck to its guns and kept true to its catchphrase : " Fashion and quality at the best price " . The famous red H&amp;M logo speaks of a singular place , where you can either pick up a lurex jumpsuit , or stick to a five-pack of white pants ; you might even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ queue who is more than 20 years your junior or senior . But you know that you can rely on the label and , whether you call it by its acronym or the more traditional " Hennes " , the brand is likely to occupy a solid and reliable place in your heart . <p> H&amp;M 's company HQ is in Stockholm , a city where even the most ordinary looking person is astonishingly beautiful or cool . Head of design Ann-Sofie Johansson is , unsurprisingly , both . " At the beginning , it was only ' fashion at the best price ' but several years back , we added the term ' quality ' , " she says . Johansson is dressed impeccably in this season 's putty tones : trousers from H&amp;M , a blouse from sister brand Cos , and rather flashier loafers by Miu Miu . " We 're working really hard on that and we always have the customer as the focus . Our goal is to satisfy them with great collections every year . " <p> The " collections " that Johansson refers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ autumn/winter stereotypes ; rather , H&amp;M operates on the basis of constantly shifting stock , introducing new pieces throughout the season , according to customer reception and demand , as well as more transient influences such as which celebrities are wearing what . In the workrooms at the company 's Stockholm HQ , designers and pattern-cutters are already working on the spring/summer 2011 collection , which will be in the shops this time next year . <p> " We do n't want to dictate fashion , " continues Johansson , " we just want to be a source of inspiration , to allow our customers to dress the way they want to dress . " This sort of democracy is integral to the chain 's success . Since 2004 , the store has also collaborated with globally recognisable designers , including Karl Lagerfeld , Stella McCartney and Comme des Gar ? ons , on capsule collections that have sold out in frenzied scenes of speed shopping . Earlier this year , it worked with Jimmy Choo to produce a range of styles starting at ? 70 -- more than the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but about a tenth of the price of the real thing . <p> " We think that good design should n't be a question of money , " says Johansson . " We want to be an including company . " So far , so Swedish . The company started life in the city of Vasteras , right in the centre of the country , as a family business called Hennes in 1947 ; the " M " came along when founder Erling Persson bought gentlemen 's outfitters Mauritz Widforss in 1968 , and began producing mens- and childrenswear . There are now over 2,000 stores worldwide , with concessions opening this year in Israel and South Korea . Persson 's son Stefan -- who was born the year the first Hennes opened -- is a major shareholder in the company and remains chairman of the board , while his son Karl-Johan Persson is the CEO . It is company policy to hire internally and to promote employees from shop floor to boardroom , so many of those in the upper ranks have done their time in the changing rooms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with H&amp;M began in 1976 , when London became the first city outside Scandinavia to have its own store ; today there are 167 outlets in the UK , which last year generated almost ? 700m alone out of a near ? 2bn global profit for the company . The Arcadia group , which owns high-street rivals Topshop and Miss Selfridge , announced profits of ? 213.6m over a similar period . <p> Equally , while many companies whose remit was affordable fashion were threatened by the emergence of Primark at the beginning of the decade , H&amp;M 's strategy of using disparate suppliers for ease and speed of distribution and its policy of keeping down costs by not owning any of their own factories meant they were in a position to offer similar prices to the budget giant , while maintaining quality . " H&amp;M 's focused international expansion strategy has kept its expenditure inflation in check , " explains Luca Solca , an analyst at Sandford C Bernstein . <p> H&amp;M 's system of fashion works by filtering high-end design into even its most basic , egalitarian ranges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are known as " trend " pieces -- challenging or directional garments that might tempt only the most fashion-forward customers . Sales of these are monitored , and if they are well-received , they go back into production at a greater number so that a broader base of consumers can try them out . The middle of the triangle is then made up of recognisable and popular trends , while the bottom is a vast collection of T-shirts , vests and black trousers , the sorts of things which are produced every season and which are bought unfailingly . <p> " It 's good to try things out , " Johansson tells me , " If you see that something is popping up , but you do n't know how big it will be , it goes to fewer shops and we see if there is a demand . " Recent success stories of this ilk include an oversized shirt in pale pink with shoulder pads , several versions of ponchos and some " trashed " ripped skinny jeans . Next season 's likeliest sell-outs are a leather-edged camel coat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recently , the more uniform-looking pieces have done well , " says Johansson . " It was a very small trend and it has grown . We get selling figures on each specific garment , so we can follow the selling closely and react very quickly . " <p> And reacting quickly , despite lead times of over a year for upcoming collections , is key to H&amp;M 's dominance . Their in-house designers do n't go to the international shows , but they do follow style blogs and cult television ; the design studio in Stockholm is home to a vast " inspiration library " , where books on Bauhaus architecture sit alongside a Beatles annual and cartoon strips about dinosaurs . Dotted around are mood boards decorated with pages torn from shoots in magazines , archive photographs and street style shots ; next to them are storyboards for collections , with evocative phrases like " New England " and " Carnaby " and swatches of materials pinned to them to illustrate patterns , prints , colours and themes . Trend co-ordinator Catarina Midby sits in the midst of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an ethical , organic cotton collection called ' Nature Calling ' , " she explains , " but the fashion level was not right -- it was more about sustainability than fashion . We had specific dyes and unbleached cotton , but nobody bought it . " Since then , H&amp;M has become the fifth biggest buyer globally of organic cotton , which they blend with ordinary cotton in most pieces they sell without flagging it up , sensing the ambivalence that shoppers have for anything labelled " eco " or " green " , which is often seen as either overpriced or a bit naff . " We see it as helping customers make a better choice , " Midby says . " We choose not to charge extra for the organic cotton we use , because we want to democratise sustainable fashion just like we try to democratise design . " <p> The goal is to increase the amounts of organic cotton used each year for the next five years by 50 per cent , and , by 2020 , for all cotton to come from a sustainable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explains Midby , is that there are not currently enough suppliers making anything like the amounts such a company of H&amp;M 's size needs . <p> High-street brands can no longer afford to ignore trade and welfare issues .

" We play a leading role in the fashion industry and no one would expect a company as big and successful as us to take responsibility , " says Jorgen Andersson , head of branding . " But we do n't want to be like McDonald 's . For the next generation , we want sustainability and environmental and social awareness to be just something that everyone does .

On arrival , visitors will collect a magnetic board on to which they stick magnetic tiles depicting the pieces they wish to purchase .

It contains children 's titles , which adults adore ; films that are joyful , but laced with grown-up darkness . Many Lasseter movies also break established protocol . Wall-E , an Oscar-winning love story about a robot , contains barely a word of dialogue . Last year 's Up used an elderly man as its protagonist . US film-goers struggled even to pronounce the title of Ratatouille . Now we have Toy Story 3 . While this year 's other big summer movies have largely flopped , it is casually surpassing expectations , making $348m in the US . The New York Times 's critic , along with many others , sprinkled the word " genius " through his write-up . In this newspaper 's review , Pixar was described as " the saviour of family entertainment " . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A self-confident man , who applies the logic of an infant to the complex problems of film-making and is prone , when discussing work , to making statements of the obvious sound groundbreaking ( " if you think something 's stupid , it probably is " or " I try to make pictures I would want to see " ) , he sees no reason why a movie under his control should be less than brilliant . <p> To understand what makes him tick , go to Pixar 's headquarters , a glass and brick complex in Oakland , California , where fresh-faced staff play air hockey and ping pong , or go around on roller skates and scooters , and drink subsidised chai lattes because , in the words of guides , they 're just " creative people " . Lasseter built it in his own image , creating a place which people like him -- clever , enthusiastic and obsessed with toys -- would never want to leave . Each Pixar film takes four years to complete , during which it is constantly refined and re-refined . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pixar rendered water quite beautifully . In Monsters , Inc , it did the same thing with fur . Up 's helium balloons took one man a year to perfect . He believes in making state-of-the-art technology sing . Even his wedding photos were shot in 3D . <p> Lasseter 's creative process is uniquely collegiate . Like any medium in which hundreds of employees toil on tiny portions of an overall product , animation can feel disjointed . Its creators develop tunnel vision . Lasseter therefore forces them to endure constant peer review . A " brain trust " of roughly a dozen top staffers meets every few months to review every work in progress . <p> This is n't necessarily a happy process . " Is John Lasseter always Mr Nice Guy ? Of course not , " says David A Price , who wrote The Pixar Touch , a history of the firm . " Plenty of directors have been fired when he did n't think they were delivering . Jan Pinkava created Ratatouille , but was moved aside for Brad Bird . Lasseter himself took over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he looks , he 's always got the needs of the studio firmly in mind . " <p> The hard work and occasional upheavals create a very identifiable " type " of hit movie . In his office , Lasseter keeps a picture of Dumbo , his favourite classic Disney film , and perhaps the soppiest . His films revolve around emotion . Toy Story 3 , in which Andy , the owner of Buzz Lightyear , is leaving home for university , touches on familiar Lasseterian themes : growing up , separation and the transience of human existence . <p> He 's been working at this art for as long as he 's been alive . John Alan Lasseter spent his childhood , in Whittier , California , rising before dawn to watch classic Disney films , and sketching furiously on notepaper supplied by his art teacher mother . After school , he won a scholarship to the animation course at the California Institute of the Arts , and later a graduate job at Disney . <p> His big break , famously , came soon afterwards . After seeing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tron , Lasseter became convinced that it represented the studio 's future . With fine disregard for protocol , which dictated that new Disney staffers should keep their heads down for years , he pitched a CG film project at his bosses . They promptly fired him . As a result , in 1984 , Lasseter found work at a technology offshoot of George Lucas 's business empire devoted to making computers and software in the CG field . His role was to make short films which could showcase the creative potential of the company 's equipment . One of the first was about a desk lamp called Luxo , which is now Pixar 's mascot . <p> In its first decade , the firm ( which became Pixar after being sold to Steve Jobs ) made critically acclaimed but commercially unviable short films and sold very few computers . It burned through $50m of investor 's cash . But after the short film Tin Toy , about a child 's toy which comes to life , won an Oscar in 1988 , Jobs decided to turn it into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , made $350m and became 1995 's biggest hit . <p> The rest is history . When Disney bought Pixar in 2006 , they paid $7.4bn , making Lasseter a wealthy ( and powerful ) man . Since then he 's divided his time between Pixar HQ in Oakland and Disney 's in Burbank , Los Angeles , where he is attempting to reinvigorate the old studio 's fortunes . <p> So far at Disney , which is arguably now his main endeavour , he 's had mixed success . A 3D animation , Bolt , faltered at the box office . So did The Princess and the Frog , a hand-drawn cartoon critics loved but audiences hummed about . Much now rides on Tangled , next summer 's Disney reworking of the Rapunzel story . Critics have even quietly carped that Pixar , though still their darling , has too many sequels on its slate , and must guard against complacency . But Lasseter , who recently signed on to co-direct Cars 2 at his old firm , will most likely let his films do the talking . Can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Who knows . He 'll certainly have fun trying . <p> A life in brief <p> Born : 12 January 1957 , Hollywood , California . <p> Family : Son of Jewell Mae , an art teacher , and Paul Eual Lasseter , a parts manager at a Chevrolet dealership . His mother 's profession contributed to his growing preoccupation with animation . <p> Career : Worked as an animator at Walt Disney Feature Animation . Then moved to Pixar , where he directed Toy Story , A Bug 's Life , Toy Story 2 and Cars . <p> He says : " We make the kind of movies we want to see .

@@1561233 <p> After decades of bending atoms around giant rings and smashing them apart in search of the secrets of the universe , scientists at Cern , the European particle physics laboratory outside Geneva , are reviving a 1960s technology and going straight . <p> Their latest ring , the 27km Large Hadron Collider ( LHC ) , only got up to speed in March , yet physicists meet in Paris this week to discuss plans for a new $6.7bn ( ? 4.4bn ) experiment -- the International Linear Collider ( ILC ) , which they hope to start building in 2012 . <p> The new machine will be a straight-line tunnel , 31km long , and will use super-conducting magnets to accelerate electrons and positrons , their antimatter equivalents , towards each other at close to the speed of light . <p> " To explore what the LHC discovers in more detail , you need an electron collider , " says Professor Brian Foster , the European director of the ILC project . Part of the report to the Paris conference will be " a blueprint for how you would set up an ILC lab " . More than 700 people at 300 laboratories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accelerator . The only other high-energy linear electron smasher is the Stanford Linear Accelerator in California , a 3.2km track built in 1962 . <p> Both the existing LHC and the planned ILC are trying to solve fundamental physics questions , including -- what happened in the Big Bang ? Where did all the antimatter go ? How many dimensions does space have ? Why are there so many different sub-atomic particles ? And , most famously , what does a Higgs particle look like ? <p> While the 12 subatomic components of matter have all been found , including quarks and neutrinos , the Higgs has proved more elusive . The leading theory of how the universe works says that the Higgs gives matter mass , and therefore gravity . Its discovery could point the way to unifying the two great 20th-century theories of physics -- quantum and general relativity . <p> It may also help solve the mystery of the missing 96 per cent of the universe .

The extra mass needed to keep them together is thought to be hidden in as yet undiscovered " dark matter " . <p> Although a location for the new device has not been decided , Cern is a likely contender , if only because most of the physicists who might want to use it are already there , along with the infrastructure they need . <p> Cern 's LHC uses protons made from atoms of the lightest element , hydrogen , by stripping off their electrons in a strong magnetic field , and accelerating them to 99.9999991 per cent of the speed of light . <p> By the time they enter the LHC , Einstein 's equation , E=mc2 , is in play . Since the protons ca n't be made to go any faster , pumping additional energy in makes them more massive . In the LHC , they can be pushed to 7 trillion electron volts . When two beams , rotating in opposite directions , cross , the energy released from a single pair could be as high as 14 TeV . <p> But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like colliding two oranges together at 45mph , " says Professor Foster .

Typically , only one quark from each proton in a collision will hit head on , while the other four will miss each other . <p> Worse , although scientists know how much energy they 've put into each proton , they do n't know how it is distributed between the pips . One quark could have most of it , or all three could have roughly equal amounts . At best , researchers can tell the maximum amount of energy a collision might involve . Still , the LHC produces billions of bangs a second so they know roughly what energy levels give them interesting results . <p> But for a more precise exploration of the high-energy frontier , they will need the ILC . Electrons are 2,000 times smaller than protons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two of them run into each other , the energy released is known exactly . <p> But electrons are not perfect . When particles are bent by magnetic fields , they emit X-rays . For relatively massive protons , this is not a problem , but for the lighter electrons it 's a huge obstacle . Most of the energy pumped into an electron in the LHC would merely replace that lost to radiation . <p> And so , scientists are returning to the linear design of half a century ago . The exact specifications will have to wait until the LHC has identified which energy ranges are of interest , but the ILC as envisioned will have energy levels of around 0.5TeV . <p> Construction of the new accelerator is expected to take seven years . No one would be surprised if , during that time , plans emerge for an even more powerful , next-generation accelerator .

He was recently named the most powerful figure in the art world by ' Art Review ' and has been the co-director of exhibitions at the Serpentine Gallery since 2006 . He lives in west London <p> Christian is not only a true visionary , he 's always had an incredible generosity to new artists -- something I experienced first-hand when I was 17 , on a school trip to Paris . I was just a teenager who was obsessed with art ; I had some free time , so I contacted Christian and went to see him . <p> I knew I wanted to do something with art , possibly in a curatorial role , but was n't sure what yet . He took a whole afternoon to talk to me and it was a revelation that changed my life . He really changed my view on what an exhibition could be -- beyond objects on a museum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exhibitions that invent a new rule of the game , " which I think about almost every day when I do exhibitions . <p> I went to see him quite regularly after that , and five years later I curated my first show , with the idea of doing it in an unexpected location -- my kitchen . Christian was adamant that he wanted to be involved ; his support gave me immense courage , and it was very successful , so we did another show , this time exhibiting some of his works at a monastery in St Gallen , Switzerland , where I was living at the time . <p> Christian was a big influence in my decision to move to Paris shortly after , where I stayed for the next 10 years .

Our latest project builds on an archive of heartbeats Christian has taken from all over the world . In the West , death has become invisible ; we never directly confront it -- but Christian 's work makes us think about mortality ; it has influenced the way I live my life . I have a sense of urgency -- I do everything I can today . <p> We have intense conversations , but never about our personal lives , as there are too many unrealised dreams to pursue .

In the CV , Clark claims to have enlisted in the Household Cavalry on his 17th birthday , which would have been three weeks before VE Day . Mrs Clark told the newspaper : " We never discussed how he managed to sidestep national service . But I come from an army family -- my father was a colonel and my grandfather a brigadier .

@@1567238 <h> Agatha Christie : The curious case of the cosy queen <p> No enemy can murder Agatha Christie . From India to France , her mysteries sell by the million . As crime buffs gather in Harrogate to investigate her lasting appeal , Andrew Taylor presents his defence <p> Thursday 22 July 2010 23:00 BST <p> We know whodunnit but not how . The curious case of Agatha Christie remains the great unsolved mystery of crime fiction . It is relatively easy to understand why we continue to read the work of Edgar Allan Poe or Arthur Conan Doyle , or for that matter Wilkie Collins , Dashiell Hammett and Raymond Chandler . Nor is it difficult to explain their enduring influence on the genre . <p> But Christie ? How does she do it ? And , in the process , how has a shy , upper-middle class lady , born in Torquay in 1890 , become ( almost certainly ) the most widely read novelist in the world today ? <p> She really is the odd one out among these influential crime writers - and not just because she is the only woman among them . For a start , so many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dislike of her work . <p> Broadly speaking , her detractors fall into two camps . On the one hand , Christie has to contend with the sneers of the critics . The classic example is Edmund Wilson 's essay " Who Cares Who Killed Roger Ackroyd " , one of his three diatribes against detective fiction that appeared in the New Yorker during the 1940s . He concludes that Agatha Christie 's work is sub-literary , best considered as something between a trivial pursuit and a mildly shameful addiction . <p> Christie 's work has also been attacked from within . Like anything else , crime fiction has its fashions . Raymond Chandler 's 1944 essay , " The Simple Art of Murder " , savaged the Golden Age whodunnit and its practitioners , including Christie , and praised the more realistic American pulp school of crime writing exemplified by Hammett . <p> Nowadays , within the genre , the currently fashionable taste is for noir - gritty and morally ambiguous stories set in the big city , whose authors aspire to tick sociological and even ethical checkboxes as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their admiration , untinged by irony , for Christie on Front Row . <p> For both critics and devotees , her name conjures up " Mayhem Parva " - a Home Counties village with respectful rustics and a host of middle- and upper-class characters . This enclosed , idyllic world is disturbed by a murder . There is a host of suspects , most of whom either employ servants or ( in the later novels ) used to do so . <p> The reader is invited to pit his or her wits against those of the detective , who eventually brings the case to a dramatic and unexpected denouement . The story ends at this point , so the reader rarely has to cope with the messy procedures of evidence-gathering , trial and punishment . We know without being told that one of those invaluable servants will manage to remove the bloodstain from the drawing-room carpet . <p> On the face of it , the formula seems to have little to do with either crime or literature . It seems narrow and mechanical , and likely to produce dull and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unfashionable , unliterary and often , by modern standards , downright snobbish . In that case , why are they so widely read ? <p> For this is the second reason that Agatha Christie stands out among her peers . Despite the various attacks on it , her work has been , and continues to be , quite staggeringly popular . Conan Doyle himself can not match her record or even come near it . <p> The statistics tell their own story . Chorion , the entertainments and leisure company that now controls Christie 's copyrights , along with those of Blyton , Chandler and Simenon , reckons that Christie 's books have sold more than 2 billion copies worldwide . Each time they are rejacketed - in the UK , that 's about every six years - there is a surge in sales as new readers are lured to her books , and old ones rediscover them . <p> Today , HarperCollins , her publisher since 1926 , sells a million copies a year in every country in the world where English books are sold ( apart from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sales have actually grown by around 50 per cent over the last ten years , completely contrary to the trend . She 's now one of the top five authors in India . According to UNESCO figures , she is the world 's second most translated author . The top place , incidentally , is occupied by a team of Walt Disney writers ; Shakespeare comes in at number four . It 's impossible to find a single reason for this continuing popularity . But several factors have undoubtedly contributed to it . <p> In the first place , there are the qualities that Christie shares with many other authors of traditional whodunnits . Most obviously , some of the appeal must derive from the simple fact that death is universal , and so is the deep-seated unease that murder creates ; and so is the love of puzzles that have solutions . <p> WH Auden , a self-confessed addict of detective fiction , argued in a brief but influential essay , " The Guilty Vicarage " , that the charm of the genre has nothing to do with literature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cathartic . A whodunnit gives Genesis a happy ending : it introduces a serpent into Eden but concludes with its expulsion , leaving Adam and Eve to enjoy their restored innocence . <p> Put another way , the traditional whodunnit in the Christie mould works as a sort of literary analgesic . It shows us , in safely fictional terms , what we most fear , and then creates the illusion that human reason can both understand it and resolve it . So Hercule Poirot and Miss Marple fulfil functions that combine those of the shaman and the scientist . <p> True or not , this theory fails to explain why Agatha Christie should have done so much better than her rivals . Christie 's first novel , The Mysterious Affair at Styles , came out in 1920 and earned her ? 25 from her grasping publisher . But this and the novels that followed rapidly created a market for her work not only in this country but abroad . Despite their localised settings ( literally parochial in many cases ) , despite the social attitudes they enshrine , her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her prose is plain , direct and effective , which makes it easy to translate . It will give pleasure even to unsophisticated readers . It 's no accident that a Christie whodunnit is often the first " adult " novel that a child reads . <p> Similarly , the characterisation is equally straightforward . Her critics do not see this as a virtue . But it makes her characters very accessible , for the detail is so spare , and often so generalised , that readers can interpret them in their own way . <p> Christie 's popularity also has much to with the versatility of her stories . It became clear at a very early stage that her characters and storylines could be transferred to other media . The first film of her work is a German adaptation of The Secret Adversary ( Die Abenteuer GMBH ) , which appeared as early as 1928 . There 's an irrelevant but deliciously surreal story that the master reel for the film was found inside the Berlin Wall when it was pulled down . <p> Chorion estimates that there have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work worldwide . The best of them -- Joan Hickson 's Miss Marple , for example , or David Suchet 's Poirot -- pay Agatha Christie the supreme compliment of aspiring to be as true as possible to the spirit of the original novels . It is no surprise that they tend to be among the most commercially successful of the adaptations . Viewers , like readers , prefer to suspend their disbelief for the duration . <p> Christie 's stories work equally well as radio adaptations or as audiobooks . The record-breaking West End run of The Mousetrap still testifies to her skill as a dramatist . There are Christie e-books and interactive games . In France , where she is the best-selling author of all time , her work is appearing as a series of graphic novels . Her stories are like water : they fit the shape of the container that holds them . <p> As a crime writer , Christie 's talents have much in common with those of the conjurer and the stand-up comic . She is the queen of carefully controlled narrative . Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She distracts our attention at the crucial moment ; she toys with our stock responses . Her puzzles are rarely dull and over-complex - unlike those of Dorothy L Sayers and many other Golden Age crime writers . The best ofthem not only fool the reader but , afterwards , they give us the supreme pleasure of thinking that " I should have got that myself . " <p> Agatha Christie is not a great writer , and her 66 novels vary widely in quality . But the best of her books are well worth revisiting . There is a clarity about them and a shrewd understanding of the vagaries of human nature . Christie was no fool . She 's also a better writer than her reputation might lead you to expect . <p> The Murder of Roger Ackroyd ( 1926 ) , for example , if by any chance you do n't know the twist , still has the power to take your breath away . And , if you do , you can admire how it 's done . Murder at the Vicarage ( 1930 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 1950 ) tells us a great deal about the stresses of post-war British society . Crooked House ( 1949 ) , one of Christie 's own favourites , breaks an unspoken taboo of the genre that many readers still find shocking . <p> We will never know the precise secret of Agatha Christie 's extraordinary success . But the simplest , though not the only , reason for it is this : she understood the power of story and how to exercise it on her readers . <p> In her recent book , Talking About Detective Fiction , PD James quotes Robert Graves 's judgement : " Agatha 's best work is , like PG Wodehouse and No ? l Coward 's best work , the most characteristic pleasure writing of this epoch and will appear one day in all decent literary histories .

After some delay , His Excellency is announced and Paul Kagame enters the room with a brisk loping stride -- a tall , thin , gangly man with small steel-rimmed spectacles , a narrow moustache and a blue suit hanging off his bony shoulders . <p> Machetes , used in the genocide , abandoned by fleeing Hutus at Rwanda 's border with Tanzania <p> His eyes have a keen , piercing intelligence , and he radiates a quality of intense seriousness that is both impressive and intimidating . Kagame , the president of Rwanda , is widely considered to be the most dynamic and effective leader in Africa today , and also ruthless , repressive and intolerant of criticism . <p> Like any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Britain is the single largest donor to his regime , giving ? 70 million last year -- it is necessary for Kagame to cry foul when he 's accused of abusing human rights , but his self-professed model for Rwanda is Singapore : a small , tightly controlled authoritarian state that has achieved a vibrant prosperity based on trade , banking and communications . <p> The interview begins with Kagame asking the questions . ' Tell me your impressions of Rwanda , ' he says , ' a ) before you came here , and b ) now that you are here . ' <p> Like most foreign visitors , I have been impressed by the cleanliness , order and efficiency of the country . Sixteen years after the genocide in which Hutu fanatics orchestrated the slaughter of more than 800,000 Tutsis and moderate Hutus , leaving the country a nightmarish ruin , with the treasury looted and corpses stuffed down the wells , Rwanda is now the safest , cleanest country in Africa , with no slums and virtually no begging or street crime . It has one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the least amount of corruption and red tape , and it is the only country in the world to have a majority of women in its parliament . <p> Plastic bags are outlawed for environmental reasons , and in Kigali , the capital city , skyscrapers are rising , and the streets are swept clean every morning . The death penalty has been abolished , and English adopted as the official language . There is a national health system , 19 out of 20 children are now in school , and rural Rwanda , while still in severe poverty , has better internet service than rural Britain , and a good network of immaculately paved roads . <p> Meanwhile the survivors of the genocide are doing something almost unimaginable : co-existing with the men who hacked their family members to death , and so often tortured and raped them . In many cases survivors and killers are now living as neighbours again in the same villages , and while this is a tense arrangement to say the least , there has been remarkably little violence , and some inspiring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are extraordinary but they seem fragile , ' I say . ' The country still feels so traumatised and volatile . I have been asking Rwandans what they would like to ask you , and two questions keep coming up : how can we heal the ethnic division in our hearts ? And what happens if Kagame drops dead tomorrow ? Many think there would be another genocide . ' <p> These remarks hang impertinently in the air for a few moments . Then Kagame , who is Tutsi and runs a Tutsi-dominated government , nods slowly and composes his reply . <p> ' For me , this fragility is to be expected . Sixteen years is a very short time , and the trauma runs much deeper than people from outside , however well meaning , will ever understand . Sometimes our partners from other countries ask us why we have not got further with our reconciliation , as if we possess a magic to just get rid of this tragic history of ours . No , we have to find a way to live with it and also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to achieve peace and stability , and now we are moving forward with development . And if Kagame , for one reason or other , is no longer there , people can look back at everything that has been done in 16 years , and they can feel a part of it , and be reassured that this stability will continue . ' <p> Rwanda 's curse has been ethnic hatred expressed as ethnic politics , so Kagame 's government , in typically bold , authoritarian style , has made it illegal . Any politician or citizen who makes a statement encouraging ethnic animosity , or expressing ethnic solidarity , risks a lengthy imprisonment for the crime of ' divisionism ' . The very words Hutu and Tutsi are now fraught and taboo , and if you ask someone which group they belong to , they will usually look uncomfortable and reply as the government has dictated : ' We are all Rwandans now . ' <p> To Kagame 's critics , this is simply a strategy to keep the Hutus , who make up 85 per cent of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now controlling the country . There are Hutu members and ministers in Kagame 's ruling party , the Rwandan Patriotic Front ( RPF ) , but the inner circle is all Tutsi . And in the past , whenever Hutu politicians have started to gather power or criticise the government , it has usually meant their imprisonment , exile , disappearance or , in the case of Seth Sendashonga and a few others , unsolved assassination . <p> According to Human Rights Watch , one of Kagame 's most persistent critics , by denying Hutus a political voice and access to power he is building resentment and bottling tensions . <p> Kagame bristles fiercely at these criticisms . ' There are people who think we will never get out of this , that in Rwanda either these ones will do the killing , or these ones will , ' he says . ' I do not accept this . I can not accept that there is something wrong with us in this way . It will be a long , difficult process -- we are under no illusions -- and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opportunity , build a culture of entrepreneurship , get people to take responsibility for improving their lives , rather than putting them in a position where they sit back in their poverty and blame others for it . ' <p> To Kagame 's fans , who include Tony Blair , Bill Clinton , Bill Gates and the CEOs of Google and Starbucks , the tinderbox nature of post-genocide Rwanda , and the results he has achieved so far , justify his strong hand and poor human rights record . The fact that Rwanda is ranked 183 out of 195 countries for freedom of the press , for example , is outweighed by the fact that the per-capita GDP has tripled . Also , the West lives with the guilty knowledge that it was Kagame and his rebel army who stopped the genocide , while we dithered and blundered , and Kagame has been skilful and relentless at using this guilt to his advantage . <p> Like so many rebel generals who have made the switch to civilian leadership , Kagame places a high premium on loyalty and discipline , likes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threats of violence against his enemies , and tends to equate criticism with treason . Unusually , he does n't appear motivated by wealth or luxury , either for himself or his relations . One of his sisters runs a small dairy . Another operates a souvenir stand at the airport . <p> When I ask Kagame to sum up his political philosophy , he says , ' Pragmatic , doing what is doable , ' and adds that fighting war is more to his liking . ' Even with all the hardships and hunger , war is straightforward and clear-cut , ' he explains . ' But building a nation from nothing ? A nation that has just experienced genocide ? There is no strategy manual for this . There is nothing that is not a priority , and the priorities are always conflicting . I try to look at problems very clearly and think , " How do we get out of this ? What will work ? What will be the consequences for the people involved ? " ' <p> Kagame has very little formal schooling , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experiences , which have been harsher than most of us can imagine , and his voracious reading . Having put in a 12-hour day dealing with affairs of state , taken his exercise ( gym or tennis ) , spent time with his wife and four children and said goodnight to them , he then stays up reading for three or four hours a night . ' Mainly it is books about economics , business management , development issues , politics , international affairs , ' he says . ' I get newspapers from Britain and other countries twice a week , and read them almost page to page . Sometimes I find I 'm reading things I do n't even need to read , because my mind is still hungry . I do n't need much sleep . Four hours is enough . ' <p> Paul Kagame was born in 1957 into an aristocratic Tutsi family that fled Rwanda when he was a small boy . His earliest memories are of houses burning on a hill , shouting and commotion , his desperate mother , the family scrambling into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hill towards them . This was in 1959 and again in 1960 , during the first of the Hutu pogroms against the Tutsi that some historians now interpret as ' warm-up genocides ' . <p> The Kagames were among tens of thousands of Rwandan Tutsis who ended up living in refugee camps across the border in Uganda . ' You will always hear me talking about the importance of dignity , ' Kagame says . ' It is really the key to people 's lives , and obviously for me it relates back to the refugee camp , the lining up for food every day , the rationing . When we started primary school , we used to study under a tree . We used to write on our thighs with a piece of dry , hard grass , and the teacher would come over and look at your thigh , and write his mark with another piece of dry grass . You develop some sense of questioning , some sense of justice , saying , " Why do I live like this ? Why should anybody live like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still there in the way I approach many things . You ca n't shock me , because what can be worse than what I have seen and lived through ? ' <p> As a young man he joined the leftist Ugandan rebel army led by Yoweri Museveni , the current president of Uganda , and spent five years as a guerrilla fighter in the bush . Intelligence was Kagame 's speciality , gathering information about the terrain , the enemy , the villagers . It suited his observant , analytical , conspiratorial mind . When Museveni took power in 1986 , he sent Kagame to Cuba for training with 67 intelligence officers under his command . <p> On his return , Kagame and his closest boyhood friend from the refugee camp , Fred Rwigyema , started building a clandestine army of Rwandan exiles within the Ugandan national army , with the aim of invading Rwanda and overthrowing the Hutu regime . It was one of the most audacious covert operations in military history , involving thousands of people , and it was how the Rwandan Patriotic Front began . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Kagame met and married his wife , Jeanette , then living in Nairobi . Soon afterwards the newlyweds went to Fort Leavenworth , Kansas , where Museveni had arranged training for Kagame at the prestigious US Army Command and Staff College , to complement what he had learnt in Cuba . Kagame and Rwigyema continued to plot their invasion by telephone , as the Ugandan military became increasingly suspicious of the Rwandans in their midst . <p> In October 1990 , with Kagame still in Kansas tidying up his affairs , the RPF detached itself from the Ugandan army , ripped the insignias off its uniforms , and crossed the border into Rwanda . By the time Kagame got there Rwigyema had been killed , and the RPF had been routed . Kagame took command of the remnants and led them to the remote Virunga mountains . There he rebuilt his army in secret , and began a four-year guerrilla war against the Hutu government headed by President Juv ? nal Habyarimana and backed by the French . <p> It was Hutu Power extremists in the ruling elite who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ China , trained the Interahamwe death squads , and then used the radio to whip up hatred and paranoia among the Hutu population , and coordinate the killing district by district . As the horror began , Kagame was in close contact with the UN commander on the ground , Romeo Dallaire , whose superiors in New York ordered him to stay neutral and not get involved . Kagame was also in contact with the Clinton administration , which justified its inaction by claiming that ' acts of genocide ' were taking place , but not genocide itself . Furious and disgusted by the international response , Kagame and the RPF took matters into their own hands and marched on Kigali . <p> The night before the RPF reached the city , the genocidaires fled , leaving the streets heaped with corpses , government buildings stripped down to the wiring , the treasury and banks emptied . Moving into the countryside beyond Kigali , the RPF found more horror , stench and eerie silence . It seemed impossible that so many people had been killed with machetes and clubs in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with 800,000 dead in 100 days , was the fastest genocide in history . <p> When the self-styled ' international community ' did finally intervene , it did nothing for the survivors , and chose instead to help the perpetrators of the genocide . The French landed 3,000 soldiers and created a protected zone for the fleeing government army , death squads and general Hutu population , which included many genocidal killers . From there , a great exodus of Hutus crossed into the Democratic Republic of Congo , or Zaire as it was then , and a massive international aid campaign was launched to feed them , shelter them in refugee camps , and bring them medical supplies . Neither the television coverage nor the televised appeals for money by the aid organisations made it clear that these people had just committed genocide . In accordance with the principles of humanitarian neutrality , they were described as ' refugees from the genocide in Rwanda ' , and most viewers naturally assumed they were innocent survivors . <p> Kagame 's blood starts to boil when he remembers this time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ armouries and ammunition in the camps , and the human rights people , and the humanitarian people , were feeding them , and telling us they were feeding refugees . And , as they very well knew , these so-called refugees were selling most of what they were given so they could maintain their military machine , because they wanted to come back and overthrow us . ' <p> There were two important long-term consequences . One was that Kagame developed a deep contempt for the international community and its claims to moral authority . The second was that his army invaded Zaire/Congo ( while he strenuously denied that an invasion was taking place ) . Fighting alongside a Congolese rebel army , it scattered but did not defeat the Hutu war machine , committed a series of brutal massacres against fleeing , unarmed Hutus ( also denied , even when the mass graves were discovered ) , deposed the dictator Mobutu Sese Seko , and set in motion a horrific cycle of violence , upheaval and pillage in Congo that has been dubbed Africa 's World War . Depending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ million , five million or seven million deaths , mostly from war-related disease and privation . <p> The gravest charges against Kagame 's regime relate to the actions of his army . There is clear evidence that the RPF committed systematic massacres of Hutus both in Rwanda when they took power , and then in Congo . According to UN reports , the Rwandan military has also plundered some $100 million worth of gold , diamonds , tin , coltan and other minerals from war-ravaged eastern Congo . It is not a defence of Rwanda but a point of context to mention that eight other African nations , and a dizzying cast of Congolese warlords , have also been fighting over the vast mineral wealth in this region . <p> Kagame has only this to say on the subject of Congo : ' The problems there are so enormous and many decades old , so I think it is a mistake to say that the problem starts with Rwanda 's hand in it , and this is where it ends . Even if we were to take Rwanda away , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot of problems to contend with -- corruption , bad governance , lack of effective institutions , and so on . But at least for those problems related to us we are gradually overcoming them , and are doing so by working very well with the Congolese . ' <p> Regarding the RPF massacres of Hutus in Rwanda , he offers a more spirited defence , saying that it was extremely difficult to restrain his troops , especially the new recruits who had just seen their family members raped and butchered . ' You can imagine trying to stand between people who are so seriously aggrieved , and having the desire to settle it because there was no justice infrastructure at that time . Then you have the ones being accused , and some felt justified and thought they did right in killing , and others said no , we were n't a part of it , even if they were involved , and trying to sort all this out was probably the most difficult thing of all . ' <p> There were still thousands of unburied bodies when human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ democratic elections in Rwanda . There were millions of displaced people , and a genocidal war machine reassembling itself just across the border . There was no currency in circulation , and the trauma of the survivors was still in the first stage of shock . ' You would look in their eyes and see a blankness , ' Kagame says . ' They were just wondering how it was possible to cope with everything they had seen . ' <p> Some 200 humanitarian NGOs ( non-governmental organisations ) arrived in Rwanda to help rebuild it , and while Kagame was grateful for the goodwill , the money and the services they could provide , he rankled at the mixture of naivety and entitlement that came along in their cultural baggage , and threw 80 of them out because they refused to register . ' Of the rest , you would be lucky to find five in 100 that are doing it altruistically . The others will choose for you where you should put their money , and try to control what you do in other areas . They come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they judge and criticise and tell you what you should do . A big part of the misunderstanding is that they expect us to be a normal country , like the ones where they are from . They do not understand that we are operating in a very different context . ' <p> In the Great Lakes region of Africa -- Rwanda , Burundi , Congo , Uganda -- it is normal for presidents to seize power at the head of rebel armies . Ethnic violence and ethnic patronage are basic tools of politics , and if you lose power there is a serious risk of death , imprisonment or exile , and perhaps a wave of ethnic cleansing or genocide against your people . In Kagame 's case , his electorate is 85 per cent Hutu . Many of them were involved in the most committed attempt at genocide that Africa has ever seen . It is not hard to understand why his government lacks enthusiasm for genuinely free and fair elections , or why it clamps down so hard on the slightest suggestion of ethnic politics . Nor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other sign of weakness . <p> Another basic requirement for politicians in the region is to present a facade of democracy to keep the donors happy and the aid money flowing . In this spirit , the RPF wrote a parliamentary constitution for Rwanda after it took power . To show Rwandans and the West that they were not a military dictatorship of Tutsi exiles , they appointed a Hutu president , Pasteur Bizimungu , and a Hutu prime minister . Kagame was vice-president , minister of defence , general of the army , and the one who took important meetings with foreign heads of state . Bizimungu proved obstinate , greedy and ambitious . In 2000 , having resigned while drunk in public , he was then arrested and sentenced to 15 years for divisionism . The crime was committed in a magazine interview , in which Bizimungu predicted Hutu violence and civil war unless the RPF started sharing power in a genuine way . <p> Kagame assumed the presidency . He started devouring books about Singapore , South Korea , China and the other ' Asian Tigers ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less than a generation by means of disciplined , authoritarian leadership and entrepreneurial capitalism . Rwanda is a small , landlocked , overpopulated country with few natural resources , and long , expensive trade routes . How was it going to develop ? Kagame announced an ambitious plan to turn Rwanda into the high-tech commercial , banking and communications hub of east and central Africa by 2020 . <p> The region is rich in resources , especially Congo , but it has been crippled by corruption , inefficiency , political instability , poverty , disease and ignorance . Kagame 's government began tackling these problems with a harsh , bullying , unwavering determination entirely new to the region . Government employees were required to be at their desks by 7am , and quickly fired if they did n't produce results . The anti-corruption tsar was given real power , and used it zealously . The rebuilding of Rwanda 's infrastructure and institutions , especially in health and education , has been largely financed by foreign aid , which provided 100 per cent of the government 's budget in the immediate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per cent . Kagame wants to reduce Rwanda 's dependency on aid , regarding it as a trap that stifles entrepreneurship and dignity , but it has been integral to his progress so far , and for the donors Rwanda has been a rare success story . Here at last is an African government that does n't embezzle or squander the money , but uses it efficiently and gets results . <p> The government has also been effective at courting influential friends abroad ( Clinton , Blair et al ) , and bringing in foreign investment , mainly from America and China . The World Bank has named Rwanda the top business reformer in the world , and the region 's most business-friendly country . The coffee business is booming , thanks in no small part to Starbucks , and tourism , unimaginable after the genocide , has grown into a $200 million a year industry . Another important part of the Rwandan economic miracle , but hard to measure , has been the secret flow of illegal minerals from Congo . <p> The other African countries involved have plundered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the profits banked in Switzerland or London . In Rwanda 's case , the mineral wealth appears to have been funnelled through government channels , with most of it spent on the military , and the rest of it helping to finance Kagame 's vision of an African Singapore . <p> The dream is still a long way from coming true . In Kigali there is a prosperous elite , most of them Tutsis returned from the diaspora , and an emerging middle class , but nine out of 10 Rwandans are still subsistence farmers . Hope rests on the generation currently in school , who are growing up with laptops and the internet , speaking English , and moving towards the universities and the new technical colleges . Rwandese society has always encouraged obedience to power ( this is one reason why so many Hutus followed their orders to kill Tutsis ) , and younger Rwandans are being pounded with exhortations to study hard , work hard , take responsibility , be entrepreneurs . <p> No one is watching the Rwanda experiment more closely than other Africans . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and considered a shoo-in for the presidency of the African Union if he ever wants the job . But the Rwanda model is not easily replicated . It requires a Kagame , and men like Kagame do not come along often . There has never been a shortage of autocrats in Africa , but very few of them have been so driven and determined to better their countries , and most have concentrated on enriching themselves and shoring up their power with patronage . Kagame has shown Africa that strong leadership can turn a country around , and that a strong leader shows no quarter to his opponents . <p> He faced his first presidential election in 2003 . Opposition candidates proved hard to find because the likeliest were either in prison , dead or had fled the country . Finally the former prime minister , a Hutu named Faustin Twagiramungu , returned from exile , announced his candidacy and made a speech accusing Kagame of running a dictatorship . The majority-female parliament promptly voted to ban his political party . Twagiramungu persevered , even after two of his most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per cent of the vote . He insists it was a free and fair election , saying , ' You can not blame me for the weakness of the opposition . ' <p> Now he has another election on August 9 . The government has closed down two critical news ? papers , and arrested a journalist for defamation ( he compared Kagame with Hitler ) and divisionism . A dissident general has survived an assassination attempt in South Africa , and a newspaper editor who linked it to the Rwandan government was murdered in Kigali . Two opposition parties have been prevented from registering , and the vice-president of one , Andre Kagwa Rwisereka of the Democratic Greens , has turned up dead from machete wounds . Political rallies have been been broken up violently by the police , and two Hutu opposition candidates have been arrested , one for divisionism , the other , Victoire Ingabire , for the Orwellian crime of ' genocide ideology ' . <p> Ingabire had been living in Belgium . On returning to Rwanda to announce her candidacy , she went straight to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no memorial for the moderate Hutus who were killed -- her brother was one of them . She was announcing herself , in RPF eyes , as a Hutu candidate , and challenging the government version of the genocide , which is a strict morality play involving Hutu villains , Tutsi victims and RPF heroes . To raise questions about the RPF atrocities against Hutus , or draw attention to the moderate Hutus who were killed , is equated under the law with denying or diminishing the genocide . <p> All in all , it seems a foregone conclusion that Kagame will win re-election and remain in power for at least another seven years . Then comes the big question . Will he abide by the Rwandan constitution , which limits presidents to two terms ? Or will he devise a reason to hold on to power for longer ? Kagame insists he will step down , and says that if there is no peaceful democratic transfer of power in 2017 , his presidency will have been a failure . He insists that Rwanda will become an increasingly open and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or because meddlesome foreigners are demanding it . ' No , ' he says , ' we must do it because fundamentally we believe in it , because these values are universal and we share them , and because it is good for us . ' <p> Is this deceitful rhetoric , or does he really intend to open up political space once development has got further , as the donors and many Rwandans would like to believe ? Is Kagame a benevolent dictator , the strong hand needed to pull Rwanda forward into a better future , or is he an incurable despot ? If you hold him up to the light in the right way , you can see both facets glinting at once .

@@1576230 <h> Michael Morpurgo on War Horse and beyond <p> With Steven Spielberg about to film War Horse and a stage production of Farm Boy opening in Edinburgh , things are looking good for the author Michael Morpurgo . <p> The former children 's laureate is no stranger to stage or screen adaptations of his books , though few have had the galloping success of War Horse . <p> The West End hit transfers to Broadway in March 2011 , with Spielberg 's movie version due out the following August . The cast includes Emily Watson , David Thewlis , Benedict Cumberbatch ( currently in TV 's Sherlock ) , Peter Mullan and Jeremy Irvine . <p> The book tells the story of a farm horse , Joey , who gets separated from his owner and ends up in the trenches of World War I. <p> What 's astonishing is that War Horse made it this far at all . Morpurgo , who wrote the book in 1982 , admits it did nothing spectacular for years . <p> " It nearly won a prize but failed . It was translated into three or four languages . It was published in America and did n't succeed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about 25 years . It simply was not a book that anyone really knew about or cared about .

" Yes , I 'm a little surprised , but I 'm also relatively pleased . " <p> Tractor tale <p> The book Farm Boy is a " sequel " to War Horse in that it continues the story of Joey after World War I. <p> Morpurgo , however , is n't fond of sequels : " I do n't like going back to to the same field to graze .

How did he manage back on the farm ? " <p> More than 30 years ago Morpurgo and his wife Clare set up Farms for City Children in Devon , which gives children the opportunity to work with animals . <p> " I 'm in the wonderful , privileged position of being able to witness this enthusiasm that urban people seem to have when they first come into the countryside , " says Morpurgo . <p> The stage version of Farm Boy - which opens in Edinburgh next week - is a more modest production than War Horse . <p> " If you went in with the expectations of the immense complexity of the lighting and design and amazing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " says Morpurgo . <p> " This is a miniature portrait but it 's beautifully crafted - all you have on stage is this wonderful old tractor and two people - they take several roles .

@@1576231 <h> BBC Proms 2010 : Valery Gergiev - mission to bring harmony <h> Valery Gergiev talks about his World Orchestra for Peace . <p> The power of music to do good beyond the purely musical is invoked more and more these days . Back in the days of the Band Aid campaign in the Eighties , it really seemed as if music could help to " feed the world " . More recently , it 's been suggested that music can augment our brainpower and even stave off mental illness . <p> All these are bolt-on virtues of music , things that are n't really musical as such . Much more intrinsic to music is the idea that it is a natural peacemaker . It was Shakespeare who coined the phrase about music having " charms to soothe the savage breast " , but he was calling on something that was already ancient . This was the idea that musical harmony mirrors the harmony of a well-ordered person , or even an entire society . <p> So the World Orchestra for Peace , which is about to appear at the BBC Proms , can claim a noble and ancient heritage . But what force @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? <p> The orchestra 's current conductor Valery Gergiev is a passionate believer in its mission , but he 's under no illusions about what it can achieve . " Of course , we can not bring peace . But what we can do is make a statement . We can show the world that people from many different cultures , who have never met , can work together . Do n't forget these concerts are televised , so people all round the world can see this . " <p> Gergiev is the second conductor to lead the orchestra in its 15-year history . The first was George Solti , the fiery Hungarian conductor who died in 1997 at the age of 84 . It was his idea to create an orchestra that would symbolise a harmony between nations , and , according to the orchestra 's director Charles Kaye , the idea first stirred into life during a party at Buckingham Palace . <p> " Prince Charles had organised an 80th birthday for Solti , who was an old friend , " says Kaye . " And he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 15 orchestras Solti had worked with that year . At a pre-arranged signal , they came on to play Wagner 's Siegfried Idyll . Sir George was very touched by this spectacle of players from different countries all coming together . " <p> The catalyst that turned a half-formed idea into an orchestra was an invitation to Solti a few years later from the United Nations . <p> " Solti was asked by Boutros Boutros-Ghali , who was then Secretary-General , to conduct a concert to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the signing of the founding charter of the UN in 1945 , " says Kaye . " This was when he mooted the idea of an orchestra that would bring together the best players from round the world . " <p> That was easier said than done , and it fell to Kaye , who was Solti 's right-hand man for the last 20 years of his life , to shoulder the burden of inviting the players and bringing them together in Geneva . <p> " The deal was that everyone , including Sir George , would get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And it was important that the orchestra was non-hierarchical . " To put it bluntly , they had to sit where Solti asked them , and everyone changed places between pieces . If a distinguished string player insisted on a front-desk position , I had to suggest that perhaps this orchestra was n't for him . " <p> Solti lived to conduct only one concert with his brainchild . But the orchestra lives on under his friend Gergiev , one of the few living conductors with charisma comparable to Solti 's . Edward Vanderspar , principal violist of the London Symphony Orchestra and a member of the orchestra from the beginning , says this is a vital factor when 90 players from 40 countries are thrown together . <p> " You have to remember we do n't have the luxury of building relationships between the players at a normal pace , and that 's not easy with players from different traditions . If you have an oboist from Vienna and a trombonist from America , they 'll have different ideas about style , intonation , how to breathe . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ totally different approach to vibrato and bowing . " <p> Does n't that make for a bumpy ride ? " Of course , but that 's the point . You have to figure out how to make things work really fast , and I think that gives a special excitement to our performances . " <p> For Gergiev , it is this merging of individual differences in a common cause that makes the orchestra so vital . " I remember one year we did Rossini 's overture to William Tell , which has this wonderful cello solo . One night , it was a cellist from La Scala , another night one from Berlin , another night an American ... all playing with their own character and tradition , but always part of the whole . <p> " That 's why this orchestra is so special . It 's not just how many countries are represented , it 's how beautifully we can play together .

However , it will not be Vladimir Jurowski , whom British audiences know and love for his music directorships at the London Philharmonic Orchestra and Glyndebourne . No , this will be his younger brother , Dmitri , and he will be making his first London appearance at the same time as he makes his Bolshoi debut . All eyes , therefore , will be on the latest addition to the Jurowski dynasty . Can the 30-year-old live up to the enviable reputations of Vladimir , their conductor father Mikhail and their composer grandfather , also named Vladimir ? <p> Big brother , who is eight years Dmitri 's senior , will be watching .

" We are both emotional people , " Dmitri says , " but I have the feeling that Vladimir is able to project more the emotions inside , while I would be the more extrovert person . But it all depends on the music we 're performing . " <p> Speaking from Berlin , where the Jurowski family settled after leaving Russia in 1990 , Dmitri offers reflections on life as the youngest of such a clan . <p> " I feel honoured to have been raised in that kind of family , " he says . " It has been an advantage . When you 're always surrounded by music and such high-level professional musicians , it 's very helpful . But also it 's a huge responsibility . I realise the quality of music-making that this family has had for so many years needs to be continued .

It does n't matter how successful you are , you always need the chance to learn and to improve and for that you need objective , high-quality , professional feedback . For all of us it 's an advantage always to have that possibility . We 're all different ; we have a lot in common but everyone always kept their own individuality . " <p> If there is a problem it is that the Jurowskis are constantly on the move and so do not see enough of each other . " On the rare occasions when we can get together , " says Dmitri , " we have to try not to talk only about music . " <p> There is a twist in Dmitri 's tale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not intend to become a full-time conductor .

' I was happy being a cellist . But then I developed some pain in my hands . I went to the doctor , he made a scan and he said , ' Young man , you have to change your life . ' " <p> At 22 , Jurowski had arthritis . " It was a strange situation because I had to face the reality that I could n't continue with everything I had done before . When you have spent 18 years with an instrument it 's your life and it 's hard to leave . But I had great support from my family and I have a practical mind that said to me , ' Wait , you 've got this talent , this gift from God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it was for nothing and you 're still young -- maybe someone is giving you a huge opportunity . ' I was n't sure if this was true but I started by following this instinct . Now I see it as one of the best things that happened to me . " <p> Sure enough , Dmitri 's work as a conductor has brought him the chance to work with the Bolshoi Opera . " For me , for any Russian musician , the Bolshoi is the ideal , the maximum that you can reach , " he says . He was only 10 when his family moved to Germany , but among his most treasured childhood memories is his first experience of Eugene Onegin . <p> " My father was conducting it in the Stanislavsky Theatre and I was about two when my parents brought me the first time to the theatre .

It is one of the rare productions I 've seen that made me feel I 'm a child again . " <p> Though he conducts symphonic repertoire just as much , opera seems to be keeping Dmitri busy . In January he will take up the music directorship at the Royal Flemish Opera in Antwerp , his first appointment to such a post .

As with many other English priests who shared this experience , he was radicalised and driven thereafter to give the highest priority to inter-racial partnership and social justice .

It 's a small green Ionian island nestling alongside Lefkas , set in some of the most transparent water anywhere in the Mediterranean . The ferry arrives after a gentle journey at a small dock beneath the village of Spartochori , whose pastel-coloured houses huddle on the clifftop like an eager reception committee . And then the fun starts . <p> Life in the slow lane : The unspolit , captivating coastline of Meganisi <p> There are only three villages on the island and for my money the only one that matters is Spartochori , with its spectacular views , vineshaded courtyards and labyrinth of narrow , delightfully paved streets .

An influx of government money has whitewashed the walls and installed air conditioning , but the chirping of the cicadas and the gentle clatter of sheep bells has n't changed much in generations . <p> On our first evening , as we walked through the olive groves , we heard a violin , its music drifting on the evening air . We followed the wood smoke to one of the few tavernas , where a magnificent sea bream fed us both for ? 8 . They seem to have forgotten to put up the prices .

These are caves so big that a Greek submarine hid there during the war to escape pursuing Nazis , and so old that they were the legendary home of the Cyclops , the monster blinded by Odysseus . <p> On other parts of the coast there are magnificent bays filled with white sails , where the beaches are made from pebbles of polished pearl that seem to disappear into molten turquoise - you ca n't simply suggest the water is blue , it 's so much better than that .

@@1580236 <p> The last big Spotify update added social features , favourites and better music recommendation . You can bet that there are similar radical upgrades to come . <p> Here 's what we want to see in the next version of Spotify . Tell us what new features you 're hoping for in the comments . <p> 1 . An advanced search page <p> Spotify 's search box accepts boolean search terms , but you have to do a bit of research to find out what they are . Why not give us access to all those hidden search extras in a Google-style ' Advanced Search ' page , with drop down menus . It would make finding tunes by year , genre and artist so much easier . <p> 2 . Better Bookmarking <p> In the last Spotify update , Stars were introduced - a one-click method for bookmarking individual tracks . We want a similar , one-click way to create a playlist from an album . <p> At the moment you have to right-click on an album title , navigate to ' Save to ' , choose ' New Playlist ' from the bottom of a long menu and then click again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ title to the ' New Playlist ' link in the sidebar - but it 's not intuitive . Here 's an idea : change the Star link in album listings to a ' Create Playlist ' link . One click and you 'll be done . <p> 3 . Folders for playlists <p> If you 've been using Spotify for a while , you 'll probably have a long , long list of playlists . Please , Spotify folks , give us a way to organise them . A simple folder function would be perfect . Give us the ability to create folders , name them and stuff them with appropriate playlists . It would give us the freedom to arrange our playlists by artist , genre or any other categorisation we can come up with . <p> 4 . Tabs <p> If you 're anything like us , you listen to one track as you 're searching for new ones . It 'd be more spiffing than Lord Spiffy of Spiffington to have the current track in one tab while finding new tunes in another . Strip back the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ browser - so , tabs make lots of sense . <p> 5 . Playlist search <p> One of of our favourite Spotify related services is ShareMyPlaylists . It reminds us of swapping mix tapes and CDs with our mates back in the day . Spotify people , you 've missed a trick there . We 'd love to able to post public playlists to a central catalogue and search other people 's playlists from within Spotify . The current social profiles do n't quite cut it ... <p> EASY SHARING:Spotify already plugs ShareMyPlaylists on its blog ... Could a partnership be struck so we can search playlists from within the client ? <p> 6 . Selective collaboration <p> Playlists have two editing states . They 're either world writable or can only be edited by their author ; they 're collaborative or they 're not . The problem with collaborative playlists is that anyone - from erudite tune aficionados to cloth eared trolls - can add tracks to them . Our solution ? A feature that enables you to add selected friends to a playlist . They can edit , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Minimised mode <p> What do WinAmp , VLC and Windows Media Player all have in common ? They can all be run in minimised modes that reduce the interface down to a simple set of playback controls . With Spotify , though , it 's a full window or nothing . We know it can be done . Just look at third party plug-in FoxyTunes . <p> 8 . The Beatles <p> Yeah , we know that 's a bit optimistic . The only digital platform you can currently download the Fab Four 's tunes on is Beatles Rock Band . Bleurgh . But Spotify has several other big omissions from its catalogue . True behemoths like Oasis , Led Zeppelin , Metallica and Pink Floyd . All of them are missing . For Spotify to become a true alternative to the disappearing paradigm of owning your own music , it has to patch up those gaps . <p> MISSING : Want to download Fab Four music ? Then The Beatles Rock Band from EA Games is the only current way to do it legally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @

Woman play an active role in politics and business , literacy is high and its natural beauty make it a favoured destination for film-makers . Homespun Keralan cinema is often referred to as " Mollywood " because of films that are made in the Malayalam language , but this week 's protest underscores an industry in crisis . <p> Mollywood movies have been losing money for years and consequently the number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In 2009 less than five per cent of the 60 films released were hits and everybody is blaming each other . Some say it is movie superstars charging too much , other that distribution costs are too high and others that the censor board is allegedly governed by self-interest and the Indian bane of embedded corruption . <p> Earlier this year , the whole industry shut down and production of all new films was stopped as strikes by technicians and daily workers brought matters to a head . In the intervening three months , there has been movement towards rapprochement , but it would be an absolute tragedy if this beautiful state stops making movies . <p> And there is a precedent , albeit tenuous . There has not been a Hollywood movie made in Singapore since 1978 , a place that cries out as a movie location . Rather like Kerala , it was the authorities who were responsible for preventing movie production , but it was the deliciously nefarious antics of US director Peter Bogdanovich that forced them to do so . <p> Saint Jack was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and tells the life of one Jack Flowers , a pimp who sets up his own bordello and consequently clashes with Chinese triads . A good read , no doubt , but not the type of Singapore the authorities wanted to portray , who knew about the book and had no intention it being filmed in the island-state . <p> Consequently when it came to filming in Singapore in 1978 , Bogdanovich came up with a fake synopsis called Jack of Hearts that was a completely different kind of film and all the Singaporean production team believed this was the film they were making . Other willing participants in this wonderful deception were many well-known British actors such as Denholm Elliott , Joss Ackland , George Lazenby and even Likely Lad Rodney Bewes . <p> The film was banned in Singapore on 17 January 1980 " largely due to concerns that there would be excessive edits required to the scenes of nudity and some coarse language before it could be shown to a general audience " . <p> The ban was finally lifted only in March 2006 . Even so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since they have said no to any Hollywood production , even though it hosts the Universal Studios Hollywood Movie theme park . <p> While nobody is saying such blatant legerdemain is involved , this week 's protest by the Kerala Film Chamber of Commerce against regional censor Madhu Kumar may be the last chance the Kerala film industry has in pulling itself off the cutting floor . <p> Other states such as Goa have been more than happy to allow film crews to patrol its beaches and backwaters . Unless the bickering stops , the final curtain may descend on Mollywood and an industry that has lasted as long as Bollywood itself .

" <p> But bigger parents are attempting complex interactions at the top of their voices . " OK , India darling , do you want the Red Leicester or the Fairtrade Cheddar on your water-biscuit ?

Hmm , I do n't think you get to talk to children like that until you 're at least six . <p> It 's bad enough at home , but I 'm beginning to realise that , as they grow up , parents are increasingly required to " do parenting " in public .

No , not just trading , or economics , or monetary history , but how we arrived at a period in time that had all the markings of a classic mania in human history , and why things I believed should have been obvious , were still dismissed by my industry , most of my peers , and millions of investors .

A larger portion of the academic world teaches its students this hypothesis . The following is found in the August ' 06 issue of The Investor 's Mind : <p> Indeed , the investments textbook for the College of Financial Planning states : <p> " The efficient market hypothesis ( EMH ) suggests that investors can not expect to outperform the market consistently on a risk-adjusted basis .

" 2 <p> And yet , considering these next two examples , it would appear that there are some very well recognized names who continue to have a good laugh on those indoctrinated in the Efficient Market 's Hypothesis : <p> " Buffet stated in his 1988 Annual Report , ' Observing correctly that the market was frequently efficient , they EMT proponents went on to conclude incorrectly that it was always efficient . The difference between these propositions is night and day . ' Buffet went on to say , ' Berkshire illustrates just how foolish EMT is .

Has there been anyone more proud to wear the England shirt in modern times ? " <p> Gill went on to say that it was this " almost unbreakable determination , fantastic ability with the ball at key occasions -- although most would agree that he was never world-class -- and openness " that made clubs and sponsors clamour for a bit of Becks . <p> " Of course he 's damn good looking and with a pop star wife too . Real Madrid even signed him to sell shirts and boost their financial standings , some cynics will tell you , " he said . <p> " Brands like Gillette , Pepsi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much benefit from his impeccable reputation and on field heroics . Even the alleged Loos affair was quickly forgotten as Beck 's re-ignited his career in Spain , ironically with a manager who did n't trust him then , one Fabio Capello .

The star 's Beckham 's response was to grow a beard , which millions of men copied . <p> Gary McCall , Director at Banana Kick , a marketing agency specialising in Sports &amp; Leisure , said that it was this knowledge of how to play the right PR card that would serve Beckham well . <p> " Even the most avid ante Beckham supporters must feel embarrassment at the way Capello has managed the early retirement of David Beckham .

Similarly to when we secured the 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games the campaign is likely to go to the wire . <p> " It will be interesting to see who the FA calls upon to help our bid . Will it be David Beckham ? Should it be how can this organisation allow an icon of English football to be treated so shabbily ? Beckham , with 115 caps , is the most capped outfield player in English history and not forgetting his services to the domestic and international game . " <p> McCall added that he was confident that the end of Beckham 's international career would certainly not signify the end of Brand Beckham . <p> " He has universal appeal to women , men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tournament hits British shores , he has retained his looks and keeps himself in top condition , which only enhances maximises his brand value , " he explained . " If England does secure the 2018 World Cup he will be the hot ' branding ' property . " You would hope the FA is aware of this as well as Beckham 's advisors and I hope everyone will be very sensible about the situation . " <p> So in terms of next steps for Beckham , how should he progress ? If marketing agency , Bandit had it 's own way -- here 's what they would do : <p> " We would explain to Becks that whilst we love him ( and we do love him ) , it 's time to take the next step , " the company says in its official blog . <p> " He should become the new breed of OG , something that the world has never seen.OG = Original Gangster ( but do n't be alarmed -- it means more than that now ) .

And according to DCH 's Nick Gill , it 's Beckham 's good nature that will see him through and secure his future <p> " Even through the hairstyles , the vilification after the ' 98 world cup and the outpouring of love thereafter , Beckham will continue to be a sporting ambassador because he is a natural and is just a bloody good bloke , " he concluded . <p> " You do n't have to look too far to see the demonstrable impact he had on the London 2012 Olympic bid to see how his ambassadorial status will continue when the boots are finally hung up .

Grifols is seeking to buy fellow plasma protein drug maker Talecris in a USD 3.4bn deal that was announced in June . <p> The Talecris-Grifols merger would , if approved by the Federal Trade Commission , control approximately 31% of the IVIG market , noted Howard Dorfman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ main competition is Baxter , which dominates the market . " Although smaller than the share of the market represented by the proposed Talecris-CSL merger , the merger still represents a significant consolidation of the market , " Dorfman said . <p> In late May 2009 , the FTC authorized a suit blocking a bid by CSL , which also makes plasma protein products , to take over Talecris . According to the FTC complaint , if the CSL-Talecris deal had been consummated , " CSL would have just one significant competitor -- Baxter International . The other two industry firms , Grifols and Octapharma are much smaller , with market shares in the single digits , and limited ability to expand their presence in the United States .

We discovered this from BBC Lancashire , which simply attributed this to " the problems on the M6 " , without further mention of what these problems were or what progress had been made in solving them . <p> Essentially the whole of Lancashire was paralysed , while the police no doubt were still trying to persuade the man to come down quietly . But we were n't allowed to hear this , no doubt for fear that several thousand motorists might leave their cars and form a lynch mob .

On the surface it sounds fine that saving life is worth any degree of sacrifice , but people should not be encouraged to believe that they can rely on getting away with this behaviour . <p> In future , if someone threatens to jump off a motorway bridge , the motorway must indeed be closed , so that he ca n't kill a motorist by jumping straight in front of his car , but for 10 minutes only . The police should use that time to talk him down , but make it clear that after ten minutes they will come for him . <p> If he jumps , he jumps , and the police dash in and pick up the pieces .

Determination <p> Media captionPhilippine police end Manila bus hijack <p> The first officers who tried to storm the bus were driven out by gunshots from the hostage taker , former policeman Rolando Mendoza . " They showed great courage to go on board . It 's very crowded , just one aisle down the middle of the bus . But once you get on board it 's not unexpected you are going to be fired at .

Lost opportunity to disarm the gunman <p> Image caption Mendoza 's gun was not always raised <p> There were numerous opportunities to restrain the gunman , Mr Shoebridge believes .

Lost opportunity to shoot the gunman <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the gunman was standing alone , during the course of the day , and could have been shot by a sharpshooter .

Either this possibility did not occur to the officers in charge , he adds , or they considered it and decided to carry on talking . <h> 5 . Satisfying the gunman 's demands <p> " I wondered why the authorities just did n't give in to all of his demands , " says Charles Shoebridge . " A promise extracted under force is not a promise that you are required to honour .

Televised proceedings <p> The gunman was able to follow events on television , revealing to him everything that was going on around him . This was a " crucial defect in the police handling " , Mr Shoebridge says . He adds that police should always consider putting a barrier or screen around the area , to shield the scene from the cameras and keep the hostage taker in the dark . <h> 7 . No element of surprise <p> It was clear to the gunman what the police were doing at all times , not only because the whole incident was televised , but also because they moved " laboriously slowly " , Mr Shoebridge says .

" When you saw the camera view from above , it was clear there was little command and control of the public on the ground , " he says . <h> 9 . Using the gunman 's brother to negotiate <p> Relatives and close friends can be a double-edged sword , Mr Shoebridge says . While they may have leverage over the hostage taker , what they are saying can not be easily controlled .

Insufficient training <p> In some parts of the Philippines , such as Mindanao , hostage taking is not an uncommon occurrence , so the country has some forces that are well trained in the necessary tactics .

After smashing the windows , one of the officers eventually put some CS gas inside , though " to what effect was not clear " he says . A unit involved in this work , needs to be " trained again and again , repeatedly practising precisely this kind of scenario , " he says .

@@1607239 <h> You are here : <h> Cool As Ice DVD review <h> At the height of his creative powers , pop rapper Vanilla Ice starred in Cool As Ice , a kind of early-90s Rebel Without A Cause . But has time been kind to Ice 's movie ? <p> Sometimes a thing seems like a good idea , but then it 's not . I imagine that remaking Rebel Without A Cause with Vanilla Ice probably did n't seem like a good idea for long but , apparently , it did for long enough to sign everyone up for Cool As Ice . That being said , it clearly dawned on them that what they were doing was dreadful before the cameras started rolling , because the finished film does not play like a movie being made by people who are taking what they do seriously . <p> When the chance to review Cool As Ice came up , I naturally jumped at it . It was only after I put the DVD into my player that I was able to properly assess what I was doing . <p> " Oh wait , " I reasoned . " I actually have to watch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ write a review that is n't just a load of cheap shots at the guy because he dressed silly and made a terrible song 20 years ago . This is a terrible idea . " <p> Fortunately , there was plenty in Cool As Ice to keep me entertained , even if it was n't for the right reasons . It 's hard to grumble too much about any film that , in the first ten minutes , features Vanilla Ice on a motorbike attempting to race a horse , all sound tracked by a DJ scratching and the voice of an unseen presence , presumably God , saying , " Ah , yeah ! " <p> The plot of Cool As Ice is about as relevant to it being entertaining as my scrotum is to the fight for world peace . They exist in spite of each other . <p> The film starts with an entirely unrelated music video that lasts for about four minutes . You find you stop fast forwarding just in time to catch Ice and his pals rolling into town on motorcycles . Whilst driving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ takes his eye . He steals her notebook and then gives it back to her , which is his pick-up method of choice . He also launches into some pretty harsh , unprovoked dissing of her boyfriend ( do n't worry , the boyfriend turns out to be a total chump ) . <p> As Vanilla Ice sets about romancing the girl , her father sets about ignoring some threats from a couple of tough-as-teardrops gangsters . It turns out that her family became part of a witness protection program after her father made enemies of some crooked cops . He simply does n't have time to deal with the problem the villains pose . He 's too busy tutting loudly and being concerned with his only daughter 's budding relationship with a colourfully dressed buffoon on a motorbike . <p> As you might expect , the gangsters kidnap the ten-year-old boy contingent of her family ( in this instance , one member ) and have him record a tape version of his own ransom note . Whilst the two parents of the family stupidly think this is the opportune @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a better idea . She does the only thing a person would logically do if a member of their family was kidnapped . She steals the ransom note and goes straight to Vanilla Ice . <p> Ice then rounds up his posse of bikers and heads after the villains , saves the day and then rides into the sunset , stopping only briefly to drive his bike over a car . Then another unnecessarily long music video breaks out . <p> There are a few genuine positives to be enjoyed from Cool As Ice . One is that the film is actually quite pleasantly colourful . It 's a hyper-tacky music video looking affair . If you have a look at Vanilla Ice 's trousers on the front cover of the DVD , they 're fairly representative of the entire film . It looks a bit like Pee-wee 's Playhouse , but for surly teenagers . <p> The other positive is that it 's short . That may sound like a backhanded compliment , but it 's not . The film knows how long it needs to stick around and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you skip through the two music videos that bookend the film ( and you really ought to ) it 's a breezy affair . <p> The difficult thing with this film is , it 's basically impossible to assess . How can you judge a film that features a montage of Vanilla Ice failing to learn how to ride a horse ? It 's like trying to start a fist fight with the concept of karma . I do n't really know what to say . <p> The performances are all alright . I mean , no one is particularly good , but they all seem to understand what 's going on here . No one appears to be under the impression that they 're genuinely making a film . I 'm pretty sure a memo went around to the entire cast telling them not to worry , as no one would be watching . Just have fun , guys . <p> The memo , unfortunately , did not find its way onto the desk of Vanilla Ice . Or rather , he probably did get the memo , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such , he postures around like a gold plated tit and has a constant look of impervious confidence on his face . Who can blame him ? After all , this was the film that was going to launch him into movie stardom . <p> Ice 's unintentionally silly delivery of every line , coupled with the slang heavy script , now heavily dated , provides a few cheap laughs , but would be grating if they were n't featured in such a silly film . It seems that the only person not in on the joke is Ice . <p> I like to imagine that the tone of the film was explained to him several times , but it just could n't penetrate his ice-cold understanding . <p> " Vanilla , listen . The film 's just a bit of fun for everybody . Try to play it a bit more camp . Show everyone that you get that this film is silly . " <p> " The Iceman is taking home the Oscar , yo ! " <p> " No . There 's no way . It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bit wacky . People will credit you with some self-awareness and they 'll think you 're alright . " <p> " Cool . I 'm with it . " <p> " So , you 'll play it up a bit ? " <p> " Me and the homies gon ' play it real James Dean . Smooth and cooking , aiight . " <p> While there 's no evidence that such a conversation ever took place , I 'm pretty sure that it did . <p> Much of the film 's appeal might have disappeared in bigger budget movie . Had the bar fight scene involved better choreography and been performed by proficient stunt men , the film would be missing one of its highlights . ( It somewhat undermines Vanilla Ice 's projected tough guy image when he ca n't even convincingly pretend to beat people up . ) <p> Similarly , the threat posed by the two unarmed gangsters ( presumably to keep the film kid friendly ) seems small . It 's hard to be too concerned when anyone could easily neutralise them by bringing three people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Three average sized guys who have never been in a fight before could probably do it . <p> The combination of what 's happening onscreen , the silliness , the colours , the strange and uneven acting , gives the film the feel of a TV advertisement . At no point would I have been surprised to see the lead character look directly into the screen and say , " The Iceman says drink Pepsi , yo . The soda for my generation . Best served ice cold and enjoyed with your homies , player . " I would have really liked that . <p> I could happily spend all day talking about the weird things that go in Cool As Ice . I 'd like to take up a whole paragraph on the ending when , having been thanked by the father of the boy he 's saved , Ice says , " It does n't really matter . " There 's a non-dead 10-year-old that says it did matter a bit . <p> I also wanted to cover the heart-breaking speech the father character gives that explains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swear I 'm not making that up . Finally , we have a film brave enough to tackle the subject of cool discrimination . ) <p> I also wanted to explain why I 'm fairly sure that Vanilla Ice 's character in this film represents the spirit of Christmas . Still , I 'm sure you get the gist by now . <p> So , would I recommend Cool As Ice ? Depending on who you are , yeah . If you 're a big snarkasm fan and like laughing at silly fashion trends from 20 years ago and outdated slang , you 'll have a ball . You might also like it if you 're into 80s and 90s television for kids and teenagers . <p> In fact , I was expecting there to be a wavy fade away at the end that revealed that the whole film had been a fever dream in the mind of Saved By The Bell character Zack Morris about what his life would be like in ten years if he became a rapper . <p> As I figure it , he fell unconscious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drawer . The dream ends as he gets shaken awake by his sidekick , Screech , who has been keeping watch and has spotted Mr. Belding coming . The kids then head to the Max for burgers , and Zack learns a lesson of some kind . <p> Cool As Ice is not offensively bad . It 's quite pleasant to look at and it has a confusing nice streak running through the middle of it . It 'd probably work if you 're a group of people in your twenties and you 're drinking beer . <p> Most importantly , though , it 's a film with a message . Unfortunately , that message was drowned out by the various messages written on Vanilla Ice 's coat . I spotted ' Yep Yep ' , ' Deep ' , ' Sex Me Up ' , ' Down By Law ' , ' Hype ' , ' Dance ' , ' Oh Yeah ' , ' Dope ' and ' Roll ' . I did n't see ' Fresh ' , but I assume it 's there . I wonder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rough draft of the coat for Cool As Ice 2 : Best Served Chilled . <p> Heartbreakingly , the disc features no bonus material .

The Catholic culture here is imbued with the memories of those roots , for good and for ill . During the Troubles in Ulster , emotions and anxieties ran high here , as relatives were caught up in the mayhem and violence . It was inevitable that Catholics in these parts would take sides with the Civil Rights Movement , and their republican politics .

The Celtic fans counter that their songs have nothing to do with religion , but are political in nature . But hatred is hatred , and it does n't matter what initial instigation and shape it has . I have always celebrated the Irish culture from which I grew , but I have always been appalled at the ease with which many fellow Celtic fans were able to bestow their support on the IRA . <p> In the 1970s Scottish and English football was blighted by the entryism of the extreme Right .

@@1616236 <h> Prelude to Meltdown : An interview with Bert Dohmen <p> In 2007 when most investment analysts and economists were downplaying the developing credit market troubles , Bert warned investors that the probability was very high that the troubles would escalate into full-blown crisis and would produce a crash of historic proportions . He chronicled the developing credit crisis in the pages of his newsletter and also published a book in early 2008 , Prelude to Meltdown , which provided his insightful views on the emerging crisis in depth . The book will surely go down as a landmark written by a financial visionary who was several steps ahead of his peers . <p> Dohmen writes the widely read Wellington Letter investment advisory , which has provided top-notch forecast and analysis of U.S. and global financial and economic trends since January 1977 . His newsletter has received many #1 ratings by the top ratings services and has forecasted every bear market using sophisticated technical analysis . Bert also frequently appears as a guest on financial television , including CNN 's Moneyline , CNBC and FOX News . Over the last 30 years he has been a favorite speaker at the largest investment conferences . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his forecast of the credit crisis , the likelihood of another financial crisis , the bond market " bubble " and the outlook for gold . His answers were as always refreshing and full of insight . Following is a transcript of that interview . <p> Q : Could you tell us what first attracted you to the financial markets and how you got your start in it ? <p> Dohmen : I started trading when I was in graduate school and I was quite interested in the financial markets . Technical analysis was n't widely in use at the time . I started with $400 and using advice from a major brokerage firm that quickly imploded . They got me into a stock with a 10 percent yield -- I though the broker was a genius to find me such a stock . But the problem was they had only one copper mine and it was later nationalized . So that 's when I decided that if I was going to be successful in the markets I would have to do it myself . So I spent a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fundamental analysis was n't in accordance with my philosophy because it only shows you what happened in the past . And I wanted to know what the big money was doing now . And the big money means the well informed money and that you can only find out with price and volume analysis and the charts . <p> Q : What prompted you to write the book , Prelude to Meltdown ? <p> Dohmen : I wrote in the book in 2007 and it was published in early 2008 and it predicted the global near meltdown . I wanted to get it out because I said that people in 50 years will still be talking about it and wondering why no one forecast it . <p> Q : You were one of the very few analysts who correctly foresaw the approaching danger of the credit storm and you wrote extensively about it in Prelude to Meltdown . <p> Dohmen : It was n't all that difficult throughout 2007 to figure out what was coming . At the end of the book I stated that the only question is whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ altogether or if would be five minutes before twelve before they do . And now we know even in the words of the top guys at the Federal Reserve and the Treasury that we did get up to five minutes till twelve . <p> Q : Do you find it amazing that so few financial experts were focusing on the problems that were building up in the early stages of the credit crisis ? <p> Dohmen : For me it was really very strange that so few people were looking at that . It really was n't that difficult . Throughout 2007 in our Wellington Letter I had been writing about all the proverbial canaries . I had a section in the newsletter describing " more canaries in the mine . " The April 2007 issue was headlined , " The perfect financial storm , " and it listed all the reasons why . The thing is that sub-prime mortgages were starting to go sour . I knew that the sub-prime mortgages had been packaged up by Wall Street firms as CDOs and then sold around the world . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agencies they were able to take this junk and take tranches of that and get AAA ratings from the agencies , which was just amazing when you consider that there are only four U.S. corporations which are strong enough to get a AAA rating on their bond in the United States . It was just absolutely amazing . Then I found out that the models that these ratings agencies were using were mathematical models that justified the AAA ratings and they had no provision in that mathematical formula for a decline in housing prices . This was an absolute shock and surprise to me as to how they could look at the huge absolute speculative frenzy in the real estate market and not think we were going to have a crisis . And at the time I was saying that real estate prices would go back down to the 2002 levels . In other words the entire speculative bubble created by excess credit would be wiped out and we 'd be going back to basics . <p> For example , here in Nevada you had 32 percent gains in housing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gain . And people started believing that it was normal and sustainable . Well it 's not . Over the years you 're happy if housing goes up 5 percent a year if even that . <p> Q : It indeed appeared that the monetary authorities waited until the proverbial last minute before acting . Is there anything the Fed and the Treasury could have done to mitigate the credit crisis in 2007 and 2008 ? <p> Dohmen : The regulators were in collusion with Wall Street . This was n't a failure of capitalism , this was a failure of regulatory agencies and in my opinion some of it was criminal . The Wall Street firms , the big ones , were limited to 12-to-1 margin based on their capital until 2004 . Then the head of the SEC , who was a former founder of a very large Wall Street firm , and he had been able to field these Wall Street guys and after that they decided to increase the permitted leverage I believe to 34-to-1 . That was absolutely incredible . I remember whey that happened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3 percent decline in their speculative investment it wipes out all of the equity . " I wondered how could this be allowed . These guys were just asking for failure . The reason it was allowed because the higher the leverage the higher the potential profits . And I guess the theory was if something goes wrong the taxpayer would pay the losses . They get the profits , the taxpayer gets the losses . And that 's exactly what happened . <p> We had other things like that in other areas of the housing market . Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were basically coerced into giving mortgages who had no jobs , no income and no net worth . Yet they got mortgages because the Congressmen said that 's what we have to do . You know the names of these Congressmen . So it was really excess of government , excess of speculation and there was no rationale behind it . Even right now when you consider that the FHA is making mortgage loans with only 3 percent down -- 3 percent down ! Nothing has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this crisis is not over . We are just in the middle of it . There 's another 50 percent to go . <p> Q : What were some of the signs you saw as being potentially ominous in the months leading up to the 2008 bear market ? <p> Dohmen : For one thing , the 5-year bull market top was in October 2007 . When it became clear that mark-to-market accounting rules was going to come in early November 2007 , all the big boys got out in October ' 07 . So the bear market started with the mark-to-market rule . The bear market ended in March of 2009 . The mark-to-market rule was changed in April of that year but in March 2009 the U.S. Congress told the FASB , which makes the rules , " You 'd better change that rule or we 're going to do it for you . " That was known in March 2009 and that produced the bottom of the bear market at that time . Wall Street is really a game and if you know how to play it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they do . <p> Q : Do you think the abolition of the uptick rule in July 2007 played a part in the stock market crash of 2008 ? <p> Dohmen : Yes , I really do . In fact when that was done I said something is being prepared to enable some of the very big trading operations to sell short without having to wait for an uptick . I do n't think anything happens in the financial markets by coincidence , so I really think that was part of it . Why would they suddenly eliminate the uptick rule which had been in effect since 1933 and did a good job ? <p> Q : The SEC never did reinstitute the uptick rule , did they ? <p> Dohmen : No , they never have reinstituted it and that is why we 're going to have another crash . <p> Q : If worse comes to worst , can the government afford another bank bailout ? <p> Dohmen : Oh sure , the government can always create money and they do n't even have to print it now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ron Paul gave us a tour of the Bureau of Printing and Engraving and they were so proud because they had the latest printing presses , Heidelberg presses from Germany . Of course we all laughed because Germany had lots of experience printing money during the hyperinflation of the 1920s . But it 's created electronically today . Now all they have to do is add a few zeroes to make billions turn into trillions . <p> Q : One thing I 've always admired about your work is your ability to predict the direction of the economy much better than most professional economists . What are the main indicators you look at to analyze the U.S. economy ? <p> Dohmen : Credit availability is the main thing I look at to forecast the economy . Money supply M3 was going down at an 8% annual rate . You only see that in depressions . Money velocity is also declining . You do n't see such things in a good economy . It all ends up with credit . It 's also important to look at commercial and industrial loans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extremely important . <p> Q : What are some other indicators investors should be watching ? <p> Dohmen : When analyzing the economy they should also look at things like credit growth . I consider credit growth , or the lack thereof , to be the most important indicator . Everything else merely follows . Job growth is also an important economic factor dependent on credit growth . If there is no credit growth then there wo n't be any real job growth . Consumer spending is the third most important thing to analyze for stock investors . If there is no job growth then spending will depend on consumers who have jobs feeling more optimistic and spending more . We have seen this over the past 16 months . Consumer spending is a coincident indicator and it helped us identify the 2007 market top . When spending starts declining , so will the stock market . <p> In terms of the stock market , technical analysis is also very important .

If you try to use fundamental analysis to predict the stock market you will come out on the losing end . <p> Q : Let 's talk about China for a minute . If the U.S. enters another financial crisis , do you believe China is self-sufficient enough to withstand the lack of demand for its products from the U.S. or will China 's economy suffer ? <p> Dohmen : I think there 's a good chance the next crisis will start in China . Everyone right now is saying , " Look at the gains made by China 's housing and financial markets over the last few years . You have to look at what is happening in the last 2-3 months , though , not just the year-to-year trend . An incredible $1 trillion in loans were issued to Chinese borrowers last year . Also earlier last year , China 's regulatory officials tightened lending standards in an attempt at curbing speculation but it 's just another case of governments believing they can solve problems in the financial markets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They 've seen a tremendous decline in home sales . Home sales are up 8% for the year so far but what the media is n't telling you is that home sales were up an 60% percent or so before the real estate crisis hit . The Chinese economy is coming to a screeching halt . <p> Q : Do you still consider U.S. Treasuries to be safe long-term investments ? Is there a chance the government may someday default on its debt obligations ? <p> Dohmen : Define " someday . " <p> Q : Say in the next 3-5 years . <p> Dohmen : No , the government wo n't default on its debt in the next 3-5 years . I 've always believed that when it comes to the financial markets , what everyone knows is not worth knowing . Applying that now , everyone knows that bonds are in a bubble and that the stock market will offer a much better return than bonds , and that you should not buy bonds as a result . I take that as a signal that bond prices may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a 4 percent yield declines to 2 percent , then the price of the bond may double . <p> Another reason why Treasury bonds are being purchased right now by investors all over the world is that Treasuries are a safe haven . I believe the rally in the bond price reflects a global flight to safety . Gold is the only real money , as it ca n't be produced at will with the printing press or the computer . Therefore , it 's a store of value . U.S. Treasuries are also a safe haven for the big money . Not only is there no default risk , but as the globe goes into a decade-long period of deflation , yields will drop and bond prices will rise . <p> I think the real question is whether the bubble is in the bond market or in the fact that everyone is calling it a bubble . The consensus that bonds are in a bubble seems to be the real bubble . <p> Q : You correctly predicted the top of the last major gold bull market back in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you still see gold as a worthwhile investment for the long term ? <p> Dohmen : In 1981 we had ridden that entire gold bull market in the ' 70s and then gave a sell signal when gold broke $694/oz. on the downside . We sold and then we sold short and rode it all the way down to $400 , which was really a nice trade . At that time my work showed that gold would then go into a 20 year down market based on cycles .

It could be anything from retro NES debut Castlevania to cult classic PS1 epic Symphony of the Night . <p> Whatever the case , the name ' Castlevania ' alone is enough for us to drop the rope-swinging , castle-exploring , Dracula-duking adventure series directly on this list of most anticipated games . <p> Fruit Ninja <p> Another game that cut its teeth on iPhone , Fruit Ninja is addictive , joyously physical and juicy - so , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ iPhone and iPad , this food-slicer from Halfbrick has you slashing up strawberries and coconuts in a dojo for high scores and unlockable extras . <p> It 's probably the most simple , basic and elementary idea in the world - here 's a banana , decimate it - but boy is it addictive . <p> Carneyvale Showtime <p> Back when the Xbox Live Indies service ( a series of home-made titles created by bedroom programmers for Xbox 360 ) was first launching , we pretty much wrote it off as a collection of buggy garbage , unplayable junk , and massage simulators . <p> But then Carneyvale Showtime - a clown-flinging puzzler - appeared : a game evidently made with such care and a serious attention to detail that you 'd swear it was a professionally built XBLA title . <p> Gamers stood up and took notice , and evidently so did Microsoft .

This panel you see today is a 56-inch panel but the one we 're bringing to market will be a 52-inch model , " said Tobias . <p> " How it works is that we put a lenticular lens over the panel which creates a left view and a right view , each eye then sees a slightly different image and that 's why you perceive 3D .

Missoni , Ralph Lauren , even Jigsaw , have been crossing over into furniture and homewares for a decade or two and , even in these downturned times , there 's no sign that they 're going to stop . In the 1990s , Versace 's plates , towels and throne-like chairs seemed to be everywhere ; the label 's signature Greek-key pattern , which decorated everything from sunglasses to bags to the bottom of Gianni 's Miami pool , being seen as quite a status symbol in some quarters ( and the height of vulgarity in others ) . Then Mr Armani decided it was time to play house , too . Armani/Casa entered the market in 2000 with the sort of square-edged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ casual feel of Armani 's perfect greige suits . <p> Now there are some more recent arrivals from the fashion world to take up the furniture challenge . The trendy Swedish denim company Acne is having a go , as is the avant-garde designer Martin Margiela . Diane von Furstenberg will be launching a homeware line in 2011 ; Diesel started one last year , and is now moving into lighting . Even A Bathing Ape , the uber-fashionable Japanese streetwear label , has created its own version of the Eames Plastic Shell chair , originally designed by Charles and Ray Eames in the 1950s , decorating the outside with the Bape trademark camouflage print . While the label is much loved in the hip-hop community for its graphic T-shirt designs , starburst sneakers and incredibly expensive hoodies , its founder , Nigo , is also a huge fan of mid-century modern . " I am a collector of furniture by the French designer Prouv ? and Eames , " he says . " I like that period . The design seems more modern and forward than that of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> But are these furniture ranges actually any good ? " I always used to be a bit worried about the fashion/furniture crossover , " says Ross Urwin , the creative director of furniture and lifestyle at the prestigious Hong Kong store Lane Crawford . " But some of them are doing a really good job now . We tested the market last season with a Diesel sofa , dining chairs and coffee table and they sold really well . So now we 're adding the range of lighting they launched at the Milan Furniture Fair in April . " As you might expect , the Diesel range , called Successful Living , aims to be alternative , young and edgy ; and , in its own Italian way , it is . There 's a side table with a streaky , worn vintage paint finish , for example , and a sofa with stone-washed linen upholstery . The lighting , meanwhile , would come under the heading " funky industrial " . Far from being a throwaway side project , Diesel has gone into partnership with the high-end Italian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lighting . The quality is as serious as that of its jeans . <p> For any store , of course , the whole point is to lure the sort of fashion consumer who 'll happily spend ? 180 on denim , into the home department . Does it actually work ? According to Janita Khangura , the assistant homeware buyer at Selfridges , it most certainly does . The London , Birmingham and Manchester stores stock Orla Kiely , Jigsaw ( bed linen and bath products ) and Missoni . The latter , in particular , is " fantastic business " , Khangura says . " It 's such a trusted textile brand , and it 's known as high fashion ; customers love it . You would n't believe how much we sell . " ( The Middle Eastern customer , apparently , is especially Missoni-mad . ) <p> Acne 's new sofas and armchair , which were first unveiled in Paris in January , are on show in its astonishing new Dover Street store in London ( all four floors of a Mayfair town house ) . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Liberty , upholstered in the vintage " Bianca " print -- white flowers on a royal blue background . " It 's a classic print from the archive , " says Liberty 's home buyer , Michelle Alger , " and it 's the first time we 've done something like this . But Acne has such a strong cult following that we are hoping it will bring all the fashionistas up to the fourth floor . " For those who are wedded to Acne 's jeans heritage , the sofas will also be shown in denim . <p> Of all the brands , Acne is possibly the most obvious label to make the crossover . Its name is an acronym for " Ambition to Create Novel Expressions " ( not a reference to a nasty pubescent skin condition ) , and the company started as a creative agency in 1996 , but ended up mutating into a denim brand when it sent out 100 promotional pairs of jeans as gifts . Since then , it has added fashion ranges for women , men and children , as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and publishing , too . It does n't advertise , but instead produces its own magazine , the Acne Paper , twice a year . <p> Just like Nigo , the company 's creative director , Jonny Johansson , is passionate about design . He is particularly keen on the 1910-20s " Swedish Grace " period , when a stark form of neoclassicism was developed by the country 's leading architects . Johansson 's Stockholm house was designed by the Swedish architect Torben Grut in 1906 ( he went on to design the city 's 1912 Olympic Stadium and the royal family 's Solliden Palace ) and the company 's Old Town offices occupy a grand old bank . " We 're not modernists , more like neoclassicists , " Johansson says as he explains how the furniture was developed . " I took the New Berlin chair and sofa design of one of Sweden 's most famous 20th-century designers , Carl Malmsten , scanned it in 3D , put it into the computer and squashed and squeezed it . " The result is a series of three sofas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and two armchairs . It 's neoclassical elegance with a 21st-century twist . For Johansson , the venture is also a rebranding exercise -- for Sweden . " Swedes are known for their functionality , " Johansson says , " and with these products we want to reposition what Swedish means . They are much more romantic than functional . " <p> Meanwhile , at Maison Martin Margiela , the Paris-based fashion house known for wilfully challenging clothes , often with a body-defying silhouette , the furniture follows in the spirit of the Margiela stores ' unique interior design which mixes trompe l'oeil and various objects clad in white cotton covers .

McKay , a rapidly growing firm whose clients include BAE and New Zealand 's Royal Navy , uses 3ami MAS to prevent employees from downloading confidential company files onto personal USB mass storage devices and removing those files from the premises without authorisation . <p> Tim Ellsmore <p> McKay 's growth was around 40 percent last year , thanks partly to a string of major contract wins in the superyacht market and partly to the firm 's continued success in the aviation and diesel power generation markets . Considering McKay 's high-profile client list , specialist knowledge and 73 years of experience , it comes as no surprise that the value of McKay 's intellectual property is extremely high . <p> " McKay 's intellectual property is broad in its nature , and covers items like strategic plans , customer databases , business development information @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's CEO .

" <p> McKay started considering employee computer monitoring and auditing software when the company " became suspicious that one or two staff members may have been looking to acquire our intellectual property , " said Graeme Bratty , McKay 's manager of finance . <p> " We looked at a number of options , but MAS was the only one that was very comprehensive for a reasonable price , " said Bratty .

It can also be used in conjunction with encrypted biometric fingerprint-scanning authentication to create " official " and highly secure company USB memory sticks that can then be monitored and audited so that leaks , losses , and inappropriate activity can be traced to the original culprit . <p> Installation of 3ami MAS was " very quick , " said Bratty , " with maybe half a day getting shared folder permissions correct . Remote deployment made it simple .

In view of this , the provisions contained in the two national laws would take priority over state legislation enacted under Article 246(2) ( read with Schedule VII List II Entry 54 ) , and under which first charge had been created in favour of the state in respect of sales tax dues . Emphasising the non obstante clauses contained in Section 34(1) of the Recovery Act and Section 35 of the Securitisation Act , the appellants argued that even though the language of Section 38-C of the Bombay enactment and Section 26-B of the Kerala enactment suggested that state legislation had been given overriding effect in regard to other laws , the courts were duty bound to give full effect to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respondent states of Maharashtra and Kerala contended that despite the national pieces of legislation containing non obstante clauses , Section 38-C of the Bombay enactment and Section 26-B of the Kerala enactment , as well as similar provisions contained in other state legislation by which first charge was expressly created on the property of a dealer or any other person liable to pay sales tax , could not be treated to be inconsistent with the central legislation . They argued that there was no provision in either national enactment creating a first charge in favour of banks , and consequently the provisions contained in state legislation creating a first charge in respect of the dues of sales tax could not be treated to be inconsistent with central legislation . Kerala further contended that the levy and collection of tax was a sovereign function as well as a necessity for the state , and as such the state had plenary power to legislate on that subject to the exclusion of any specific provision in national acts creating first charge in favour of the banks . <p> Decision <p> The court observed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the national acts , the provisions contained in those acts would not override the other legislation . The court also observed that the non obstante clauses contained in the national acts merely gave overriding effect to the provisions of those acts if there was anything inconsistent contained in any other law . The court held that Section 38-C of the Bombay enactment and Section 26-B of the Kerala enactment contained non obstante clauses and accorded express statutory recognition to the priority of the state 's charge over other debts . In other words , those sections and similar provisions contained in other state legislation not only created first charge on the property of the dealer or any other person liable to pay sales tax , but also gave overriding effect over other laws . <p> The court observed that if Parliament had intended to create first charge in favour of the borrower in priority over the first charge created under state legislation , it would have expressly incorporated provisions similar to those contained in other legislations such as : <p> the Workmen 's Compensation Act 1923 ; <p> the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Estate Duty Act 1953 ; <p> Section 25(2) of the Mines and Minerals ( Regulation and Development ) Act 1957 ; <p> Section 30 of the Gift Tax Act ; and <p> Section 529-A of the Companies Act . <p> In addition , Parliament would have ensured that notwithstanding a series of judicial pronouncements , the dues of banks , financial institutions and other secured creditors would have priority over the state 's statutory first charge in the matter of recovery of sales tax due . The court held that in the absence of any specific provision to that effect in the national pieces of legislation , it was not possible to read any conflict between the two national pieces of legislation on the one hand , and Section 38-C of the Bombay enactment and Section 26-B of the Kerala enactment on the other .

" He is my absolute hero , " said another . <p> There are n't that many athletes who can prompt so strong a reaction in people who only keep one eye on sport .

On the other hand , there is no doubt that there is something both moving and inspirational in reading his nursery school headmistress describe the encouraging effect on her current pupils of watching Bolt 's triple record-shattering , triple medal-winning Beijing outing -- and the improvements to the school he has provided out of the spoils of success . <p> What 's more , even through the pen of his ghost , Bolt 's amiable , relaxed voice seems to speak loud and clear . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ embarrassed by the fact that he won his Olympic 100 metres record while slowing down ; he was only really trying when he broke it again at the World Championships in Berlin a year later . <p> In the next breath he insists he is capable of bringing his time down to 9.4 .

That is why , no matter how fast I run the 100 metres , the 200 will always mean more to me , because of the effort I 've put in " . <p> But he also comes over as a likeable individual , who wears the mantle of role model with grace . He comes from a poor Jamaican background , his first races were on a track that had a two-foot dip towards the finish , and he has suffered both scoliosis ( which resulted in one leg being shorter than the other ) and injury , so one message of his book is that hard work and discipline can overcome almost anything . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bolt is only 24 and he admits that at times he has played too hard .

The decision ended a lawsuit between the Austrian Consumer Protection Association and the insolvency administrator of an Austrian issuer of profit participation certificates . <p> According to the ruling , the exclusion of ordinary and extraordinary termination rights regarding consumer profit participation certificate holders was found to be illicit , even though the certificates had been listed on a stock exchange . Furthermore , the Supreme Court dealt with the qualification of profit participation certificates and held that profit participation certificates constitute creditors ' rights in personam ( in the form of continuing obligations , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ result , due to their creditor status , the certificate holders have a more senior position ( compared to equity holders ) in the issuer 's insolvency . <p> Exclusion of termination rights in terms and conditions <p> The terms and conditions of the relevant profit participation certificates issuance did not foresee ordinary or extraordinary termination rights for profit participation certificate holders . The issuer 's insolvency administrator tried to justify the exclusion of termination rights for certificate holders by arguing that the certificates had been listed on a stock exchange and that such listing would allow an exit . Accordingly , the certificate holders would be entitled to sell their certificates , which in effect would be similar to a termination right . In addition , the insolvency administrator 's defence related to the argument that profit participation certificates should be treated similarly to non-voting preferred stocks or participation capital according to the Banking Act . In his view , the certificates resembled equity and should therefore not carry termination rights as holders of non-voting preferred stocks would not be entitled to termination rights as well .

The main reasoning for this view was that profit participation certificates do not entitle the holders to vote in a shareholders ' meeting or to challenge any decision by the shareholders of the issuer . Furthermore , the court held that profit participation certificates can not be compared to participation capital according to the Banking Act .

The court dismissed the issuer 's argument that the option to sell profit participation certificates on the stock exchange constituted an equivalent exit right for certificate holders compared to the early termination and repurchase right of the issuer . Even though a possibility to sell certificates on a stock exchange may generally constitute an equivalent right to end the certificate ownership ( compared to an issuer 's termination right ) , this is not the case in connection with profit participation certificates : in the given context , any increase in the issuer 's earnings would normally increase the value of the profit participation certificates .

There 's even a new 4.0-litre V8 engine added to the line-up , just in case you doubted change was afoot . <h> Come on ! How different is the ' new ' 2011 Continental ? <p> You 'll spot the new Conti from the front most easily : those Mulsanne-inspired speccy-four-eyes headlamps are distinctive , the inner lamps powered by xenon on low beam and LED on high beam ; the outer lenses are day running lights and illuminate entirely by diode . The Bentley grille now sits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new Continental alongside each other and you 'll be surprised by the diverging side profiles . Like the transition from Mk1 to Mk2 Audi TT , the glasshouse ( or DLO , in designerspeak ) is 26mm shallower , making for a more ' slammed ' appearance on the new Continental GT arriving in early 2011 . <p> The door handles are now on the side character line rather than breaking up the sheetmetal too . And see those door mirrors ? They 're the same as on a Mulsanne , they are . <h> How will the new Bentley Conti GT drive ? <p> Probably very like the last one , which is to say like the Orient Express on speed . The basic engineering architecture is carried over and the car has an identical wheelbase and overall length . However , there are numerous technical upgrades : the track is wider front and rear , new lighter steering knuckles are now hollow and the wheelarches have swollen to accommodate 20in rims as standard , though many will upgrade to newly available 21in wheels . <p> Drive is now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in normal driving , juggled by a Torsen central diff . The ZF six-speed gearbox is claimed to halve shift times using tech pioneered on the Supersports , but ZF 's eight-speeder is coming according to chief engineer Ulrich Eichorn ( and we 'd point out that enables hybridisation as seen on BMWs and future Jaguar Land Rover products ) . <p> Most importantly , the new Conti GT makes greater use of lightweight aluminium throughout . The front wing is now a singleformed aluminium piece ; the boot and bonnet are both made from aluminium too . Previously the bootlid and wings were steel -- all helping to contribute to a 63kg weight saving . <p> &gt;&gt; Click ' Next ' below to read more about the new 2011 Bentley Continental GT <h> And the new Bentley engines ? <p> The 6.0-litre W12 continues , uprated to 567bhp and 516lb ft all the way from 2000-5000rpm . But the big news is a new 4.0-litre V8 co-developed with Audi . And get this : it 's the engineering breakthrough promised in 2007 when Bentley promised a new powertrain to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hybrid power pack in sight ... <p> The new V8 is biofuel compatible and likely to be turbocharged when it arrives in early 2012 . The lower powered Continental will have global appeal -- with a lower price point in the UK and an appeal in markets such as China with a 4000cc tax break . No further information is available on the smaller lump . <h> What about inside the new Bentley Continental GT ? <p> We 've always loved the ambience in the Continental and all they 've done is magnify its strengths . There 's a new top-end Naim hi-fi , a 30GB hard drive , the maps are now powered by Google and double glazing is standard to hush any unseemly wind and road noise . <p> They say there 's an extra 46mm rear legroom thanks to new thinner seats ( the seatbelts are no longer integral ) but to be honest it 's still cramped back there and we 'd recommend waiting for the LWB Conti Flying Spur if you regularly ferry John Terry and Ashley Cole from Boujis to Chelsea . <p> Plenty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There 's a wider digital screen now with touch sensitive controls . And the best bit inside ? There 's now a 3mm foam layer under the leather dash to give a better squidge factor . It works -- brilliant tactile fun and better than layering hide on plastic . <h> Why the Bentley Continental is important to Crewe <p> The Continental is the model that transformed Bentley . They 've sold 23,000 Contis since 2003 ; up until its arrival , the company had sold just 16,000 cars in the previous 80 years . This boom sent Bentley sales rocketing from 1000 a year to 10 times that in just four years . <p> Problem is , buyers in this sector are especially fickle , warns global sales and marketing director Stuart McCollough . ' People come in and have a car for six or 11 months and then buy something new , ' he says . Buyers spending this cash want the latest thing , the newest toy . Hence time to upgrade the Continental family to tempt those buyers back for more of the same . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Conti range , expect them to start close to the current car 's ? 126k . Sales of existing Supersports , Continental Flying Spur and Continental GTC convertible will continue but in the fullness of time they too will be upgraded in a similar fashion . <p> &gt;&gt; Click ' Add your comment ' below and let us know what you think of the new 2011 Bentley Continental GT

I have seen a lot of Canada , but the arid landscape comes as a shock . Forget mountains , moose and Mounties : think cactus and the smell of sage . In high summer , temperatures top 100F ( 38C ) ; luckily , a series of elongated , cold blue lakes provides natural air-conditioning . Our first stop , overlooking Lake Osoyoos ( pronounced uh-soo-yuss ) , is at North America 's first aboriginal-owned and operated winery : the Nk'Mip Cellars ( pronounced inca-meep ) . <p> Whereas tribes in the US opened casinos on their reservations , the Nk'Mip opted for a resort with a spa , golf course and vineyard .

Even though the atrocity was carried out by Islamist extremists , the reaction of the American public was commendably restrained . By and large -- though there were exceptions -- they distinguished between the majority of Muslims and the terrorists who were prepared to create carnage in the name of a warped interpretation of their faith . This moderation was to be expected in a free country where people are at liberty to believe what they want and say what they think . <p> How , then , can we explain the situation in which America finds itself today , with religious tensions stoked to dangerously high levels ?

Americans thought they were going to liberate Afghanistan and Iraq from Islamist extremists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years , the distinction many Americans once drew between the Islamists and a well-integrated Muslim community has blurred . <p> Two events have come together to inflame emotions further across the globe . The insistence of a Muslim organisation on building a mosque close to where the Twin Towers once stood has forced many Americans , whose traditional instincts are to uphold the freedom of Muslims to worship where they please , to question the motives for choosing this particular site . Partly in response to this controversy , a hitherto anonymous Florida pastor , Terry Jones , decided to burn copies of the Koran . He , too , was free to do so ; but -- as with the New York mosque -- to exercise that liberty would not only be insensitive but dangerous , given threats of a violent reaction by Muslims around the world . Oddly , the Muslims who have denounced the pastor fail to see the parallels with the New York mosque , as do many American liberals . It took Sarah Palin , often mocked by the Left , to make the connection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ book as repugnant -- and Mr Jones was last night under pressure from saner voices to drop his plan . But just as worrying was the response of the Muslim world to one individual , whose congregation numbers just 50 . He has been condemned by every leading American politician , from President Obama down . He does not speak for America , for the West or for Christians . The intemperate , often violent , reponse of Muslims to the actions of such insignificant people shows an intolerance whose only beneficiaries are the Islamist extremists .

It boasts an annual worldwide travel insurance package which covers two adults up to the age of 65 and up to six children , and includes travel to the USA .

@@1627240 <h> Professor Julian Besag <h> Professor Julian Besag , who died on August 6 aged 65 , was an eminent statistician and played a vital role in developing mathematically-sound models for a host of practical problems -- from agricultural field trials to mapping the incidence of diseases . <p> His speciality was spatial statistics , in which data are pegged to geographic location .

When , aged 21 , he married Valerie , with whom he was to have a son , he even persuaded her to climb 14,000ft to the summit of the Allalinhorn on their honeymoon . <p> He briefly read Engineering at Cambridge before moving to Birmingham University to study Mathematical Statistics , graduating in 1968 .

@@1633237 <h> Cuba lay-offs reveal evolving communism <p> Cuba is to lay off huge numbers of state employees , in the biggest shift to the private sector since the revolution in 1959 . But this is not the end of communism in the country , writes Stephen Wilkinson of the Centre for Caribbean and Latin American Research and Consultancy . <p> The media frenzy that has followed the announcement that Cuba is to reduce its state workforce by 500,000 by the middle of 2011 , is similar to that which followed Fidel Castro 's throwaway remark last week that the Cuban model is n't working - it has largely missed the point . <p> This is not the end of communism or socialism in Cuba . <h> Working it out <p> Workers at the ministries of sugar , public health , tourism and agriculture will go first <p> The announcement yesterday by the Cuban Workers Confederation is highly significant and it does spell the final death knell of the old Soviet model of centrally planned socialism in Cuba , but it would be very wrong to interpret it , as some have , as the harbinger of free market capitalism and liberal democracy . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rhetoric of revolution and the discourse is very much one of deepening the socialist character of the system rather than one of shifting towards capitalism . <p> Unlike the prospect of suddenly being left without work that faces many in the UK , as the present government 's budget cuts loom , these cuts in Cuba are being undertaken after a long period of consultation with the trade unions and other organisations . <p> Workers know what is going to happen to them . The programme is to be undertaken in stages , the effect on people 's livelihoods is to be mitigated and it is important to understand that the announcement does not mean that all the 500,000 workers mentioned are to become unemployed . <p> A large number of them will be offered alternative employment opportunities and a good many will continue in their jobs but will cease to be employed by the state anymore . <p> This is a far cry from the egalitarian days when workers were expected to labour for no recompense other than their own moral good and of the country and fellow Cubans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ self-employed or become part of a workers ' cooperative . <p> Taxi drivers for example , or shop workers and workers in small manufacturing enterprises , all of whom are currently state employees , will essentially take over the administration of their own workplaces and earn their salaries directly from their takings or revenues rather than being a salaried state employee . <p> They will essentially be doing what they have always done - but they will no longer be on the state 's payroll . <p> In cases where workers are made redundant they will be encouraged to set up new business or transfer to other sectors . <p> This does of course imply a huge change towards a system in which the market dictates the distribution of goods and services and this in turn also implies other significant changes . <p> As one Cuban economist put it to me recently , the role of the state is to be transformed from being the administrator of economic activity to the regulator . <p> The state is therefore withdrawing a good deal of its paternalistic character . Workers will not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while out of work any more - they will be expected to look for and find work for themselves . <p> Workers will have to provide their own lunches instead of having a subsidised canteen and they will have to find their own way to work instead of being picked up by the company bus . <p> However , at the same time , the incentive to work will be enlarged through bonuses and pay based upon productivity . There is no longer an upper limit on what one may earn . <p> Workers will be encouraged therefore to move into unpopular jobs such as construction and agriculture by the possibility of earning more in those sectors . <p> Other sectors that the government says it is going to expand in the coming months are in oil , tourism , biotech and pharmaceuticals where it says there will be new job opportunities . <p> All of this is a far cry from the egalitarian days when workers were expected to labour for no recompense other than their own moral good and that of the country and fellow Cubans . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the ideological underpinning of the system . <p> There is by implication a shift towards greater individualism and self reliance and the acceptance that there will be differential incomes and therefore different living standards among the population . <p> Welfare is to be directed by means testing to where it is needed rather being applied universally regardless of individual income . <p> All this sounds very familiar to people in Britain , who have witnessed debates on these matters recently , but how this will play out in the longer term in Cuba will be interesting to see . <p> Another interesting area to watch will be how the changes may increase the pressure in the US for the administration there to change its policy towards the island . <p> As the market increases in Cuba and more people become self-employed and low level enterprises are freed to run themselves , those who are arguing for the US to engage with island in order leverage this process and move it further down the free market route will have a stronger basis for their case . <p> This news , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the other side of the Florida Straits more likely than ever . <h> Economic reform <p> April 2010 : Cuba begins turning over hundreds of state-run barber shops and beauty salons to employees <p> August 2010 : President Raul Castro says the role of the state is to be reduced in some areas , with more workers allowed to be self-employed or to set up small businesses <p> September 2010 : Cuba announces radical plans to lay off huge numbers of state employees to help revive the economy <p> However , it would be wrong in the short term to see the reforms as leading inevitably to a change in the political organisation inside Cuba . <p> Cuba is to remain a one-party communist state for the foreseeable future . <p> This leads some to suggest that the Cubans are following a Chinese or Vietnamese model .

Interestingly this includes encouraging workers ' co-operative enterprises . Might this be Cuba 's first step towards meeting Chavez half way ? <p> As with all things Cuban , we can only wait and see , but this is certainly a carefully planned change that has been four years in the making - since Raul Castro took over in 2006 - and will certainly not be as traumatic as commentators in the media have suggested . <p> Stephen Wilkinson is at the Centre for Caribbean and Latin American Research and Consultancy , London Metropolitan University

It was published in the peer-reviewed medical journal Gut . <p> The research was reported widely in the media , which emphasised its positive results rather than its limitations .

The researchers set out to answer these specific questions . <h> What did the research involve ? <p> The researchers included 2,279 people with bowel cancer and 2,907 healthy people , drawn from a large Scottish case-control study . People with cancer were recruited within 2 -- 3 months of diagnosis , while those without cancer were randomly drawn from a population register . The cases and controls were matched for age , gender and residential area .

They say it will leave poison on our dinner plates and spoil the marine environment . Its proponents , meanwhile , argue that a genetically modified salmon could help preserve the oceans and feed the world for decades to come . <p> The GM Atlantic salmon grows twice as fast as its wild cousin . Its genes have been artificially augmented with DNA taken from two other fish -- the Pacific Chinook salmon and an eel-like species called an ocean pout ( Zoarces americanus ) -- in order to boost the growth hormone that allows it continually to put on weight throughout the year . <p> After two decades of research and development , and almost as many years of legislative wrangling , the company behind the GM salmon believes that it now stands on the verge of an historic decision by the powerful US Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) that will open the way to the sale of genetically engineered meat and fish both in the United States and the rest of the world . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sort of labelling the GM salmon should be given , following an exhaustive scientific review which found there were few serious concerns about the risk either to human health or to the natural environment .

" There is no timeline on a decision on the application , but I would predict it more along the lines of months , rather than weeks , " she told The Independent . <p> The Massachusetts company AquaBounty Technologies believes it has done everything possible to show that farmed GM salmon will be both safe for humans to eat as well as being harmless to the marine environment -- although this had done little to quell the concerns of its detractors . <p> There is little risk of the GM salmon escaping to the wild , because they are designed to be grown in fish-farm tanks on land rather than in pens out at sea .

A coalition of 31 such groups in the US has stated their implacable opposition to a product they believe is potentially dangerous to human health and the environment , as well as cruel and painful for the GM fish , which they say are created to grow unnaturally fast . <p> If the FDA gives its approval , which many commentators believe is now inevitable given that its scientists have found little to argue against doing so , the opponents of the GM salmon insist that it should at least be clearly labelled as a product of genetic engineering .

GM animals , however , fall under different legal provisions and as such must receive formal approval before they can be sold for human consumption . <p> If , as expected , the FDA eventually approves the sale of the GM salmon , it will mark an important precedent in the technological changes to the human food chain that some scientists believe are essential if we are to feed the extra three billion people expected to be living on the planet by the middle of the century .

@@1642237 <p> It has survived a world war and been around the globe with all my belongings , more times than I care to count . But as I unpacked this last time , I realised that a chapter of family history , locked up in one battered , loose-leafed journal , was in danger of being lost forever . <p> Fortunately I had n't left it too late - and was able to transcribe and scan it , so that my siblings could have their own copies . But the original blue notebook , now 73 years old , was beginning to disintegrate - and it was high time it went to a better home . <p> The first part of the journal was written by my grandfather , Eric Lambert , who was not someone who normally kept a diary , but back then it was still a novelty to start a new life in the Far East . In November 1937 , Eric was transferred , with his wife , Ciss , and 10 year-old daughter , Molly , by the Royal Marines to Hong Kong . With five weeks at sea ahead of him , he needed a diversion . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thanks to his diary I have an insight into the sort of person he was . He threw himself into all the activities -- deck sports , fancy dress parties , bridge , and a " damn silly game " called Coffee Pot . I cringe when he decides to ignore a fellow passenger , an American , for the terrible sin of being " rather uppish " . But then he redeems himself , as there they are , five days later , playing poker together . <p> By mid-December 1937 , Eric drops his guard . Fed up with the enforced holiday , he 's desperate to get back to work , particularly once news comes through on the radio about the Japanese firing on British and American ships in the Yangtse . <h> Related Articles <p> One of the most telling entries is where he foreshadows the turmoil to come : " Things appear rather grim , but do n't think it will come to a showdown .

There were two U-boats on their tail , and they were told to carry their lifejackets with them at all times . <p> War came to their doorstep in 1941 , when they were evacuated from Singapore in another convoy , this time bound for Ceylon . They 'd been very lucky up until then . Molly and her school friend , Marjorie , had made it back to Singapore from their school in Cameron Highlands in Malaya , just before the Japanese cut it off . <p> When the bombs started falling on Singapore , my grandmother refused to leave without Eric . <p> But Ceylon was no more than a temporary haven .

They did n't know where they were going for most of the time , but with a ship full of young naval officers , only a few years older than she was , Molly was n't short of company . <p> What strikes me most is how stoical people were then , and the efforts those crews made to keep up morale on board . <p> On May 1 , 1942 , someone had evidently taken the trouble to find out it was Molly 's 16th birthday : " It is my birthday today , but we could n't celebrate it very much because we were n't allowed ashore . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at lunchtime because the Chief Steward found out about it , and made me a cake with 16 candles on it .

@@1642238 <p> As the Nineties dawned , London 's Shoreditch was n't the hive of culture it became after the dotcom boom , but rather a wasteland of warehouses and neglect . As the decade reached its midway point , however , Shoreditch sputtered into life , this cold husk slowly awakening into a thriving hub of creative activity , a rebirth that began , in no small part , thanks to the Blue Note . A three-storey nightclub in Hoxton Square , the Blue Note was run by Sav Remzi , founder of the Nuphonic record label , who 'd enjoyed success with his jazz club , the Red Eye ; tapping the services of a handful of hip London record labels , the Blue Note soon won a reputation for pioneering , successful and unique club nights . <p> " I used to live round the corner from the Blue Note , back when Old Street was still half-empty , " remembers future Ninja-employee and Ninja artist Jason Swinscoe . " The Blue Note had the hippest record labels running DJ sessions there , with lots of experimentation : James Lavelle running his Mo ' Wax club there , Talvin Singh 's Anokha @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night , around 7pm until midnight , cups on my shelves would rattle from the sub-bass coming from Goldie 's Metalheadz night . " <p> Ninja Tune began hosting their own night , Stealth , at the Blue Note in December of 1995 , following a successful launch party for DJ Food 's Recipe For Disaster album at the venue . " It 's rare to find a club owner willing to let you experiment , " remembers Coldcut 's Jonathan More , of Stealth . " Every great club night has been a combination of an open-minded club-owner , a wayward promoter , and a bunch of crazy people who want to do shit that nobody else is doing . " <p> " The very first night , there were queues around the block , " remembers Shane Solanki , who promoted the first nights . " We thought , ' what 's happening ? ' So many people market their club nights to fuck , but we were having fun , dicking around and enjoying ourselves , and our first night was a sellout ! " <p> It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Ministry Of Sound but , says Suzi Green ( who soon took over the running of Stealth , after Shane went travelling ) , " The Blue Note was n't like those clubs . People were n't dressing up to go to Stealth : it was dark and dingy , and the floor was sticky and dirty . But if the lights were out and there were pretty projections running , you did n't realise it was a shit-hole ! " <p> The club 's three floors allowed Ninja to host a variety of moods and environments across the different rooms . " We 'd have the Light Surgeons or Matt running visuals upstairs for the ' Chill-Out ' room , " remembers Suzi , " The middle floor had DJs , and the basement was a sweaty room with a stage that could just about hold five musicians , or four turntables for Ninja 's trademark mix sessions . You 'd struggle to get a drink , because people were dancing right up to the bar , to this mad mixture of music . One night a guy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the DJ ! " <p> Named Club Of The Year by NME in 1996 , Stealth was a perfect showcase for Ninja artists to perform and DJ , to get their music heard , and the label 's identity permeated everything from the ground-breaking visuals , to the collectible flyers designed by Strictly Kev . They welcomed DJ sets and performances from artists outside the stable , too . " Kruder &amp; Dorfmeister played their first UK set at Stealth , " remembers Shane , " and Squarepusher played bass music in the basement -- that was amazing . Bjork came down . And I had to turn Arthur Baker away one night , because it was just too rammed inside . He was all , ' Do n't you know who I am ? ' , and I said , I 'm sorry , that 's really not how we do business . Maybe if he 'd been Afrika Bambataa ... " <p> The queues that snaked around The Blue Note for every Stealth night , were drawn in by the vibe , the visuals , but most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the beginning of eclecticism coming back into the main room , " says Strictly Kev . " Before Stealth , the main room was just Techno or House , 4-on-the-floor stuff . We took the ethos of our Solid Steel show off the radio-waves and into the main room , playing everything from Drum'n'Bass , to Hip-Hop , to Funk , to Electronica , to Techno ... " <p> " I 'd never heard slow , heavy music like that in a club before , with the whole room going nuts to it , " remembers Simon Green , who would later record for Ninja Tune as Bonobo , of the night DJ Krush guested alongside DJ Food at the decks . " It was heavy and deep , rather than fast and loud , and that really made an impact . It was the most musically forward-thinking night out I 'd ever had .

Matt and Jon and Krush were DJing together , and the lights were coming up from behind them , and it just looked like some holy moment . The club was entirely packed and rocking , and I was sweating so much ... Best night of my life ... " <p> " Ninja Tune label compilation Funkjazztical Tricknology came out shortly before Stealth started up , which was great timing , " says Kev . " We had a hot compilation , a night at a very hot venue , and that just focused everyone , in 1996 , on Ninja Tune , and all the things that went on within it . That was the beginning of the first Golden era of Ninja , really . " <p> The success of the Stealth nights inspired the label to send their show on the road , as Suzi booked nights across the country -- and then later across Europe and the rest of the world -- featuring DJ sets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Up , Bustle &amp; Out and The Herbaliser , who had evolved into ' proper ' bands featuring live musicians alongside the turntables and sequencers . <p> The package tours ' ground-breaking bills of live artists and DJs would introduce countless new audiences to the proudly polymorphous Ninja brand , but there were sometimes struggles . " Venues could n't get around a night that featured live bands and DJs , " says Suzi , who quickly assumed the role of in-house Tour Manager . " They would n't have the right set-up for a live band , or it was a night-club and they were expecting DJs , so the punters did n't really show up until 1am . " <p> " We did a show with Coldcut in Italy in 1994 , " adds Kev , " and we played for about twenty minutes , and then all this whistling started . We thought they were loving it , but it became a cacophony of wolf-whistles , and that 's apparently how they diss you in Italy . What we were doing was just too new for them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Germany , with three DJs manning four decks onstage , basically scratch-jamming over all sorts of stuff ... People were scratching their heads , saying ' we 've never seen or heard anything like this before in our lives ' . And they got it , slowly . " <p> " Amon Tobin used to pretty much clear dancefloors on his first tour , because he was so ' out there ' , " says Ninja press agent Vez , of one label signing who underwent an intense ' trial by fire ' before audiences could catch up to what he was doing . <p> " The audiences did hate me , with a passion , " remembers Amon . " People were booing and trying to get me off the stage , and I had several projectiles thrown at me . But I felt , very strongly , that it was irrelevant to me whether someone wanted to hear it or not . I was going to do it anyway . " <p> " He was so fucking uncompromising , he just kept on doing it , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ branch , admiringly . " A year or two later , he was headlining 2000 person capacity venues , a massively-successful artist in his own right . " <p> Mostly , though , veterans of Ninja 's excursions harbour fond memories of their time on the road , playing their music in far-flung corners across the globe , and on grand stages closer to home . " I played a club in St Petersburg " remembers Funki Porcini 's James Braddell , " and suddenly there was this really bizarre smell , and it was hard to breathe . Someone had let off tear gas in the club , which is apparently quite common in Russia , as a joke : it 's their equivalent of a stink bomb . Some people left the club , but the rest took out handkerchiefs and just kept on dancing . I thought , if they 're fucking staying , I 'm staying too ! " <p> Touring with Ninja was nothing like legendarily scabrous Led Zeppelin biography Hammer Of The Gods : forget coke and groupies , Ninja artists struggled instead with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really competitive , " remembers Suzi . " They 'd all be up at dawn , trying to get to the second-hand record shops first . If there was a spare bunk in the bus , it would be full up with vinyl . That 's what it was all about for them : trainers , graffiti , records . " <p> Simon Green saw Kev and DJ partner DK take this competitiveness to ridiculous levels while touring North America . " We were in Vancouver , playing a show later that night on Vancouver Island . The ferry was going to take two hours to get us across , but DK ended up hiring a helicopter and choppering across in ten minutes , just so he could get to the record shop before Kev ! We bought so many records on that trip that we had to have crates of them shipped home separately , and the night after they arrived back in London , we had a tour reunion on the Solid Steel radio show , playing a mix composed entirely of records we 'd bought on tour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tours were particularly raucous , " laughs Kev . " Certain people got their groupie action , but I 'm not going to mention any names . Suzi 's going to write a book one day , and actually name names . That 's what she 's threatening , anyway ... " <p> Eighteen months after it had begun , Ninja Tune drew the regular Stealth nights to a close . " Someone asked Jon why we were closing the club when it was still packed out every month , and he said , ' All good things must come to a trend ' , " says Suzi . " The crowd was changing , and getting a bit more yobby , and it had lost its soul a bit . " <p> The next regular Ninja club night , Funkungfusion -- named after the then-current Ninja label compilation -- would take place nearby , upstairs at the 333 on Old Street , a venue even gnarlier than the Blue Note . " Not long before we arrived , it had been a really seedy club , " laughs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Fire Brigade and said we 'd overfilled the club , and when they arrived the club-owners said we had to ' lose ' fifty to a hundred people . So I had to shift all these people through this little door to the upstairs , yelling ' Free beer ! But only if you move fast ! ' They sat in the offices with a few crates of free beer until it was safe to come down . " <p> Stealth and Funkungfusion were only the first of an ongoing series of regular club nights and live events Ninja have run , including the You Do n't Know nights at the Big Chill House and Electrowerkz . The Xen Solid Steel nights at Cargo continued the ground-breaking blend of live acts and DJs in a venue that finally offered enough space for the live acts to spread their wings as well as Ninja club nights as far afield as Brussels , Paris , Tokyo and Osaka , and big tent shows at the Big Chill and Secret Garden festivals , along with 2004 's international touring A/V extravaganza , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on to the West End 's Ruby Lo , morphing into a DJ night with a door charge of ? 3 , with the line-ups kept secret until the night . Notable appearances include Four Tet , Rob Da Bank , Diplo 's first ever UK DJ set , a pre-King Cannibal Zilla , The Scratch Perverts and , of course , a host of Ninjas . <p> " Ruby Lo was a cheesy West End bar , but it suited us , " remembers DK . " We wanted people to drop in after work , to sit and listen to the music , or to take to the dancefloor if they felt like it . It was like the radio show , in a club format , and it ran for two years . We had some brilliant guest DJs : Kentaro , Steinski , Coldcut ... Luke Vibert came down one night , with Aphex Twin in tow , and they were more people with their cameras out taking pictures of Aphex than there were dancers , which kind of spoilt it , really . After two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his wife had twins , so we wound the club down , but we went out with a bang : we performed our first Solid Steel mix-CD live , and gave away every record that we played . " They did n't give up on the format entirely though and had already set up a Bristol branch in conjunction with Detectives Of Perspective which ran for 5 years and played host to equally impressive line ups on a bi-monthly basis . <p> Though Suzi no longer works for the label -- she now arranges events for kindred spirits The Big Chill -- she remains a Ninja in every way that counts , and holds their DIY ethos in high regard . " It 's funny how the music industry has changed , " she smiles . " For financial reasons , touring has been stripped way back , with fewer and fewer road crews , the way we used to do it . A lot of bands do n't realise it 's their money they 're spending if they get someone to carry all their kit ... the fools @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We never thought of doing it any other way . " <p> The Quietus also grabbed Stevie Chick for a brief Q &amp; A about his new tome <p> When did you first become aware of Ninja Tune and why did its aesthetic and output appeal to you so much ? <p> Stevie Chick : I first became aware of Ninja back in its first flush of mainstream success , the ' Trip Hop ' era if you will . I 'd just started to immerse myself in hip-hop , and all the possibilities offered by turntables and sequencers and samplers , and Mo Wax 's Headz compilation opened a door in my mind to the more abstract , instrumental stuff that was happening then . Mo Wax seemed to get more immediate press buzz back then , but it did n't take me long to start exploring artists like Funki Porcini and Coldcut , and their first big compilation , Funkjazztical Tricknology , suggested there was much to get lost in with regard to their catalogue . But you know , I was at university , trying to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much music as I could , from as many different genres , and I could just about afford to buy an album a week back then . The week before I bought Funkjazztical Tricknology , I might 've bought an Uncle Tupelo album , and the week after an Alkoholiks LP - Spotify did n't exist back then , and even illegal file-sharing was beyond the capabilities of my 56k modem , so I could n't really immerse myself in stuff on my budget in those days . But I do remember having a pretty natty Ninja T-Shirt , a mauve ringer tee ( as was the fashion in those days ) with Strictly Kev 's Ninja and a slogan about getting blunted but not getting too much fluff on your needle ( fnarr ) . <p> A couple of years later , however , and I was writing about music for a living , and every single Ninja release I wanted to hear was tumbling through my letterbox , for free , along with a lot of other music from an infinite number of other labels . And I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's output , and that , by the late 90s , that was the only kind of uniformity the label countenanced : that here was a label which was , by definition of how many of its artists made their music , ' hip-hop ' , but never constrained by genre : taking this revolutionary method and spinning it out as far as the imagination and the technology would allow . Ninja Tune releases could mangle your brain and send you hurtling towards the dancefloor , like Coldcut 's More Beats &amp; Pieces ; they could also hit you on an emotional level with a delicate force that left you moved and breathless , like The Cinematic Orchestra 's ' All That You Give ' . That breadth of sound and style and content would only expand in the years that passed and - along with their ethical approach to business and the uncommon decency of the people involved at the label , who I came to meet while writing about their releases - only increased my admiration for Ninja Tune 's works . <p> Did you go to Stealth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was Ninja a part of your life apart from just buying records ? <p> SC : I was a Solid Steel listener , no doubt , though I never made it down to Stealth , I do n't think - again , during Stealth 's lifespan , I was mostly broke and studying or spending my nights at the Garage or the LA2 or similar dives . Dumb as it sounds , I figured I 'd rather spend my ' entertainment dollar ' on live music than turntablism , a methodology I would later curse once I started attending club nights and catching DJs at work . Certainly , researching the Stealth chapter for the book made me green with envy , at the great times I missed . As such , I was unprepared for how mind-blowing Ninja artists ' multimedia performances would be in the flesh - I have a very clear memory of Hexstatic and Coldcut and DJ Food at 93 Feet East , for Ninja 's 10th birthday celebrations , dancing to the chainsaw roars of ' Timber ' and watching the very source of those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - spool out upon massive screens before me . It was disorientating , it was overwhelming , it was fucking awesome . <p> What is it about Ninja Tune that differentiates it from the other trip hop/blunted beats style labels such as Mo Wax ? <p> SC : Honestly , the simplest and most obvious answer to that is , they 're still going , still thriving . Unpack that pat answer , and you 'll find the real reasons : the label balance a creative adventurousness with a keen and sensible business approach , and have never been satisfied with standing still or being synonymous with a single sound or movement , and have retained a hunger that 's served them , and their fanbase , incredibly well . The early Mo Wax releases were great , and the Ninja bods give them heavy props throughout . But a couple of years after Headz , Mo Wax was less an outlet for great music , and more the label run by that bloke who spends more on trainers than most African countries ' GDPs . He seemed to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Ninja was n't just one man 's vision , however , and the two men who formed it - Coldcut 's Jonathan More and Matt Black - assembled a fine staff who could keep the project evolving , as their energies were ploughed back into Coldcut 's music and their other many interests . And Coldcut had been fucked over by the music industry machine in the past - that 's why they formed their own record label - so they had a keen interest in operating as a benevolent force within the industry , of not being like the old fuckers who 'd tried to hem in their own creative impulses pre-Ninja . <p> Ninja also has crazy amounts of ambition , and a canny skill to pull off all their crazy schemes .

@@1647232 @ @ for pleasure <p> I have just been to the Underworld , propelled there by a very talented boatman . Down a cleverly widened river near Kettering , Northamptonshire , the landscape architect Kim Wilkie has been paddling me along to see his latest masterpiece . On dry land he has designed a pit of Hell and taken on the great landscape gardeners of England 's 18th-century golden age . At the bottom lies a rectangular pool of water that he presents as the entrance to Hades where the mythical singer Orpheus lost his love , Eurydice . <p> Boughton House in Northamptonshire has long been a seat of the Dukes of Buccleuch . The present head of the great house and park , the 10th Duke , still ranks as the biggest private landowner in Europe . In the 1980s I used to call on the expert gardener Valerie Finnis , who had settled her superb collection of alpine plants in Boughton 's adjoining Dower House , having married a senior family member , Sir David Scott . I would leave their heavenly garden and feel that the grassy park outside had missed a trick . Beneath an elegant stone bridge , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conifers and sycamores on a distant hill ... I had no idea that the stream was the spring-fed River Ise and had once been landscaped into a pattern of formal lakes in keeping with the French style of Boughton 's main fa ? ade . <h> Robin Lane Fox <p> As our flat-bottomed boat struggled through hellish carpets of blanket-weed , my panting paddler , the 54-year-old Wilkie , explained to me how the current Duke , Richard Buccleuch , had decided to reshape the river . Old plans of the garden in the early 18th century almost certainly go back to the masterly Charles Bridgeman , the genius behind the famous landscape park at Stowe . They show the Ise running in a wide , formal channel and opening out into the fine Broad Water lake before returning past a big man-made garden mound . Almost any other landowner would have framed the plan and left it as a memento of a grander past . Not so the 10th Duke . <p> If you want to know how to widen a river for posterity Boughton is now the place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ except two old water pipes . However , the line of the landscaped river 's banks was re-established . Wilkie was intrigued to discover that it measured exactly a chain ( 20.1m ) in width . The Duke 's landscape manager then decided to reinforce the banks with lengths of oak boarding , fixed together with coach bolts . Originally the boarding had been made of elm . The new banks needed no less than two miles of oak -- not seasoned oak , which would buckle over time , but green oak which would harden in situ . It was too much for the English timber trade . The sturdy oak for this glorious English waterway has had to be bought in from Belgium . <p> In 2007 the Duke and his landscape manager were in Edinburgh for a major conference on whether landscape design is shackled or freed by the past . The Duke went in to one hall of speakers , the landscape manager into a second and it was there that he heard Wilkie lecture . Wilkie was then brought down to the park 's overgrown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What would he do on the opposite side of the river ? <p> Landscape architects dread the need for sudden inspiration on site . The Duke had been thinking of a second mound to balance the existing one , but it would block the long view from the house . In a flash Wilkie proposed to go downwards , not upwards , inverting the proportions of the mound and digging them down into the river 's opposing bank . After a thoughtful grunt His Grace came round to the idea . <p> From the top of the mound I began by admiring the Georgians ' brilliant sense of proportion . The Broad Water and the widened river are a triumph and Wilkie has made an ingenious pathway to the mound 's top from which to view them . He has sown coarse grass-seed over a path of crushed-stone-gravel . It can be lightly mown by machines set high and looks green above a hard surfacing for human traffic . <p> Wilkie is on peak form at the moment . In the FT nearly 10 years ago readers voted overwhelmingly for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the court of London 's Victoria and Albert Museum . He has since been given the job of an entire new terrace for the US 's unsurpassed gardens at Longwood , Pennsylvania , funded by the Dupont Foundation . He is also the managing landscaper for the much-contested site of London 's former Chelsea Barracks . It is quite a career for a man who began as a marketing manager at Unilever . <p> Recovering from his paddling , he waxed lyrical about the mound as a new Mount Olympus with the depths of Hades on the bank beyond . All I could see was a sort of pit with a cube of metal on the far edge , which I mistook for a mocked-up frame for a future feature . It turns out to be the feature itself , based on proportions of the " golden section " , which flowery gardeners like me are too stupid to appreciate . <p> Boating across to the far bank , we looked down into the hitherto invisible -- a descending pattern of brilliantly-planned grass paths and below , a stone-edged rectangle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the breeze . We went down seven metres below the upper edge and discussed whether Orpheus had come up from Hades holding the hand of his beloved Eurydice , or not . In the myth he had been told not to look back until they were out into the light . He could not resist one backward glance at her , whereupon there was a triple crashing sound and she was tugged back for ever to the murky Underworld . <p> When did Orpheus come into the project ? Not at once , Wilkie told me . Like me , he believes that a scheme should make a fine visual impression without the need for prior understanding of hidden deeper meanings . The meanings merely help viewers to see even more if they so wish . I suggested installing a model hand , vainly reaching from the pool 's waters , like Eurydice 's last plea . Could there be simulated crashes , what Virgil calls " terque fragor " , to remind visitors what Orpheus lost ? Wilkie tactfully suggested it was time for us to climb out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had refuted Virgil . According to the great poet , the descent to Hell is easy , but " to retrace one 's steps , that is the labour , that is the toil " . Wilkie 's grass circuit winds so cleverly that the return from Hell seems cheeringly effortless . The entire project was less easy . It took more than a year and as I looked at the interim photos I admired the Duke and his team for their boldness in the face of winter mud . The grass mound , banks and pits are now mown by two men for two days each week , using a remote controlled bank-mower . These mowers are at last importable and cost about ? 34,000 ( $53,250 ) . <p> Leaving the great landscape I walked back through the garden in which I once weeded fine alpines with Valerie Finnis . Not one is alive , 30 years later . The Underworld , by contrast , will live on for centuries to puzzle garden archaeologists .

Also scoring high are the bustling miniature synth epic of ' Glass Mountain Trust ' , which features the honeyed vocals of D'Angelo and at no point gives the listener a clue as to what he is singing about or what a Glass Mountain Trust might be , and top of the shop , the quite remarkable glacial robo-funk of the title track ( meaning that the standout track , ' Bang Bang Bang ' aside , is the one with Simon Le Bon on it .

Well this time round Rising Star Games have teamed up with Mitchell Corporation to release the amazing PANG : Magical Michael on our shores . <p> Taking a new spin on the original series , the game follows Michael a young aspiring magician who foolishly failed an experiment of his that lead to balloons being dispersed all over the world , wrecking havoc at major landmarks . To right his wrong Michael has to travel the world to destroy every balloon in order to save the world and bring it back to its original state . <p> PANG : Magical Michael is a great re-imagining of the original Pang , staying true to the series , by keeping hardcore arcade-style gameplay .

With each level you have the chance to be stylish or boring which is rated on a variety of terms such as shot speed , skill , item pickup , etc and you are also given a degree for your score , you could get anything from penniless or cool . This of course puts a large emphasis on the need for high scores which is of course one of the hooks of an arcade game . <p> There are a lot of hidden modes in PANG , once you 've met the correct criteria in Tour mode you can unlock the hidden stages , and once completing them you unlock the Challenge mode which is a mode centred mainly on getting the highest score possible . Once you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Special stages which allow you to jump , which was a feature I sorely missed in the Tour mode , as well as some extra items you can use against the bubbles . <p> One thing PANG : Magical Michael has more than enough of is a variety of powerups , ranging from different gun types and level altering items you 'll find yourself hoping for certain item drops on those super hard levels , although handily each powerup has a tutorial to make sure you know what you 're doing when you get them , which are introduced just before you start a level with the powerup in it . Just make sure to dodge those washing tubs ! <p> Multiplayer works extremely well , having the one more go nature to it stopping you from being able to put it down , especially when on a winning streak .

Each hit you take of an opponent 's bubble will hurt you , and the amount of damage you take is dependent on how large the bubble was . And if bombarded with bad bubbles you 'll soon find yourself the looser . Also unlike ' Survive ' the normal bubbles only render you useless for about 2 seconds , the only real danger is those opposing bubbles . All multiplayer modes can be played with multi-card play , vs CPU and single card play via DS Download Play . <p> The game also features a survival mode called Panic Mode , allowing you to attempt to pop as many bubbles as you can without dying , and featuring a level up system to let you know how well you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past level 50 you then unlock a new touch mode for playing Panic . Generally Panic mode is slightly more lenient than Tour mode by being given three lives and having flashing bubbles which stop time momentarily . It does feature a Tetris style ' this is where your next bubble is coming from ' feature on the top screen as well , giving you a chance to get ready to burst those bubbles . Also if you 're finding Panic mode too hard on your own if you set up to play with a friend in multiplayer ( it will only appear if connected with a friend ) you can also play co-op Panic mode . <p> PANG : Magical Michael is a great sequel to follow on 21 years later ; it 's an enjoyable DS game that will keep you busy for hours .

It has a very villagey feel , the neighbours organise farmers ' markets and spaghetti dinners , there 's a talent show and a pancake breakfast -- everyone is very community orientated . When I moved in all the neighbours came round very kindly and they said , ' Do you have kids ? ' and I said no , and they said , ' What does your husband do ?

So I just do all the little waking-up sort of chores , and I usually try to have toast or fruit or something . By the time afternoon comes around I 'm starting to think about actually getting some work done . Lately I 've been making art for a show , and that 's very disciplining . Certainly a lot more gets done with a deadline looming .

The earliest piece of furniture I have is from the American Civil War . I 've got several work rooms , and the house is pretty much decorated in books , which is ironic because I 'm a visual artist and most of the wall space that probably should be hung with art is now taken up by bookcases .

Josh explains ... <p> Truly difficult television is a hard concept to get a handle on . Like an intelligent lyric in a pop song , it 's not so much a bad idea as one that takes the medium in an unfamiliar direction . Sure , there are plenty of maudlin documentaries or shocking scenes in soaps , but these are often conveniently distanced or suitably fictional for our armchair viewing pleasure . They are n't necessarily the kind of thing we 'd call ' hard to watch ' . <p> This Is England ' 86 , on the other hand , is most definitely hard to watch . At least , it has been of late . <p> Fittingly , since the final scene of the penultimate episode derailed both the narrative of the series and all discussion about it , the final episode flies off in somewhat of a tangent . The episode starts with Woody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back , Milky reconciling his betrayal of his best friend and Shaun trying to find sympathy for the violent father figure who changed the path of his life forever , but this is largely left frustratingly without closure as the true drive of the narrative is Lol 's confrontation with her father , made all the more imminent by Trev 's horrific news . <p> ' 86 is a series that has clearly changed direction . Instead of the ensemble teen series prior episodes have lead us to expect , in this episode we 're faced with a heavy , high stakes drama , where life and death really feels like it 's hanging in the balance , particularly in the key scene that spans practically the entire episode . <p> If this sounds like a description of gripping , dare we say , ' worthy ' television , that 's because it is .

You may need to prepare yourself before viewing ( both mentally , in anticipation of some unpleasant scenes , and physically , with a good stress ball to get you through them ) but the reward is drama that is as noteworthy and high quality as any you 're likely to see on Channel 4 in the near future . <p> How to view the series @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consolidate the episode as part of a wider narrative remains a debate well worth having , but with Meadows already proposing how a second series could see Shaun negotiating the drug culture of the early 90s , it seems this is n't the last time Meadows will make us grip the sofa tensely during our evening 's entertainment . <p> Just remember , for future reference , the following advice : just because a series features the music , fashions and good old hi-jinks of your parents ' youths does not mean it will make a comfortable evening 's viewing when watched with your mother ...

@@1663231 <h> Genetic analysis means children can now be tested for retinitis pigmentosa . But when , and how , should they be told ? <p> One morning in 1987 Stephen Jones and his wife , Lesley , drove from their home in Osterley , west London , to Moorfields Eye Hospital in the City so their son Ben could have his eyes tested . <p> A nurse had picked up ' some problem ' during a routine health check at Ben 's primary school . She was not sure exactly what it was , only that he needed to be seen by a specialist . <p> Stephen and Lesley were not overly worried because Ben 's eyesight was not noticeably bad . He had had some problems reading the blackboard , and occasionally tripped over his toys , but his parents put that down to clumsiness . <p> Otherwise Ben was a normal eight-year-old boy : he loved football , watching television and hanging out with his friends . <p> He was consoling and deliberately used careful wording so as not to sensationalise the condition , but said that at some point in the future -- maybe in two years or 20 , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lose his sight . Ben had retinitis pigmentosa , a group of inherited eye conditions that lead to incurable blindness . <p> ' It was a severe shock because it came out of the blue , ' Stephen recalls . <p> There was no history of blindness in their family . <p> ' I remember the assistant saying , with luck his eyesight will remain good throughout his education . So , in one visit you 're going from thinking , oh , he may have to wear glasses to being told he 'll probably lose his sight . ' <p> Now they faced the dilemma of what to tell Ben . Although he had been sitting across the table from the consultant during the diagnosis , what had been said barely registered with him . ( Ben says now he has no memory of that day ; he says he was probably thinking about football -- he was devoted to Everton . ) <p> Should Stephen and Lesley tell their son what lay ahead and allow him to prepare for the future ? Ben was obsessed with sport and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Or should they keep quiet about the timebomb in store ? After all , how do you explain to a child that he has been sentenced to inevitable darkness ? <p> The issue of disclosure , of what to reveal to whom and when , is increasingly being discussed as advances in genetic testing mean that people can be forewarned of their future . The success of the Human Genome Project , which mapped man 's entire genetic code , has made it possible to detect hereditary diseases that develop later in life . Huntington 's disease , for example , which is non-treatable and fatal , and which does not typically develop until middle age , can now be picked up in the womb and , in the case of IVF , even before with ' pre-implantation genetic diagnosis ' -- embryo screening ; likewise , BRCA , the gene known to dramatically increase the risk of breast cancer . <p> Dr Ruth Newbury-Ecob , a consultant in clinical genetics at University Hospitals Bristol , points out that the dilemma facing Ben 's family ' is where a child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ age at which they 're made aware of that . ' <p> What she sees in her clinic are parents with a strong family history of a genetic disease seeking a ' predictive ' test : has their child inherited the disease or not ? The technicalities of a genetic test are fairly simple , but its human implications are painful and complex and often lead to heart-rending decisions . <p> Individuals with a serious genetic disease in the family now have a choice . Do they live in hope ? Or do they take the test , and then , if it is positive , spend the next 20 years knowing that death or incapacity approaches ? How does knowing affect an individual 's decision about a job , a partner , having children ? There is soul searching for the parents of children who test positive , without a doubt . But what of those who do the testing ? <p> ' It can be difficult to stand back and observe a parent withholding information from their child , particularly in early teens when they are thinking about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the full picture , ' Sophie Devery , a genetic counsellor at Moorfields , says . Most parents do tell their children , she adds , ' but obviously we ca n't get involved because that is the parents ' decision . ' <p> ' It 's very difficult for parents to balance the difficulty of telling their child they have tested positive , ' Dr Newbury-Ecob acknowledges , ' the distress that may cause , the anxiety for the child , and how it affects the parent/child relationship , against the long term , where if they choose not to discuss things and the child finds out through a third party , that can be very damaging for the relationship because of the breakdown of trust . ' <p> Retinitis pigmentosa ( RP ) causes the slow disintegration of retinal cells : first the rods , which enable vision in low-light conditions ( the first symptom of RP is typically night blindness ) ; then the cones , which detect light and colour . As time goes on , many sufferers are left with narrow tunnel vision . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Some sufferers are blind by their early thirties ; others can still have good eyesight into their forties and fifties . About 25,000 people in the UK suffer from RP ( one in 3,000 ) , and there is currently no cure . <p> There are three main hereditary patterns : ' dominant ' requires only one abnormal gene from either parent ; ' recessive ' requires an abnormal gene from both parents ; and X-linked , where only males are affected after inheriting one abnormal gene from their mother . Genetic testing for the disease was first developed in 2003 , but still only about half of all RP cases can be genetically tested ( the dominant and X-linked forms ) . And although it is inherited , half of all cases come as an abrupt shock . <p> ' Most of those are recessive but some are X-linked , where there has n't been a male born for some time with it , ' Anthony Moore , a professor of ophthalmology and an honorary consultant at Moorfields , explains . The other slightly unusual aspect of RP is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ test to get advance warning . It can be stumbled on during routine eye examinations and confirmed by an optician looking at the back of the eye ( the tell-tale sign is changes in pigment ) . <p> Ben Jones is now 31 and in his second year training to be a vicar at Trinity College , Bristol . He is tall and slim with messy dark hair and an endearing boyish buoyancy . We meet in his light-filled flat in a residential suburb of the city , where he lives with his wife , Victoria , a stay-at-home mother , and their children , Evie , two and a half , and Caleb , four months . His father , Stephen , is visiting for the day ( his parents now live in Newbury , where the family moved soon after Ben was diagnosed ) . Both father and son exude a wry humour , which suggests that this is their way of coping with the seriousness of the condition . <p> Ben was registered blind aged 17 , and has used a white stick for the past five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not see anything in his right eye , but has narrow tunnel vision in his left , as if seeing through a straw . Normal vision is 180 degrees ; Ben 's is two degrees . <p> ' So from here , if I look at your right eye I ca n't see your nose , ' he tells me . ' In fact , if I look in your eye , I ca n't see your eyebrow . So at any given moment I can only see a tiny area , and I make up the picture by not just looking at one place all the time . ' <p> In good light , he can still read , work on a computer and watch television . It transpires that both of his parents were carriers of the RP gene ( the recessive type ) , but did not know it . Consequently , Ben had a one in four chance of getting the disease . ( His sister has been examined , and has no signs of RP on her retina , but she has a 50/50 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lesley decided to tell their son as soon as he was diagnosed . ' I 'm not very keen on secrets and holding things back from people , ' Stephen explains . ' Obviously we did n't spend our time saying to Ben , " You 're going to go blind . " You can protect your child by being entirely open , but not laying it on thick , and doing it as gently as possible . So when something arose like a forthcoming visit to Moorfields or if Ben trod on the cat , we would talk about it with him . The thing we did debate in the family was the extent to which we should tell his friends , and we all agreed from the outset that we should be very upfront about it , so when the need arose , people were aware . ' Stephen spoke about RP at Ben 's secondary school . <p> At first Ben 's only symptom was night blindness at the age of nine -- in dim light , he struggled to find the door , for example . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sight in his right eye and the sight in his left eye was slowly closing in . At 17 he could no longer play in the school first team for rugby , basketball and football ( he was in all three ) , and he was also noticeably stumbling into objects during the day . But he went on to study theology and computing at the University of Kent in Canterbury , and then trained as an RE teacher , which he did part time while also being a student worker at his church ( where he met his wife ) . <p> ' The fact that I 've always known about the RP has made it easier to bear , ' Ben says . ' So at every stage I 've known it 's going to get worse , but two years is the distant future when you 're 10 . I can still see my kids and watch football on the telly , and at some point that is probably not going to be the case , but I do n't really think about that because I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case . I suspect that everything about this was much more disturbing for Mum and Dad than it was for me . And maybe that 's partly because I am relatively chilled out anyway , but also because I was told when I was eight and when you 're eight you just take stuff in your stride . ' <p> Ben 's having RP also means he is a carrier and therefore has the potential , if Victoria is a carrier too ( which they do n't know and do n't want to know at this stage ) , to have passed it on to their children . Does he want to get his children tested ? ' If one of them starts showing signs or even the vaguest problem , then I 'd want to , but I 'm not in a desperate rush -- not because I do n't want to , but because it seems like an enormous amount of effort to go to for an off-chance . ' <p> RP meant Ben abandoned his dream of being a professional footballer , and he regrets not being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see or hear is a very bad combination ' . Walking without a white stick in an area he does n't know makes him feel vulnerable , but in familiar surroundings such as his home , which is unmodified , he moves freely -- he puts a glass of water directly in my hand . When talking of the difficulties of RP , Ben is predisposed to focus on the comedy : bollards are , painfully , ' always at knee height ' ; he walked up to his waist in a small lake at Kew Gardens ; he fell down a manhole while on a school trip to the theatre . ' I did the whole cartoon thing , legs twirling in the air , before plummeting . ' <p> ' Ben has taken RP in his stride all his life , ' Stephen says , ' even when he was going through his " Kevin " years ' -- Ben 's teenage rebellion included riding motorbikes and quad bikes around a friend 's farm and subsequently doing badly in his A-levels -- ' but in terms of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's not fair " or " Why me ? " or " This should n't have happened . " He has just got on with life . ' <p> Ben says his decision to become a vicar was n't dictated by his sight , but by the fact that he had always wanted to be a vicar . ' In fact there will be issues -- I wo n't be able to be in a rural parish , for example , because I ca n't drive and a lot of churches are quite dingy . ' Likewise his decision to marry young ( he was 25 when he met Victoria ) and have children was simply down to ' finding the person I knew I wanted to spend the rest of my life with ' . <p> Has knowing the future made Ben want to see as much as he can while he can ? <p> ' I think so , but it 's hard to say what is me and what is the eyesight problem , ' he says . ' I 've always been someone who wanted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and white-water rafting no matter what . ' But there has been some stuff I wanted to do before going blind . I will be forever grateful that whatever happens , I got to see my children . ' <p> Not long after meeting Ben I went to see Tom Walker , a pharmacist , 39 , in Newcastle . He is married to Elizabeth , a graphic designer , and they have three children , Charlie , 10 , Hannah , eight , and Emily , four . Hannah was diagnosed with RP when she was three and a half . Both Tom and his wife are carriers of the recessive form of RP , and so have a one in four chance of having a child with RP . <p> ' I noticed Hannah did n't see particularly well in the dark , ' Tom says . When he read her a bedtime story and the light was low , she could n't see the pictures on the page . If her teddy bear dropped off her bed , she could n't find it . Their GP referred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fast-acting RP , where the degeneration is rapid . ' They told us she would be severely visually impaired by school age . ' Tom and Elizabeth were devastated . Hannah had just started nursery . <p> The vexing question was what to tell Hannah . ' You carry the responsibility for a child at that age , ' Tom says . ' She was n't old enough to understand . ' So they did not discuss it with her . And they still have not discussed it with her , partly because Hannah 's predicted deterioration has yet to happen . ' She is long-sighted but no more or less than any other child in her school who wears glasses , ' Tom says . Hannah is the sort who loves to put on shinpads and kick footballs . ' It 's only a matter of time , we know that , ' he says . <p> So will they discuss it with her ? ' What 's the trigger ? ' Tom says . ' Is it four and a half , five and a half , six @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough to cope with knowing that she will go blind ? ' Tom 's eyes fill with tears . He is heartbroken and confused . ' It 's hard for us to accept and that 's why I 'd like to tell her on the day they find a cure , because that is easier to deal with . ' <p> There are two treatments currently in clinical trials in Britain : gene therapy , where good copies of the gene that is faulty are injected into the retina ; and artificial retinas or the ' bionic eye ' , where an electronic chip sits on the retina stimulating light-sensitive cells . Neither offers a complete cure and neither is imminently available on the market , but both are the focus of widespread hope . <p> Tom says that he and his wife rehearse telling Hannah in their minds . But not telling her has advantages . ' The innocence of childhood , ' he says , ' Protecting your child . Would you want to know that you were about to step out of that door and get killed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know the future , you just want to live life to the full . That is what I want to do with my daughter . I want her to live life to the full . ' <p> He adds that both sets of grandparents agree that not telling Hannah yet is the right thing to do . As do friends and other members of the family . The only person who disagrees is the consultant who diagnosed Hannah 's condition . ' He 's advised what he would do in my situation -- tell her -- but respects my decision not to , ' Tom says . <p> Most parents explain in a simple way once their child is at school , Prof Moore says , but ' there is a minority who do not like to discuss it . There are some families where even the grandparents do not want to talk about it . They feel very guilty . ' <p> But not telling opens up other problems . Hannah has to be removed from the consulting-room during discussions at her yearly check-ups and has started to ask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man ' . And the fact that they have confided in close family , friends and teachers ( so Hannah can sit at the front of the class to see the blackboard ) means that there is the potential for information to leak out . <p> ' It 's a bit of a tightrope we walk because we do n't want Hannah to find out in the playground from another child whose parents have discussed it with someone else , ' Tom says . And not telling requires ingenuity . Hannah has started to ask questions about why she can not see as well as her friends at night . So far her parents have answered by saying everyone is different -- ' kind of skirting around the issue ' . <p> ' It would be very easy to bury your head completely and that would not be the right thing , ' Tom says , ' because when we do talk to Hannah about her eye condition she is going to want to know what we did . Did we try to look for a cure ? Did we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far did we go on her behalf knowing what we knew ?

Its case has been bolstered by the procurement contracts for the carriers that commit the Government to place alternative work with the shipyards even if a carrier is abandoned . <p> It is understood that the Navy has offered to slim down to as few as 12 surface ships , leaving it with six Type 45 destroyers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ submarine fleet would reduce to seven Astute hunter-killers plus the four Trident nuclear deterrent boats . With the two carriers , this would reduce the fleet by half from its current total of 42 ships . <p> " If we want the two carriers it means we have to mortgage everything and by that I mean reducing the fleet by almost a half , " said a senior Navy source . <p> Navy analysts warned that the cuts would mean Britain reducing its fleet to the size of the Italian navy and almost half the size of the French . <p> Liam Fox , the Defence Secretary , warned in a letter leaked to The Daily Telegraph last week that the Navy could lose its entire amphibious landing capability and be unable to mount even a relatively small-scale operation such as the intervention in Sierra Leone .

Even though those cuts are likely to be held well below 10 per cent , Dr Fox still has to fund a ? 38 billion " black hole " in the military order book . <p> The carriers are currently designed to carry specially built Short Take-Off Vertical Landing Jets , which are significantly more expensive than conventional catapult-launched fighters . <p> One option discussed at the council was delaying at least one of the new carriers and equipping it with a catapult . <p> Ministers debated that option to allow " interoperability " with other nations , including France and the US , whose carrier-based jets are catapult-launched . <p> A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Tornado warplanes .

@@1663238 <h> When American football star Pat Tillman died in ' friendly fire ' in Afghanistan , the US Army tried to cover it up . A new documentary tells the story of his family 's fight for the truth <p> When Pat Tillman and his brother Kevin enlisted in the US Army in 2002 it was a source of both pride and apprehension for his family . America was still reeling from the attacks on the World Trade Center . ' We were at war , ' their father , Patrick Tillman Sr , says , ' and the idea that my kids would allow someone else to fight their battles for them ... I do n't think that sat well with either of them . ' <p> Tillman , standing second from the left , with his squad in Afghanistan <p> For the US military , Pat Tillman 's enlistment provided an opportunity of a different kind . Tillman was a celebrated sportsman , a professional footballer playing for the Arizona Cardinals who turned down a three-year , $3.6 million contract so that he could serve his country . No scriptwriter in the Pentagon press bureau could have devised a more persuasive poster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sent Tillman a personal note commending the ' proud and patriotic ' thing that he was doing . <p> When Tillman died in Afghanistan in April 2004 , shot three times in the head , the news was greeted with an effusion of grief and patriotic pride . A Pentagon press release described him as having made ' the ultimate sacrifice in the war on terror ' , a spokesman for the White House talked of him as ' an inspiration both on and off the football field ' , while the senator for Arizona , John McCain , spoke of how Tillman 's death would be ' a heavy blow to our nation 's morale ' . <p> Tillman was awarded the Silver Star , the third highest military decoration in the US Army , given for ' gallantry in action against an enemy of the United States ' . The citation described how he had ' put himself in the line of devastating enemy fire ' , and how ' while mortally wounded , his audacious leadership and courageous example ' had inspired his men to fight , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ safe passage from an ' ambush kill zone ' . <p> But Pat Tillman did not die as a result of enemy fire . The three bullets in his head had been fired by his own comrades . <p> The saga has now been told in an extraordinary new documentary , The Tillman Story . The fruit of three years ' work by the producer John Battsek and the director Amir Bar-Lev , the film examines how the US army attempted to cover up the fact that Tillman died from so-called ' friendly fire ' and , in the words of one former soldier , ' pin a recruiting poster on his coffin ' , and his family 's struggle to find out the truth . <p> At first glance Pat Tillman seemed every inch the quintessential American hero . Square-jawed , ruggedly handsome and powerfully built , he looked like a cross between an action movie star and the archetypal testosterone-fuelled ' jock ' . But Tillman was a much more complicated figure than that . <p> A few weeks after his death , at a memorial service held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a friend described him as a man ' on a constant quest to improve himself ' . <p> The eldest of three sons of a lawyer , Patrick Sr , and a special-needs teacher , Mary , Pat Tillman was an outstanding scholar as well as an outstanding athlete , graduating summa cum laude , the highest academic honour , from his college in Arizona before being drafted into professional NFL football in 1998 with the Arizona Cardinals . <p> Tillman , his father says , ' pushed himself on just about every level ' . As a boy , he would carry around a book of quotations -- Churchill , Mark Twain and Abraham Lincoln -- circling and memorising the ones he found most inspiring . As a professional footballer , he owned neither a mobile phone nor a car , and would cycle to training in a T-shirt and flip-flops , a paperback book in his pocket . His reading ran from Ralph Waldo Emerson and Henry Thoreau to Noam Chomsky . <p> On the day after 9/11 , Tillman gave an interview in which he talked about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' . ' A lot of my family has ... gone and fought in wars , ' he said , ' and I really have n't done a damn thing as far as laying myself on the line like that . ' <p> Six months later , having completed the last game of the season and returned from a honeymoon in the South Pacific with his childhood sweetheart , Marie , Tillman and his brother Kevin announced that they were enlisting in the army . <p> Tillman was the first NFL professional since the Second World War to voluntarily leave the game for military service , and his recruitment was a public relations gift for the army . Rumsfeld , after sending Tillman his personal letter of congratulations on June 28 2002 , emailed the Secretary of the Army , Tom White , noting that Tillman ' sound sic like he is world-class . We might want to keep our eye on him . ' But Tillman refused to play the role of poster boy . He declined to explain why he had enlisted , turning down all interview requests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was quietly offered a ' safe ' posting at home , but turned that down too . <p> After basic training , Pat and Kevin were assigned to the US Army Rangers , an elite combat corps , with the rank of ' specialist ' -- between private and corporal -- and in March 2003 they were among the first US forces deployed in the invasion of Iraq . Doubts soon began to set in . At 25 , Pat was older than most of his platoon , and according to his mother he grew frustrated at the lack of intellectual stimulation . ' It disturbed him that the military did n't use people to their full potential and that things were done that seemed to make no sense . ' He also began to question the prosecution and legality of the war in Iraq . <p> Returning home after his first tour of duty , Tillman told his mother that the war was ' pretty much bullshit ' . Among the things they discussed was his concern that he seemed to undergo more psychological evaluations than other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maybe it 's because they 're curious about you , " ' Mary recalls . ' " Why would you give up so much to join the military ? " ' <p> In the years following his death , the family were eventually able to obtain two of these evaluations under the Freedom of Information Act . ' They said things like , he did n't respect authority , all kinds of stuff ... ' Mary says . ' Pat did n't suffer fools gladly , that 's for sure . But when there was authority to respect , he respected it . ' <p> Whether the army was concerned about Tillman 's views or felt he had served its purpose , he was offered an honourable discharge and the chance to take up a new football contract . He refused . ' Pat had signed up to fight for three years , he was going to fight for three years . That was the deal , ' his father says -- and in early April 2004 Pat and Kevin were redeployed with their ' Black Sheep ' platoon to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engaged in a ' clearing operation ' , sweeping villages for Taliban fighters in a region of south-eastern Afghanistan , near the border with Pakistan , when one of the platoon 's Humvee vehicles broke down . A request by the platoon leader , Lt David Uthlaut , to his command centre 65 miles away in the city of Khost to airlift the vehicle was refused . Instead , it was ordered that it should be towed to safety behind a civilian truck that had been hired locally ; at the same time the platoon should proceed with the mission to have ' boots on the ground ' in the village of Manah before dusk . The only way to achieve this was to split the platoon in two : ' Serial 1 ' pushing on towards Manah , while ' Serial 2 ' took responsibility for the broken Humvee . <p> Serial 1 , including Uthlaut and Tillman , set off towards Manah , passing along the road through a canyon , while Serial 2 turned back along the road towards Khost . They had travelled only a short @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be unable to continue on the rocky terrain . Instead , they then followed the route that Serial 1 had taken through the canyon . <p> It was at this point that Serial 2 came under attack from what the soldiers thought were either rocket-propelled grenades or mortar and small arms fire . They returned fire , blitzing the higher ground with mortar and machine-guns . The sound of explosions and gunfire alerted Serial 1 at the far end of the canyon . Uthlaut tried , and failed , to make radio contact with Serial 2 , while Tillman , another soldier , Bryan O'Neal , and an Afghan militiaman named Thani set off up the hill for a position on the ridgeline overlooking the road . <p> The lead vehicle of Serial 2 came into view . Seeing the Afghan militiaman , the squad leader , Sgt Greg Baker , opened fire . Hit by eight bullets , the Afghan died instantly . Following Baker 's lead , others in the lead vehicle now began spraying the ridgeline with machine-gun fire . Tillman frantically waved his arms , yelling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he and O'Neal scrambled to take shelter behind some rocks . He then threw a smoke grenade as a signal that they were ' friendlies ' . There was a lull in the fire . When Tillman broke cover , the soldiers in Baker 's vehicle opened fire again . Machine-gun fire struck the body armour on his chest and he dropped to a squatting position . According to O'Neal , Tillman continued yelling , ' I 'm Pat Tillman ! Cease fire ! ' But the firing continued . He was hit three times in the head . His last words were ' I 'm Pat ----ing Tillman ' . <p> The death of America 's most famous soldier came at a particularly critical time for the US military . In early April 2004 American forces had suffered a humiliating setback in the abortive attempt to capture the Iraqi city of Fallujah , and the 131 US casualties that month would be the highest in nine months . America was fast growing disillusioned with its ' war on terror ' . <p> On the day that Pat Tillman was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of America , imploring them not simply to write about ' the attacks and setbacks ' but to ' give context ' to the events in Iraq and Afghanistan . What was required , it seemed , was something positive . What was required was a hero . <p> On the evening of April 22 Tillman 's family were informed of his death . ' We were told Pat had been shot in the head getting out of a vehicle , ' his mother remembers . ' That 's all we knew . ' On April 30 -- only two days after the first images of the abuse of inmates at Abu Ghraib prison had been shown on American television , with public faith in the prosecution of the war sinking to its lowest ebb -- it was announced that Tillman had been awarded the Silver Star , and posthumously promoted from specialist to corporal . <p> The army wanted to give Tillman a full military funeral with honours , but his wife , Marie , refused . Apparently mindful of how the army might continue to use him in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ written instructions that ' I do not want military involvement ' at his funeral . But Pat Tillman was too public a figure for his death to be allowed to pass quietly . <p> On May 3 3,000 people attended a memorial service in San Jose , which was televised nationally . Among the army officers who gathered around to comfort his family was Lt Gen Philip Kensinger , the head of the army 's Special Operations Com ? mand , which oversees all special combat corps . Only later would it emerge that even as he was consoling Tillman 's family , Kensinger was fully aware that their son had died from friendly fire . <p> Four months later , at the beginning of the new football season , the NFL would mount its own day of commemoration , with all teams wearing a memorial decal on their helmets in Tillman 's honour . In Arizona , his number 40 shirt was ' retired ' in a ceremony at a Cardinals game . President Bush appeared on a video screen offering tributes . <p> In Afghanistan , a series @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the immediate aftermath of Tillman 's death . Other members of the platoon were ordered to say nothing of the incident , and phone and internet connections at the base were shut down . His brother Kevin , who had not witnessed the incident and knew only that Pat had been killed but not how , was put in ' quarantine ' , and within days would be sent home with Pat 's body , accompanied by another soldier who was under strict instructions not to tell Kevin or the family what had happened . <p> In contravention of army protocol , which stipulates that the uniforms of fallen soldiers be returned to America , Pat 's uniform , helmet and combat vest were destroyed , along with his notebook . Within hours , an army captain , Richard Scott , was ordered to prepare a report on the incident . His draft investigation , prepared in a matter of days , was condemnatory . Tillman 's death , Scott concluded , was fratricide -- the military term for friendly fire -- and the result of an act of ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recommended to head ? quarters that there should be a further investigation by the army 's Criminal Investigation Command to establish whether there had been ' criminal intent ' in the killing . <p> But Scott 's conclusions were not , it seemed , what the army wanted to hear . Instead , another investigation -- to be known as a ' 15-6 ' -- was ordered at battalion level . ( It would be a further two years before it emerged , in yet another inquiry , that Scott 's initial report had been quietly buried , his references to ' negligent homicide ' and the recommendation for a criminal investigation excised . ) <p> In a subsequent investigation two years later , another high-ranking officer , Brig Gen Howard Yellen , would describe how the 15-6 report was received among the chain of command . It was ' sort of like , " here is the steak dinner , but we 're giving it to you on this , you know , garbage can cover " . You know , " You got it . You work it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about what she thinks Yellen 's statement meant : ' We 've got Abu Ghraib , all this other stuff the garbage , but this soldier the steak who is very high profile has been killed ; we can use this to our advantage . Unfortunately , he was killed by friendly fire . That means we 're going to have to spin it . You 've got it , you work it . It 's a grotesque way of saying it . And yet that 's what he says . ' <p> Sitting in the lounge of a San Jose hotel , Mary Tillman has a serene and thoughtful demeanour that does not immediately suggest the moral indignation that has driven her in her quest to establish the truth of what actually happened to her son . <p> ' To lie is the most horrible thing , and we have been lied to , ' she says . ' It 's an atrocity that they would take a young man with honourable intentions who 'd served his country and then lie about how he died to promote a war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That is immoral . ' <p> The first Mary Tillman learnt of her son having died from friendly fire was on May 28 2004 -- five weeks after his death -- in a telephone call from a reporter for the Arizona Republic news ? paper . The army , apparently fearing that the information was about to be leaked , had decided to release it officially . The following day , Lt Gen Kensinger issued a terse statement that ' while there was no one specific finding of fault ' an investigation ( the 15-6 ) had concluded that Tillman had ' probably ' died as a result of friendly fire in the course of ' an intense firefight lasting approximately 20 minutes ' , during an ambush conducted by ' 10 to 12 enemy personnel ' . <p> When Mary was first shown the results of the 15-6 investigation in June 2004 she was immediately struck by all the unanswered questions that remained . She drafted a list of her concerns to Senator John McCain , along with a request for her son 's autopsy and the field @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a paper trail of some 6,000 pages of military documents , most of them heavily redacted , the names of officers and soldiers blanked out , that she would follow over the next three years , attempting to piece together the truth of what had happened to her son . <p> The more Mary read , the more the anomalies began to stack up . According to witnesses on the ground , there had been no ' intense firefight ' with the enemy . No one in Serial 2 nor any of their vehicles had been hit by enemy fire . At worst , it seemed that they had been subject only to harassing fire at a distance from a handful of Taliban . <p> It emerged that the driver of the lead vehicle had recognised Tillman , O'Neal and the Afghan soldier as ' friendlies ' and had yelled at his fellow soldiers to stop firing , but his shouts had gone unheard , or been ignored . <p> Another soldier in the vehicle acknowledged that he too had seen ' arms waving ' , but maintained that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cease fire . ' Others were firing and I wanted to stay in the firefight , ' he said . A third said he had seen two figures and just aimed where everyone else was shooting -- apparently a clear breach of the US Army rules of engagement that require ' positive identification ' of a target before opening fire . To Mary this suggested not so much soldiers confused by the fog of war as driven by ' a lust to fight ' . <p> Official accounts suggested that the lead vehicle in Serial 2 was moving when the shots that killed Tillman were fired . But Specialist Bryan O'Neal , who had been beside Tillman when he died , explicitly stated that the vehicle ' stopped , re-engaged us , drove forward and re-engaged us again ' . <p> ' When you start reading things and they just do n't add up , it 's very disturbing , ' Mary says . ' You begin to think that anything is possible . ' <p> In November 2004 , as a result of pressure from Mary Tillman and Senator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ordered a further investigation into Tillman 's death . Conducted by a brigadier general , Gary M Jones , the report -- made up of 2,100 pages of transcripts and detailed descriptions of the incident -- concluded that the army had known almost immediately that Tillman had died of fratricide but maintained that there had been ' no reluctance ' to report the facts of the incident , and that any failure to immediately notify the family had been born of a desire to avoid giving them ' an inaccurate or incomplete picture ' before a full investigation . <p> The destruction of Tillman 's uniform , body armour and combat vest may have contributed to perceptions that ' the army was trying to hide that this was fratricide ' , but ' nothing could be further from the truth ' : the items were permeated with blood and posed ' a biological hazard ' , and retaining the physical evidence ' could have had a significant negative impact on the morale of Cpl Tillman 's unit ' . <p> Among the most telling witnesses in the report were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within days of Tillman 's death . He told Jones that elements of his report had been excised , and that sworn statements given to him by soldiers on the ground had later been changed , ' to , I think , help some individuals ' . <p> This had made it appear that Tillman had died in a single volley of gunfire in a matter of seconds , rather than in three separate bursts that had taken place over some minutes -- a critical distinction in arguing that this was negligence rather than simply ' the fog of war ' . But Scott 's observations were ignored in Jones 's final conclusions that repeated the story that Tillman had been shot from a vehicle travelling at a speed of ' 25-30mph ' and that the occupants ' had visibility of and directed fire at ' him ' for only 4-5 seconds ' . <p> Brig Gen Jones further concluded that Lt Gen Kensinger , the senior army representative at the memorial service , was not aware of the possibility of fratricide until after the service was over . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> When Patrick Tillman Sr attended an army briefing in June 2004 about his son having died from friendly fire , his response took aback everybody who was present . ' Why then , ' he asked , ' did you give him a Silver Star ? ' <p> ' They said something like , " We gave him a Silver Star for attitude , " ' Tillman Sr tells me . ' I have an uncle who got one in the Second World War , and I know what it takes to get one , and that just did n't make any sense to me . ' <p> Tillman Sr has the steely , no-nonsense manner of a man who does not take kindly to being lied to . ' They gave him a medal and he did n't deserve it . And that 's no insult to Pat to say that . He did n't need a decoration . He was an outstanding human being and an outstanding soldier . ' <p> In April 2005 , after Tillman Sr received his briefing from Brig Gen Jones and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrote Jones a scalding letter . Picking apart the assertion that the shooting had happened in ' 4-5 seconds ' , Tillman Sr pointed to the evidence that his son had actually been fired on from at least two separate locations while the shooters were stationary . He was hit first by machine-gun fire to his body armour , knocking him down . Two further rounds fired by another weapon took off the back of his head . Then a third -- in army jargon -- ' kill shot ' entered the top of his head as he fell . He and O'Neal were standing only 40 yards from the shooters -- close enough for whoever had shot him to clearly identify him as a ' friendly ' . This was no ' fog of war ' . <p> Turning to the cover-up , Tillman Sr went on that rather than fratricide having been ' suspected ' , it was known instantly . Fourteen people had witnessed it , and a colonel had been at the scene within hours . <p> ' Telling us the truth about how Pat died @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrote to Jones . ' Every one of you have disregarded your duty , acting deliberately and shamelessly to kill my son and lie about it . ' He concluded his letter : ' In sum , ---- you ... and yours . ' <p> By now the Tillman case was becoming a national cause c ? l ? bre , avidly reported in the media , and pored over in the blogosphere . In March 2006 the Defence Department Inspector General 's office published its own inquiry into the army 's handling of the affair . This declared the killing of Tillman to be ' an accident ' , but found that there had been ' critical errors ' in reporting his death that had led to ' inaccuracies , misunderstandings and perceptions of concealment ' , but that there had been no cover-up . <p> At the same time , a report by the army 's Criminal Investigation Command concluded that there was no evidence that Tillman 's death was ' anything other than accidental ' , and that the soldiers in Serial 2 who killed him had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : ' Under extreme circumstances and in a very compressed time frame , the members of Serial 2 had a reasonable belief that death or harm was about to be inflicted on them and believed it was necessary to defend themselves . ' <p> To Tillman Sr , the Inspector General 's report was just one more serving of ' the ration of crap ' that he believes the army has dished out since his son 's death . <p> ' I will not assume that there was some mistake made , or some fog of war and that this was simply an unfortunate accident , ' he says . ' I wo n't do it . The reports all say this was done improperly , or this was an oversight . It was just one screw-up after another . But if you start from the top and work your way down , it makes perfect sense : everything was done in accordance to plan . People do n't burn evidence ; you do n't destroy a soldier 's diary , it 's just not done . Some very serious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my son a Silver Star . And when you look at some of the communications -- Brig Gen Yellen 's statement " we handed you the steak ... " -- it 's painfully obvious this thing was choreographed . ' <p> Just how far up the chain of command the alleged cover-up ran would finally become apparent in March 2007 , when a confidential army memo was leaked to the Associated Press news agency . The memo had been sent by Major Gen Stanley McChrystal of Joint Special Operations Command to Gen Kensinger , Gen John Abizaid , the head of US Central Command , and Gen Bryan Douglas Brown , the head of the US Special Operations Command . <p> It was dated April 29 2004 , the day before the army released the fictionalised account of Tillman 's death in the Silver Star citation -- which had been approved by McChrystal himself . In the memo McChrystal warned that the army investigation then nearing completion would find it ' highly possible ' that Tillman was killed by friendly fire , and that ' Potus ' -- the President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of any comments he might make ' about Corporal Tillman 's heroism and his approved Silver Star medal in speeches currently being prepared ' . <p> ' I felt that it was essential that you received this information as soon as we detected it , ' the memo went on , ' in order to preclude any unknowing statements by our country 's leaders which might cause public embarrassment if the circumstances of Corporal Tillman 's death become public . ' <p> In a speech two days later at the annual White House Correspondents ' Association dinner , Bush commended Pat Tillman for feeling ' called to defend America ' , but conspicuously avoided any mention whatsoever of the manner of his death . <p> To Mary Tillman , the most incriminating word in McChrystal 's memo is the smallest . ' He says " if " the circumstances of Pat 's death become public , not " when " . Why would it say " if " if they were n't trying to keep it quiet ? ' <p> Tillman 's parents believe that if the President knew , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , did n't . Indeed , Tillman Sr believes that Rumsfeld would have known that his son had died of friendly fire ' within hours ' . <p> ' They were unbelievably prompt in destroying Pat 's things and in quarantining people , ' he says . ' They were Johnny-on-the-spot . That information went right up to somebody who had some serious authority , and by that I mean the authority to falsify this setting . ' <p> In April 2007 , largely as a consequence of Tillman Sr 's efforts , a Congressional inquiry was convened to examine whether the alleged cover-up over Tillman 's fratricide was a result of ' incompetence , miscommunication or a deliberate strategy ' . <p> In August Rumsfeld himself appeared in front of the Congressional committee , along with four , now retired , army generals -- Abizaid , Brown , Kensinger and Richard B Myers , the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff . In a series of questions about how , when and where they had learnt of Tillman 's death and the fact that he had died @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recall ' , or some variation thereof , was used 82 times . <p> Abizaid claimed that there had been a delay of ' 10-20 days ' before he had received the leaked memo of April 2004 , because he was in Iraq , and that he found out about the ' suspected ' fratricide only ' some time between May 6-13 ' when the memo finally caught up with him . But Mary Tillman discovered a press release on the Department of Defence 's own website stating that on April 29 -- the day the memo was sent -- Abizaid was in fact in Afghanistan , talking to Tillman 's platoon leader , Lt Uthlaut . ' I asked him about Pat Tillman , ' the press release quoted Abizaid as saying . ' He said , " Pat Tillman was a great Ranger and a great soldier " , and what more can I say about him ? ' <p> ' The only reason he would have been there is because he knew Pat had been killed by friendly fire , ' Mary believes . ' And he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says she passed this information to the Congressional committee , but it was not raised when Abizaid was questioned . <p> Rumsfeld -- the man who had personally welcomed Tillman into the armed forces -- claimed he could not ' recall precisely ' when or how he had learnt of Tillman 's death , and that he had learnt that it was from friendly fire ' probably around May 20 ' -- almost a month after the fatality . When Dennis Kucinich , an Ohio Democrat congressman on the committee , suggested that Rumsfeld had ' covered up ' the Tillman matter Rumsfeld snapped back : ' That 's just false ... You have not a scrap of evidence or a piece of paper or a witness that would attest to that . I have not been involved in any cover-up whatsoever . ' <p> Kevin Tillman , who remained in the army through his three-year term , and who has always refused to discuss publicly his brother 's death , also testified before the committee . In an impassioned and deeply moving address he spoke of the web of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woven around Pat 's death , and the ' horrific ' attempt to ' hijack his virtue and his legacy ' . <p> ' The least this country can do for him in return is to discover who was responsible for his death , who lied and covered it up , who instigated these lies and benefited from them , then ensure that justice is meted out to the culpable . ' <p> To Amir Bar-Lev , the director of The Tillman Story , one of the great tragedies of the saga is how the myth came to obscure the man . Tillman , he says , ' was taken twice from his family , the first time by death , and the second time by the appropriation that happened , not just by the military but by the culture at large . The government tried to appropriate him as their hero but so did everyone else . The Californians can say he was a great Californian , the Arizonians can say he was a great Arizonian , the right can say he was a great warrior , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ irony is that at the same time as we lionised Pat we dismissed his wishes for privacy . We were going to have him whether he and his family liked it or not .

At the end of it all a total of seven soldiers were disciplined ; nobody was charged with ' negligent homicide ' or with perjury . <p> In the years in which she was investigating what happened to her son , Mary gave up her job as a special-needs teacher .

A lot of people do n't really understand the depth of what happened to Pat -- " Oh , he 's not the only one to die of friendly fire . " But it has absolutely nothing to do with the friendly fire ; it 's all the deceptions around it . That 's why the message of the film is so important . ' She pauses .

Even if the world meets its current 2020 targets for cutting greenhouse gases , that wo n't be enough to stop global warming or avoid dangerous climate change . But it 's not too late , or too difficult , to aim a bit higher . That 's the upbeat conclusion of our new report , ' Plugging the Gap : An easy guide to a safe climate future ' , released at this week 's UN climate talks in Tianjin , China . <p> Heard of the gigatonne gap ?

Emily Twinch reports . <p> ' Generation after generation , the Romany Gypsy never stops trying to prove to people we are not what you think we are .

' People think we are thieves , vagabonds and do n't pay our way . But we do pay . We pay everything you pay . ' <p> Ms Smith-Bendell has dedicated her life to fighting this historic prejudice in order to defend their planning rights .

The book charts her life from her childhood with her parents and eight siblings to the present day and reflects on the historic oppression Romany Gypsies have faced since the 16th century , when King Edward VI passed laws ordering Gypsies to be branded and enslaved . <p> Now Ms Smith-Bendell is working on a new book . This time she is teaching people about the history of Romany Gypsies and the planning system . With an overhaul of the planning system threatening the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be more timely . Six months into the coalition government 's tenure , it has slashed funding for new Gypsy and Traveller sites , and made it harder for them to get planning consent . <p> With increased demand for sites and plans to give communities a greater say on new developments expected to increase opposition , Ms Smith-Bendell says the Romany Gypsy wagons are ready to roll up to the Houses of Parliament if the coalition does not seek to increase the number of Gypsy and Traveller pitches in England . ' We are not going to shut up any more , ' she says . ' There is a need for pitches . If they the government do n't provide them and there 's a need for a protest , then there will be one . ' <p> New pitches look increasingly unlikely . The last government pledged ? 97 million to increase the number of such sites between 2008 and 2011 , which dropped to ? 64 million when the Homes and Communities Agency took over the programme last year . This was a blow for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with what was to come . This summer , Inside Housing discovered that just ? 1.5 million of the ? 17 million allocated to councils for 2009/10 was actually spent . And since coming into office , communities secretary Eric Pickles has scrapped the ? 32 million earmarked for this financial year entirely ( Inside Housing , 20 August 2010 ) . <p> Ms Smith-Bendell is warning that the cuts will force many more Gypsies back on the road . Already the Communities and Local Government department 's bi-annual caravan count , which indicates the number of non-settled Gypsies and Travellers on the road , reveals there were 18,355 Gypsy and Traveller caravans in England in January 2010 , up 5 per cent in July last year . This compares to a 2 per cent yearly rise in the number of pitches provided by local authorities and housing associations in England in January this year , up to 4,918 . <p> Protecting a way of life <p> Ms Smith-Bendell 's own story reveals why assimilating into wider society is n't a straightforward option for Romany Gypsies . She incurred the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' gorgie mush man ' at the age of 20 . ' I was always made to know he was not one of us , ' she says . She first went to live with her husband Terry , with whom she has had two children , in a flat in Bristol where she tried to adapt to a settled life . <p> ' If you went into my garden and got a bird and put it in a cage , it would stop singing . We Gypsies have got an aversion to bricks and mortar , ' she says of how conventional living made her feel . <p> To understand this better , I meet Ms Smith-Bendell in her current home on a cold , rainy autumn day . She has spent the past 15 years living here in a hybrid of a traditional Gypsy lifestyle and everyday village living . Despite residing in such a quaint , settled community , she has managed to avoid being trapped by bricks and mortar . Entering the gates of her premises , the words ' grys poove ' - meaning horsefield @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wagon - one of three Ms Smith-Bendell owns - is immediately visible . <p> Ms Smith-Bendell is a friendly , welcoming lady , worried about how her hair will come out in the photographs . But when the topic turns to the communities secretary she reveals her fighting spirit . <p> ' I would give him a new title - Judge Pickles - because he has made himself judge and jury over every Gypsy in the country with what he is going to do with us if we do n't conform to new planning laws , ' she says . <p> Since coming to power the coalition has scrapped regional special strategies , leaving it up to councils to determine the need for Gypsy and Traveller accommodation provision as part of its localism agenda . <p> Today , Ms Smith-Bendell estimates there is a need for much more than the generally accepted figure of 4,000 pitches in England - largely due to a lack of significant site permission since the 1960s . ' I think it 's a lot higher than that , ' she says . <p> However , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ councils are less likely than ever to build more pitches . The Chartered Institute of Housing and National Housing Federation have both voiced concerns that , if not managed correctly , localism could equate to a ' nimby 's charter ' , meaning planning committees will be disinclined to give planning permission for Travellers ' private sites or new authorised sites . <p> Land of their own <p> This alone would appear to be bad news for Gypsies ; but even if councils do find the cash and grant planning consent , it 's far from a perfect solution for some Romanies . ' This new planning framework is leaving councils to use their own and taxpayers ' money to build local authority sites that Romany Gypsies do n't want anyway , ' explains Ms Smith-Bendell . This , she says , is because many Romanies prefer to live surrounded by their extended families , which is not usually an option on council sites where pitches are allocated according to availability . <p> Instead , many want to buy and build on their own land where they can live with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ applications to build on their own land are turned down , Ms Smith-Bendell estimates . With the advent of localism , this looks like it could get even higher . <p> She says if families try to go through the proper channels , local opposition often means a planning application will fail and an injunction might be taken out against them . As a result , they feel they are left with no alternative but to apply for planning permission retrospectively - partly as a form of protest . <p> ' We use retrospective planning to bring the problem to the fore now , ' she says of a practice Mr Pickles terms ' an abuse of the planning system ' . ' Even if a piece of land ticks all the boxes , there 's so much opposition from the local community we will leave it up to a planning inspector to say yes retrospectively . ' <p> Mr Pickles says the changes to the planning system will put Gypsies and Travellers who ' play by the rules ' on an ' equal footing ' to settled communities . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ settled population , ' he adds . <p> Ms Smith-Bendell learned all this the hard way . Today she is settled in Ashcott , but it was the difficulty she had getting planning permission for her mobile home 20 years ago that prompted her to help other families who are in the same boat . <p> Now , as a result of her experience , she commands the respect of some influential figures - Liberal Democrat peer Lord Eric Avebury for one . ' She has been an activist on these planning problems for many years and an effective one at that , ' he says . ' I 'm in touch with her regularly by email and I rely on her for advice because it gets to the heart of the matter . ' <p> She still tries to live according to her traditions .

And when I ask whether she cooks the traditional rabbit stew her first book refers to so fondly in its title , she replies : ' No Romany Gypsy will eat rabbit since Myxomatosis a viral epidemic affecting rabbits . ' She will make a stew , but it 's more likely to be with beef or chicken these days . <p> Perhaps this is what all Romany Gypsies will have to do to protect their way of life : adapt their traditions to the modern world . <p> To stand a chance in this battle , Ms Smith-Bendell knows Gypsies must beat the planning system .

@@1680233 <h> Neil Gillis : Blacks is back &amp;ndash ; and the proof is in the takeover bids <p> This time last year Neil Gillis , the chief executive of the outdoor retail specialist Blacks Leisure , was staring into the abyss . Following an ill-fated move into surfwear before he took the helm in November 2007 , Mr Gillis was trying to ensure that Blacks avoided financial ruin with a company voluntary arrangement , an insolvency procedure . When creditors approved the CVA in November 2009 , Blacks Leisure was able to ditch 88 unprofitable Blacks , Millets and Freespirit stores and move forward . <p> Skip forward nearly a year and the prospects for Mr Gillis and Blacks Leisure 's beleaguered shareholders looks far rosier . Two days ago , Blacks confirmed it had again received takeover offers from " several parties " , believed to include the private equity firm Lion Capital . Shares in Blacks had traded at 271p in October 2007 but closed at 43p yesterday , despite a jump this week . <p> Lion Capital made an earlier offer for Blacks in February 2009 , along with Mike Ashley , who controls Sports Direct , but formal offers never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the rude health of its hiking enthusiast customers -- it is forecast to make a ? 5m pre-tax loss this financial year -- its turn-around strategy is well under way . Mr Gillis said : " We have sorted out a lot of the problems . The CVA helped us to get back on an even keel . " <p> The biggest change has been getting rid of the boardwear business , which " was a distraction and something we were not very good at " , says Mr Gillis . Bolstered by its completion of a ? 19.7m fundraising earlier this year , Blacks is now refurbishing its estate and is on track to open 15 new stores this year . The average sales density at the new shops is " 30 per cent ahead of the rest of the estate " , says Mr Gilliis . <p> At its Blacks store in Holborn , central London , he waxes lyrical about the company 's focus on retail disciplines , such as sectioning off brands , notably Berghaus and North Face , and how it has added more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ card in May . In fact , Blacks is just the latest ride on what has been a roller coaster career for Mr Gillis , whose previous roles have brought him into close contact with Prince Charles and pop legend Sir Paul McCartney . <p> Before he joined Blacks , Mr Gillis was the chief executive at Esporta , between 2003 and 2007 . He sold the sports club chain for ? 460m to the property tycoon Simon Halabi in late 2006 , although Esporta fell into administration several months after Mr Gillis had left . <p> His time at Blacks Leisure -- which now has 98 Blacks , 208 Millets and 11 Freespirit stores -- has been no less colourful , not least because Mr Ashley , who also controls Newcastle United Football Club , remains major shareholder . <p> The retail tycoon had already looked at acquiring Blacks in 2007 before Mr Gillis joined . Earlier this year , Mr Ashley ratcheted up the pressure on Mr Gillis by blocking the retailer 's proposed ? 20m cash call . He then abandoned his second takeover approach in just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intention of certain suppliers , notably North Face , to boycott trade with Sports Direct . <p> With this " unwelcome distraction " out of the way , Blacks was able to proceed with its ? 19.7m fundraising . Mr Ashley 's refusal to participate saw his stake reduced to 14.5 per cent . " It the fund raising was critical -- without this we could not roll out the new store programme , " says Mr Gillis . <p> Asked about having Mr Ashley on the share register , he smiles and says it is " interesting " . He adds : " It is a bit like the rest of the business . There is never a dull moment with Blacks and there is never a dull moment with Mike Ashley . " <p> Their last meeting was in April , when Mr Gillis presented the rights issue to Sports Direct 's deputy executive chairman and his finance director . Mr Gillis says : " We had a good meeting .

I would not be disappointed in years to come if someone wanted to buy the business . " <p> Despite this week 's bids , Blacks is not yet out of the woods , although the CVA also cut its net debt to just ? 12.6m . For the 17 weeks to the end of June , the group reported a 7.5 per cent fall in like-for-like sales . Mr Gillis says that May was a particularly " tough month " for a lot of retailers . While he accepts that forthcoming public sector job cuts and tax rises means the British retail sector is in for " quite a long tough haul " , a more fundamental change is the shifting dynamic between British retailers and the Chinese manufacturers that supply them . <p> He says that rising costs , currency pressures and wage inflation are leading retailers such as Blacks to increasingly consider alternative manufacturing bases in countries including Vietnam , Sri Lanka and Thailand .

They knew all about the mass torture , the promiscuous shooting of civilians , the outrageous use of air power against family homes , the vicious American and British mercenaries , the cemeteries of the innocent dead . All of Iraq knew . Because they were the victims . <p> Only we could pretend we did not know . Only we in the West could counter every claim , every allegation against the Americans or British with some worthy general -- the ghastly US military spokesman Mark Kimmitt and the awful chairman of the Joint Chiefs , Peter Pace , come to mind -- to ring-fence us with lies . Find a man who 'd been tortured and you 'd be told it was terrorist propaganda ; discover a house full of children killed by an American air strike and that , too , would be terrorist propaganda , or " collateral damage " , or a simple phrase : " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we all knew they always did have something . And yesterday 's ocean of military memos proves it yet again . Al-Jazeera has gone to extraordinary lengths to track down the actual Iraqi families whose men and women are recorded as being wasted at US checkpoints -- I 've identified one because I reported it in 2004 , the bullet-smashed car , the two dead journalists , even the name of the local US captain -- and it was The Independent on Sunday that first alerted the world to the hordes of indisciplined gunmen being flown to Baghdad to protect diplomats and generals . These mercenaries , who murdered their way around the cities of Iraq , abused me when I told them I was writing about them way back in 2003 . <p> It 's always tempting to avoid a story by saying " nothing new " . The " old story " idea is used by governments to dampen journalistic interest as it can be used by us to cover journalistic idleness . And it 's true that reporters have seen some of this stuff before . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Iraq was farmed out to The New York Times 's Michael Gordon by the Pentagon in February 2007 . The raw material , which we can now read , is far more doubtful than the Pentagon-peddled version . Iranian military material was still lying around all over Iraq from the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq war and most of the attacks on Americans were at that stage carried out by Sunni insurgents . The reports suggesting that Syria allowed insurgents to pass through their territory , by the way , are correct . I have spoken to the families of Palestinian suicide bombers whose sons made their way to Iraq from Lebanon via the Lebanese village of Majdal Aanjar and then via the northern Syrian city of Aleppo to attack the Americans . <p> But , written in bleak militarese as it may be , here is the evidence of America 's shame . This is material that can be used by lawyers in courts . If 66,081 -- I loved the " 81 " bit -- is the highest American figure available for dead civilians , then the real civilian mortality score @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Americans knew of . Some of them were brought to the Baghdad mortuary in my presence , and it was the senior official there who told me that the Iraqi ministry of health had banned doctors from performing any post-mortems on dead civilians brought in by American troops . Now why should that be ? Because some had been tortured to death by Iraqis working for the Americans ? Did this hook up with the 1,300 independent US reports of torture in Iraqi police stations ? <p> The Americans scored no better last time round . In Kuwait , US troops could hear Palestinians being tortured by Kuwaitis in police stations after the liberation of the city from Saddam Hussein 's legions in 1991 . A member of the Kuwaiti royal family was involved in the torture . US forces did not intervene . They just complained to the royal family . Soldiers are always being told not to intervene . After all , what was Lieutenant Avi Grabovsky of the Israeli army told when he reported to his officer in September 1982 that Israel 's Phalangist allies had just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's not to our liking , and do n't interfere , " Grabovsky was told by his battalion commander . This was during the Sabra and Chatila refugee camp massacre . <p> The quotation comes from Israel 's 1983 Kahan commission report -- heaven knows what we could read if WikiLeaks got its hands on the barrels of military files in the Israeli defence ministry ( or the Syrian version , for that matter ) . But , of course , back in those days , we did n't know how to use a computer , let alone how to write on it . And that , of course , is one of the important lessons of the whole WikiLeaks phenomenon . <p> Back in the First World War or the Second World War or Vietnam , you wrote your military reports on paper . They may have been typed in triplicate but you could number your copies , trace any spy and prevent the leaks . The Pentagon Papers was actually written on paper . You needed to find a mole to get them . But paper could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ destroyed . At the end of the 1914-18 war , for example , a British second lieutenant shot a Chinese man after Chinese workers had looted a French military train . The Chinese man had pulled a knife on the soldier . But during the 1930s , the British soldier 's file was " weeded " three times and so no trace of the incident survives . A faint ghost of it remains only in a regimental war diary which records Chinese involvement in the looting of " French provision trains " . The only reason I know of the killing is that my father was the British lieutenant and told me the story before he died . No WikiLeaks then . <p> But I do suspect this massive hoard of material from the Iraq war has serious implications for journalists as well as armies . What is the future of the Seymour Hershes and the old-style investigative journalism that The Sunday Times used to practise ? What is the point of sending teams of reporters to examine war crimes and meet military " deep throats " , if almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up in front of you on a screen ? <p> We still have n't got to the bottom of the WikiLeaks story , and I rather suspect that there are more than just a few US soldiers involved in this latest revelation . Who knows if it does n't go close to the top ? In its investigations , for example , al-Jazeera found an extract from a run-of-the-mill Pentagon press conference in November 2005 . Peter Pace , the uninspiring chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , is briefing journalists on how soldiers should react to the cruel treatment of prisoners , pointing out proudly that an American soldier 's duty is to intervene if he sees evidence of torture . Then the camera moves to the far more sinister figure of Defence Secretary Donald Rumsfeld , who suddenly interrupts -- almost in a mutter , and to Pace 's consternation -- " I do n't think you mean they ( American soldiers ) have an obligation to physically stop it . It 's to report it . " <p> The significance of this remark -- cryptically sadistic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of course . But the secret Frago 242 memo now makes much more sense of the press conference . Presumably sent by General Ricardo Sanchez , this is the instruction that tells soldiers : " Provided the initial report confirms US forces were not involved in the detainee abuse , no further investigation will be conducted unless directed by HHQ Higher Headquarters . " Abu Ghraib happened under Sanchez 's watch in Iraq . It was also Sanchez , by the way , who could n't explain to me at a press conference why his troops had killed Saddam 's sons in a gun battle in Mosul rather than capture them . <p> So Sanchez 's message , it seems , must have had Rumsfeld 's imprimatur . And so General David Petraeus -- widely loved by the US press corps -- was presumably responsible for the dramatic increase in US air strikes over two years ; 229 bombing attacks in Iraq in 2006 , but 1,447 in 2007 . Interestingly enough , US air strikes in Afghanistan have risen by 172 per cent since Petraeus took over there . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is now bleating that WikiLeaks may have blood on its hands . The Pentagon has been covered in blood since the dropping of the atom bomb on Hiroshima in 1945 , and for an institution that ordered the illegal invasion of Iraq in 2003 -- was n't that civilian death toll more than 66,000 by their own count , out of a total of 109,000 recorded ? -- to claim that WikiLeaks is culpable of homicide is preposterous . <p> The truth , of course , is that if this vast treasury of secret reports had proved that the body count was much lower than trumpeted by the press , that US soldiers never tolerated Iraqi police torture , rarely shot civilians at checkpoints and always brought killer mercenaries to account , US generals would be handing these files out to journalists free of charge on the steps of the Pentagon . They are furious not because secrecy has been breached , or because blood may be spilt , but because they have been caught out telling the lies we always knew they told . <p> US official documents detail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ website some 391,832 US military messages documenting actions and reports in Iraq over the period 2004-2009 . Here are the main points : <p> Prisoners abused , raped and murdered <p> Hundreds of incidents of abuse and torture of prisoners by Iraqi security services , up to and including rape and murder . Since these are itemised in US reports , American authorities now face accusations of failing to investigate them .

@@1686231 <h> Detaining and deporting the mentally ill <p> This appeal raises interesting questions about the approach the courts should take when considering whether detention pending deportation is legal in a case involving an ex-convict with serious psychiatric illness . A failure to implement a Home Office policy on the subject did not automatically make the decision to detain unlawful . However , the Court of Appeal was not unanimous on what the correct test for legality was . <p> This was an appeal against a deportation decision by the Secretary of State for the Home Department . The Appellant had a long criminal record and in 2007 was sentenced to 4 years in prison for robbery . Later that year , the deportation decision was made . However , the Appellant also had a history of serious psychiatric illness . <p> The Secretary of State had made the decision to detain the Appellant pending deportation after release from prison using to his powers under paragraph 2(3) of Schedule 3 of the Immigration Act 1971 . The Secretary of State also had a written policy for making the decision to detain people pending deportation . The policy stated that mentally ill persons would not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the detention . <p> A judge had found that the Secretary of State had failed to apply his own policy , because , although there had been reviews of the Appellant 's detention , these reviews had barely touched upon his mental health problems . The Appellant sought various remedies , including temporary admission back into the UK , damages for breach of his Article 5 ECHR right to liberty and a declaration that his detention was unlawful . The focus of the appeal was on the judge 's refusal to grant a declaration that the detention was unlawful and grant a mandatory order for release . <p> The arguments <p> Essentially the Appellant argued that , by failing to take into account his own policy regarding the mentally ill , the Secretary of State 's decision was necessarily unlawful . If the detention would have been inevitable had the policy been applied properly , only then would the decision be lawful . <p> The Secretary of State argued that the failure to apply the policy was a relevant consideration but not determinative of lawfulness . He argued that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 WLR 704 were to be applied and the judge was to take his own view as to whether the detention as lawful . That case concerned the same power being considered in this case , namely paragraph 2 of the 1971 Act which provides for detention pending deportation . Woolf J outlined the following principles : <p> " Although the power which is given to the Secretary of State in paragraph 2 to detain individuals is not subject to any express limitation of time , I am quite satisfied that it is subject to limitations . First of all , it can only authorise detention if the individual is being detained in one case pending the making of a deportation order and , in the other case , pending his removal . It can not be used for any other purpose . Secondly , as the power is given in order to enable the machinery of deportation to be carried out , I regard the power of detention as being impliedly limited to a period which is reasonably necessary for that purpose . The period which is reasonable will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is more , if there is a situation where it is apparent to the Secretary of State that he is not going to be able to operate the machinery provided in the Act for removing persons who are intended to be deported within a reasonable period , it seems to me that it would be wrong for the Secretary of State to seek to exercise his power of detention . <p> In addition , I would regard it as implicit that the Secretary of State should exercise all reasonable expedition to ensure that the steps are taken which will be necessary to ensure the removal of the individual within a reasonable time . " ( Page 706 ) <p> One test or two ? <p> Black LJ considered that it was essential to show that a failure to apply rules or a policy had to be causative of the detention for the decision to be unlawful . Case law did not support a finding that the detention would be unlawful if it was not inevitable that detention would have been decided upon anyway , in the case of a failure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Longmore LJ however considered that case-law indicated that causation was not a necessary element of the question of lawfulness of detention , which was to be assessed according to the Hardial Singh principles ( paragraph 84-88 ) . <p> Maurice Kay LJ considered that the case-law showed two distinct approaches : the application of the Hardial Singh principles and the causation/materiality test . He preferred the causation test , but considered that the outcome would be the same in either case ( paragraph 91 ) . <p> Primary decision-making <p> Black LJ stressed the importance of the court adopting the role of primary decision maker in these cases , given that they involve the liberty of the subject ( paragraph 77 ) . This is unlike the usual public law approach , where the courts will not normally step into the shoes of the person responsible for the initial decision now under consideration and make the decision afresh . <p> The decision <p> Despite the differences in their approach to the case-law , all three judges concluded that the Appellant 's appeal should be dismissed .

This is far from the truth , as this was preliminary research , which actually focused on the cellular processes involved in forming blood vessel scars . <p> The lead researcher is quoted by the Daily Mail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for use in a drug that would be swallowed , injected or inhaled , but it could perhaps be sprayed onto the vein before it is transplanted . This has not been researched any further yet . <h> What kind of research was this ? <p> Coronary artery bypass graft ( CABG ) surgery is a major operation in which arteries or veins from another site in the body are grafted onto those of the heart to bypass diseased vessels . It has saved many lives . One potential complication of heart surgery ( particularly stent insertions and bypass grafts ) is ' neoinitimal hyperplasia ' , the development of scar tissue in the blood vessels immediately around the site of the procedure . It is caused by the migration and growth of smooth muscle cells inside the new inner structure , which can eventually restrict blood flow in the vessel . <p> A number of different mechanisms have been found to inhibit the migration of these cells . In this laboratory study , researchers further examined the effects of different substances on healthy vessel tissue and at the sites @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They were particularly interested in the role of calcium- and potassium-transporting channels found in the cell walls , including one called Kv1.3 . <h> What did the research involve ? <p> The researchers compared different types of smooth muscle cells found in mouse aortas , to determine the characteristics of the normal cells and those that proliferate heavily , potentially leading to scarring . They wanted to profile the types of channels in these cells and see which ones may have been predominant in the different types of muscle cell . <p> Human and mouse smooth muscle cells were cultured , then injured with a 0.3 mm wide scrape across each culture . Cells usually respond to this type of ' injury ' by regrowing into the wound . For 48 hours the researchers treated the cells with chemicals that block the actions of the Kv1.3 ion channels . After this , the researchers counted the number of cells in the wound . The two different compounds tested were called margatoxin and correolide compound C. Margatoxin is found within the venom of certain types of scorpion . <p> Further @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) rather than just on the muscle cells . In these experiments , the development of scarring was again compared in samples exposed to margatoxin and correolide compound C. <h> What were the basic results ? <p> One particular type of potassium channel ( called Kv1.3 ) was found to be involved in the change of smooth muscle cells to the type that could reproduce ( proliferating type ) . This channel was active and abundant within the smooth muscle cells in vessels , and was highly concentrated in scarred human veins . <p> Exposing cultured cells to margatoxin and correolide compound C , both of which can block the Kv1.3 potassium channels , reduced their response to injury , although this reduction was smaller in human cells than in mouse cells . The response to injury in this case was determined by the number of cells that grew into the scrape on the cell culture . <p> In similar experiments on human veins , margatoxin and correolide compound C both reduced the formation of scar tissue . <h> How did the researchers interpret the results ? <p> The researchers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proliferation of smooth muscle cells within the vessels . They say that the results suggest a potential role for substances that can block Kv1.3 as ' suppressors of neointimal hyperplasia ' ( the potentially-dangerous development of scar tissue in the vessels ) . <h> Conclusion <p> This laboratory research has detailed the involvement of a particular potassium channel in the cell wall of smooth muscle cells in mouse and human blood vessels . These channels have been linked with migration and reproduction of the muscle cells , and are therefore implicated in the development of scar tissue in the cardiac vessels following surgery . The study investigated the effects of blocking the Kv1.3 channels with different substances . One of the two compounds studied here , margatoxin , is found in the venom of a scorpion . <p> The news coverage of this study implies that an extract of scorpion venom can prevent the failure of bypass grafts . This is misleading and not supported by the early stage of this research , which focused on the cellular processes behind blood vessel scarring rather than developing margatoxin into a medicine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the margatoxin as a treatment per se , concluding that they have determined a role for Kv1.3 potassium channels in the migration of vascular smooth muscle cells . It must also be remembered that there are a number of reasons why cardiac surgery of this kind may fail , with neoinitimal hyperplasia being only one of them . <p> It is very premature to imply that this research has discovered a treatment for a potentially fatal complication of heart surgery . The Daily Mail quotes the lead researcher as saying that margatoxin would not be suitable for use in a drug that could be swallowed , inhaled or injected .

As long as you understand that the point is to get the ball into the basket at the opposite side of the court you know as much about the real sport as the game does .

@@1686240 <p> London 's Ninja Tune imprint has recently celebrated its twentieth birthday , and has done so with a ludicrously packed boxset they 've dubbed a ' futurespective ' : instead of focusing on what 's come before , they 've elected to draw together a veritable who 's who of current dance music trends . Close relatives of the dubstep/post-dubstep explosion feature heavily -- from Ninja stalwarts like The Bug to newly signed tracks from the likes of Zomby , Dorian Concept , Mala and Dark Sky -- alongside earlier label classics twisted into bizarre shapes by a host of newer names . As well as offering a pretty comprehensive overview of what 's currently going on around the peripheral zones of UK dance music , it functions as a snub to those who tend to pigeonhole the label as just putting out slightly kitsch , stoned breaks and hip-hop variants . <p> With their recent output stretching in directions far beyond the sound of Ninja 's core set of artists , and a new link forged with Flying Lotus ' hot-as-hell Brainfeeder crew , it seemed an appropriate time to take a closer look at the label 's story so far and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duo Coldcut to chat about the journey so far and what 's coming up next . This is the first of two features , focusing on the label 's past -- the second part will look further into its current development and where it 's likely to find itself in the future . <p> The most interesting projects tend to evolve organically , with little more than wits , guts and the guiding hand of adventurous taste to take them toward new spaces and ideas . Two decades after Matt Black and Jonathan More set up Ninja Tune as an outlet for their own now anonymous output , frustrated at their Coldcut guise being locked in a maelstrom of record industry politicking , it 's proved to have legs far beyond its relatively modest origins . " Hey , there was no masterplan -- except to see what we could get away with , " deadpans Black , when I ask whether they 'd ever anticipated seeing the label achieve the success it has . <p> Trapped in a body bind thanks to their existing label 's insistent focus on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the decision to set up their own label while on tour in Japan with a pre-Fatboy Slim Norman Cook . With the Coldcut name temporarily in limbo , they were at a low ebb . " We were in a pretty shit place at the time we went , " explains a warm and chatty More over the phone from London . " Back in the UK we 'd just left a whole raft of meetings and bullshit record company shenanigans and were pretty pissed off about everything to be honest ! Frustration 's always been a useful factor for us because we have to try and use it to fire us up rather than being an armchair negative . " <p> Channeling that frustration into a series of records as DJ Food ( an evolutionary alias later to settle with an entirely different line-up to its original incarnation ) , the label 's coherent aesthetic and growing popularity ensured its remit gradually expanded beyond the Coldcut duo into a blossoming roster of likeminded artists . The likes of The Herbaliser and Funki Porcini in particular pioneered the deeply psychedelic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ label 's primary sound . Even now , it remains an association -- stigma is perhaps too strong a word - attached to Ninja Tune from certain quarters . It 's one not entirely inaccurate in places , as the fuzzy , early hours feel of some of the label 's major players ended up a prime inspiration for a seemingly endless stream of inconsequential imitators . <p> Still , around the time the term ' trip-hop ' was coined , an awful lot of the music emerging from the label 's core group of artists was far more exciting and exploratory than the coffee-table murk the tag is usually associated with . Funki Porcini 's Hed Phone Sex album , released in 1995 , remains a particularly involving listen . A potent and often unnerving brew of druggy paranoia , filthy-minded sentiment and jazz nocturnes , its darkened atmosphere calls to mind a midnight wander around the back alleys of midsummer London . The Cinematic Orchestra 's gorgeous Every Day album , released far later in the label 's lifespan , also seems to have only improved with age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on opener ' All That You Give ' retains a broken majesty , and several reworked and extended versions of tracks from their soundtrack to Man With A Movie Camera drown in barely resolved tension , occasionally punctuated with flurries of breaksy live percussion . <p> Over the first twenty years of its existence , the label 's identity has settled less on a particular sound rather than a certain , hard to define aura . There are certainly similarities between many of their artists - in particular a tendency towards disassembled breaks and jazz-influenced modality - but if there 's anything that binds the disorienting blur of Amon Tobin to The Bug 's crushing digi-dub , or the keening soul of The Cinematic Orchestra to Jaga Jazzist 's heady onslaught , it 's a tendency to join the gaps and solidify connections that might not have been immediately apparent . Coldcut 's seminal Journeys By DJ mix , first recorded in 1993 , could as easily reflect Ninja Tune now as it did then , blurring the lines between different styles of dance music into a single coherent whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aim to dig beneath the music 's surface to uncover the hidden traits shared by all the sounds smashed into its hour long runtime : hip-hop , jungle , house , techno , jazz , film scores and more . The same is true of Big Dada , its hip-hop centric offshoot that has over time grown to encompass a similarly harlequin roster . <p> " I think that 's the founding aesthetic actually , " Black agrees , " because it comes from Jon 's and my DNA , which was in turn formed by the time we grew up , and influences such as John Peel , the great UK music eclectic . We 're all post-John Peel generations nowadays in the UK . " The mapping of routes between myriad strands of music over the last two decades has been a crucial factor in the label 's evolution , he explains . " Part of Coldcut and Ninja Tune 's trip has been to take that idea and then realise it using the hip-hop techniques of mixing and sampling , so that we can not just appreciate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they have sex with each other . " <p> But beyond its ongoing musical development , from vinyl DJ tools through early full lengths to today 's ever-broadening roster , what remains most surprising about Ninja Tune now is how they 've managed to weather a tough two decades for the music industry . As first vinyl then CD sales dropped , and a cultural shift towards the online marketplace and filesharing accompanied the economic downturn , how have they managed to keep their heads above water where so many others have floundered ? " It 's just being careful , being appropriate to sizes , " explains More . " From being able to release some really obscure but wonderful piece of music that we 're into , which might only sell to 500 people - but still be able to make enough money on it to make it worthwhile - to something like Scruff or Cinematic Orchestra that are large sellers . And still apply the same sort of logic , and not balloon out . " <p> And they avoided the temptation to borrow to expand beyond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I were ahead of the whole banking crash scenario , " More continues , " because when we went through this process with a record label from being two blokes who made records in their bedroom to being on Top Of The Pops , and having big sellers , we were flopped on by all and sundry . A bunch of shysters came along and tried to have us with their wicked ways , saying ' borrow this and you 'll be even better ' . " <p> " We never wanted to do that , " agrees Black . " We just wanted to make sure we never got into massive debt . So that everything we did , we knew we could afford to do , rather than taking a coked-up lunch daydream for reality , and ending up splattered all over the sidewalk a few months later . " <p> Alongside some crafty branding tactics -- printing everything on yellow paper when they first began ; Strictly Kev 's iconic artwork and the label 's distinctive logo ; producing Ninja Tune section dividers to send to record @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Coldcut 's , defining successes has been to remain at the vanguard of dance music 's shift into the digital age . " I think Coldcut 's the R&amp;D department of Ninja Tune , " reveals Black . " I think we were the first DJs in the UK to play off laptops . And not because ... " He tails off and laughs . " Well , actually we knew it was fucking cool and it was the way things were going , so it was making a statement ! But it was just about experimenting . " His tone darkens slightly when I clumsily ask about the shift away from a vinyl-loving mindset towards a more digital outlook . He stresses the duo 's role in the development of digital DJing technologies and the importance of maintaining a level of realism around running a label business . " On the one hand , there is that love of vinyl , and the big picture on the sleeve -- try skinning up on an mp3 ! -- but it 's pointless to stick your head in the sand or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see why people get in a lather about it , but we tend not to because it 's not useful . " He reflects for a minute . " And I 'm very happy with my library of digital music , which I can mash up in ways I could n't do with vinyl , using Traktor and stuff like that . " <p> Both maintain that it 's been a constantly fascinating and often exciting trip . " I saw two sardines leave Stealth Ninja 's regular club night in a pre-hipster Shoreditch complaining it was too packed , that was quite funny , " More quips . " Stealth was a wonderful moment , it started life as a launch party for a DJ Food album and we did n't think anyone was going to turn up . In those days it was acid this , smiley face that , and all the rest of it . And it was rammed , so we did it again , and again . " Which works as a pretty decent metaphor for the label 's own development . Initially channeling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seeing what they could get away with over a longer period of time ; the process has all ultimately hinged around a straightforward philosophy , he explains as our conversation ends . " I thought there was a better way of treating artists . At the end of the day that 's what it 's about at the label . There are times when you get artists that can be divas , but I do n't think we 've got any divas on Ninja Tune . We 've just got Ninjas. "

@@1691232 <h> Games review -- Red Dead Redemption : Undead Nightmare <p> The dead walk in the Old West , as Rockstar lampoons its cowboy classic with a riotous mix of zombies , mythical monsters and clever in-jokes . <p> Red Dead Redemption : Undead Nightmare -- this is his boomstick <p> Downloadable content is now one of the most predictable aspects of modern gaming : you know it 'll appear almost instantly after a game is released , that the content will be inessential and overpriced and it 'll be exactly the sort of thing that used to be included for free as an unlockable . <p> The first few downloads for Red Dead Redemption certainly fit that profile and were nothing but a wholly unnecessary bundle of extra characters , weapons , maps , and minor new game modes . This is different though , Undead Nightmare is whole new single player campaign with a proper story , voice acting and brand new gameplay features and locations . And ... zombies . <p> A few fans have already complained that mixing zombies with the entirely un-fantastical Red Dead Redemption was silly , even disrespectful . But right from the start of the intro @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's tongue can be seen to be firmly in cheek . John Marston thinks what 's going on is as ridiculous as you do and although the game never errs into straight farce the atmosphere is far more Treehouse of Horror than Dawn of the Dead . <p> In the game 's opening moments John 's wife and son become infected and after tying them up at home he ventures into Blackwater to find a doctor . What he actually finds is the town overrun by the undead and a torch to set them all on fire with . This is the first of a quartet of new weapons , the most fun of which is the blunderbuss that uses zombie parts as ammo . <p> Although you can go anywhere on the map you want right from the start you have to help liberate towns in order to use them to save or fast travel . A liberated town also means more missions , both key story ones and a range of amusing side quests . <p> The typically excellent script constantly lampoons the original 's storyline , exaggerating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clever and amusing ways . ( So it 's best to complete the original game first , so you get all the jokes . ) <p> Rescuing still living townsfolk takes the place of the original 's bounty hunting , but as well as the undead there are also much rarer supernatural creatures such as Bigfoot . Perhaps the most useful are the four horses of the apocalypse , all of which have a particular special ability such as setting enemies on fire or infinite stamina . <p> Since nobody is around to keep their shops the game constantly warns that ammo is in short supply , but in reality it 's not hard to maintain a decent collection if you keep your head . The Dead Eye bullet time effect now lasts for longer than ever and caving in a zombie 's head with a close up melee attack is pretty easy once you get the hang of it . <p> But that 's the problem really , as Red Dead Redemption already suffered from fairly shallow combat . Since you now never need to take cover or worry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five or more hours actually seems a bit too long . Considering the price though we 're not holding that against the game , especially as there are new multiplayer options as well . <p> Undead Overrun is a sort of Horde/Firefight style survival mode where you and three amigos try to last as long as possible against waves of the undead . At this point the game 's debt to Left 4 Dead becomes even more obvious ( many of the monster types are near identical and there 's even the equivalent of Boomer Bile ) but it 's decent fun nonetheless . There 's also a new standard multiplayer match type thrown in called Land Grab , which is a slight variant on King of the Hill . <p> The whole package absolutely shames most other downloadable expansions ( including the earlier Red Dead ones ) and as silly and shallow as it all is it 's just as unmissable as the main game itself . <p> In Short:A tongue-in-cheek and generously stocked spin on the original game that is far more than the cheap cash-in of most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least as good as the original and the whole story campaign is filled with secrets and extras . New multiplayer options are n't bad either . <p> Cons:Red Dead 's combat was always a touch stodgy and it feels even more repetitive and shallow here . As a result progress does become samey before the end .

@@1697232 <h> Oh no , Nutt again ! <p> A year after being sacked as a government drugs adviser , David Nutt is back to warn of the evils of the demon drink . <p> V <p> 2 November 2010 <h> Get spiked by email <p> Viewers of BBC Breakfast were left in no doubt yesterday about which substance would win the award for Most Evil Drug - at least , according to academic and evidence-based-policy martyr , Professor David Nutt . ' In terms of the cost to UK society today , alcohol is the biggest harm , and that 's the one I think that we should be putting a bit more effort into reducing the harms of . ' <p> His appearance on the Breakfast sofa was related to the publication of a new paper by Nutt and other members of the Independent Scientific Committee on Drugs , a group set up in the wake of Nutt 's sacking from the UK government 's official Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs ( ACMD ) in October 2009 . The paper , published in the Lancet , is based on a one-day workshop where 20 drugs were scored on 16 criteria : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the individual and seven to the harms caused to others . While drugs like heroin and crack cocaine were deemed to be the most harmful to individual health , alcohol came out on top in terms of harm to others . <p> The authors conclude : ' Our findings lend support to previous work in the UK and the Netherlands , confirming that the present drug classification systems have little relation to the evidence of harm . They also accord with the conclusions of previous expert reports that aggressively targeting alcohol harm is a valid and necessary public health strategy . ' In other words , we could really do with a new way to classify drugs because some substances that are currently subject to the strongest penalties for possession or supply - like ecstasy - are really not that harmful while there should be a crackdown on alcohol consumption . <p> Nor does the methodology of the current paper - drug ranking by committee - inspire a great deal of confidence . Nutt 's views on the dangers of alcohol are well known and this method of comparing harms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the evidence . <h> Related categories <p> Moreover , there are problems with the criteria used , which are often not really intrinsic to the drug itself . For example , the individual harm of drugs will include HIV acquired from shared needles . But needle-sharing is as much a consequence of the criminalisation of heroin as the drug itself . If heroin was consumed in the same kind of civilised surroundings as wine , HIV would not be a problem . Road traffic accidents are caused by alcohol and other drugs , it is true , but measuring that effect is difficult ; for example , just because one driver involved in an accident was over the drink-drive limit at the time does not mean alcohol caused the accident . <p> The criteria for harm to others include the potential to destabilise a drug-producing country . Colombia may have such problems , for example , but there 's no reason why growing coca plants should have such a consequence any more than growing barley for beer should lead to militarisation and dictatorship . These consequences are a product @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others also includes family breakdown , but cause and effect work both ways in this situation : separating family problems that cause dependence from dependence that causes family problems is , to say the least , a bit tricky . <p> The Lancet paper is part of a new drive for evidence-based policy . In recent years , politicians have been seeking new ways of justifying policy on a range of issues from health and education to climate change and crime . And there 's no better way to close down a debate - or conjure up a policy when you 've run out of ideas - than by turning to the ' evidence ' . <p> There 's two major problems with this : firstly , expert evidence is useful , but it can only ever capture part of any significant social problem . So , in the case of drugs policy , Nutt and his colleagues have only told us about the harms relating to the consumption of particular substances ; the experts tell us nothing about the benefits . We could , for example , keep records @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ department of the local hospital because they have drunk too much or they 've fallen over due to being three sheets to the wind . But even if we did so , we would know nothing about the far greater number of people who had a good night , who were able to unwind after a stressful day or kindled a romance thanks to a little Dutch courage . <p> More generally , the data on liver cirrhosis or drink-induced assaults ca n't tell us whether we think that drinking is morally acceptable . Even if it were the case that a syringe full of heroin or a bottle of Smirnoff were completely harmless to both the user and others around them , we might still disapprove of the idea of people obliterating their consciousness for recreational purposes . More pertinently , we might recognise that drugs of all kinds can cause harm but that it should be our choice , not one made for us by the state , whether or not to get off our heads . <p> The second problem is that evidence-based policy sidesteps democracy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ politicians simply have no need to ask us what we think . The experts , we are told , have spoken and no further discussion is necessary . From that , it is easy to take one small further step by consciously or unconsciously manipulating the evidence relied upon to produce a suitably convenient outcome : evidence-based policy becomes policy-based evidence . <p> Alcohol is undoubtedly associated with considerable harm , but it is also associated with a lot of pleasure , too . You could say the same about almost every aspect of human life , from skiing to raising children . We can not simply read a scientific report ( or in the present case , a less-than-scientific report ) and discover what to do . What we can do is to be critical of the obsession with evidence-based policy and those , like David Nutt and friends , who puff themselves up in its name .

@@1702234 <h> As the Church has noticed , the countryside is changing -- but largely for the better , writes Clive Aslet . <p> When it comes to platitudes , you ca n't beat the Church of England . This week , at a conference in Derbyshire , it has been turning its attention to the countryside -- and fings , it 's noticed , ai n't wot they used to be . Villages have become dormitories , while house prices mean that only the affluent can afford to live in them . Well , durrr , as my children would say . <p> If the bishops want to find the England of their dreams , one of the few places they could look is the village of Laxton , over the county border in Nottinghamshire . Once , all villages were like this -- full of cheery souls shouting inquiries to each other about hay bales and dog biscuits as they made their way to the thriving pub . But Laxton , with its 14 working farms , is a historical anomaly , the only village in Britain still to practise the medieval open-field system . The next-door village of Kneesall , where the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ estate , is far more typical . <p> This , in turn , is part of a wider transformation . In 1950 , 90 per cent of the people in the average village would have derived their living , directly or indirectly , from the land . Old-timers were suspicious of " artificial " , as chemical fertilisers were called , and some even scattered their seed from baskets as in biblical times . <p> Now , Britain 's intensive agricultural system employs hardly anyone . The great industries of the countryside are retirement and tourism . Young people are drifting away , and services have been closing down . A few weeks ago , I visited Wigtown , a delightful community of 900 souls on the north side of the Solway Firth . Having been served pork belly and pommes dauphinoises at the bed and breakfast ( which is what food in the countryside is like these days ) , I went to a ceilidh at the literary festival . If I 'd had a heart attack , the ambulance from Dumfries would have taken an hour to arrive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the countryside is changing . But it 's scarcely being overwhelmed by woe -- and many of the changes are for the better . Take those rising house prices . First , pretty cottages are a finite asset , so they 've become more expensive than in the Sixties ( when up-to-the-minute land agents were advising landowners to demolish them ) . But the reason better-off families want to live in them is because , despite the lack of rural services , they love the lifestyle . <p> This , in fact , reflects the countryside 's greatest strength . Why are house prices high ? Because the areas are so nice . Increasingly , talented , go-ahead people can live wherever they choose . As these entrepreneurial types start families , they 'll seek places that offer the best quality of life -- in other words , the countryside . Perhaps they 'll avoid Hambleden in Oxfordshire -- a prosperous , beautiful area , but a broadband blackspot where the chairman of BT once had the only super-fast connection . But they 'd be fine in Dumfries and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Dublin . <p> Where these entrepreneurs go , jobs follow . They 'll give the sons and daughters of the village the chance to live there , too -- and help to cut the commuting that is turning communities into dormitories . After all , commuters are not all prosperous urbanites popping down for the weekend ; they include families who have been in the village for centuries , who can not find work within walking distance of where they live . <p> More broadly , the next few years will probably see a move away from the car -- once a liberation for remote communities , but now something of a curse . If rising fuel prices and concerns about carbon emissions force country people to wean themselves off their dependency on the car , and to think more locally simply because they ca n't afford to fill the tank , there could be a long-term gain : people will get to know their neighbours again , and village spirit will revive out of necessity . <p> In fact , there are signs of this happening already . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must close . Listeners to The Archers will know all about community-run shops ( although only yesterday , someone emailed from Devon to tell me that the Ambridge experience has been plain sailing compared with her own ) . Old people who work in them gain a sense of purpose , and youngsters obtain crucial work experience . Many of the shops , which are growing in number , draw upon the accountancy skills of the very commuters the bishops decry . <p> Then there are the other positive signs . Not so long ago , a gastronome would have regarded village life as the worst kind of sensory deprivation . Now , you can find a decent meal almost anywhere , or great ingredients at a farm shop . Will it be cheap ? Probably not . But the cost reflects the wealth of the area , as does the condition of the housing stock . Until the Second World War , most people in the country led lives of backbreaking drudgery , often going hungry or having water streaming through the thatch . It may now be suffering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I know which one I 'd rather have . <p> Clive Aslet is Editor at Large of ' Country Life ' and author of ' Villages of Britain ' ( Bloomsbury )

Beginning with cabinets of tools -- tobaccos pipes , injecting kits and opium capsules -- we move into an array of items that show another side to drug use and its culture . <p> Whether we 're aware of it or not , most of us are users of mood or mind-altering substances , whether it 's a cup of coffee , a glass of wine or an Ecstasy pill . So it 's interesting to see an exhibition that looks at the huge spectrum of the dark yet seemingly bright world of drugs . <p> There is a long history behind their use and purpose in different cultures all over the world , and this show might open a few visitors ' eyes to leave them feeling surprised at what they have discovered . <p> The Wellcome has a reputation for its interest in science and medical equipment , so the section @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a physician from the 1700s . His book , Mysteries of Opium Reveal 'd , shows how keen he was to tell other doctors about the powers and effects of the drug . <p> Fast-forward to the early 20th century and Keith Coventry 's still-life collection , Crack City , chillingly reveals how different items , such as an asthma inhaler , can be used as a homemade crack pipe . <p> The title of his abstract series is the nickname given to a group of tower blocks in London known for their social and drug problems . Coventry 's black and white still , Crack Den , shows three young women lighting up while sat on a mattress . <p> Yet in non-Western culture , substance use is for traditional purposes and religious sacrament -- as seen in Edwin Forgan Myers ' photo collection , Peyote Ceremony and Huichol Village Scenes , from 1938 .

In New York , during the time of " free love " , artist Joshua White designed lights for discotheques . Eventually he became involved with lighting for rock bands The Who , Jefferson Airplane and Jimi Hendrix . <p> For his installation piece The Joshua Light Show , White joined artist Seth Kirby to create what he describes as a " sculptural interpretation of a real 1960s psychedelic laboratory .

It was n't until the 19th century that drugs were at their most potent and most available , so the trade had to be regulated , and by the 20th century there was a national ban on drugs . <p> The exhibition highlights drug use as a form of social interaction , whether in a village in South America or for recreational use in the Western World . High Society shows visitors how drug-use goes back hundreds of years . To us Westerners there is a dark and dangerous stigma surrounding these substances , but to some cultures it 's a way of life .

@@1715240 <h> Listen To This by Alex Ross : review <h> Ivan Hewett gets down to Listen To This by Alex Ross , a lively and fascinating exploration of music <p> Alex Ross 's first book , The Rest Is Noise , was surely the publishing surprise of the decade . It succeeded in doing what all the previous surveys of modern classical music had failed to do , which was to make scary " plinky-plunk " music seem urgent and engaging to a wide audience . The diffident Ross became a celebrity , somewhat to his discomfort . The book sold 200,000 copies and even achieved the distinction of being serialised on Radio 4 . <p> Now comes his second book , a collection of pieces culled from Ross 's music column in The New Yorker . They range over many things : Verdi 's populism , Kurt Cobain 's death , the harmonic turns in Radiohead 's songs , the peculiar magic of late Brahms , the subtle relationship between the Los Angeles Philharmonic and its one-time musical director Esa-Pekka Salonen . <p> It 's a fair reflection of Ross 's wide tastes , but there 's a polemical intention , too , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' classical music ' : not the thing but the name . It cancels out the possibility that music in the spirit of Beethoven could still be created today . " He wants to prove that possibility still exists , by " writing about classical music as if it were pop , and pop as if it were classical " . <p> That will strike some as perverse . We think of pop music as the ephemeral voice of a fleeting cultural moment , whereas classical music consists of frozen monuments living somewhere outside time and space , which appear on earth like an epiphany only when they 're performed . <p> Ross disagrees . For him all classical music is tangled up in its time and place , and lurking in the best pop songs are the very same harmonic and structural devices that give classical music its eternal fascination . <p> Ross is hardly the first to put forward this thesis . If he makes his predecessors seem plodding and pseudy it 's partly because he goes further , tracing the appeal of both pop and classical music @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , classical music actually outdoes pop in its wildness . " If I were in a perverse mood I 'd say that the Eroica ( Beethoven 's third symphony ) is the raw , thuggish thing -- a blast of ego and id -- whereas a song like Radiohead 's Everything in its Right Place is all cool adult irony . " <p> Ross has a wonderful knack for catching the human gesture embedded in a musical phrase . Of the beginning of La Donna ? mobile he says , " the irony of the aria is hinted at in the opening bars , as the players start and stop again , like actors clearing their throats " . He talks of the " joy in darkness " and the " animal pleasure in violence " at the beginning of the Finale of Brahms 's Fourth Symphony , where the brass , timpani and strings " make a curious noise -- rrrrRUH -- rrrrRUH -- like the growl of a sleepy dog " . <p> The vividness may be novel , but the mindset that produced it is not . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revives the spirit of those old-fashioned musical men of letters , of the type that flourished before academia colonised the field . <p> But Ross is keenly aware that the level of musical culture assumed by earlier proselytes for classical music such as Donald Tovey has practically vanished . He avoids all but the bare minimum of technicalities , and is careful to ground them in a graspable image : as in the brilliant essay on the persistence of repeating basses from the Baroque to the blues , where he says the chacona is " a little sonic tornado that spins in circles while hurtling forward " . <p> Ross 's shrewd cultural awareness is also revealed in the way he roots historically remote topics in contemporary realities . In the essay on Verdi he tells us how he stepped out of the opera house in Genoa , and found himself surrounded by a m ? l ? e of wind players from the Italian Alpine military corps , in town for their annual convention . " I was struck by the fact that these amateurs were employing essentially the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The raw matter of Traviata and Trovatore was filling the air . " <p> It was clearly an epiphany for Ross and he wants us to share it ; just as he wants us to see how , in a sweaty stadium in Barcelona , a Radiohead song tapped into some eternal tap-root of music . <p> It 's easy to see where Ross 's heart really lies , in the sense that the essays on Schubert , Mozart and Brahms are so much more deeply felt and insightful than the others . Nevertheless , running through the book is the same Utopian dream that surfaced in The Rest Is Noise : that one day the old categories of classical and pop will melt away , and we will all live together in music 's universal republic .

The restaurant manager wants to choose the menu for us , and I have quickly agreed . <p> " Afterwards , you have to put in that this was not my suggestion , " Barroso , 54 , protests , only half-jokingly , in flawless English .

We may be hundreds of miles south of rainy Belgium but Barroso is in a " uniform " familiar to me from Brussels : blue suit , light shirt , dark tie buttoned at the top . <p> We talk about his background : Barroso 's father 's family was once rather prominent in Portugal -- so prominent , in fact , that his grandfather , an ardent monarchist , was forced to flee to Brazil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ violence against the Portuguese royal family . Returning to Portugal , his father became an accountant in Lisbon ; his mother , from a poorer family , was a schoolteacher .

" I am the first one not to go into science . Everyone else went into mathematics , or science or medicine ... I wanted to go into literature but my mother said it was better , as a profession , to be a lawyer .

Those he recognises get a smile and a nod , but there is none of the backslapping bonhomie I 've come to associate with US and British politicians . Instead , Barroso is relaxed but proper . Even though it 's a warm day , neither of us takes off our suit jacket or loosens our tie . As we eat the disputed foie gras , which is perched incongruously atop a bed of chips , he begins , unprompted , to talk about the rough and tumble of national political campaigning -- and his face comes alive . He reminisces about the 400,000km he travelled by car as opposition leader during long-forgotten municipal elections , and revels in retelling the story of a live television appearance during his first long-shot run for prime minister in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legend . <p> " An interviewer , a lady , was a little provocative and she asked : ' Mr Barroso , do you really believe you 're going to be prime minister ?

' " <p> He laughs uproariously , assuring me he had not prepared the line in advance . " I did not want to lie , " he chuckles . " I knew very well I was n't going to win the election . " The defeat , he argues , was not such a bad thing . At the time , he was n't sure he was ready to become prime minister . Three years later , he was : Barroso and his coalition partners won in a landslide in 2002 . <p> I try to turn the conversation back to the world stage , and mention the first time he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's preparations for war in Iraq in March 2003 when , as Portuguese prime minister , he hosted George W. Bush and Tony Blair in the Azores , less than a week before the invasion began . <p> I had meant the anecdote as a way into talking about the forthcoming meeting with Obama , and about Barroso 's well-known pro-Americanism . But my questioning goes astray -- Barroso thinks I am really asking about his support of the Bush administration during the war , and he becomes more reserved . So he walks me through what must be a much-practised retelling of the reasons for his pro-American war stance -- he thought the invasion was a bad idea but , if the US was going to do it , he was going to back an important ally . <p> As he discusses how he balanced US pressure and anti-war sentiment from European colleagues , our main course is served : John Dory in a light sauce with a side of mashed potatoes with spinach swirled in . We barely notice the change in plates because the conversation has become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pelosi are mentioned . Historical alliances with Britain and Spain are cited .

European officials are feeling let down at the lack of attention from Obama , despite his having being ushered into office two years ago on a wave of European goodwill ; US officials are annoyed that the Europeans seem to need constant care . <p> Barroso warms to the subject , saying both the US and Europe should be criticised . " I think on both sides of the Atlantic , we probably were taking the relationship for granted , " he says , as we finish our fish and hand back our dessert menus unopened . " I very often compare relations between states to relations with people .

" This is a new dessert that the chef has made , just to try . You do n't need to eat it , " he insists . We both protest politely -- but start to clean our plates anyway . <p> I continue to press the case on tensions with Washington , noting that Obama skipped out on the last EU-US summit , which had been planned for Madrid in May , and that the Lisbon meeting appears hurriedly arranged : it is a couple of hours on the end of a Nato summit in Lisbon rather than a standalone meeting in Brussels . ( That city is both the EU 's headquarters and the capital of Belgium , current holder of the bloc 's rotating presidency . ) <p> But Barroso insists the substance of the meeting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ venue , of course , as you know , I can not oppose Lisbon , " he laughs . <p> We finish our desserts . I ask about his relationship with Van Rompuy . After the ritual insistence that the two are working well together , we get lost in a debate on political philosophy , where Barroso quotes both " systems theory " and " the Montesquieu approach of balance of power " . <p> I am struck by how this academic discussion has animated Barroso . He refers to himself as " a former scholar , or an accidental scholar " , and I recall an offhand remark he made at the start of the meal about the outsized role his mother , who died earlier this year , had played in his life -- and her wish that he become a university professor . <p> It suddenly seems that his interest in academia almost supersedes his interest in politics . The pop psychologist in me begins piecing together little nuggets that Barroso has revealed over the course of the afternoon , particularly the grandfather who fled to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against a political life . I also recall that he had talked quite movingly about his political awakening as a teenager , gradually coming to the realisation that Portugal under S ? lazar was not the model state the dictatorship constantly propagandised . <p> Unlike other student leaders during the Portuguese revolution , who became communists or radicals , Barroso said he had always been a centrist and that his prime motivation for rebelling against the regime was its lies and censorship : how strange , he had thought , that a government should prevent its citizens from reading books or listening to certain kinds of music . <p> As our lunch comes to an end , I start to think of Barroso less as a driven politician and more as someone who was permanently shaped by the intellectual deprivations of the pre-revolutionary Portuguese political system . It would explain a lot : his love of the give-and-take of campaigns ; his embrace of academia ; his admiration for the openness of the US ; his strong sympathies for the EU 's new member states , who have thrown off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right into Barroso 's face . But rather than end the meal , he suggests we move to another table , and I heartily agree , keen to put my theory to the test . <p> As if on cue , Barroso , who has been ruminating about his passion for modern art and opera , tells me about a jazz festival just outside Lisbon in 1971 when legends such as Miles Davis , Ornette Coleman and Charlie Haden had played . Although S ? lazar had recently died , his government was still in power and its leaders backed the festival as a good way to draw tourists . <p> " Portugal was a very backwards society , " he says , his voice rising with excitement as he remembers a moment in the concert in between songs when Haden , a world-renowned bassist , took the microphone . " He said : ' I dedicate this song to the black liberation movement of Angola , Mozambique and Guinea-Bissau . ' " The crowd went wild , Barroso recalls . " That 's when I discovered jazz . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Theory of Barroso for him : that what has driven him to his scholarly dalliances , to his passion for the arts and even to the heights of the EU can be traced back to the young man wanting to break free of the stifling autocracy of fascist Portugal . <p> " It sounds like one of those American books on self-help , " he says , disapprovingly but good-naturedly . " I 'm not now going to have a psychological analysis with the Financial Times . " <p> But then he starts to try it on for size . He notes that many of his classmates at law school went on to have successful legal careers in Portugal , while he ventured outside the country to study and see the world . He left the long-sought office of prime minister after less than two years to take the top EU job in Brussels . Then he mentions that one of his guiding principles has been to embrace the new and different .

" Portuguese restaurants in the capital consist mainly of a couple of dozen caf ? s and patisseries around the old Portuguese quarters of Stockwell and Vauxhall , " says Guy Dimond , food and drink editor of Time Out London .

Many salt cod recipes are found in both Spain and Portugal , but these croquetas are pure Portuguese ; they do n't exist in Spain . " <p> Clark has great affection for Portugal and its culinary culture . " I feel almost nostalgic when I visit Portugal , " he says . " It 's a few years behind Spain in development and tourism , so it 's less commercialised , and this is reflected in the food . One of the side effects of the El Bulli phenomenon has been that restaurants in some parts of Spain have become pretentious , overpriced and over-sophisticated . In Portugal the restaurants are less polished , but they excel in doing simple things very well . Portuguese wines really taste of where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all sense of terroir . And the charcuterie is wonderful . The fact that Portugal is a little more remote than Spain has been the saviour of some of its skills and identity .

@@1720231 <h> Journeys and joys , pain and pleasure <h> In an autumn selection of poetry by Jewish writers , we find both charm and audacity <p> By Michael Horovitz , November 19 , 2010 <p> Dannie Abse , gently grand old man of Welsh-Jewish letters <p> For more than 50 years , Elaine Feinstein has quietly stockpiled her diverse literary energies , which continue to glow like a constantly burning bush of inspirations , athwart the contemporary wastes of near-universally officialised Philistia . Her latest book of poems , Cities ( Carcanet , ? 9.95 ) , amounts to a colourfully revealing snapshot album of her physical and mental travels around the globe and through history . <p> While recalling how , All my grandparents came from Odessa/a century ago , she watches today 's migrants , arrive in London with battered luggage , /holding fast to old religions/and histories , remembering/the shock of being hunted in the streets , /the pain at leaving their dead/in broken cemeteries , their resilience/hardwired as birds ' skill in navigation . <p> Feinstein 's fecund relationships with beloved fellow poets -- as with Ruth Fainlight ( whose New &amp; Collected Poems are to be released imminently by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miroslav Holub in Prague - are delicately evoked . But what strikes me hardest in this sequence as in its predecessors , is her unflinching realism in the face of the heavy costs of creativity : the pain waiting on the next page for me/the blank of betrayal which would/rapidly scoop out my life and release/the blood flow of poetry . <p> Lotte Kramer came to England in 1939 with the Kindertransport .

" <p> Dannie Abse 's Two for Joy : Scenes from Married Life ( Hutchinson , ? 15 ) is the only hard-covered book of this round-up , and an outstandingly elegant production , as well befits this gently grand old man of Welsh-Jewish letters . <p> After his wife and muse Joan was killed in a car crash five years ago , Dannie wrote The Presence ( Vintage Books , ? 8.99 ) , a beautiful prose memoir of loss . The proverbial " One for sorrow , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in rural folklore ) is completed with this companion volume of 50 poems of celebration : <p> I lived her life and she lived mine -- /not only in the easy valleys of Pretend/where bosky paths descend to lakes where no swan/is singular ( and fish ignore the hunched Angler ) //but here where the uphill road to happiness/has ordinary speed limits , /and still the revelation is/that there can be such a thing . . . <p> Though the undercurrent of most of these elegiac pieces was bound to be sombre , Abse 's always tender way with words , images and concrete details exquisitely conveys the good humours of his and Joan 's marriage of true minds and bodies : Last night , lying in bed , /I remembered how , pensioners both , /before sleep , winter come , /your warm foot suddenly/would console my cold one . <p> Each of these three poets is well represented in Peter Lawson 's wide-ranging anthology Passionate Renewal : Jewish Poetry in Britain since 1945 ( Five Leaves , ? 14.99 ) . <p> The fate of busy verse editors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get overlooked . In Lawson 's case this would be a pity since his first , all-too-slim volume , Senseless Hours ( Bayswater Books , 57 Central Avenue , Pinner , Middx HA5 5BT , ? 9.50 post free ) , displays considerable wit , intellectual pizzazz and technical audacity . <p> In English Middle Classes , Lawson defines himself via a negative aftermath to an encounter with his conformist brother : I listened patiently for soul beneath/the peremptory condescension , /seeking some hint of feeling , even/interest in me , I experienced rock/where there could be openness/mirrors where there might be/windows , cleverness where I hoped/for knowledge and understanding. /Yet amidst this awful English/middle-class smugness , I felt/revitalised through recognition/of what has shaped my spirit/of resistance &amp; purpose . <p> Lawson 's 12 lines on " Chagall 's ' The Poet Reclining ' ( 1915 ) , still on view at Tate Britain , feel in perfect tune with this lovely painting .

Lawrence has taught creative writing and pioneered programmes in health education for young people in both the UK and US . <p> To her credit , this selection from 25 years ' poetry output is packed with pristine thoughts , emotions and perceptions palpably true to her experience , with none of the literary-careerist clutter that so frequently unpoeticises the verse of more competitively ambitious but less pure-spirited contemporaries . <p> As with many I would consider good Jews , her cornucopia of flowing lines in this book is the more kosher for being unorthodox : <p> The thing is to belong//and I do n't belong , /not to any one thing or/person , any idea or/commitment to anything/that ordinarily/can be relied upon. //I do n't belong as a/wife to a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the horizon/guiding no one/not even myself. //You could say/I am lost/but as I do n't belong/to any one place/anywhere is/somewhere/I call home .

@@1720238 <p> The Sony Ericsson Xperia X8 takes the UI we saw on the Sony Ericsson Xperia X10 mini and flips it over to a device with a 3-inch screen . It shares the same design as the Xperia X10 , so falls neatly between the X10 and X10 mini - we 're surprised Sony Ericsson did n't call it the X10 midi . <p> The biggest selling point of the X10 mini was the small form factor combined with some user interface tweaks that made such a small device usable . The X8 finds itself up against a more conventional array of devices , sitting beneath the high-end Android devices like the HTC Desire . There were a number of lessons to be learnt from the Xperia X10 and we 're surprised that Sony Ericsson has launched the X8 again running Android 1.6 , which was widely criticised previously . <p> It might only be " geeks " that obsess about which version of Android their device runs , but there are a number of handsets out there with Android 2.1 or 2.2 , for example the LG Optimus One , the Orange San Francisco or the Samsung Galaxy Europa , all of which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sony Ericsson has confirmed that an update to Android 2.1 is due before the end of 2010 , but we 've seen these sorts of updates missed before , so we can only judge the X8 on what we have in front of us . <p> Starting with the hardware , we 've mentioned the design follows the other Xperia Android devices we 've seen from Sony Ericsson . Encased in plastic , the phone measures 99 x 54 x 15mm , so is fairly compact and weighs in at 104g - a veritable lightweight . Adding to the funk you get the option of switching back covers for a different colour and our sample came with the option of a pearlescent white or silver . <p> The curved nature of the rear of the handset does make it sit comfortably in the hand , but an ominous creaking as you manipulate it suggests those changeable backs could do with being a little more substantial . Hard buttons are finished in silver , with three ranging across the bottom of the screen offering up menu , home and back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , along with a power/standby button on the top . <p> The first thing that becomes immediately obvious about the buttons beneath the screen is that they are n't backlit , which is a pain when you decide to use the phone in the dark . Otherwise it is an interesting looking device , the soft design offering something different to the majority of phones which are some variation of black . <p> Power the phone on and you are greeted by Sony Ericsson 's custom UI . We 've seen it on the Xperia Android devices previously and it appears that nothing much has changed . Like the X10 mini and the X10 mini pro , you get corner shortcuts which can be customised , meaning quick and easy access to your essential applications . This almost makes up for the fact that Sony Ericsson 's Android skin does n't just let you drop shortcuts onto the home pages as so many do , so the whole thing is less customisable than you 'll find elsewhere . The home pages will let you add widgets , at one per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through . It 's a simple solution , but a little basic , as you ca n't give yourself , say , power control and shortcuts to your favourite social networking apps on a single page which you can elsewhere . <p> The menu too has had a little tweak , so it drags up from the bottom of the screen ( or pops-up on a central button press ) and then offers up all your applications with pages swiping left to right . Sony Ericsson has pre-installed a number of apps to get you started , its biggest selling point is our old foe Timescape . <p> Timescape is Sony Ericsson 's take on integrating your social networks . It uses tiles to bring you your " friend 's " updates and can be filtered so it offers Twitter , Facebook , Messages and Missed calls or any combination thereof . The graphical representation of updates in individual tiles is nice , but we 've never been sold on the implementation . The updates collect a background image from their source , with an individual 's avatar bringing some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even from someone with a high-quality Facebook profile picture , you never really get that quality reflected in Timescape . <p> You can also only see five tiles on the screen at one time , the central presented flat for reading , the others rotating in or out like a Rolodex . The problem is that if you have a large number of updates , like you might from Twitter , then it takes a long time to get through them . You ca n't really browse and you 'll find yourself opting for the Facebook or Twitter apps instead , with their simple list presentation , making Sony Ericsson 's highlight app something of a damp squib . <p> Outside of that you 'll be left to scour the Android Market to fetch more applications to expand the possibilities of your phone . The screen 's low resolution of 320 x 480 and the out-dated version of Android means that you 'll be restricted in what you can get to , but most of the immediate concerns are available to you - the aforementioned Twitter and Facebook , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wo n't get access to some of Android 's nicer features though . The official Adobe Flash app is restricted to Android 2.2 devices and we found the usual work arounds , like the Skyfire browser , would n't work for online video either . You do n't get support for multiple Google accounts , or the like of the 3G Wi-Fi hotspot feature , although this might be of little concern for those just after a basic phone . <p> However , being an Android device means you get synchronisation with Google accounts for your mail , contacts and calendar from the off , and very simple it all is too . You also get free navigation from Google Maps , supported by the Xperia X8 's GPS , but this is a common feature of all Android handsets . <p> Sitting at the core of the Xperia X8 is a Qualcomm MSM7227 600MHz processor ( as found in a number of rival devices ) , so things do move along with some pace , although again , Android 2.2 would offer up better performance and perhaps rid the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ applications . Sony Ericsson 's skin does detract , we feel , from a simple Android experience and it is worth pointing out that the native Android interface in later versions is rather nice - just as we found with the Huawei Ideos . We also experienced some strange events on the X8 - the screen would go blank and become unresponsive , needing a battery pull to restore things - so there is perhaps some ironing out of bugs to do . <p> The 3-inch 320 x 480 capacitive display is fairly responsive , but there is bit of a squeeze around the on-screen keyboard . With practice we found the keyboard to be good enough and in landscape you get just about enough space to use it with two thumbs . We did find the occasional lag issue where the keyboard could n't keep up , freezing for a second before belting out an approximation of the characters we 'd pressed . It will predict and correct as you go along though and there are always third-party applications you can install to alter the keyboard if you wish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found that dragging around maps and webpages did n't cause any problem , rendering on the screen quickly enough . <p> Sitting on the back of the X8 is a 3.2-megapixel camera , but no flash . The camera performance is basic , typical of this class of phone . It is of the fixed focus variety so does n't really excel in any conditions , with images lacking clarity and detail . This is accompanied by video capture at a maximum 640 x 480 , at 30fps . Again , the performance is average and although it does n't step up to the HD footage that high-end handsets now offer , it does beat some rival Android handsets in terms of resolution . <p> Sony Ericsson has tweaked the music player , and it is combined with better than average headphones and an external speaker which is excellent , just the sort of thing to belt out tunes in a bus stop with your mates , much to the annoyance of others . You get volume control from the buttons even when the screen is off - it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lock screen , so you have to unlock and re-enter the music player to change tracks or pause music .

@@1720239 <h> Does tomato juice fight osteoporosis ? <p> Share : <p> Save : <p> Subscribe : <p> Print : <p> Behind the Headlines <p> Friday November 19 2010 <p> Tomatoes have especially high levels of lycopene <p> " Two glasses of tomato juice a day strengthens bones and can ward off osteoporosis , " The Daily Telegraph reported . It said scientists have found that an ingredient in the drink , called lycopene , slows down the breakdown of bone cells , protecting against the disease . <p> This news story is based on a small pilot study that compared the effects of lycopene supplements and tomato juice on chemical signs of bone loss in postmenopausal women . Women taking lycopene from either juice or pills had lower levels of the chemical by-product associated with osteoporosis . <p> The findings of this study highlight an avenue for further research . However , it is too soon to conclude that tomato juice will help fight bone disease . The researchers , though optimistic , make it clear that their study is a pilot and that larger studies that measure actual bone loss or fractures , rather than the signs of the disease , will provide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? <p> The study was carried out by researchers from St Michael 's Hospital in Toronto and the University of Toronto , Canada . <p> The study was funded by tomato juice manufacturers , the makers of the lycopene supplements and various other organisations . These included the Canadian Institutes of Health Research , the research and development departments of Genuine Health Inc. , the HJ Heniz Co , Millennium Biologix Inc. , Kagome Co ( Japan ) and LycoRed Ltd ( Israel ) . <p> The study was published in the peer-reviewed medical journal Osteoporosis International . <p> The Telegraph covered the research well , although it is important to highlight some of the study 's shortcomings including its small size and the fact that it measured a surrogate marker of bone loss , rather than actual bone loss or fractures . <h> What kind of research was this ? <p> This small randomised controlled trial investigated whether levels of a substance called N-telopeptide , a marker of bone loss , in the body could be affected by lycopene supplementation in pill form and from tomato juice . Lycopene @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fruit and levels of lycopene are especially high in tomatoes . Antioxidants in general are thought to help prevent damage to cells by neutralising substances called " reactive oxygen species " ( ROS ) , which are by-products of the metabolic process ( how the body breaks down food ) . <p> The researchers enrolled early postmenopausal women , aged 50 to 60 years old . Women at this age lose bone at an accelerated rate and , according to the researchers , some studies have shown that the rate of bone loss and damage to bone cells is increased by rising levels of ROS . <p> In this study , the researchers wanted to see whether lycopene supplementation would reduce evidence of bone loss in women at high risk . <h> What did the research involve ? <p> The researchers enrolled 60 women who had been postmenopausal for at least a year and who were aged between 50 and 60 years . Women were excluded if they were smokers or if they were taking any medications that might affect their bone metabolism or have antioxidant properties ( for example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diabetes ) . They were asked not to consume any vitamins that may contain antioxidants or foods containing lycopene , such as grapefruit and watermelon , for the duration of the study . <p> The women were randomly allocated to one of four groups : 15mg of lycopene from regular tomato juice , 35mg of lycopene from lycopene-rich tomato juice , 15mg of lycopene from a capsule , and a placebo capsule containing no lycopene . <p> All the women were asked to refrain from eating foods that contained lycopene for one month before the start of the study . Height , weight , blood pressure and a blood sample for analysis were also taken before the study started . <p> The women took the supplement twice a day with meals . Further blood samples were taken for analysis after two and four months of supplementation . The women kept a daily food diary to record the other food and drinks they consumed in the seven days before a blood test . The study lasted for four months . The researchers were mainly interested in blood levels of the substance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the blood will increase if bone is being broken down . The researchers also measured a number of other substances in the blood including proteins and enzymes , and also tested blood samples for antioxidant capacity . <p> The researchers compared the levels of N-telopeptide in the three lycopene supplementation groups with those in the placebo group . They also merged the three lycopene supplementation groups into one group to compare it separately against placebo . This was the main analysis they presented . The analyses were adjusted for factors that might affect the relationship between lycopene and bone health , such as BMI , age , blood pressure , years since menopause and levels of antioxidants and bone-loss markers at the start of the study . <h> What were the basic results ? <p> The total amount of lycopene absorbed by the body was the same for both women taking supplements and those taking tomato juice . As expected , women taking supplements had more lycopene in their blood than those on placebo at the two- and four-month follow-ups . <p> After two months , blood levels of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ placebo group showed increased levels . This difference between the treatment and placebo groups was significant and present at four months . The blood levels of other substances also increased , such as beta-carotene ( a pro-vitamin also found in tomato juice and a product of lycopene metabolism ) . <h> How did the researchers interpret the results ? <p> The researchers concluded that the levels of reduction in N-telopeptide in the groups receiving lycopene are comparable to those seen in postmenopausal women who are supplemented with calcium and vitamin D , both of which are recommended for preventing osteoporosis . <h> Conclusion <p> This was a small randomised controlled trial which the researchers themselves called a pilot study . It provides preliminary evidence of an effect , but must be followed by larger , more robust studies that have clinically meaningful outcomes . <p> The researchers delivered an in-depth and insightful report of their research , highlighting the main shortcomings of their study . While they are optimistic about their findings , reporting that the size of the reduction in N-telopeptide was similar to that seen as a result @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they did not measure bone mineral density ( BMD ) or follow the participants for long enough to observe any significant changes in BMD . <p> This means we do not know what effect the reduction in N-telopeptide has on BMD or other outcomes such as fracture rates , which are the important clinical outcomes for women at risk of osteoporosis . As such , the research does not provide evidence that lycopene has a clinically important benefit for postmenopausal women . Longer studies would be needed to determine whether lycopene has a role in preventing osteoporosis . <p> Importantly , giving the women supplements with greater concentrations of lycopene did not affect the total amount absorbed by the body . This suggests that the body may only absorb what it needs and does not take in more simply because it is given more . <p> The relationship between beta-carotene and lycopene may also need further research , as it is not clear which of these antioxidants ( or both ) might be responsible for the changes seen .

But perhaps not for much longer . <p> One is the idyllic countryside to the north of Winchester at Barton Farm where developers plan to build 2,000 homes . <p> The other is land between Wickham , Knowle and Fareham , where this week Fareham Bourough Council ( FBC ) backed plans to build some 7,000 homes , creating a housing estate the size of Petersfield . <p> The fact that both have come under the gaze of developers is a blow to green campaigners whose hopes were raised following the scrapping of the South East Plan earlier this year , and with it regional housing targets . <p> But councils such as Fareham continue to back development plans on greenfield sites . <p> And even when they did n't the courts last week sided with the potential developer of Barton Farm , CALA Homes . <p> In fact , Mr Justice Sales ruled in the High Court that the old housing targets are still in force , following CALA Homes ' challenge to the Government decision in July to abolish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that there has been huge opposition to both developments may not , ultimately , stand in the way of their going ahead . <h> Promoted stories <p> When FBC bosses arrived at Thursday 's meeting to discuss the Wickham , Knowle and Fareham home development plan , they were met by the sight of some 40 protesters . <p> " Fareham 's figures state a need for 2,000 homes . But they 're using this plan for a town of 7,500 " <p> But that did n't stop the Tory-run council from giving its backing to the development . <p> The plan is now likely to go to a public inquiry and an action area plan will be drawn up before more detailed plans go back before the council . <p> Council bosses say there are some 2,000 people on the housing waiting list because of the gap between house prices and salaries . <p> But protesters say the scheme is flawed . The situation in Fareham is being repeated across Hampshire and the rest of the country . <p> One of the protesters was Caroline Dibden , chair of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) South Hampshire , who helps to run the South Hampshire United Voices campaign against the development . <p> She said : " People have said to me : ' Where else will the housing go , if it does n't go here ? ' " But they are missing the fundamental point . Fareham 's own figures state a need for just 2,000 affordable homes . They are using this plan for a town of 7,500 , together with eco-town funding , to try and accommodate that whole need outside the city . This is neither the right place , nor is there a need for such a large development . <p> " Neighbourhoods and community groups should be asked properly how their neighbourhood should be developed . <p> " Due to a lack of thorough community engagement to date , people are only now becoming aware of the size and horrendous traffic and unfunded infrastructure implications of the new town proposal . <p> " A petition of nearly 1,000 signatures has been collected so far in Fareham against the Strategic Development Area . More than 700 postcards from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shapps , the Minister for Housing and Local Government . " <p> Christopher Napier , chairman of CPRE added that the group is not against all development . <p> " Elsewhere in the county , CPRE Hampshire has been supportive in principle of an eco-town at Whitehill-Bordon , which is almost all brownfield development , on the basis that some development is necessary after the Army moves out , and that the existing town is in need of improvement and better facilities -- which the new eco-town would bring , " he said . <p> " The proposed new town north of Fareham does not meet those criteria . <p> " In this case , we would be looking at building on an important greenfield site between Fareham and Wickham , which would be very damaging to the countryside , a fact that can not be disguised by calling it an ' eco-town ' .

@@1723230 <h> Manufacturers can help make Britain a world leader <h> Over the past decade manufacturing has demonstrated its diversity , strength and ability to deliver significant productivity and competitiveness gains - but the government must do its bit , says the manufacturers ' organisation , EEF . <p> Exports of British manufactured goods have been tracking the recovery in world trade much better than those from other parts of the economy . <p> The UK 's economic recovery was always likely to evolve in fits and starts and , even though it is a year since we turned a corner , feelings of uncertainty are only slightly diminished . We need only look across the Irish Sea to be reminded that there are still reasons for caution . <p> No one , not least a government with significant spending cuts in it sights , should assume that a private sector revival will continue to gather momentum . And , while any growth is to be welcomed , we need to learn the lessons of the past decade by striking a balance . This means the right type of more balanced growth from innovation , investment and exports to secure the UK 's prosperity . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is tinged with optimism . The UK has been making some progress towards building the foundations of sustainable growth , for which manufacturers can take significant credit . The past four quarters have seen a strong and positive contribution from the UK 's industrial sector , where output has been expanding at its fastest pace since the end of the last economy-wide recession in 1994 . <p> A major component of this has been manufacturers ' ability to capitalise on export markets . Exports of British manufactured goods have been tracking the recovery in world trade much better than those from other parts of the economy . EEF 's latest research looking at the shape of British industry shows that while plans for growth were inevitably derailed during the recession , the focus for the next three years is to make further gains in global markets , underpinned with investment in new machinery and innovation in the UK . <p> This activity by manufacturers , if realised , will go a long way towards filling the gap left as the public sector retreats . Over the past decade manufacturing has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ productivity and competitiveness gains . As the responsibility for creating jobs and wealth now falls increasingly on the shoulders of the private sector , manufacturing will have to translate the gains of recent years into a step-change in growth . <p> To do this requires manufacturers of all shapes and sizes . We need start-ups that bring creative innovation and ideas to market as well as large companies that anchor supply chains and make crucial investments that benefit entire industries . <p> Herein lies the challenge . With internal and external hurdles to overcome at both ends of the spectrum , young companies can not finance their initial growth with internal resources alone , yet struggle to access external finance . Mid-size companies planning for transformational growth that could make them global players can get caught up in a thicket of red tape , especially employment regulation , and a still unpredictable tax system . <p> Growing a generation of larger manufacturers that will expand year on year is vital for the wider economy and the nation 's growth potential . As the Government fleshes out its Growth Paper and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broad agenda for growth that works for all sectors and types of companies . <p> It must also recognise where the blockages to the right type of growth lie . This begins with government becoming a more strategic partner with the private sector . <p> Partnership with industry can help make the UK the investment location of choice , with an internationally competitive business environment and a strong , highly visible , industrial base . It will also require government to be open-minded in its approach to the future shape of manufacturing and not limit its vision solely to a narrow one of R&amp;D in so-called " high tech " industries . It must also create a tax system that encourages innovation and capital investment . Finally , to maximise the impact of public resources , government should target its strategy at high growth industries where the UK has a competitive advantage , as well as leveraging the multiplier effect of large companies who cascade their benefits down the supply chain and across the economy into wider areas such as skills . <p> The Prime Minister was right when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than simply get out of the way . A shift in emphasis from the public to the private sector is central to long-term growth . Overall , there are reasons to be confident about manufacturing generating the sustainable economic growth the UK needs , but we can not take this for granted . It will require ambition , certainty and the most competitive environment government can provide for companies to realise those ambitions here in the UK . If this is delivered we , as a nation , can justifiably expect our business leaders to step up to the mark . <p> Terry Scuoler is chief executive of EEF , the manufacturers ' organisation 
@@1723231 <h> Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story <p> The late Cardinal Hume withdrew his support for parish-based conversions in the early 1990s because of the opposition of some bishops ( Photo : PA ) <p> In the words of Cardinal Ratzinger then , ' what are the English bishops afraid of ? ' <p> On Saturday evening , I received a telephone call from a Catholic priest , formerly an Anglican clergyman , who had been one of a group of influential Anglo-Catholics ( the most senior being the Rt Rev Graham Leonard , formerly Bishop of London ) who in the early 90s had entered into negotiation with a group of Catholic bishops led by Cardinal Hume , on the possibility of devising a method whereby Anglicans might convert to the Catholic Church not individually , but in parish-based groups . My caller was clearly excited , having learned in more detail than has yet been published , the terms under which the Ordinariate will be set up . " They 've given us everything we were asking for , " he said . " It 's all there . " <p> I had been in contact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had kept me fully informed as each meeting took place . I kept copious notes , later confirmed by the minutes of the meetings , which were leaked to me by more than one participant . This information formed the basis of a detailed and accurate account of what had happened , which appeared in my book The Roman Option some time after the whole thing had been torpedoed by the opposition of certain English Catholic bishops , as a result of which Cardinal Hume -- who in the negotiations had been entirely supportive of the Anglican negotiators -- lost his nerve and withdrew his support . The scheme foundered and sank , some thought without trace . In Rome , Cardinal Ratzinger asked " what are the English bishops afraid of ? " Pope John Paul asked the former Bishop Leonard : " Why are the English bishops so unapostolic ? " <p> When my book appeared the cardinal issued a categorical denial of my account ( strongly implying that my report of Cardinal Ratzinger 's and the Pope 's words were a blatant fabrication ) and a condemnation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the Catholic bishops of England and Wales even though few of the bishops can possibly have read it at the time . <p> So , I was publicly branded by my own bishops as a liar . I was able to have this statement withdrawn after a long correspondence with the statement 's author ( one of Westminster 's auxiliary bishops ) , by insisting that if it was not I would publish the minutes of the meetings to show that I had been telling the truth . Since I was very unwilling to imply that Cardinal Hume had himself been lying , or even wholly in error , I was profoundly relieved when this was agreed , though the damage to my book had been done . <p> Why had I bothered ? What was the use of those years of work on the book , I wondered . Far fewer people would know about the statement 's withdrawal than about the book 's formal condemnation . There was one interesting answer to that question , however , which made me feel a little better . I received @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the papal nuncio had ordered six copies of my book : so , The Roman Option would be read in Rome . But by whom ? It was an intriguing question . <p> Time passed . Women priests were ordained . A sort of church within the Church of England , which declared itself out of communion with women priests and those bishops who ordained them , emerged . It had its own non-territorial bishops , certain of whom , after more than a decade , reopened negotiations with the Catholic Church : not , this time with the English bishops , whom they now did not trust , but very quietly , in Rome itself . <p> One day , I received a phone call from Rome . It was from a member of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith , whose former prefect was now Pope . I was asked for an undertaking to mention to nobody either the name of my interlocutor or , at that time , even the fact that the conversation had taken place . Things were at an early and delicate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possibility of movement along the lines of the former negotiations . They had read my book . Could we talk ? <p> I told them that I was n't as closely in contact with the Anglican side as I had been , for obvious reasons . But there was one thing I was sure of : that the whole thing would be sunk unless the English bishops were kept firmly out of the loop : they should be told nothing . There was a silence . " Your remarks are noted , " he said . But it was clear to me that if the English bishops had n't been told yet , that was a decision that had already been made . <p> Time passed again , though less of it , this time . To the astonishment and dismay of some Catholic bishops Anglicanorum coetibus was published . And now , we are told ( I had to smile ) that in the words of the Herald report , " The dioceses of England and Wales have pooled a quarter of a million pounds to fund the Ordinariate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formed , the local dioceses would provide help to Anglican clergy coming over both in terms of housing and financial aid " . Cor ! Does that mean in every diocese , even on the south coast ? <p> I have explained in previous blogs why I think this is an entirely desirable development . I just have one question . Why could this not have happened 15 years ago ? And what is the answer to Pope John Paul 's and the then Cardinal Ratzinger 's questions : What were the English bishops afraid of ? And , a tougher question : why were the English bishops so unapostolic ? <p> Perhaps things are different now . We must all earnestly pray that they are . <p> Dr Rowan Williams tells Vatican Radio he hopes the new structure will deepen appreciation of the Anglican patrimony <p> Dr William Oddie is a leading English Catholic writer and broadcaster . He edited The Catholic Herald from 1998 to 2004 and is the author of The Roman Option and Chesterton and the Romance of Orthodoxy . <h> Comments <h> Comment Policy <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spirited and lively debate .

Not that he 'll get very far ... <p> NG <p> Pope John Paul II asked why the English bishops were so unapostolic . I wonder why he did nothing to ensure that new appointments were not in the same old mould . I pray that Pope Benedict , who has clearly seen the wisdom of keeping Anglicanorum coetibus firmly under Roman control , will bear this in mind when making new appointments ( including the first Ac Ordinary ) . <p> Winston Lewis <p> Excellent article and how true .

It is about time they realised they will not be taking seats in the HOuse of Lords . <p> Alec <p> Perhaps the opposition came from certain liberal-minded Bishops fearful of having more traditionalists in their dioceses , with some Anglo-Catholics having a reputation of being more Roman than Rome . Opus Dei , Neocatechumanate , Lefebvrists , and now Anglo-Catholics -- they could only see troubles ahead . <p> Cor de Lion <p> My dear brother in Christ , I am a middle-aged Anglican priest who for family and health reasons can not at this time enter the Promised Land of the Ordinariate . I am so fearful of negative backlash from what you have disclosed here ! God knows how I tried to make my way into the Catholic Church as an individual -- and how difficult that became even though I had no presumptions about being a Priest -- just wanting to be a faithful , traditionalist Catholic with no sharp edges or axes to grind ! Please do not give our enemies any grounds to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offer of the Ordinariate ! Do please avoid the temptation to be too triumphalist . <p> http : //twitter.com/MargaretYo Margaret Yo <p> I would think those questions have little bearing on the present . Best to move forward . <p> Magdalene <p> Cor de Lion : we await you ! <p> RT <p> The Ordinariate is right and good , but it is for groups . What of those anglican clergy who wish to come as individuals . Will there be any arrangements for them as there were a few yeatrs ago ? This is not a rhetorical question . I really want to know . <p> Kyriakos <p> In addition to the things you have mentioned , the fear of public opinion ( in a country where there is anti-Catholic prejudice ) that they are poaching Anglicans could be the strongest reason.Liberals are infamous for trying to be always politically correct . <p> Kyriakos <p> Dear Cor de Lion I am Catholic belonging to one of the Eastern Catholic Churches . We pray and welcome you to the Catholic Church . We Catholics have diverse rites , In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Catholic Churches ( Latin and two Syriac Churches ) all accepting the bishop of Rome(Pope) as their head.It is not uncommon to have on one side of a street a parish church of one Catholic Church and one the other side that of another.But we all know we belong to the one Catholic Church.My hope is that the Anglican Ordinariate become another ' sui jurist ' ( self governing ) Church in the Roman Catholic Church.Also thank you for the advice NOT to be triumphalist.Praying for your health and family . <p> Alec <p> I think in the first wave , groups of laity with their priests are forming the core of the Ordinariate to get it off the ground , but in future , anyone , an individual priest or layperson , should be able to join the Ordinariate , perhaps close to where they live . So far , parishes that have declared their public support are based in the south , an area pastorally overseen by the three active bishops , but one hopes as time goes on , there will be groups joining the Ordinariate in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appointed , any priest or layperson should be able to apply to him direct to join . <p> Sigfridii <p> A deeply unappealing account by Dr Oddie of his new denomination . No wonder there are so few rushing to join it . <p> PhilipH <p> Alec -- if that 's what they thought about Anglo-Catholics , they must 've been reading the liberal secular press and proponents of women priests too much . Likewise it was claimed by the same sources that Anglo-Catholics would meet a hostile reception from many Catholic parishes if they did convert . Yet those of us who did convert as individuals were warmly welcomed . In my local deanery there are many ex-Anglicans , I do n't believe we are a hotbed of trouble . <p> Catholicgadfly <p> Unfortunately many of our English Catholic Bishops are a bunch of liberal wasters with no back bone to with hold church teaching any more ! I apologise for the guttural language , but it needs to be said and many will agree with me . Fortunately , they seem to be losing a few battles now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end ' for them . I believe that the new Nuncio will only advise Rome on Bishop 's that will be sympathetic to Benedict 's evangelising &amp; orthodox agenda . <p> I will explain that I am a Catholic who wholeheartedly supports the Ordinariate . It is an absolute disgrace that the Bishops of England &amp; Wales are only ' stumping up ' ? 250,000 . They should have offered substantially more . Let me assure you they can afford it . <p> For good people like Cor de Lion . Try not to worry too much about William 's article -- there are now people at the top of the church who are now challenging our liberal bishops and lobbying Rome for only non-liberal candidates to be appointed in the future ! Indeed this article highlights another defeat for these liberals . <p> Alec was right in saying that the Bishop 's of England &amp; Wales did not want the Ordinariate because they were scared of more traditionalists . The good news is that they 'd better get used to it ! <p> RJ <p> Well , in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even in the Catholic Church . An idealised picture of the Church on earth is not helpful . <p> We believe the Christ founded it and promised to remain with it but a quick look at the letters of Saint Paul and the history of the Church would show that sin within the Church , and human limitations , are part of the reality as well . It is said that even some saints have found it difficult to live side by side . <p> NG <p> Dear Cor de Lion , I suggest you make yourself known to one of the Anglican bishops who are spearheading the England &amp; Wales Ordinariate . You can rely on their complete discretion , and the fact that family and health reasons are currently an impediment will be sympathetically understood . At the same time you will be kept abreast of developments in the New Year , and helped to see how a way forward may open up for you . <p> NG <p> Dear RT , there are two routes open for individual clergy at present . ( 1 ) Approach a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discernment in the usual way . ( 2 ) Join up with one of the emerging groups ( some of which may be quite geographically scattered , and most of which will not be from a single parish ) and follow along the path being developed in forming the Ordinariate . <p> Kyriakos <p> You are wrong Sigfridii , the Catholic Church does not excist in England or Europe only.And situations are not like this elsewhere . <p> W Oddie <p> I have been a Catholic for nearly 20 years ; it is hardly for me a new " denomination " ( actually , it 's not a denomination at all , simply " The Church " ) . And my article was n't an " account " of the Church : simply of the behaviour of some of the people in it who are , like all of us , sinners in their own way . I can assure Sigfridii that life in the Catholic Church is not merely " appealing " ; it is a joy which never fades . I was a member of the Anglican Church @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : I could tell stories of that experience , including stories of Anglican bishops , which far exceed anything I could say about the Catholic Conference of Bishops . As for " so few rushing to join it " . it is , world-wide , the fastest growing Christian Church . <p> Sigfridii <p> So , how many of these Anglicans ( the subject of your article ) are rushing to join it ? <p> By all accounts , it is many thousands short of an Exodus . And little wonder , the way your denomination treats them . <p> Kevin <p> Cor de Lion <p> I came in 25 years ago -- not because of the E&amp;W bishops , but in spite of them . Since then , on the whole , it has been my experience that they betray the Faith . I met Cardinal Hume and spent an hour with him once , trying to show him the error of his ways on another matter with which he was at loggerheads with the Holy See . Waste of time . With deeply flawed men like this in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but we are assured of the Indefectibility of the Catholic Church by Christ Himself -- despite all the problems and all the treachery , He is with us always . This book explains it well : - http : **55;347;TOOLONG <p> David <p> I welcome the Ordinariate but can not think that it will be home for a large number of people.Speaking as a former Anglican ( converted 1992 ) I know that most of the genuinely ' catholic ' anglicans have already left the CofE . There is just a remnant left behind . <p> I suspect we will hear lots of excuses based on family/finance/age over the coming weeks . <p> Little Black Censored <p> Saying that most of the genuine catholics have already left presupposes a static situation , but the C of E is getting worse and worse , which will encourage more and more Anglicans to accept the Pope 's offer of rescue .

In fact I sometimes came to your breakfasts at Pusey House , where you celebrated an Anglican Mass which looked very much like the Novus Ordo . From you , and your brand of Anglo-Catholicism , the English Catholics had nothing to fear . But across the road , in St. Mary Magdalen , Mass was celebrated in a form which can only be described as the Tridentine Rite translated into English . For the post Vatican II generation of English Bishops , this is very frightening ; they still hope that the Extraordinary Form will wither away because it is in Latin . But if the Extraordinary Form , with all its theological symbolism , came into church in a language " understanded of the people " , it could create a liturgical and cultural movement which would sideline the ghastly Ordinary Frorm as we now have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ English Catholic Bishops are a bunch of liberal wasters with no back bone to with hold church teaching any more !

Let 's hope that the Ordinariate will develop into a Sui Iuris Church , and that everyone will be permitted to change sides . <p> Michael <p> Lucan , the classic Tridentine Low Mass is said silently , and for man in a pew there would n't be different if in vernacular . Those parts which are sung in a High Mass , are supposed to be sung in Latin in the Novus Ordo too , but the rule is ignored . If translated , the chant would have to be adopted to vernacular and the Tridentine Mass would turn into a disco concert . The only thing that should be translated are the readings , but that would not be a novelty -- in many areas this was a practice prior to Vatican II . <p> Arthur <p> I am glad you ask this question . There must be many in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ priest who has being living as a layman since 1998 . Whilst I greatly valued the ministry to me and my flock of our PEV , I could no longer live with the contradiction of owing my canonical obedience to a heresiarch . Logically I should have converted , as an individual to the Roman Obedience . But there were a collection of personal circumstances which held me back . For a year or two I even lapsed from the faith . Now I belong to an Anglican congregation . I belong , but I do not really belong , as they see their way forward within the Society of St. Wilfred and St. Hilda . I live in the diocese of Chichester -- the very heart of the Society . There are virtually no groups seeking membership of the Ordinariate . I am in my late 60 's and my wife is in her early 60 's and is severely disabled with Secondary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis . We have little hope of attaching ourselves to a group seeking the Ordinariate , but that is where I feel I belong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Catholic Parish , but that is not really where I feel I belong . I really am in the wilderness . <p> PopishCrank <p> I 'm even more concerned that the bishops of the English speaking Catholic Church have n't spoken out and refued to accept the Roman Missal ( 3rd ) edition . To be foisted upon us this coming Advent . What a pity they did n't display the courage and the backbone to send it back to Rome as the Germans did with their vernacular missal . <p> Neville DeVilliers <p> How right you are Alec . Cardinal Hume had every reason to fear the English Church would suddenly become a sanctuary filled with whining , disenchanted former members of the CofE ( as there are in the U.S.A. and elsewhere ) . Taking with them their laundry list of complaints and demands . As some of the Anglican clergy do now when they convert to the Roman Church in the U.S.A. <p> Cardinal Hume was n't going to be bullied by Cardinal Ratzinger , or by John Paul II . God bless him . RIP . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and thoroughly revolting , especially as they are being aired now . As I feared , the Ordinariate is turning out to be more a fount of disunity and a well spring for in-fighting than a bridge for non-practicing Catholics and most Anglicans for crossing to Rome . <p> Neville DeVilliers <p> After two days in existence , " the fastest growing Christian Church " ? The rhetoric and promises are the only things that can be measured at this juncture . <p> Neville DeVilliers <p> If the Extraordinary Form were to be translated into " a language ' understanded of the people ' " ( a wonderful thought actually ) there would be such a sudden rush of Latin-rite Catholics to the Anglican Use parishes , entire novus ordo dominated parishes would be depopulated overnight . Which explains why English speaking hierarchs are dragging their feet , and in no great rush to embrace the Ordinariate , particularly in the U.S.A. I can just read the articles and letters to the editor in the " National Catholic Reporter " . LOL LOL LOL <p> Neville DeVilliers <p> Kyriakos , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the highly advertised whiners from the Anglo Catholic wing . The Episcopal Church and other break-away Anglican bodies are not rushing to the gates to embrace it . In time perhaps , but we 'll just have to wait and see . <p> Neville DeVilliers <p> and the biggest excuse of all : " I do n't accept the primacy of the bishop of Rome , nor do I accept transubstantiation , the eucharist as a sacrifice , or the rejection of women for the priesthood " . As painful as this may be for Rome and the admirers of the Ordinariate , the overwhelming majority of Anglicans throughout the world still see themselves as " Protestants " . I do n't see this changing anytime soon . <p> Adrian <p> What were the English bishops afraid of ? That 's easy : English people .

There were some more sophisticated Indian eateries around but the majority did indeed have flocked wallpaper and rather odd luminous pictures on the wall . And the food was basic . <p> Today the image has much changed - both in terms of decor and the food . And that 's not just in the big cities . <p> In Shropshire we are spoiled for choice for good quality Indian dining . In Ludlow there is Golden Moments , Bilash in Much Wenlock and Caf ? Saffron in Shrewsbury , among several others . <p> And in Wellington there is the Dhaka . I ate there about six years ago and was much impressed .

And with few people to attend to , service can be overpowering . Not here , it is attentive but not in your face with waiters hovering so close they can hear the quietest word . <p> Dhaka 's aim is to provide a stylish , modern and comfortable dining environment where high quality Eastern , Indian and Bangladeshi cuisine , made the traditional way , is served . Classical Indian tradition is used and the restaurant only uses natural ingredients incorporating fresh herbs and spices making the food free from all the artificial additives , preservatives and food colouring . Dhaka Restaurant also uses healthy and low fat ingredients where possible . <p> Quite a promise to make but if the meal we had is anything to go by one that is fully honoured . <p> I dined with two eating companions who certainly know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they bowled over . <p> Poppadums and dips were ordered as we tried to decide what to eat .

They were difficult choices . But eventually we decided and we had a little taste of all our dishes ! <p> Starter one and two were a mixed kebab - a mountain ( albeit it very pretty ) of sheek kebab , onion bhajee and chicken tikka served with a fresh salad ( ? 5.95 ) . <p> Starter three was King Prawn Garlic - large king prawns marinated in ginger , extra garlic and mint and a touch of spice ( ? 6.50 ) . <p> Presentation and content were such that the two ' experts ' said little as they savoured the tastes . <p> Main one was a Dhaka Special Cocktail - a platter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ salad . ( ? 11.95 ) . <p> Pricey you may think ? Certainly not for the amount and the standard . Now this was eaten by an ' expert ' who I do believe has hollow legs which rarely get filled up - but he was finally defeated and was forced to leave a little . <p> Main two was a Dhaka Special Biryani - special basmati rice full of prawns and chicken in butter ghee with delicate herbs and spices ( ? 9.95 ) . This was for the second ' expert ' who was also a little overwhelmed - pleasantly by the fragrance of the dish and astonished at the quantity . <p> I had a chicken chilli mossalla - cooked in capiscum and tomatoes with rich spices ( ? 8.95 ) .

The octogenarian director sees no need to reinvent the wheel , and this comedy of courtship and duplicity in 18th-century Bath is allowed to stand on its own merits . <p> Just the sight of Simon Higlett 's elegant design , based on the curve of Bath 's Royal Crescent , makes you smile -- as do almost all the performances in a production that began in that most beautiful of English cities in September , and has now arrived in the West End . <p> The chief attraction , apart from the generous spirit of the play itself -- partly inspired by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ performances of Penelope Keith as that " Queen of the dictionary " Mrs Malaprop , and Peter Bowles as Sir Anthony Absolute , a man who rumbles and thunders with rage whenever his iron will is crossed . <p> Appearing together on stage for the first time , the much-loved sparring partners from the television sitcom To the Manor Born are both on tremendous form . <h> Related Articles <p> Penelope Keith delivers Mrs Malaprop 's often inspired mangling of the English language -- " He is the very pineapple of politeness " -- with the assurance of one who prides herself on her verbal eloquence , and there is a mixture of hauteur , roguishness and vulnerability in her performance that is truly endearing .

@@1726240 <h> I 'm no supporter of this war , but I despair at the BBC 's denigration of our troops <p> On Monday evening , BBC1 broadcast a shocking hour-long drama called Accused by the writer Jimmy McGovern . <p> It depicted the British Army in Afghanistan as a brutish , corrupt and dysfunctional institution . <p> The programme has provoked more than 200 complaints from the public . It has also attracted the wrath of various senior military figures , including the former Chief of Staff , General Lord Dannatt , who is so outraged that he has called into question the BBC 's role as a public service broadcaster . <p> Last week the head of the Army , Sir Peter Wall , begged to no avail that the film be dropped . <p> Lord Dannatt says the programme suggests that the Army in Afghanistan is rife with bullying , that alcohol is consumed by soldiers fighting on the front-line , that there is no chain of command to enforce justice , and that cover-ups are normal . <h> RELATED ARTICLES <h> Share this article <p> For those who did not see Accused , let me summarise the story . It concerns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Army after a brush with the law . <p> They are spared a custodial sentence so that they can fight in Afghanistan , only one of many implausible plot twists . <p> Peter , though naturally brave , is too frightened to fight . He is picked on by a psychotic corporal , who describes him as a ' faggot ' and calls him a ' bitch ' , throws buckets of excrement at him , and makes his life so miserable that the poor man is finally driven to killing himself . Frankie is reluctantly drawn into the bullying of his friend . <p> Corporal Buckley effortlessly convinces the authorities that Peter was killed in battle , and his body is returned to Britain along with the myth that he died as a hero . <p> Eventually a distraught Frankie ' grasses ' on the mad Corporal , only to find his complaints are unheeded . He decides to kill him , and the drama ends with his being sent down for 25 years . <p> There is no mercy in this Army . No officer ever appears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ psychotic corporal , and a crooked sergeant is complicit . <p> There is not a single redeeming feature to Army life . Peter 's father , a former soldier , remembers the Army as a brutal and lawless organisation . That is how it is . <p> Unflinching : Ben Batt , Mackenzie Crook and Benjamin Smith played British troops in Afghanistan in Accused <p> Let me say that my greatest criticisms are not directed at Jimmy McGovern . He is an able Left-wing playwright , naturally much overpraised in fashionable circles , who has a political agenda . <p> He evidently dislikes the Army and abhors our involvement in Afghanistan . On the latter point I happen to agree with him . <p> Acclaimed : Accused writer Jimmy McGovern <p> My quarrel is not so much with him as with the BBC for broadcasting a drama representing fictional soldiers in the most heinous light at the very time that real soldiers are risking their lives in Afghanistan -- and when , according to the commander in Helmand province yesterday , they should be bracing themselves for more carnage . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to stand up to injustice , with the exception of Frankie . Afghans are treated as sub-humans . <p> I do not doubt , of course , that bullying goes on in the Army , possibly on a widespread scale . For example , the deaths of four soldiers at Deepcut Barracks suggest there is a problem . <p> But Mr McGovern 's account of a uniformly nasty Army , in which there is not a single decent person in authority , is extreme to the point of lunacy . <p> And the timing is deeply cruel . If I had a son , brother , husband , father or any other relative fighting in Afghanistan , I think I might weep over this film . <p> If I were fighting there , I might despair , so great is the travesty of the truth that Accused presents . <p> However futile and misguided the cause -- as I happen to believe it is -- our servicemen in Afghanistan are risking their lives for their country . <p> It seems to me , from what I have seen of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one another . <p> Exposure to danger brings out selfless and honourable qualities , which are absent in this bleak and cynical drama . <p> Should we care ? It is , after all , only fiction . But stories are powerful instruments on the human mind , which is no doubt why Mr McGovern writes them . <p> Accused offers an account of what is going on in Afghanistan and , for all its intermittent plot absurdities , it asks to be taken seriously as the truth . <p> Interviewed on the Today programme yesterday morning , Jana Bennett , director of BBC Vision , took refuge in the silly defence that it was only ' fiction ' . <p> How Mr McGovern must have chuckled . Her argument might conceivably have been justified were she talking about a film set at some distant or imaginary time . <p> But Mr McGovern chose deliberately to stage his drama now , in Afghanistan , where real British soldiers are risking their lives , because he is a political writer making a political point . <p> If it were only make-believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been no need at the end of the programme for the BBC to advertise its Helpline for people who were upset by the issues raised by the drama . <p> It was potentially disturbing precisely because it purported to be rooted in reality . <p> Which explains why , after the programme had finished , some people Tweeted their shock or surprise that the Army in Afghanistan could be behaving in this way . <p> They may be naive and credulous , but so are those who write letters to characters in The Archers . Even bad art seeks to convince the most sophisticated that it is true . <p> I do n't believe Ms Bennett is a wicked woman . <p> ' Fiction ' : BBC Vision director Jana Bennett defended Accused <p> She is a characteristic specimen of the cosseted , woolly-thinking , metropolitan types running the BBC who have no notion of what it is to risk one 's life as a soldier , and no understanding and little concern for those who are doing so . <p> It appears not to have occurred to her that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distressed by the drama -- or , if it did , she does n't care . <p> But the sheer , callous irresponsibility of the BBC does take one 's breath away . And also its double standards . <p> It is fashionable in Leftist or liberal circles to oppose the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan , and so any drama that depicts those conflicts in a discreditable light can find itself on television even while our troops are still risking their lives <h> Poll <p> What did you think of the BBC drama Accused ? <p> Grossly insensitive <p> Justifiable drama <p> What did you think of the BBC drama Accused ? <p> Grossly insensitive7809 votes <p> Justifiable drama5007 votes <p> Now share your opinion <p> By contrast , when the ? supposedly Right-wing playwright Ian Curteis wrote a play about the Falklands War , which ? portrayed the then Prime Minister , Margaret Thatcher , in a favourable light , the BBC refused to broadcast it for 20 years even though it had commissioned it . <p> We can be certain there would n't be any rush to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Afghanistan if someone were bold or imaginative enough to write one . <p> By the way , Accused was the second of a six-part series by Mr McGovern put out by the BBC , though thankfully the only one about the Army . <p> For all its faults , the BBC is a great national institution . <p> Shame on it for providing a platform for the undermining of another great national institution , for colluding in a lie about it , and for depicting our soldiers as beasts or weaklings when they deserve our support and respect .

It was published in the peer-reviewed medical journal Autism Research . <p> The research was covered accurately by The Daily Telegraph , although further validation is required before this method could be used as a clinical test . The Daily Mail reported that a brain scan has been developed that could " diagnose autism in children in just ten minutes " , allowing the condition to be detected at a much younger stage so children could begin therapy and treatment before they start school .

This contains the connecting fibres of brain cells and shows up as white on MRI images . The researchers said that they were particularly interested in two areas of the brain , called the superior temporal gyrus ( STG ) and temporal stem ( TS ) . These contain the white matter fibres critically involved in language and social cognition .

Sixty-three per cent of individuals with these conditions were taking one or more psychotropic medications , such as antidepressants or stimulants . <p> To focus on the white matter microstructure , the researchers used an MRI technique called diffusion tensor imaging ( DTI ) , which measures the direction of local water diffusion in brain tissue ( water diffuses more rapidly in the direction of the brain cell fibres ) . They made various measurements of the diffusion properties of water in these areas in order to tease out structural differences between the individuals . <h> What were the basic results ? <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the diffusion of water in the STG areas found on both sides of the brain , and in the TS on the right-hand side only , compared with typically-developing individuals .

Overall , they found that the test was 83.3% reliable . <p> The researchers found that the volume of the white matter area did not aid classification . <h> How did the researchers interpret the results ? <p> The researchers say that analysing the properties of the white matter microstructure in the STG and TS has a high ability to separate individuals with autism from typically-developing individuals , and that this provides evidence that the STG and TS are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extension of their study to larger sample sizes and to individuals with higher severity of autism , younger children and females is now necessary . <h> Conclusion <p> This preliminary research in a small group of 30 individuals with high-functioning autism shows that there may be subtle differences in the microstructure of white matter in two brain areas in individuals with high-functioning autism compared with typically-developing individuals . However , follow-up in a much larger group is needed to see how well these differences actually predict whether a person has autism or not . The researchers acknowledged some limitations of this work : <p> The study only looked at individuals with high-functioning autism , only one type of developmental disorder , and further research is needed to see whether the differences they saw are specific to high-functioning autism or whether individuals with other developmental disorders may also have these subtle differences in brain structure . <p> The study only looked at right-handed males aged seven years and above . Further studies need to assess whether the findings apply to infants and young children and women , and also to individuals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ researchers say that , alongside larger follow-up studies , longitudinal studies are also needed to see how these brain areas may change with time . <p> Presently , looking at water diffusion using MRI can provide some information about brain microstructure , but the resolution is still relatively low . There may be a variety of brain cell types within an area that can not be anatomically distinguished by this technique as yet . <p> Some of the autistic groups were taking medications for psychiatric conditions , and it is not clear whether psychotropic medication could affect white matter microstructure , so this needs to be tested . <p> This study also indicates that two brain areas called the superior temporal gyrus and temporal stem may be associated with autism , but the nature of this association requires further research . The imaging technique used in this study suggests that there may be subtle differences in the microstructure of cells in the white matter , but further work is also needed to determine any fine anatomical differences in autism . <p> All in all , this research forms a well-conducted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distinguish between a specific group of autistic individuals and typically-developing individuals .

@@1738233 <h> Farce majeure <p> Emily Pithon in Alan Ayckbourn 's ' Taking Steps ' at the Orange Tree earlier this year <p> " In some respects it 's like all playwriting taken to its apotheosis , " says the renowned director Richard Eyre of the drama he is working on . " It 's all the technical aspects of playwriting absolutely pushed to the limit . It 's so dazzlingly skilful . " <p> To what , then , does he refer ? Oedipus Rex ? Hamlet ? Waiting for Godot ? No , the play in question is A Flea in Her Ear , the 1907 Feydeau farce . Eyre is directing a new production for London 's Old Vic , a task that has renewed his admiration for the genre . He is not alone in taking it seriously . The theatre practitioner , Edward Gordon Craig , wrote that " Farce is the essential theatre . " <p> At its best , farce can be sublime , the mix of intricate plotting and sheer silliness combining to blissful comic effect . It 's not an easy genre to define , however . The playwright Michael Frayn , who wrote the dazzling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who does attempt a definition of farce falls on his face " . The essential ingredients tend to be slapstick , mistaken identity and , above all , a relentless , intricate plot in which confusions rapidly accumulate . Where comedy might prioritise character , in farce plot is king -- the wilder the better , as the writer pursues remorseless logic to land his characters in ridiculous situations . <p> Shakespeare was not above using farcical tactics -- concealing Falstaff in a laundry basket in The Merry Wives of Windsor , for example . Ben Travers ' Aldwych farces ( 1925-1933 ) , followed by the Whitehall farces directed by Brian Rix between 1950 and 1969 , made the genre a cornerstone of British theatre for many years . But the difficulty of executing it well and a lingering suspicion that it offers pretty lowbrow entertainment combine to make pure farce a relatively rare visitor to the English stage these days . So what makes good farce work and why it is so hard to pull off ? <p> I head to the Old Vic , where the entrance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get a chaise longue up the narrow backstage stairs . When I do arrive in the rehearsal room , which boasts a striking number of fake doors ( 247 entrances and exits ) , Eyre explains why A Flea in her Ear is a perfect French farce . <p> " If you wanted an example to show to a Martian , then this is the purest , " he says . " It 's got the classic ingredients of sexual insecurity , lubriciousness and panic , and the elements are so perfectly bound together . " <p> The plot is triggered when a woman suspects her husband of being unfaithful ( he is n't ) and sets a trap to catch him at it . The plan backfires , embroiling all the characters in the fall-out . Eyre describes it as being " like a stick of toffee : it just accumulates and with every incident that passes the chaos gets thicker and thicker . " <p> Such structural ingenuity is one of the delights of farce . The downside , though , is that event-driven comedy can seem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something needs to be at stake for the characters . Eyre suggests that one reason Feydeau is admired is that he began with characters then worked " like a chemist " creating compounds . He adds that the problems in Flea are very real to the characters : <p> " The whole of the chaos is initiated by erectile dysfunction . There is a guy who is very uxorious , dedicated to his wife , who is unable to get an erection . His wife thinks he must be having an affair . If they had found a way of talking about it , none of the play would have occurred . But because they 're the people they are , they do n't . " <p> This dilemma could result in tragedy but because of the tone , speed and remorseless logic , becomes ridiculous . The plot moves so fast that there is never any time to clear up misunderstandings , so they multiply . " It 's breathless , " says Eyre . " If you pause for reflection , the flywheel stops turning . And the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Griffiths in Michael Frayn 's ' Noises Off ' , Comedy Theatre , 2002 <p> That velocity poses a challenge to the director and the cast . Stage directions are exact ; timing has to be precise . Actors have little time to establish character but have to keep the energy up and the story moving . Oliver Cotton , one of Eyre 's cast , reveals that " the hardest thing is that you 're taking such responsibility for the narrative " and compares the complex structure to " a Bach fugue " . <p> Eyre comes up with a slightly different musical analogy . " I 've just revived a production of Carmen at the Met , " he says . " With an opera , you ca n't argue about the score . You can argue about interpretation but you ca n't say , ' I 'm going to take a pause here . ' It 's the same here . You 've got to work out how the kit works -- otherwise you 're not actually doing the play . " <p> A little later , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sequence in which one character has to break wind loudly , while the others retreat in dismay . There is much debate about the correct length of the eruption and the precise timing of the reaction . " Do we step back on the noise or do we wait for the noise to finish ? " asks one actor . Not quite the same as Carmen at the Met , then , but you can see Eyre 's point . <p> Over at the Orange Tree , in Richmond , a similarly absurd scene is unfolding . Here one actor cowers beneath a table while the rest of the cast conduct an earnest discussion about where best to conceal a dead dog . The canine corpse is a crucial prop in Once Bitten , the early French farce the theatre is mounting for Christmas . Because the theatre is " in-the-round " , the job of hiding characters -- or dogs -- becomes even more challenging . <p> " What I love about farce is that it 's like a mathematical sum , " says Sam Walters , the theatre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and you get it right . Or it does n't . " <p> Walters emphasises that the cast have to take their characters ' dilemmas seriously . " The fear is that the actors think , ' Oh I 'm in a funny play so I 'll do funny acting . ' But it 's deadly serious to the characters . If someone has taken his trousers off , it 's because he had no alternative . " <p> " If there 's a threat in farce , it must be serious , " agrees the playwright Alan Ayckbourn . " Danger runs alongside farce . " Although Ayckbourn , one of theatre 's most popular playwrights , is often referred to as a farceur , he says he has only written one " true " farce : Taking Steps ( recently gloriously revived at the Orange Tree ) . <p> " A true farce takes you on a journey , " Ayckbourn says . " It 's very akin to thriller writing , where you distract , and convince the audience something is possible . It 's a conjuring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be " agony " , as it demands tight logic leading to absurd situations . " It 's often dismissed , but it requires a lot of skill . I think pure farce is really hard . You need a slightly strange brain to do it . And there 's no such thing as an interesting farce . It 's either funny , or it is n't . " <p> Michael Frayn concurs . Composing Noises Off , he recalls , was " hellish " : " I thought when I was writing it that I 'd stepped off the edge of a cliff . I really did find it mind-bendingly difficult . I tried with an earlier farce , Donkey 's Years , having little figures on a model stage . But the situation changes much faster than you can move the figures . The only way you can really do it is to hold it all in your head . " <p> He added to his headaches in Noises Off by creating a farce-within-a-farce . In this comedy , a fictitious theatre company performing a bad farce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a brilliant , risky conceit , using a good farce to spoof a bad one . <p> " In most farces there is an element of panic , " says Frayn . " People get into a situation where they 're afraid of being disgraced , they then tell a lie to prevent the disgrace and the lie , far from helping them out , increases their difficulties . " <p> The frenzy and deception can be used to caustic satirical effect -- as in the political farces by the Italian playwright Dario Fo or the darkly sardonic comedies of Joe Orton . But even without that satirical edge , it can be cathartic . Frayn suggests that a good farce speaks to that subconscious fear that gives people nightmares about turning up at work naked . <p> " We 've all got fears inside us that we 're going to make fools of ourselves , not be able to carry on with the show . And to see it happening to somebody else is a release of one 's own fear ... When I started writing farce , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , why do n't you write about life as it really is ? ' I could n't understand their question . Did they really not have farce in their lives ? Everyone loses control over their environment sometimes and circumstances escalate . You lock yourself out of the house , so you have to climb in through the window and somebody thinks you 're a burglar . " <p> And for the audience , there is perhaps the ultimate frisson that everyone on stage is not only portraying chaos , but risking it . " There 's a story about an old actor who is dying , " says Frayn . " And he sighs , ' It 's hard , dying , it 's hard ... But not as hard as farce . ' "

@@1742230 <h> You are here : <h> The origins of A Bug 's Life <h> Did Pixar really take influence from the all-time classic Seven Samurai when making A Bug 's Life , we wonder ? <p> If you 're looking for inspiration for an animated film , then it 's generally all around you . Disney has mined fairy stories , DreamWorks has been hunting down books too , then there are television series , popular characters and original ideas . Basically , given the glut of animated movies coming out every year , the big companies are looking far and wide for inspiration . <p> But how many have looked to Akira Kurosawa 's classic movie , Seven Samurai ? <p> The answer , predictably , is one . And the identity of that one ? That 'd be Pixar . <p> For its second feature , A Bug 's Life , which we 've been celebrating this week , Pixar appeared to take Kurosawa 's 1954 classic as inspiration . Certainly , whether the similarities are intentional or coincidental , there 's a lot of crossover between the two movies , even though , in terms of treatment , they could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 've not seen it , is the story of a village that hires - yes ! - seven samurai to protect the harvest from people looking to steal it . Effectively , the farmers of the village hire in outside help to offer some defence to those who come and steal their livelihoods . It 's a stunning film , and , it should be noted , a much longer one than A Bug 's Life . <p> It perhaps goes without saying , though , that if you 've never had the chance to catch it , you really should try to . It regularly appears on lists of the best films of all time . Rightly so , too . <p> So , where does this cross over with Pixar 's second movie ? Well , firstly , we should be clear , here : A Bug 's Life is n't an official remake of Seven Samurai , but it is a film that effectively tells the same story . Only in the case of A Bug 's Life , Pixar put together a team of bugs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the firm also , as you 'd expect , put more than enough of its own twist upon matters to give it an identity very firmly of its own . <p> To the best of my knowledge , Pixar has never gone on record to talk about the Seven Samurai link . Instead , it cites a different inspiration as sparking the germ of the idea for the film . On its official website , Pixar offers Aesop 's Fables as the starting point for A Bug 's Life , instead . <p> The firm says that the idea itself came from a chat between co-director Andrew Stanton , and storyboard artist Joe Ranft . The pair were chatting about the fable The Ant And The Grasshopper , so goes the story , and developed A Bug 's Life from that point on . However , Pixar twisted the classic fable , so that the grasshopper who begs for food in the Aesop story decides to just take it in the A Bug 's Life movie . The rest of the narrative was spun out from there . <p> Yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems the most potent influence . You have , after all , the anthill under threat from grasshoppers , who wreak their damage and fly off again ( although Seven Samurai did n't have Kevin Spacey on brilliant voicing duties , of course ) . <p> Off , then , goes one of the bugs to call upon a group of people who can protect said anthill , shoring up the defences of a village that previously had none . If you follow the path through , as to who eventually saves the day in both A Bug 's Life and Seven Samurai , there are parallels there , too . In short , it 's not too much of a stretch to suggest that A Bug 's Life is an homage of sorts . <p> The films would certainly make a fascinating , and unusual , double bill , but perhaps , therefore , an appropriate one .

At the very least , you 'll be giving fresh light to Pixar 's most underappreciated movie .

The hub of the whole scientific enterprise is biochemistry -- the largest single subject , in terms of the number of journals , of references to other papers , and of the extent to which other disciplines , from cancer biology to earth science , refer to it .

The United States -- the world capital of science -- puts so much effort into biology and medical research that engineering and physics pale by comparison ( although vast sums of money are spent on each ) .

Even so , it was mentioned by experts on global warming , on squid ecology and on the biology of ageing , which means that I can console myself that I do better in reaching out to the world than do all those sociologists .

For further information please read our Cookie Policy . <h> Supreme Court rules on doctrine of lis pendens and registration of documents <h> Newsletters <p> In Har Narain v Mam Chand , ( 1 ) the Supreme Court discussed and reviewed the law relating to the doctrine of lis pendens with regard to Section 47(2) of the 1908 Registration Act . The doctrine of lis pendens provides that no fixed property can be transferred while an action relating to it is pending before a court of law. ( 3 ) Under Section 47 , a registered sale deed of a fixed property , on registration , is deemed to operate from the date of execution . The court clarified that the legal fiction created by virtue of Section 47 does not circumvent the operation of lis pendens . In effect , the court held that if a sale deed was not registered at the time the civil suit commenced and is registered subsequently , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of lis pendens . <p> Facts <p> The first respondent , owner of certain land , mortgaged the property in favour of its predecessor in interest of the appellant , which had been in possession of the land since 1970 . The respondent and the appellant had also entered into an agreement to sell the property . Subsequently , the respondent executed a sale deed purporting to transfer the property to a third party on August 2 1971 . The sale deed was registered on September 3 1971 . <p> In the period between execution of the sale deed and its registration on August 10 1971 , the appellant filed suit against the respondent seeking specific performance of the agreement to sell . The suit was resisted by the respondent on the grounds that the sale deed ( dated August 2 ) related back to the date of execution under Section 47 , and accordingly the property was classed as sold prior to initiation of the lawsuit . The appellant argued that since registration took place after filing of the suit , the sale was affected by lis pendens . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the view that the doctrine of lis pendens did not apply to the facts of this case . The lower courts had proceeded on the presumption that although the documents had been registered after the suit was filed , they related back to the date of execution . Therefore , the sale of the property was deemed to have been effected on the date of the execution of the sale deed itself . <p> Decision <p> The appellant appealed to the Supreme Court , which upheld the appeal . It held that : <p> " in spite of the fact that the registration would relate back to the date of execution , the sale can not be termed as complete until its registration and it becomes effective only once it stands registered . Thus , the fiction created by Section 47 does not come into play before the actual registration of the document . " <p> The Supreme Court observed that a similar issue , though involving a right of pre-emption , was considered by the Constitution Bench in Ram Saran Lall v Mst Domini Kuer , ( 4 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spite of the fact that the Act , 1908 , could relate back to the date of execution in view of provisions of Section 47 of the Registration Act , 1908 , the sale could not be given effect to prior to registration and thus the sale was not complete until the registration of instrument of sale . " <p> The court in Ram Saran also clarified that Section 47 of the Registration Act does not specify when a sale is deemed to be complete . It observed that : <p> " a sale which is admittedly not completed until the registration of the instrument of sale is completed , can not be said to have been completed earlier because by virtue of Section 47 the instrument by which it is effected , after it has been registered , commences to operate from an earlier date . " ( 5 ) <p> The Supreme Court took the view that the lower courts failed to appreciate that the fiction created by Section 47 of the act itself is a consequence of registration of the document . Accordingly , it was held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case , as the registration of the sale deed occurred after the suit was filed . <p> Comment <p> The Supreme Court has clarified its position with regard to the operation of Section 47 of the Registration Act . It appears that , in its reasoning , the court has equated the words " shall operate from " to " be effective from " . On that reading , the position taken by the Supreme Court is not in tune with the literal meaning of the words used in Section 47 . This is one of the many instances in which the courts have chosen to eschew a literal meaning in favour of a purposive one in order to serve the ends of justice . <p> " Time from which registered document operates : A registered document shall operate from the time which it would have commenced to operate if no registration thereof had been required or made , and not from the time of its registration .

I recently had the chance to try it -- in my case it was the Lamborghini Thrill , in a Gallardo , to be precise -- and can vouch for the fact that it is enormous fun . <p> The session starts with a briefing on the basics of track driving given by a professional racing instructor . On the day I was there , this was delivered by Silverstone 's Mike Swinnerton . The presentation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off by explaining how to identify the " racing line " , in other words , learning how to use the entire width of the track in order to find the straightest , and therefore quickest , route through a corner . He then broke down the cornering process into its main constituent parts . <p> The first of these involves the approach , starting with the braking point ; during this phase , braking and changing down through the gears should , in the interests of stability , as far as possible be undertaken in a straight line . At the turn-in point , the car should be travelling slowly enough to allow the car to be turned safely towards the clipping point , or apex , on the inside of the corner on a balanced throttle . Mike also stressed the importance of accelerating smoothly and progressively as the car is straightened up when exiting from the corner . <p> He finished off by explaining the difference between understeer , the tendency , under certain circumstances , of a car to run wide at the front , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to avoid them or deal with them .

Helmet on , I headed out onto the circuit with another Silverstone instructor , Chas , who , from the very beginning , encouraged me to drive quickly rather than hang back . <p> The Gallardo is ideal for this sort of thing . It 's much quicker than the cars most of us drive on the road , and has exotic touches such as a metal gear-change gate and a V10 engine that sounds simply glorious , but it also has all-wheel drive and feels very well balanced .

And as you slowly improve your technique , you will probably come away with a bit more respect for the top racing drivers who drive far more powerful cars much more quickly under far more exacting conditions for lap after lap without making any mistakes . <p> All too quickly it was over -- I would gladly have lapped the Gallardo all day , given the chance -- but at least I have a nice certificate hanging on my wall confirming that I have successfully completed Silverstone 's Lamborghini Thrill in order to remind me of the experience .

Things looked bleak just a few years ago when Silverstone lost the right to host the British Grand Prix to rival circuit Donington but when Donington could n't deliver , Silverstone secured a new seventeen-year contract to put on the race . This triggered heavy investment in new facilities , including a huge , visually imposing new pit and paddock complex that is already taking shape in advance of the planned completion date in May next year . <p> Find out more about the Lamborghini Thrill and other Silverstone driving experiences at www.silverstone.co.uk , or call 0844 3728 270

In 1978-9 , when Australia 's leading cricketers were playing for World Series , the waifs and strays who remained thought the best way to bat out for a draw was to slog Geoff Miller , now England 's chairman of selectors , into the Fremantle Doctor and the Indian Ocean . <p> Overall , the WACA has brought out the worst in England 's batsmen and bowlers . In their last five Tests there , back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so much by actual bouncers fended to short-leg , but by length balls which have bounced and been edged , nicked and sliced through to the slips and keeper . Wisely did Alec Stewart , the former England captain who grew up in Perth grade cricket , remark that strokes at the WACA had to be vertical or horizontal , not in between - but they usually have been . <p> Since 1990-1 England have not been able to make a total of 300 , except once : and that was when they had been set 557 to win , after being shredded by Adam Gilchrist 's century , the second fastest recorded in Tests . Half of their last 10 totals at the WACA have been below 200 - and you can not blame Shane Warne this time . He took only 10 England wickets there , all told . <p> Of course , this England team is a vast improvement on their predecessors , bushy-tailed and dedicated to the pursuit of excellence . But , under stress , old habits re-surface ; and even though England were in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the first innings of their opening game at Perth , there were more than enough signs to temper confidence , never mind euphoria . <p> Strauss himself tried to cut and was caught behind ; Paul Collingwood did not get on top of a cut either and was caught at gully ; Jonathan Trott was out cutting too , albeit against the spinner Michael Beer , who has been promoted to the Test party on the strength of being presentable ; and Kevin Pietersen , driving expansively , was dropped at second slip before being caught at gully . These shortcomings will have been filed and worked on , but maybe not eliminated from England 's shot-selection when the heat is turned up . And they happened with WA 's strike bowler , Steve Magoffin , injured for all but 5.4 overs in which he took two wickets . <p> Not only will the conditions tip this series back towards Australians ; so will Stuart Broad 's return home . England have three capable replacements , but none has the accuracy of Broad , which made him the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ none is likely to score a 50 , as Broad did in the state game , with three sixes and controlled aggression , after England had ' edged , nicked and sliced ' to 117 for seven . <p> In the state game , thanks to his accuracy , Broad was by far England 's most effective bowler : 30 overs and five wickets for 73 . Whether Chris Tremlett or anybody else replaces him , he is going to offer more width than Broad , and width disappears at the WACA . That archaic fielding position known as ' third man ' could be revived this week . <p> Seeing bounce like seldom if ever before , stung by their team-mates being routed for less than 300 , England 's bowlers have bowled too short over the years and been hammered . Only once - twice if you count the waifs and strays of 1978-9 - have England bowled Australia out in both innings at the WACA . <p> We should also remember the nature of five-Test series . Only if the disparity between the two countries is immense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of New Zealand , India and Pakistan around 1960 -- does the pendulum stay on one side . Otherwise it swings to and fro . That is the nature of five-Test series . That is why they are the supreme form of the game . That is why Test cricket is declining rapidly worldwide , because administrators can not grasp this basic tenet . <p> Australia , after their infusion of youth , will bounce back at the WACA : perhaps not enough to win the third Test , but they still have some big days ahead . This series is anything but over . <p> Perth stats <p> England 's record in Perth : Played 11 , Won 1 , Lost 7 , Drawn 3 . <p> England 's sole victory there was in 1978-9 during World Series Cricket . <p> Average runs per wicket at the WACA in Tests between the two countries : England 27 , Australia 37 . <p> The highest innings for England at the WACA is 162 by Chris Broad in 1986-7 . <p> Fewer than a third of Tests at the Waca have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @

@@1750233 <h> LIVE : VIRGIN HOLIDAYS BARBADOS MUSIC FESTIVAL <h> ( Silver Sands , Barbados ) <p> Ask most music lovers the first things that spring to mind when asked to think of Barbados , and they 'll probably say reggae , Rihanna , and , ( I apologise to your mind 's eye if you had n't thought of it ) a bare-chested Simon Cowell on a jet-ski . <p> But there 's more to music on this jewel of the Caribbean and the Virgin Holidays Barbados Music Festival is the perfect showcase for it . <p> While the UK shivered in freezing conditions over November 19-21 , the cream of Bajan talent ( apart from the otherwise engaged RiRi ) was strutting its stuff over three days in temperatures constantly hovering around 27 ? C , with help from some top UK acts including the Dub Pistols . <p> Leaving all thoughts of Cowell and the X Factor back in blizzard Britain , the best acts from Barbados and surrounding islands joined forces with some of the freshest talent from these shores in a sort of rum-fuelled cultural exchange on stage - and both locals and tourist like me lapped it up . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some sun-soaked festival vibes yourself , Virgin Holidays were doing deals including flights , accommodation and entrance to the event over all three days for about ? 600 - not a lot when you consider what your heating bill is going to be this winter ... <h> RELATED ARTICLES <h> Share this article <p> Share <p> It 's held at the idyllic yet funky Surfers ' Bay resort on the south coast , which is a cool and affordable enclave of the island bursting with culture - and well away from holidaying celebs in the blinged-up west . <p> Blessed with a beautiful beachside location and decked out with fairylights , it was an idyllic bijou festival for true music lovers held in a tropical heaven . <p> Act after act impressed as you lounged on the white sand beach or danced up a sweat , all the while sipping an ice cold Banks beer or Mount Gay rum and coke - two local brews that sponsor the event , and either only ? 2 a pop . <p> The event is organised by Veronica ' Ronnie ' Montgomery , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the UK two years ago , and her friend Steve Campbell . <p> He 's an ex-pat Brit who runs both the festival venue in Silver Sands , as well as a cool seafront music and food joint Surfers ' Cafe , just down the road in Maxwell . <p> Both of them know their music and the bill was bursting with some top-quality sonic treats . <p> Peerless : Bajan reggae outfit The Fully Loaded Band <p> It was the fourth edition of this tropical treat on the south of the country featuring a mix of British and Bajan rock , blues , ska and incredible local reggae supremos like The Fully Loaded Band . <p> Ronnie explained : ' The concept of the festival is to bring some of the UK 's up and coming artists to work alongside local Barbadian musicians to form lasting musical partnerships and to play music you do n't often hear on the island . And to drink lots of rum !

It really is a seemingly magical place . <p> So what else ( apart from the generally incredible weather and delicious and cheap booze and food ) sets the Virgin Holidays Music Festival apart from al fresco musical fandangos back home ? <p> Intriguing : Trinidad indierockers Jointpop were one of the stand-out Caribbean acts over the weeken <p> Intriuging Trinidadian rock band Jointpop played one of the most storming sets during Saturday 's jam . <p> Frontman Gary Hector explained to Mail Online : ' Well , for Jointpop ... coming from " next door " ( Trinidad and Tobago ) , it gives us the chance to expose our style to our Caribbean neighbors in a very cool festival setting . <p> ' Also I can imagine the people coming in from the UK would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weather and friendly people . The promoters also make sure that everyone is having a great time with all the cool acts - it 's a more personal musical experience . ' <p> Gary is bang on the money and the aesthetic carried on into the Sunday , a grand finale is all meanings of the phrase , as suddenly the bill was swelled with all the bands due to play Saturday too and the site was packed with hundreds of revellers who 'd dried off from the day before . <p> The magnificent blues of the superb Woking-based Martin Harley Band - one of celebrity chef Hugh Fearnley Whittingstall 's favourite bands - were definitely a highlight of the whole three days . <p> But no-one could have rounded off three days of rum-fuelled mayhem quite like London-based punkrock ska scamps the Dub Pistols . <p> They recorded their last album , 2009 's Rum N Coke on the island having been to every Barbados Music Festival since it started . <p> Getting the crowd of hundreds pumping the air and dancing madly in the steamy heat with their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dredlocked local dance hall MC Red Star Lion , who guested on their last album and who gave their punky Brit sensibilities a distinctive Bajan edge . <p> Barry Ashworth and his live trombone and guitar-boosted band were also joined by special guest star Lindy Layton , who got the biggest cheers of the weekend when she took to the stage . <p> Dub be good : Former Beats International star Lindy Layton , one of the Dub Pistols 's special guests <p> She joined the Dubs for their version of Dub Be Good To Me , the song she made famous with Norman Cook 's Beats International in 1990 , and covered as a No. 1 hit this year by Professor Green and Lily Allen , as well as I 'm In Love , her single with the Dubs from the last album . <p> She told MailOnline afterwards back in snowbound Britain : ' The show in Barbados was my perfect gig .

@@1750234 <p> In a basement bar in the West End of London that 's part English tea room , part Prohibition era speakeasy -- the floral wallpaper and the empty bottles of Mumm champagne in the fireplace in uneasy symbiosis -- Matt Lucas and David Walliams are also going through their familiar high-contrast double act . <p> Posing for pictures in what seems to be their preferred off-duty mufti -- suits and ties -- they 're like Gilbert and George refracted through a Carry On prism . They hold hands , clutch each other 's knees and -- at least in Lucas ' case -- crack their faces into manic grins . Walliams is a little more circumspect . <p> An imposing 6ft 4in , he 's impeccably attired in a petrol-blue suit that 's undoubtedly crafted by his friend and seeming obsession , the designer Tom Ford . ( When he was getting his house redesigned -- Noel Gallagher 's former Supernova Heights in north London , no less -- Walliams showed the builders pictures of Ford 's LA home and said , more or less : ' I want that one . ' His new wife , the Dutch model Lara Stone , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their marriage . ) <p> He 's restrained and rather serious , incongruously combining fruity vowels and a lubricious laugh with an actorly detachment . <p> Lucas , almost a foot shorter , looks like a schoolboy whose mother 's best smartening-up efforts are forever doomed to come undone -- his shirt untucked , his tie askew . He 's more impetuous and irreverent , keen to undermine any remark that might carry even a faint whiff of the portentous . <p> When talk turns , as it inevitably must , to Jordan , Walliams opines that her ostensible day job is creating a photo-opportunity for herself : ' Where does her real life end and her media existence begin ? I doubt if even she knows where the line is any more . She 's sort of trapped in her own meta-narrative . ' <p> Lucas raises his eyebrows . ' I also have to try and juggle two different existences . There 's the Matt Lucas that you know and then there 's the real me -- who I call Katie Price . ' Such is the comic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ viewers and DVD sales in the tens of millions , the ' yeah but no buts ' and ' I 'm a lay-dees ' hard-wired into the DNA of a whole generation . <p> What tended to get lost in the avalanche of verbiage expended on the show -- the grotesquery of the incontinent pensioners and breast-feeding men , the accusations of mockery at the expense of a disfranchised underclass -- was the sheer brio of Walliams ' and Lucas ' characterisations , plus the darkness that lay behind a lot of those characters . <p> Both Walliams and Lucas have been in therapy -- the former a victim of bullying at his Reigate grammar school , the latter able to pick and choose his demons from growing up bald , gay and Jewish in north London -- and have talked of their struggles with depression . <p> ( When Walliams was on Desert Island Discs , his luxury was a gun , not to bag his dinner , but so he could shoot himself if necessary . ) <p> So , as the Little Britain juggernaut wound down , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Walliams to act in Pinter , swim the Channel for Comic Relief and write bestselling children 's books about troubled boys who find happiness in , for instance , cross-dressing ; and Lucas to play Leigh Bowery in the stage musical Taboo and Tweedledum and Tweedledee in Tim Burton 's Alice in Wonderland -- the question of what they would next wrest from their psyches was a more than academic one . <p> Now we have the answer -- Little Britain on Ryanair . Such , at any rate , is how Come Fly With Me is likely to be received . <p> In the show , centred on a budget airline called FlyLo , Lucas and Walliams play upwards of 20 characters , regular and fleeting , including Omar Baba , the airline 's Al Fayed-style owner ; Mickey and Buster , a pair of hopeless paparazzi ; Feargal , an Irish trolley dolly ( ' I 'm one of 10 brothers . We 're all gay . Except for Finbar . He 's bi . ' ) ; Simon and Jackie Trent , a husband-and-wife pilot team with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ airport buggy driver ; Precious , the evangelical coffee-concession proprietress ; and a pair of Japanese schoolgirls eager to catch a glimpse of their idol , Martin Clunes . <p> The degree to which you find it ' happy flighting ' , as another character says repeatedly in the first episode ( the nearest the show comes to a copper-bottomed catchphrase ) , will depend on your partiality to Walliams ' and Lucas ' revisiting of their classic sketch-show tropes . No self-lacerating sim-com in the mode of Simon Amstell 's Grandma 's House for them , it seems . <p> ' I think if we did a downbeat sitcom where we played two bitter comedians moaning about people shouting our catchphrases at us in the street , we 'd get great reviews , ' Walliams says wryly . ' But I imagine it would be quite a turn-off for the public . ' <p> ' Our skill is in characters , ' Lucas avers . ' The broader and more cartoony the better . ' <p> Come Fly With Me , which starts on Christmas Day , came out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on around 18 months ago . ' We sat down and over the course of two or three weeks , we created a show a day , ' Lucas says . ' It was a rich period . The airline idea was one we came up with . And the more we talked about it , the more we thought , there 's life in this . ' <p> ' All human life can be found in an airport , ' Walliams emphasises . <p> The show was filmed in two real-life airports ( we 've been asked not to name them , but airport anoraks should easily identify them ) . ' They were hard environments to shoot in , ' Walliams says . ' You ca n't control it . You 've got tannoy announcements , people wandering in and out of shot , all kinds of distractions . But it brings a great reality to it that you could n't have faked . ' <p> ' They 're real people and real planes , ' Lucas beams . ' My mum and stepdad are eating a Cornetto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scene where I was crying , and some guy came and stood right in front of me , watching me act , ' Walliams says . ' It was really inhibiting . ' <p> ' I had to drive a buggy and I ca n't drive , and I was n't wearing my glasses , ' Lucas says . ' That was more daunting , for me and everyone else . ' <p> ' You only killed one person , did n't you ? ' asks Walliams archly . ' The other weird thing was , the security people had to come and watch us getting our heavy prosthetics applied , so that they could verify our new " identities " when they took us back air-side . Doing this , I began to realise why no one else has ever done a scripted series set in an airport . ' <p> ' But it 's useful as a setting , because everyone has an experience of going there and it 's usually an anxious one , ' Lucas adds . ' Did I pack my passport ? Will I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a wee , a pound for a pooh ? ' He grins . <p> ' Forgive me -- let 's not go down that route . This show 's actually much cleaner than Little Britain . There 's something in the current climate that made us rein it in a bit . There 's still some edge -- that 's what we do -- but it 's slightly more family-oriented . ' <p> ' It 's a bit realer than Little Britain , ' Walliams says , ' but we 're still reserving our right to change gender , race and sexuality as much as we can . ' <p> Certainly , there 's nothing as crude in Come Fly With Me as projectile bodily fluids or naked fat-suits , but surely some might still have qualms about the minstrelsy inherent in Walliams and Lucas blacking up to play Precious or Taj ? <p> ' We play young-old , black-white , fat-thin , straight-gay , ' Lucas declares . ' We do n't want to limit ourselves and Britain is multicultural . But we 're not making any political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that down , you end up not being able to play anyone but yourself , ' Walliams says . ' In that case , should Daniel Day-Lewis have played Christy Brown in My Left Foot ? Should n't it actually have been someone with cerebral palsy ? ' <p> ' That 's what acting is -- playing someone else , ' Lucas says . ' And then , with the writing , I remember someone using the phrase " class tourism " about Little Britain ... ' <p> ' Well then , let 's burn the works of Dickens and Shakespeare , ' puts in Walliams heatedly . ' I mean , if you can only depict people of your own class ... ' <p> Maybe it depends on what you think comedy 's for , I offer . Amstell said in a recent interview that he thought it should be directed upwards . ' I do n't know what that means , ' Lucas says flatly . <p> ' He means do n't attack people who are weak , right ? ' Walliams says . ' Attack those in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think comedy is necessarily an attack . It 's finding humour in life . I do n't think if you 're making a joke about something you 're automatically demeaning it . ' <p> He pauses . ' Obviously you check yourself , make sure you 're not poking fun at someone 's racial characteristics . They have to have their own life as opposed to being a generalised representation of class or ethnicity . That 's when you 're in trouble . ' <p> ' Vicky Pollard had her own life , ' Lucas says . ' So did Harry Enfield 's Slobs or Catherine Tate 's Lauren , or Steve Coogan 's Pauline Calf . You just find your own way of doing these characters . ' <p> They pause for a ruminative sip of water . It 's clear that they take their comedy pretty seriously , but they insist that they did nt feel any pressure to attempt to outdo the Dark Side of the Moon-sized shadow cast by Little Britain . <p> ' No part of me thinks that Come Fly With Me will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of me is bothered about that . It 's not something you can control . Nobody maintains the highest level of success for the entirety of their career . No one . Madonna , Michael Jackson ... they all go through their peaks and troughs . There 's a type of excitement you generate when you do something good and you 're perceived to be new . But it 's transient by nature . It does n't work forever for anybody . ' <p> ' The main thing is , you 've got to be proud of what you do , ' Walliams says . ' And we 're both proud of Come Fly With Me . ' <p> ' And there are fashions in comedy like everything else , ' Lucas continues . ' Right now , there 's a boom in stand-up with people like Michael McIntyre and Peter Kay , who are very accomplished and pretty clean , and there seems to be something in the air that says that 's what people want . But then in the next few years the new Bill Hicks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' <p> ' And then Michael McIntyre will be like Bob Monkhouse , ' says Walliams , sounding not displeased at the prospect . ' It 's like when Russell Brand came along , a lot of people suddenly looked old-fashioned . Someone will find a new way of doing a sketch show and Little Britain will look decidedly previous-generation . We 'll be the dinosaurs . So we 'll have to reinvent it , not sit there moaning . It 's like Miranda Hart reinventing the sitcom . ' <p> ' She 's brilliant , ' Lucas enthuses . ' So warm . She 's going to be huge . Right now people want Miranda rather than misanthropy . ' <p> ' But there 's room for everything , ' Walliams argues . ' I remember when we did a Comic Relief sketch with George Michael , and we went out for dinner with him , and I asked him what music he liked in Wham ! He said : " Oh , me and Andrew loved Joy Division , Unknown Pleasures . " And I thought , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 've got Wham ! and Joy Division albums . ' <p> ' I 've only got Wham ! ' Lucas says with a simper . <p> If the duo slip into the roles of elder comic statesmen with some ease , it 's perhaps because of the perspective afforded them by the kind of access-all-areas level of celebrity they 've attained . <p> For Lucas , there 's a budding Hollywood career and the possibility of revisiting the role of Leigh Bowery ( he 's bought the film rights to Sue Tilley 's biography of the performance artist-provocateur ) ; for Walliams , there 's the stonewalling when asked if he 's been approached to be a judge on Britain 's Got Talent ( ' I have n't signed on to do anything , ' he mumbles ) , and his continuing ( and sometimes complicit ) tabloid ubiquity ( he shows me some shots on his iPhone of himself and his wife backstage at the X Factor with Wagner , the former flashing showbiz smiles , the latter looking characteristically bemused ) . <p> But along with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have had their personal travails publicly raked over in unedifying fashion . So how have they found being famous so far ? <p> ' Denise van Outen said this thing to me about fame , ' Walliams says with a grin . ' It 's exciting at first , then it becomes really naff and a bit embarrassing . You ca n't turn it off . It 's a bit tricky when something bad is happening in your life and you ca n't be the person that people want you to be , because someone 's died or something ... ' <p> ' ... and you 're trapped in your house for a week , ' puts in Lucas , sharply . <p> ' That 's when it 's kind of tough , ' Walliams continues , ' especially being a comedian , because you 're not like you are on Jonathan Ross or Little Britain , but you do n't want to disappoint people . ' He checks himself . ' But let 's get things in perspective here . We 're not down a Chilean coal mine . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ career move for those guys though , did n't it ? ' Lucas says .

The low-rise buildings surround a pleasant pool with gardens and mini golf , and there are on-site restaurants and a deli .

The one " must " is a whale-watching tour on a high-speed catamaran . <p> The city is famous for its seafood and any number of restaurants and food outlets can be found , from the stalls in Quincy market to the excellent burgers at the Cheers bar ( www.cheersboston.com ) or the excellent Red House in Cambridge ( 617 576 0605 ; www.theredhouse.com ) . <p> The RV was organised through Complete North America ( 0845 263 7100 ; **28;931;TOOLONG ) -- it was our first time driving an RV and it was awesome .

Half-price show tickets are available , along with discounts on dining and buffets . To make the most of Vegas make sure you buy a 24-hour bus ticket ( $7 ) . All the hotels appear excellent along the Strip , but my favourite was Caesar 's Palace ( www.caesarspalace.com ) .

Capt Doug Beattie writes exclusively from the frontline on the dilemma of helping those once intent on taking his life . <p> Captain Doug Beattieof 1 Royal Irish Regiment won the Military Cross for bravery in Afghanistan . He writes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frontline . <p> Breathing hard , my back against the dusty wall of a mud compound , its metal doors forced open to reveal a small shop , the coolness of its shade washing over me , I stared hard at the Taliban fighter at my feet . <p> He stared back . <p> Just moments earlier he had been intent on killing me and my men . What his motivation was - ideology , money , excitement -- I did n't know and would never find out . For the man 's deep , dark eyes were unseeing . <p> They were those of a man who had breathed his last , another casualty of war . <p> Where he lay , a small pool of blood had formed behind his head , his loose fitting robes twisted around him , the feet bare , the long hair matted with dirt , his beard matted with blood . <p> The dead insurgent had tried to use children to mask his retreat . <p> Around him was strewn the detritus of a medical emergency ; tubes , bandages , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Rangers then proceeded to try and save his life . It was not to be . <p> Death had triumphed over life . When we could , we would take a DNA sample and a photo , and then leave his body to be buried by the local population whose hospitality he had forced himself upon , taking advantage of the Pashtun-Wali code , the ancient custom of kindness to strangers adhered to as much today by the local population as it was during the time of Alexander the Great . <p> But procedure would have to wait a bit longer , for the sounds of combat had not died with the young insurgent . <p> Even as my soldiers had tried to staunch his flow of blood and that of one of his wounded colleague , their comrades renewed the attack , trying to force us from the ground we had so recently taken , hoping we would abandon not just the territory but also the wounded fighter and the weapons and radios we had captured . <p> There was nothing particularly unusual about the situation . Using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Find , Feel and Understand , in other words learn about the area . <p> Our patrol had been working on a road between Kalang , our main Patrol Base in Saidabad , and the rather smaller and more isolated checkpoint Tanoor . The result was predictable . <p> The insurgents had been first to engage , the 7.62mm short rounds from their AK47s , and 7.62mm long rounds from the PKMs , splitting the air above our heads , ripping up the earth at our feet and slamming into the compound walls the Rangers were using for cover . <p> It was the next .338 calibre bullet from Ranger sniper 's weapon that smashed through his groin and sent him spinning to the ground . <p> But this was n't a day to absorb the enemy fire and merely trade a few rounds of our own .

Could I ? And finally should I ? The first two questions relating to his rules of engagement the last question relating to the impact of firing , what effect would it have not just on the insurgent but on the local population . In the end he had no choice , his skill matching his training . <p> It was then that the insurgent 's comrade moved from the shadows , rifle in hand as he fired wildly down the track . It was the next .338 calibre bullet from Ranger sniper 's weapon that smashed through his groin exciting his buttock and sent him spinning to the ground . <p> This was not the movies . There was no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air , just the sickly sound of the impact ; lead boring through flesh and bone . <p> For the enemy the relief of being alive would quickly have been tempered by knowledge that his body had been seriously if not fatally damaged , physically unable to respond to the commands sent from the brain . <p> I am no stranger to violent death . Bosnia , Kosovo , the war in Iraq and now three tours of Afghanistan , have ensured that . But that does not mean I am immune to it , whether the loss of life has been suffered by friend or foe . I feel both keenly . The immediate euphoria of overcoming an enemy tarnished by the sense of waste . <p> Do I leave them writhing in pain and misery , hopelessly willing their shattered limbs to carry them beyond our reach ? <p> Death on the battlefield is at least followed by a full stop .

The surviving insurgent is treated as if he is one of us . With a dressing on the wound , and morphine for the pain , a MIST report is sent back to HQ classifying him as a CAT A patient . <p> Soon a helicopter will arrive to whisk him away to the same facility that would have treated a British casualty if the roles had been reversed , no medical distinction being made , it is the Law of Armed Conflict and it governs all our actions on the battlefield . <p> Meanwhile his dead colleague is shown the dignity in death I suppose we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ straightened by his sides . <p> Nowhere in the rules and regulations does it say this needs to be done .

@@1753237 <p> The Chinese really must think the American strategy and behavior to be braindead and self-destructive . The US helped them assemble a manufacturing industry , replaced US income with debt , and finally faces the Grim Reaper in a national episode of systemic failure . The US leadership is as stupid and mindless as the population is driven by compulsive consumption over the cliff , as the nation faces ruin . The Jackass warning has been for five years that the Chinese experiment would end in tragedy , and that when a preponderance of USTreasury debt is owned by foreigners , especially a single foreign nation , the Untied States will lose its sovereignty . <p> It is worse . It lost its vitality entirely . With its financial engineering backfire , the nation is broken from a sequence of repeated asset bubbles &amp; busts . With its wartime economy , the nation seeks new enemies and prefers exports of weapons to productive goods . The nation is like a Sherman Tank sinking in a sea of quicksand with credit cards as banners flown , all overdrawn and canceled . The globe has come full circle from a century ago . The export @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ US monopoly on narcotics nowadays . Uncle Sam prefers selling contraband to legitimate industry . <p> A spectacular sequence of events has taken place with respect to China and the United States in the past decade . The disastrous outcome was extremely visible long ago to the competent economists . This article can not fully discuss and analyze the entire sequence , which in my view took the USEconomy from imbalanced , debilitated , and on the verge of ruin in ten years to chronic insolvency , accelerated breakdown , and systemic failure today . The official policy toward China by the USGovt on bilateral trade highlights the incredibly stupid and irresponsible nature of American leadership , especially in economic and financial matters . Let this piece serve as an outline of ruinous self-destructive policy , resulting in a climax failure in the Untied States . At the doorstep to a much darker poorer place , with countless traits associated with the Third World , the US as a nation with its USGovt and Wall Street compromised leadership refuse to admit grotesque errors . They do what they usually do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and create a new enemy to lay blame on foreigners . This time though , the Chinese object of criticism , rebuke , hostility , and retaliation is the largest USTreasury creditor . The counter-attack from Beijing after an amateurish display of ignorance and tantrums seems directed at purchases of Gold &amp; Silver , along with developing a stranglehold on the commodity supply chain . The financial managers in China have found inventive ways to discharge vast amounts of USTreasury Bonds . Their challenge includes finding secure worthwhile investment locations for the over $20 billion in bilateral trade surplus they build each month with the US , a formidable challenge indeed . <p> MOST FAVORED NATION TICKET <p> The rationale for the Clinton Admin to grant a Most Favored Nation status to China in its closing months in 1999 was a mystery to me . To be sure , the gesture went a long way toward developing detente with the slumbering giant . But it awakened the Middle Kingdom after two centuries of quiet , marred by a half century of harsh communism . Without question , some big promises @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the USGovt sought a lock on a new large scale creditor to purchase USTreasury debt securities , regardless of the consequences . Perhaps the USGovt sought a bagholder both either USTBonds or USAgency Mortgage Bonds , or both . With Japan and South Korea as neighbors , China would surely not resort to purchasing US weaponry . Given the coincident timing with the handover of Hong Kong from the British at the end of its 99-year lease , one must suspect that China might have promised not to transform HK into an economic prison camp shrouded in communist rules that would render it a wasteland , if the US and UK would only promise to assist the Asian giant with technology transfer , industrial support , and massive business investment . China probably promised some big bait of cheap imports to the USEconomy , the grand US achilles heel . The US was well along its pattern of consuming itself to death . Witness the retail emphasis within its economy , its crippling reliance upon debt , its junk food preferences , and its obesity . The China might have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Maybe the entire deal was well planned , a leftover of Mao Tse Tung days when he was a member of the Skull &amp; Bones group . <p> The Most Favored Nation status was the ticket that opened the door , a New Open Door policy , for investment , lower cost in production , and the general awakening of the sleeping giant . What followed was a natural course of events to unseat the Untied States , converting it into a hopeless debtor with neither the prospect nor the means to repay its debt . Enter the new age of China , all perhaps the plan , the ever patient giant . The parallel to the destruction was a course taken by former USFed Chairman Greenspan . He guided the nation through the avenue to financial engineering and consequent implosion brilliantly , offering ideological justification , legislative obfuscation , and near the end , a nearly total abdication . He was a tremendous mesmerizing high priest . Greenspan 's second paycheck from his Swiss masters is consistent with working an agenda toward the demise of the American Empire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the United States and China was as investment partners . Rough figures of Western corporation ( US , Canada , Europe ) investment were $23 billion for the years 2001 , 2002 , and 2003 . It was probably more . The Chinese industrial base expanded to the point that 60% of all Chinese trade surplus originated from Western corporations new to the scene . Yet the US leaders complained about the big surplus gathered , being part of its process . Worse , the Chinese factories often were equipped with the next generation Japanese machinery , like in machine tools , automation , and fabrication . A few years later , the German machinery entered the factory floors to some extent . US corporations saw an opportunity to tap the cheaper Chinese labor , and did so . The consensus opinion was that China could not be ignored for another century , so include them , partner with them , bring them into the fold . China quickly became the centerpiece to the globalization movement . One must wonder if the Western economist corps was so clueless as to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ countless jobs from the US and Europe . China would accumulate reserves rapidly . China would own foreign debt securities well beyond a critical mass . When the Hat Trick Letter started in 2004 , my warning was constant and consistent , that China would eventually became a rival then a trade war opponent . The differential in labor costs would lead to a gigantic arbitrage that ended up at a breaking point , with extreme conflict at the end chapter . We are there . It will be a miracle to avoid a hot war . <p> THE LOW COST SOLUTION <p> The people of the United States no longer hear about the famed Low Cost Solution bandied about in 2002 and 2003 endlessly . It was supposedly a good thing , to reduce the cost of home electronics and housewares . For a idiot consumer society , that is a good thing supposedly . For a wise nation , it is a prescription for disaster . That was how the Jackass saw it . The solution of a lower production cost had a flip side , with staggering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a collision course with the Third World abyss . Simply stated , China 's gain would be America 's loss . The new jobs created in China to enable the lower cost in producing exports to the US consumer , hellbent on consuming his entire house in home equity , hellbent on consuming his entire future in order to live for today . The result would be assuredly lost jobs in America . It was obvious to all except the clueless cast of hack US economists . They proclaimed that the lower costs of production would enable cheaper imports into the USEconomy , a new wave of spawned growth with ripple effects in benefit , wider distribution from this vast Asian pool , more retail jobs , and a new American growth spurt . What utter nonsense ! But they continue to ply their trade . <p> Quickly the jobs vanished from the USEconomic scene . Home appliances took much of the news headlines . The drain of jobs spread to Japan , as its robust economy began to feel the impact . In time the majority of consumer items @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for export to Japan . The labor arbitrage in globalization spares no advanced economy , which must operate under a higher cost structure . Follow washing machines , dryers , dishwashers , stoves , and more , came housewares and hardware items . The crowning blow was the announcement that Wal-Mart had 160 Chinese manufacturing sites in place . Sam Walton would not approve , as his motto was Made In America . The die was cast . Then came the problems of quality and reliability . Food imports from China had gradually earned a tarnished reputation of recycling chicken from reject sources and even roadkill for fresh caramel color and quick export to the US grocery shelves . The home building industry saw problems with drywall quality , even carpet chemicals . The SARS epidemic eclipsed the news headlines though , usurping attention . The same type of software reliability problems seen in the 1990 decade from India were experienced from Chinese exports . The greatest impact in the early stages of the Chinese industrial experiment were <p> the loss of US jobs in favor of growth in China @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the USEconomy <p> the rise of home equity debt from US households <p> the US dependence upon asset bubbles for economic growth <p> the growth of income in China <p> the growth of the bilateral trade deficit with China <p> the growth of the mammoth FOREX reserves in Chinese Sovereign Wealth Funds <p> the increasing share of Chinese ownership of USTreasury Bonds <p> the increasing share of Chinese ownership of USAgency Mortgage Bonds <p> reduced quality and reliability of imported products to the USEconomy <p> strain for the macro economic impact to the USDollar and Chinese Yuan <p> strain for the macro economic impact to the USGovt debt and USTreasury Bond <p> resentment in the US for jobs stolen by China <p> blocked large firm acquisitions ( see Unocal , BHP Billiton , 3Com ) <p> new areas of friction ( e.g. bank rules , security rules like Google ) <p> a fast rise in tariffs and protectionism <p> ALARMING FOREX RESERVES <p> For US-based economists not to foresee a simple direct consequence of fast rising , alarming levels of FX reserves being accumulated by China , the American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Jackass siren call was that eventually the Chinese holdings of USTreasury Bond debt would grow so great that US sovereignty would be challenged , compromised , then lost . The concept never entered the corrupted thought chambers of US economists and the cranium cavities . The challenge became so great within China for managing such huge sums of money , each and every month , that they created several Sovereign Wealth Funds . The Arab nations developed the concept , as did South Korea and Singapore , but the Chinese saw such funds flourish . When they collectively tipped the $1 trillion mark a few years ago , the news captured global attention . <p> Nowadays , the Chinese total reserves from diverse accounts totals $2.65 trillion , a center of great power . Heck , that is almost as much money as has been stolen by past US presidents , and stolen by US defense contractors , which happens to be about $1.5 trillion from Fannie Mae and $2.2 trillion from the Pentagon misappropriations . One must love the verbiage , as misappropriation sounds better than stolen . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ counterfeit USTBonds sold ( over and above issuance ) into the market by JPMorgan Chase , whose evidence was in the Building #7 at the World Trade Center , turned into a heap with pervasive thermite residue . <p> In recent months , the US-China bilateral trade deficit has remained over $20 billion per month in stubborn fashion . The labor arbitrage is a dynamic that will not go away . Chinese labor , as the Jackass wrote in 2005 , could rise by 50% and still be far below the US wage scale . In order to cement their grip on trade , and assure a reliable supply line , which keeps firm their surplus revenue stream and economic vitality , the Chinese embarked on a fortification strategy . They bought the Long Beach California port facility . They bought much of the Vancouver port facilities . They bought much of the Mexican port facilities . In the last year , they expanded to building the primary Brazilian port facility . Call it a stranglehold of deep water ports . The major challenge for China with gargantuan reserves and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . <p> They have major challenges in investing all that money . Well actually , it is not money , but rather credits acknowledged to contain value in recognized purchase power . The Chinese have been engaged in extremely brisk investment plans to secure energy supply , metal &amp; mineral supply , and on the other side to secure markets to sell their finished goods . Instead of weapon sales , they typically promise to build community centers , schools , hospitals , marketplaces , railroads , and port facilities . Of course in the process , they ignore local dictatorships . They have made great inroads in West Africa , a region the US ignores except for Nigeria , where the common practice is to use muscle and bribery it seems . See the ex-VP Cheney case . China has made great inroads in the Persian Gulf and in Turkey , opening up Middle East markets and African markets . <p> SCAPEGOAT FOR US WRECKAGE <p> As the disaster unfolds from a mindless self-destructive pathway toward the climax in consumerism coupled with labor market abandonment , the USGovt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . China has been labeled a currency manipulator , a thief of jobs , everything but the old heartless yellow scourge . Save that label for last . The USGovt , with its recent Wall Street masters , has been deeply involved in wrecking the integrity of most every financial market it touches . The USTreasury Bond market has a scad of naked shorts , failures to deliver , and leverage from Interest Rate Swap contracts that help to maintain the high value and low rates . The USGovt keeps the Consumer Price Index under wraps , preventing an unwanted rise from appearing . In the 2000-2007 period , the rising home price component was carefully removed from the CPI . It featured the home equivalent rent component instead , a tame moribund figure . After 2007 , the stat rats decided to include the home price component again , since it is falling . Now the CPI features a home price item that consists of 25% of the index incredibly . Then the USDept Treasury assures that enough Treasury Investment Protected Securities are bought by the USFed , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a bathtub of cold water at all times . Then the USGovt uses suppression of the gold price in order to keep the USDollar elevated . The currency stabilization funds are commonly recognized mainstays of USGovt financial management . In fact such stabilization funds have about 20 to 30 hidden agencies busily defending the USDollar value , our freedom , and our way of life . During all this market manipulation , the USGovt has angered its creditors to the extreme . <p> So the USGovt reveals its many currency manipulator sides . A scribe would be negligent not to mention the Shadow Banking System that is the province of the US banking industry , fully supported by the USFed and the USDept Treasury . The hidden banking network has the unique feature of profiting from other nations as their financial structure heave from the great stress , and decline into a wrecking field . Keep in mind they include vast import of fraudulent bonds from the US issuers . The shadowy system used to boast $1400 trillion in credit derivatives and other nuclear sewage , now perhaps only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to laugh . These instruments go a long way to manipulate the value of USTBonds , the USDollar , and the entire usury costs of the US universe of corrupted value . <p> The USGovt finally has complained about Chinese Yuan currency manipulation so much and for so long , not to mention with such shrill vacant thought , that the world has isolated the US on the global stage . Take the South Korean G-20 Meeting a month ago . The US was given lip service as appetizer hors d'oeuvres , and a cold shoulder at the dinner table . Nobody followed the US lead , nobody . It was the most shameful G-8 or G-20 Meeting in Untied States history . The finance ministers took their cues from the Chinese delegation . The crowning climax to duplicity has taken shape in the last year . Early in 2010 , the professor occupying the USFed Chairman post repeatedly mentioned his plan for an Exit Plan from the 0% rate corner . The Jackass dismissed such nonsensical propaganda , along with equally lunatic delusional notions like Green Shoots of USEconomic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ student for accountability on forecasts , analysis , and white papers , he would fail quickly and exit the program ( a very different exit strategy ) . As the distress to the USEconomy and US financial system became acute in 2010 , the USGovt blamed China for more currency manipulation . It became a tired old song with little or no meaning , more like a blunt stick to beat the Chinese investment partner from 2002 , to pummel the creditor . How quickly we forgot our trade partner , our source of Low Cost Solutions ! ! <p> The climax came with admission that the USFed would embark on Quantitative Easing #2 , a correct Jackass forecast cited all through the first six months of 2010 . The USFed would print money , buy USTBond debt , flood the bond market with liquidity , and directly manipulate the USDollar currency in the process . The debt monetization in 2009 and 2010 was much bigger than the exposed QE1 . The USDollar has been in downtrend ever since . Gold has been in powerful uptrend . The duplicity comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manipulates its Yuan currency . The DC spin has no other message . To be sure , China keeps a loosely managed peg to the USDollar , never to permit too fast a rise . But the USGovt by comparison is the undisputed world champion of currency manipulation , debt production , market undermine , statistical distortion , and bank ruin . See the Flash Trading in the stock market . <p> CURRENCY WAR &amp; TRADE WAR <p> The Competing Currency War has ramped up , heated up , and agitated every single major and secondary nation in the global economy . The primary detonation trigger for the currency war was QE1 , the printing of $1.4 trillion of phony money by the venerable USDept Treasury , blessed and managed by the august USFed , and subsequent purchase of two gaggles of USTBonds and one gaggle of USAgency Mortgage Bonds . The world watched in horror , as the USGovt gradually lost its buyer base in Treasury Bond auctions . The totally lost USFed under the myopic stewardship of Professor Bernanke , the great student of Great Depression revisionist history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Except this time after the nutty home buyer tax credit expired , the USEconomy slid further into recession . The lies told and reports published on price inflation , which rages higher at 8% according to Shadow Govt Statistics competent analysis , permit a 5% to 6% lie to be built into the GDP calculations . If price inflation is not really 2% to 3% as reported , then the GDP growth is not 3% as reported , but actually minus 2% to minus 3% instead . If simple annual GDP is compared to annual GDP from a year ago , then the GDP is running at a 7% recession . This revelation is astounding ! ! <p> So the USGovt refuses to effectively stimulate the USEconomy , since beholden to Wall Street for $trillion welfare programs . The USGovt conducts revolving door sessions on home loan modification , offering much sweeter incentives to the foreclosure mills run by the FDIC for the big banks . And the USFed admitted in August and September that the QE2 project would be unleashed . The engine for the global Competing Currency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bubbles were engrained in policy , where the multi-$trillion bond fraud originated for global export , where the criminal prosecution is nowhere , where the multi-$trillion monetary press is hard at work . The response from global trade partners is shock and horror , followed by hasty actions . The central banks around the world are busily responding to rising currencies . The December Hat Trick Letter gold report shows evidence in the TIC Report on USTBond holdings by major nations . <p> Some nations are reducing US$ exposure by USTBond sales . Other nations are quickly buying up USTBonds to prevent a fast rise in their native currencies . Other nations are part of the hidden US-UK network that conceals their vast USTBond purchases , all of which are denied by Bernanke before the USCongress . Why would the United Kingdom be so busy if not part of the illicit game of currency ruin in a desperate survival initiative ? The United Kingdom , despite being locked in an intractable downward spiral with insolvent banks , wrecked home equity , and horrendous national deficits , has somehow seen fit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from $126.8 billion in September 2009 to $459.1 billion . And China is a currency manipulator ! ! <p> The Competing Currency War has a long way to go . Healthier nations with a brisk export trade must be careful not to suffocate under a strengthening currency , as the USDollar steers itself down into the devaluation morass . The brain trust of the Wall Street and London pedigree know full well that the game is over , the fiat USDollar is trash , and that the Paradigm Shift features a power handoff to China and the East from the insolvent West , whose flagship in the US &amp; UK is preoccupied by war . The Competing Currency War is utterly fascinating , since it can be pre-written according to a tight script . Japan is buying USTBonds to prevent a fast rise in the Yen currency , which has already done harm to their export trade . The emerging nations are being flooded with speculative funds chasing higher bond yields , proceed funds from commodity sales , and much more . They will be harmed by rising native currencies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rules and taxes on incoming speculative money flow . They have a food price inflation problem , which is not from speculation , but rather from in my non-expert opinion a result of three decades of cutting and burning the Amazon Rain Forest . Their rain patterns have changed radically . <p> The real big battlegrounds are between the US &amp; China and among nations within the European Union . The Europeans can not continue with the fractured common Euro currency more longer , especially with defaulting sovereign bonds underneath them . Its Euro Bonds are so different , that arbitrage pulls apart the Euro at a time when the sovereign debt structure is falling like a series of dominos . The big enchalada is clearly Spain , which is near default . It will change the EU landscape radically . Today some silly nonsense propaganda deception news was promulgated that $40 billion would be needed to fix Spain and its banks . If Spain is three times larger than Greece , and the Athens banks needed $110 billion , one might use lower math to conclude that perhaps over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rescue . A rising Euro renders great harm . So again , according to script , the EU leaders and the EuroCB chieftains will do what they can to bring down the Euro currency , an exceptionally easy task . Such an easy task to order more Euros and bail out more European banks . The decision is simple , and in the process of pushing down the Euro exchange rate , the Gold &amp; Silver prices rise substantially . The Competing Currency War swirls . The only winner is Gold and its shiny quicker brother Silver . <p> GRAND CREDITOR &amp; LIQUIDATOR <p> China has become the world 's great creditor . So far they have not abused their role and position . They tend to cut trade deals more than weapons deals like the US has done with the entire Persian Gulf for five decades . The most clever action so far by China in the last two years was to establish a Dollar Swap Window for Greek Govt debt conversion . They obviously are using USTBonds in a dumping exercise . They are building a broader Dollar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ debt . They have won a freeze on trade war decisions at the governmental level across the entire European continent in a brilliant stroke . They won access to world class German industrial products . They have an avenue to dump USTBonds and in a sense enter the EU as a member nation , its creditor partner . The maneuver essentially isolates the Untied States further . Just this week , the clownish notion of US insulation from PIIGS sovereign debt was smashed . The US banks are vulnerable , despite past denials . <p> China has discovered that it can dump far more USTBonds by purchasing discounted EU member nation debt securities than it ever could in buying up West African deposits or Persian Gulf energy sources or South American deals . American observers shook quake in their boots , since China has learned how to enter the world of high finance . Sovereign debt is the closest thing to currencies in existence . The bonds are the obverse side of the currency . China has begun to expand its Yuan convertibility . Moves with Brazilian Real were followed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In late November moves with the Russian Ruble were cemented . In two years , the Chinese Yuan might be on nearly equal footing as the USDollar as a global reserve currency . The fact that it is rising will be one of its strongest features . <p> GOLD CENTER OF RETALIATION <p> The trade war has blossomed from import &amp; export of goods &amp; products to the financial sector . The resentment over currency manipulation has a backfire . China is heavily motivated to purchase Gold and to convert reserves to Gold . They are using USTreasury Bonds to buy Gold . They are fast exhausting the available supply of gold bullion , the real tangible physical version with inherent value . They are encouraging the Chinese population to buy gold in any form , relaxing the rules . At the same time , they are playing the Wall Street and London corrupt rigged game . They are using USTBonds to purchase layers of indexes futures contracts in gold . So as they buy up gold bullion , they pack underneath layers of long contracts at slighly lower prices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the neck while covering the mouth &amp; nose with a brutal cupped hand . The Chinese has engaged in the active war of words . They have called the USDollar a joke for a global reserve currency , unworthy since it is linked to gargantuan deficits . They carefully avoid accusations of bond fraud . The Chinese have called the USDollar the ultimate in currency manipulation , due to its open abuse as a monetization instrument . The mere fact that the USDollar is the object of a new carry trade , on then off , is another insult . Imagine using the USDollar at 0% cost as the source to fund speculative trade . It guarantees a powerful longstanding enduring decline . <p> GOLD &amp; SILVER BREAKOUTS <p> The breakouts in the Gold &amp; Silver prices will continue for the next two years and beyond . Every several weeks , a fresh record high will come . The unique aspect of the precious metals breakout is its foundation in a crumbling global monetary system . Demonstrated proof is that the Gold &amp; Silver prices are making record highs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impressive than the silver chart . The long held favorite by the Jackass is silver . Central banks own none , and industry demands plenty , as substitutes are few . Gold &amp; Silver have found their place as global reserve assets and currencies within FOREX accounts during the global assault on sovereign debt . The claims that Gold &amp; Silver are in a bubble are as stupid as they are humorous . Money is never in a bubble . The big bubble is USTreasurys . The desperation of the captains of fiat fraud is showing like underwear worn on the outside in plain public view . <p> Note the Silver price breakouts in all four major currencies , from upper left to lower right in the US$ , the Euro , the Pound Sterling , and the Yen . The promised land for many precious metals investors has been to witness a bull run in all currencies . It has begun , and it will continue until the series of pre-ordained climax events occurs . It will be as tragic as exciting . The global monetary system is collapsing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that brings no viable solutions anywhere . The major banks are collapsing in insolvency and futile defense of their broken fortresses . Government deficits are spiraling out of control , whose solution in fiscal austerity only makes the economies weaker . The metals exchanges are being systematically drained , even as revealed for the leveraged paper fraud they operate . They buy and sell paper gold and paper silver without too much benefit of physical , permitting naked short sales by the biggest US and London banks . Their game is being called . The Swiss banks are under critical eye for foot dragging on gold &amp; silver withdrawals from Allocated accounts . <p> The Chinese have done something remarkable , only to be done if they know the game is over and the victory over fiat paper money is complete . The Chinese have laid out their game plan , their modus operandi , their tactics if not strategy , through an anonymous London broker . Hats off to the King World News for sharing the invaluable information that should encourage even the most timid and reticent investor . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of physical metal to sell in a fractional scheme . They can not afford to pounce too hard on the price , with either naked shorts or higher margin requirements . Doing so only plays into the Chinese hands , which are grabbing all the bullion available . So the challenge is for the Anglo bankers to control the pace of the demise of the Gold &amp; Silver metal market . This is game over . In these times of monetary hyper-inflation , called euphemistically and absurdly Quantitative Easing by another name , the prospects for a double and triple in the Gold &amp; Silver price is utterly obvious . <p> THE HAT TRICK LETTER PROFITS IN THE CURRENT CRISIS . <p> From subscribers and readers : <p> At least 30 recently on correct forecasts such as the Lehman Brothers failure , numerous nationalization deals such as for Fannie Mae , grand Mortgage Rescue , and General Motors . <p> " You freakin rock !

The individuals belonged to a genetically distinct group of humans that were distantly related to Neanderthals but even more distantly related to us . <p> The finding adds weight to the theory that a different kind of human could have existed in Eurasia at the same time as our species . <p> Researchers have had enigmatic fossil evidence to support this view but now they have some firm evidence from the genetic study carried out by Professor Svante Paabo of the Max Planck Institute in Leipzig , Germany . <p> " A species of early human living in Europe evolved , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ western form that was the Neanderthal and an eastern form , the Denisovans .

Melanesian DNA comprises between 4% and 6% Denisovan DNA . <p> David Reich from the Harvard Medical School , who worked with Svante Paabo on the study , says that the fact that Denisovan genes ended up so far south suggests they were widespread across Eurasia : " These populations must have been spread across thousands and thousands of miles , " he told BBC News . <p> One mystery is why the Denisovan genes are unique in modern Melanesians and are not found in other Eurasian groups that have so far been sampled . <h> ' Fleeting encounter ' <p> Professor Stringer believes it is because there may have been only a fleeting encounter as modern humans migrated through South-East Asia and then on to Melanesia . <p> Image caption The remains were excavated at a cave site in southern Siberia <p> " It could be just 50 Denisovans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough to produce this 5% of those archaic genes being transferred , " he said . <p> " So the impact is there but the number of interbreeding events might have been quite small and quite rare . " <p> No one knows when or how these humans disappeared but , according to Professor Paabo , it is very likely something to do with modern people because all the " archaic " humans , like Denisovans and Neanderthals disappeared sometime after Homo sapiens sapiens appeared on the scene . <p> " It is fascinating to see direct evidence that these archaic species did exist ( alongside us ) and it 's only for the last few tens of thousands of years that is unique in our history that we are alone on this planet and we have no close relatives with us anymore , " he said . <p> The study follows a paper published earlier this year by Professor Paabo and colleagues that showed there was interbreeding between modern humans and Neanderthals as they emerged from Africa 60,000 years ago . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @

One is the re-emergence of the cocktail as a drink which is taken seriously ; the other is the proliferation of restaurants specialising in high-quality red meat , sausages , pork chops and the like . <p> Think of Hawksmoor in Spitalfields ( and there are many other examples ) . There you can get " dictionary-thick " steaks from the Ginger Pig 's herd of Longhorn cattle , aged for 35 days and grilled over super-hot charcoal . For Sunday brunch they do an enormous plate piled up with smoked bacon chop , pork and pork and mutton sausage , Bury black pudding , short rib , bone marrow , bubble and squeak , baked beans enriched with pig 's trotter and unlimited amounts of toast and dripping .

And you can slather your steak in luscious add-ons like stilton hollandaise . All washed down with never-ending Bloody Mary . <p> As for booze , well , when I was young you could not buy a proper gin martini anywhere except in the cocktail lounges of the five star hotels , and you 'd have been silly to try . If you asked for a martini they 'd serve you a glass of warm vermouth . Nowadays most self-respecting London restaurants and de luxe pub/bars are equipped to serve martinis and other much more complex drinks . These might contain half a dozen or more different aromatic ingredients -- like the cocktail I read about recently which was based on aged brandy flavoured with a maceration of toasted fruitcake . <p> Now , I accept that these fashions are confined to the high end of the catering industry , and metropolitan areas , but still they represent a definite improvement on what went before . More than that , both trends reveal a change in attitude . It boils down to this , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used to be wary of , but which they 've now learned to embrace . On the one hand , spirits that blow your head off , and , on the other , clogging , congealing animal fat . <p> This affects both men and women -- since in my experience sophisticated , pleasure-loving women enjoy booze and steaks nearly as much as men do . The 1970s and 1980s were the age of margarine -- Stork SB and Flora -- when the public health experts told us to watch our cholesterol and steer well clear of double cream and butter . These days scientists are much less dogmatic , and some seem to think a diet heavy in sunflower oil might not be such a good idea . Plus you got all the worries over those dangerous trans-fats that were produced by the hydrogenation of vegetable fats .

It 's more of a refinement . Discerning consumers would rather ingest something with a complex , interesting flavour but in moderate amounts . The emphasis is on high quality more than quantity .

Pregnant women and mothers of tiny babies were sent down for minor offences while more serious offenders were released to walk the streets . <p> Meanwhile , he was liable to offer ammunition to Private Eye 's vision of the out-of-touch Mr Justice Cocklecarrot with observations in court such as : " Who are the Beatles ? " He once said of the Spice Girls : " They arrived on the scene breasts first , but I do n't know their names . " <p> Never short of an outrageous opinion , at various times Pickles described the Duchess of York as a " scrubber " , Freddie Mercury as a " greedy bisexual " and the former Lord Chief Justice Lord Lane as a " dinosaur " . <p> Pickles frequently flouted the voluntary code that the judiciary do not speak out in public -- indeed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Kilmuir Rules , which at the time prevented judges speaking out in public without the Lord Chancellor 's permission . He criticised the legal system for being infected by conservatism , complacency and conformity . <p> He earned the enmity of Lord Hailsham , the former Lord Chancellor , whom he described as a " brooding Quixotic dictator " . Years later , after he had retired , Pickles went even further , describing Hailsham as " an arrogant , pompous , toffee-nosed Old Etonian " . <h> Related Articles <p> Despite being one of the most liberal judges on the Bench -- he called for the legalising of marijuana and prostitution -- Pickles attracted the odium of the Left as well as of the Right . <p> His views on women made him a target for feminists , but he was unapologetic : " I 've never said that a woman who goes about bra-less or dressed in a certain manner deserves to be raped ; what I have said is that if a woman dresses in a particular way and behaves in a particular manner she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Interviewed in 1990 , he declared : " I am the human face of the judiciary , unlike the majority who adopt a Trappist-like silence . " <p> James Pickles was born on March 18 1925 into a long line of Yorkshire stonemasons . His great-grandfather , George , worked on Lutyens 's Law Courts in the Strand ; his uncle was Wilfred Pickles , the Have A Go broadcaster of postwar years ; while his father made a fortune as an architect and financier in Halifax , of which he was mayor . <p> Educated at a private school in Worksop and at Leeds and Oxford Universities , James Pickles was called to the Bar in 1946 . He practised at Bradford from 1949 until 1976 , when he was appointed a circuit judge in the north-east and London . He had been made Assistant Recorder in 1963 and Recorder of Bradford in 1972 . His first head of chambers in Bradford was J Stanley Snowden -- " a lifelong Liberal who taught us how to stand up to top people , including some High Court judges , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ account , Pickles had to fight for recognition from the legal establishment : his application to become a QC was turned down three times by the Lord Chancellor , as were his early applications to become a judge . <p> When he did become a judge , the Lord Chancellor 's department was soon given to reason to regret his appointment , as Pickles 's determination to broadcast his opinions became clear . In 1981 he was refused permission to appear on a Panorama programme on sentencing policy , and three years later to record an interview for Radio Leeds . <p> In 1985 he published an article in The Daily Telegraph about the government 's pressure to shorten sentences by means of parole and was threatened with the sack . Undaunted , Pickles published a second article a few months later and was summoned to see Lord Lane , the Lord Chief Justice . <p> At that time Pickles gave a verbal undertaking that he would in future contact Lord Lane before speaking to the Press . He rescinded the agreement when the Lord Chief Justice , according to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In 1987 the irrepressible Yorkshireman published Straight from the Bench , in which he aired a number of controversial views . Prostitution , he argued , was a necessary evil and should therefore be controlled through licensed brothels . Pornography was a silly , emotive subjective term for something which " most men have some interest in " . <p> The delays , secrecy and old-boy network of the judicial system also came in for routine bashing in the book , and the resulting dispute with Lord Hailsham ended with a relaxation of the Kilmuir Rules . <p> Despite the furore , Pickles warned his critics that his first tome was merely the " chatter of a machine-gun " and that a second volume , more like " a siege gun " , would soon follow . <p> In 1989 Pickles was rarely out of the news . On January 20 Labour MPs signed a motion calling for his resignation after he gave probation to a man who had sexually assaulted a girl of six . <p> A few months later he jailed a young mother for contempt of court @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accused of assaulting her . The Court of Appeal quashed the decision , but the judge was unapologetic : " The only sentence people really take notice of is loss of liberty . " <p> He also argued that women 's groups should be baying for her blood , not his -- since by refusing to give evidence the young woman was failing the " court of women " . <p> In January 1990 Judge Pickles -- barely a week after being reprimanded by the Appeal Court for his unnecessarily " gladiatorial " conflict with a barrister -- tried a 19-year-old supermarket cashier with a 10-week-old baby for helping shoplifters . " I do n't say you deliberately became pregnant to avoid prison . But I have to consider that others might , " opined the judge before sending mother and baby down for six months . <p> She was later freed on probation after a ruling by Appeal Court judges , headed by Lord Chief Justice Lord Lane , that she should not have been sentenced to youth custody . Pickles 's response was to call an impromptu press @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as " a dinosaur living in the wrong age " -- a remark which led the former Master of the Rolls , Lord Denning , to declare that Pickles should be sacked . <p> When he retired in 1991 Pickles wrote a column for The Sun and later transferred his services to The Daily Sport , in which he described the then transport minister Steve Norris as " the fornicating ferret " and said of a sex offender who asked to be castrated : " Grab him by the balls and shove ' em in a vice .

@@1760236 <p> The gruesome murders carried out by Stephen Griffiths , the so-called " Crossbow Cannibal " , have brought untold heartache to the family and friends of the three women he is known to have killed , dismembered and eaten . But how much worse it must be to discover that Griffiths had been identified as a potential risk who had long harboured desires of becoming a serial killer . Could he have been stopped ? <p> When he was just 17 , Griffiths was given three years ' youth custody for a violent attack on a supermarket manager , whom he slashed with a knife . He was diagnosed as a " sadistic , schizoid psychopath " and later spent time at Rampton high-security hospital , but was not deemed mentally ill . He told probation officers that he saw himself becoming a killer in later life , and a psychiatrist said he displayed a " preoccupation with murder -- particularly multiple murder " . <p> In 1992 , he was given a two-year prison sentence for affray and possession of an offensive weapon after holding a knife to the throat of a young girl for no apparent reason . The following year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in public and given a suspended prison sentence for possessing two air pistols . <p> Here , then , was an obviously disturbed and dangerous individual , who most people will have been horrified to discover was free to carry out his perverted fantasies , with appalling consequences . Could he have been -- should he have been -- locked away in a mental institution ? <p> The question of what to do with people who are socially dangerous but are not , in the strictest sense , mentally ill has been a source of controversy for hundreds of years . In the past , these so-called " moral defectives " were certifiable if they had " strongly vicious or criminal propensities and require care , supervision and control for the protection of others " . A similar definition , by now called a " psychopathic disorder " , was included in the 1959 Mental Health Act and retained in its 1983 successor . <p> However , this Act also required that anyone detained under its provisions -- now known as being sectioned -- had to be treated in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their condition " . But an argument arose over whether these psychopaths were , in the unfortunate phrase , " not bad but mad " . After all , unlike schizophrenics and other mentally ill individuals , whose problems can be improved by drugs and other therapies , their condition could not be alleviated , and was therefore not treatable . <p> This issue entered the political arena in 1998 , with the conviction of Michael Stone for the murders of Lin and Megan Russell in Kent . Stone had a long history of offending and had been diagnosed as having a psychopathic personality disorder . But because psychiatrists did not regard this as treatable , he could not be detained . <p> Ministers in the last government said that Stone should have been in a secure hospital , simply because he was a danger to others , and decided to plug what they saw as an unacceptable loophole in the law . So they set off on a long and tortuous legislative journey to amend the 1983 Act . Their aim was to do away with the treatability provision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who were at liberty could be removed from society , because they might be a risk to others in future . Once identified , these individuals would be assessed by a team of experts and -- if deemed sufficiently dangerous -- would be locked away in a hospital or in a purpose-built institution , possibly for ever . <p> The psychiatric community was appalled . It did not want to act as police officers , judges and jailers to people who might , or might not , commit a crime in future . So , for the next eight years , there was much heated debate : special committees were established , umpteen consultations took place and the proposed Bill was redrafted three times . <p> By the time the new Mental Health Act became law , in 2007 , it had been substantially watered down from the original plans , which critics said were simply unacceptable on civil liberties grounds . The Act removed the old requirement that treatment had to involve making someone better , and brought in a new test under which people with a personality disorder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was available . The aim was to enable psychiatric hospitals to section people previously considered bad , though not mentally ill -- but many experts think that the change from the previous law is marginal . <p> In Griffiths 's case , the decision to keep him in a mental hospital arguably should have been taken in 1991 , when he was first assessed . But the old treatability rules still applied then -- and it is by no means clear that the new ones would have made any difference . He does not appear to have had any recent contact with psychiatrists that might have led to a diagnosis which would have got him locked away . And without one , how can anyone know ? <p> The court was told that since then , Griffiths had displayed no signs of psychotic illness or a treatable mental disorder . He was , in that old-fashioned term , pure evil -- and sadly , we have yet to devise a way of removing that strain from the human psyche . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @

@@1760238 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Internet <p> DATABASES predate the web by decades , yet the efficiency of the Internet 's most popular services is directly related to their performance . NoSQL is looking to take this essential information technology discipline into the Internet age . <p> Given our dependence on databases , it is surprising to see such a fundamental technology remaining relatively unchanged in an industry that has several technology cycles every decade . As Erik Ljungstrom , technical team leader at Dedipower Managed Hosting says , most database administrators have to " hack around problems that were not around 30 years ago " . <p> Ljungstrom made his comment as he promoted NoSQL , a relatively new database system optimised for workloads typically found in serving Internet workloads . The idea of NoSQL was first mooted back in 1998 as a lightweight , open source relational database . It obscures the SQL interface from the user and enforces no database schema , while relationships between data are stored in a separate graph . <p> Although NoSQL fell out of favour in the early 2000s , interest in it was rekindled by hosting providers such as Dedipower , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As the Internet moves from transmitting crumbs of stored data to streaming large chunks of data such as video and pictures , firms are starting to question whether database optimisation is the most efficient way forward . <p> Ljungstrom , keen to emphasise that NoSQL is n't a complete replacement for traditional relational database management systems ( RDMBS ) , says that the technology provides website architects with a viable alternative in certain use cases . That 's not a statement without any real world examples , since firms such as Amazon , Google , Ebay and Facebook already use NoSQL implementations to power customer facing parts of their businesses . <p> Apache 's implementation of NoSQL comes under the guise of Cassandra and has been adopted by many firms including Datasift , the outfit behind Tweetmeme . Datasift has the enviable position of having invented the popular ' Re-tweet ' button that 's found on thousands of websites , and it uses Cassandra to store all its live data . Nick Telford , a system developer at Datasift , said Cassandra offers unseen benefits to small companies aside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cost , good security and agile flexibility . <p> According to Telford , Datasift sets up Cassandra so that it makes use of low level hard drive characteristics , allowing it to get away with purchasing inexpensive hardware . This is one reason why a firm that receives around a third of all Twitter messages sent needs only 15 low-end servers to handle the load . The servers all have just standard consumer grade equipment , including Intel Core 2 Duo processors and two 1TB SATA hard drives . <p> " We have optimised for sequential writes , " said Telford , referring to the fact that as hard drive platter density increases that brings higher sequential performance , something Datasift exploits through a process of internal data compaction . Telford said that Datasift optimises data placement to reduce head seeking , which is a characteristic better served by expensive high RPM enterprise hard disk drives and solid state drives . <p> Telford was proud to say that Datasift is not only able to handle this considerable load but do it " on the cheap " . That might be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inspire many small , up and coming firms to look into NoSQL . <p> As Ljungstrom said at the start of his talk , NoSQL is n't a magic bullet . The document store is not particularly good for searching and Telford claims that Datasift 's testing has found unoptimised data reads can have a latency of around 100ms while write times are as low as 0.1ms . Telford proposes data caching to improve read performance . <p> Read performance issues aside , Telford admits that Datasift uses Sun 's MySQL RDBMS internally in situations " where you need guaranteed data consistency , ad-hoc queries and relational data " . It 's a line that does n't inspire total confidence in Cassandra , however when presented with Datasift 's track record of uptime along with performance and cost benefits , it 's hard to argue against NoSQL and Cassandra . <p> While Ljungstrom claims NoSQL " often has built in resilience " , Telford detailed Datasift 's replication strategy . Of its 15 servers , data is replicated on three and , talking exclusively to The INQUIRER , Telford said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of servers grows , with a directly proportional growth in its replication ratio with the number of servers deployed . <p> Aside from resilience , consistency is likely to be NoSQL 's Achilles heel . Some implementations of NoSQL offer ACID guarantees while others do n't , and that uncertainly will need to be cleared up for big businesses to seriously consider the adoption of NoSQL . <p> NoSQL , like many database systems before it , is n't a magical solution for all data serving and management needs , however evidence presented by Dedipower and Datasift show NoSQL to be an effective alternative to traditional RDBMS in certain uses . <p> It 's unlikely that IBM and Oracle will be concerned about NoSQL implementations taking away business from DB2 and Oracle DB just yet , because while newer , smaller firms are happy to embrace new technology , older firms that are heavily invested in an RDBMS are unlikely to ditch or even supplement their existing systems with alternatives all that easily . <p> As Chris Miller , CEO of Dedipower said , " NoSQL is not the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What NoSQL shows , however , is that traditional software and database system architectures designed decades ago might not always be the best solutions for all present and future needs .

" <p> But unlikely as it sounds , Miss Zhang is part of a huge and growing number of like-minded Chinese who were celebrating the story of Christ 's birth on December 25 . Up to 100 million are now practising Christians - possibly a higher proportion of the country 's 1.3 billion people than in Britain - and they outnumber the 76 million members of the Chinese Communist Party ( CCP ) . <p> While Christmas in Beijing and other major Chinese cities is regarded by many people as just an excuse to go shopping , it is also the time whenChina 's Christians are most visible . In Beijing , the official government-run churches were as packed as the unofficial ones . Outside the south cathedral , the capital 's largest and oldest Catholic church , the queue of people hoping to attend midnight mass stretched for more than 400 yards . <p> Ushers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kuaile ! " , the Chinese for " Happy Christmas " , as 1,500 people crammed into the pews for the mass which was led by the Bishop of Beijing , Li Shan . Hundreds more watched the service on two giant television screens outside the cathedral , singing along to carols including Silent Night . <p> Yet most Chinese Christians , like Miss Zhang , prefer to worship in illegal " house churches " . It is a brave choice in a country where the authorities remain deeply suspicious of organised religion , and especially Christianity . <p> " Buddhism and Islam are n't regarded as Western religions , so the CCP is more opposed to Christianity , " said Cao Zhi , a Christian who works for the World and China Institute , an independent Beijing-based group that provides legal aid to Chinese Christians . <p> " The party do n't really know anything about Christianity , but they regard it as a Western ideology and so they are opposed to it . " <p> The Chinese constitution officially guarantees religious freedom but in an effort to monitor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Protestant , are required to attend state-controlled churches - a stricture ignored by those who meet instead in flats , anonymous office blocks , university dormitories and even the private rooms of restaurants . <p> The authorities are increasingly clamping down on their activities , fearing they could be used to organise opposition to the communist party 's rule . <p> Last year , a house church network with 50,000 members in Linfen in northern Shanxi Province was shut down and its leaders imprisoned . In the last three months , house churches in three other provinces have been closed , while in October 200 members of house churches were prevented from travelling to Switzerland to attend the 3rd World Congress on Evangelisation , one of the biggest worldwide gatherings of Protestants . <p> " There 's always conflict , " said Li Baiguang , an activist lawyer who was one of three Chinese Christians invited to the White House in 2006 by former President George W Bush . " Sometimes , the police just take away the furniture from the house churches to try and stop people gathering in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or pastors , saying it 's an illegal gathering . " <p> Mr Li won a national endowment for democracy award in 2008 for his work defending Christians who have been arrested for practising their religion . <p> He is convinced the crackdown on Christians is intensifying . " In the last four years I 've been involved in many cases involving house churches . Ninety per cent of the people I defend get convicted , " he said . <p> " The courts will nearly always support the authorities . Priests and house church leaders are getting arrested more frequently . The government feels threatened by them and is afraid of their power . " <p> Yet the number of Christians continues to grow . Jin Tianming , the pastor of the house church which Miss Zhang attends , said : " When we started in 1993 there were just 10 of us . Now , we have more than 1,000 members and 10 full-time staff . Every Sunday there are around 30 newcomers . " <p> With room for only 300 worshippers in the room near the Beijing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hold three services on Sundays to accommodate everyone who wants to come . <p> He believes China 's huge transformation over the last three decades has fuelled Christianity 's growth . " Things have changed so much and so quickly that people need faith , " he said . " Before they believed in communism , now they need something else . And while the changes have given people the opportunity to make money , they have also introduced more pressure into peoples lives . " <p> When The Sunday Telegraph attended the church , worshippers mostly under the age of 40 occupied every seat and stood lining the walls , many clutching Bibles and prayer books in both Chinese and English . <p> Prayers ended with loud shouts in English of " Hallelujah " and " Amen " . Some stood with their hands above their heads , palms held upwards , praying for the holy spirit to enter them . <p> Mr Jin preached on the persecution early Christians faced . It was an apt sermon , given the troubles his church has faced . " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . <p> " At first , when we met in residential apartments , the police would find out and we 'd have to move . Since 2005 , we 've met in office buildings but we keep being forced to move because the local authorities put pressure on the landlords . Last year , we were evicted in November and had to pray outside in a park in the snow . " <p> Christians began to go underground soon after the communist takeover in 1949 , even though Christianity in China dates back to the seventh century . <p> Beijing severed diplomatic ties with the Vatican in 1951 and ordered Catholics to join a state-run Catholic patriotic association , which does not recognise the primacy of the pope . An official Chinese Protestant church was also set up . <p> Those Catholics who remained loyal to Rome were forced to worship in secret , and many of the far more numerous Protestants followed suit . <p> New Christians are particularly drawn to the fervent , evangelical Christianity of the Protestant house churches , which has spread from nearby South @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Korean missionaries have been active in China since the early 1980s while posing as ordinary businessmen and women . <p> According to the government 's own figures around 28 million people are members of the official churches , meaning that up to 72 million worship in secret . <p> " I feel the pastors in the official churches are controlled by the government and I have more freedom to worship in a house church , " said Mr Li . " Most Christians in China feel the same . " <p> Those who attend the house churches are almost all loyal to the government , but resent its interference in their religious activities . " People who go to house churches believe politics should n't have a part in religion . Last year it was the 60th anniversary of the founding of the new China , and the official churches had to hold services of celebration , " said Mr Cao . " That would never happen in a house church . " <p> Equally worrying for the CCP is the spread of Christianity 's appeal from the poverty-stricken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young , university-educated residents of China 's fast-swelling cities - the very people from whom the party traditionally recruits . <p> Chen Yan , 23 , a trainee manager at a software company who attends Mr Jin 's church , said this was partly because of the stress of modern life , with pressure to get into a good university and then a job . " But I also think young people are thinking more about the meaning of life and not just about getting ahead , " she said . " When I started coming to church , I felt less troubled . I felt God was giving me the confidence to face life . " Most Chinese Christians are introduced to religion by friends or family . <p> Public advocacy of Christianity remains almost impossible . " There 's no way you could stand on the street giving out leaflets telling people to read the Bible , " said Mr Li . " That would be very dangerous .
