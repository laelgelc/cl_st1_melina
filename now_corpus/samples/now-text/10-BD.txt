@@4513233 <h> Reducing remittance costs <p> A.N.M. Nurul Haque <p> IT is really a cause for serious concern that some global remittance operators and banks are exacting a big amount of money from the Bangladeshis working abroad by charging high fees for transferring their hard-earned money to their families at home , and the amount money thus paid in 2009 would be no less than $1 billion . <p> According to a finance ministry report , Western Union , Money Gram and Citi Bank --global leaders in the money transfer market -- charge fees ranging between 8.3 percent and 13 percent from the expatriate Bangladeshis for remittance transfer , which is significantly high for impoverished Bangladesh that is heavily dependent on migrant workers ' remittance for meeting its balance of payment needs . <p> The finance ministry report on " Cost of Remittance Transfer " revealed that Western Union , Money Gram and Citi Bank charged $40 , $25 and $30 respectively for transferring $300 from the US and other remittance generating countries -- especially from the oil-rich Middle East countries -- which is quite exorbitant . <p> Bangladesh received around $10 billion in 2009 from its 6.3 million migrant workers , posting a strong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years . According to a Bangladesh Bank estimate , only 57 percent of annual remittance flow into the country comes through an official channel , as the high charges force many migrant workers to use informal channels to send remittances , which remain excluded from the national account . <p> Expatriate welfare Minister Khondker Mosharraf Hossain , is on record saying that World Bank would support Bangladesh 's effort to introduce remittance transfer through mobile phones in order to make the delivery faster and cheaper . The WB has agreed to provide financial and technical support for installing the system , under which the recipient will be notified by SMS and then will punch the code he gets on his SMS into a specially designed Automated Teller Machine ( ATM ) to withdraw the cash . This system will help whittle down the remittance transfer cost significantly , making it as low as one percent of the principal amount . <p> We may learn a lesson from the Philippines , a major remittance receiving country , which received $17.3 billion in 2009 and developed a faster and cheaper system of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provider , with its remittance network partner Bank of Philippine Islands , has introduced the Express Send system . <p> Under this system a customer can send up to $3,000 a day for $5 , and the recipients can get their money easily from more than 800 branches and 1,500 ATMs throughout the Philippines . Wells Fargo waived remittance fees temporarily to show sympathy for and share the plight of the victims of the Typhoon Ketsana , which hit the Philippines last year . It also donated $100,000 to the US Red Cross for relief efforts . <p> Smart Communications , the largest mobile phone operator in the Philippines , has developed an innovative remittance system based on mobile phones and text message . In the Philippines , at least 30 percent of the 84 million Filipinos own mobile phones . <p> Smart Communications recognised the opportunity to build a remittance product based on text messaging . The remitted funds can be withdrawn from an ATM using the Smart Money as cash card .

The senders can enter a bank 's website to register for the service and then send money to their families at home , instead of going to the bank . The Vietinbank eRemit allows customers to send money anywhere at any time . When the senders complete the registration process , Vietinbank will automatically send an email to inform the recipients , who can use their identity cards at the bank 's branches to pick up their money . <p> Vietinbank has also worked with various foreign partners to establish channels for transferring remittances , especially in countries that have a large number of overseas Vietnamese , such as Taiwan , Malaysia , the Republic of Korea , Middle East , US and Australia .

The biggest players in the remittance markets are traditionally companies that specialise in remittances , as opposed to banks that offer remittances as one of many products in their portfolio . <p> Apart from very large remittance corridors like the US to Mexico , and the UK or the US to India , most have just a few remittance service providers . So the market conditions mostly resemble oligopolistic conditions , where the remittance service providers charge high prices .

There is cognisance and unanimity within Bangladesh , irrespective of political affiliation , that the incidence , scope , and intensity of extreme weather events will increase and that this is bound to affect this riverine country in various sectors , particularly to the prospects of submergence , salinity intrusion and destabilisation and aggravation of fluctuation of river flow across seasons . <p> At the same time , despite disappointment over the 15th COP held in Copenhagen in December 2009 , optimism is again being expressed about the possibility of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the 16th COP to be held in Mexico in 2010 . <p> Bangladesh has taken some steps towards adaptation to climate change and has already allocated the equivalent of $100 million from its own resources to deal with emergencies .

They have also suggested that pollution is often the negative externality of private consumption , and one way of internalising this externality is to switch from private to social or collective consumption . I agree with them that this might create a lighter ecological footprint due to lower levels of material consumption . <p> A good idea , the practicality of this is however largely untested in Bangladesh and will depend largely on facilitating overall socio-cultural transformation .

Nevertheless , industrial units have continued to be irresponsible in this regard . <p> Time has now come for zero tolerance in this regard . Those responsible for monitoring industrial enterprises must ensure strict compliance , if necessary through the precept of a " neighbourhood watch scheme .

Shahe Alam <p> In Bangladesh , modern rice varieties ( MVs ) were introduced for the boro and aus seasons during the mid ' 60s and for the transplant aman season in the ' 70s . Rice is grown in three seasons . Out of 10.84 million hectares under rice production in Bangladesh , modern boro rice alone covers about 4.70 million hectares , of which nearly 98% area is under irrigation facilities of various kinds . <p> Available statistics indicate that roughly 70% of the MV boro area falls under diesel operated irrigation schemes ( run by DTW , STWs and LLP etc. ) and about 30% area falls under the less expensive power operated irrigation tools . Nevertheless , adequate irrigation and timely application of fertilisers are the key inputs for the input intensive modern boro rice production . <p> Irrigation alone determines the substantial variation in the adoption of modern varieties in boro season . As such , irrigation is considered as the leading input for desired adoption of high yielding modern rice varieties .

On the other hand , among different inputs , cost of irrigation has risen by more than 20% , followed by fertiliser ( about 18% ) , because of the price increase of these items both in the national and the international markets . <p> However , in order to keep pace with growing demand for food emanating from population growth , rice production has to be increased at the desired rate . The government is also trying to take initiatives like offering input subsidy almost every year with a view to ensuring proper supply and utilisation of these inputs . During 2005-06 period , the government allocated Tk.1,200 crore as subsidy on different inputs ( fertiliser , electricity etc. ) in order to maintain a conducive production environment . <p> It is , therefore , imperative that farmers should derive benefits out of the given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the country , the costs of fertiliser and irrigation are expected to be more or less similar in all areas , and farmers should be able to harness the benefit from the subsidy program . During the boro season of 2009-10 , the government introduced input subsidy card for the farmers in order to provide cash subsidy on diesel , and as much as 10 million farmers were brought under this program . <p> Available research findings showed that mainly marginal and small farmers benefited out of the program while the benefit derived by others ( e.g. medium and large farms ) was a bit less due to high cost of irrigation ( Ref : Unnayan Onnesha , 2010 ) . However , it is widely known from different reports that irrigation price varies from location to location and the modes of payment of irrigation are also different . In fact , due to the differences in mode of payment the cost of irrigation also varies substantially . <p> Moreover , farmers sometimes had to face shortage of fertilizers , specially urea , during winter-boro season . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pricing , because the input ( irrigation and fertiliser ) pricing mechanisms vary in different regions . <p> The cost of irrigation for diesel-operated machines always remains quite high under all the prevailing payment systems . Due to volatility in the world market , there has been instability in the prices of inputs , specially of fuel and fertilisers . The increase in diesel price appears to be the main factor for high cost of irrigation . Power shortage along with low voltage causes severe disruption in running power-operated irrigation machines , which eventually leads to crop failure in many cases . <p> There has also been high variation in fertiliser prices at different locations , particularly in some border areas ( e.g. Satkhira , Khulna , Lalmonirhat , Sylhet etc ) . Due to the long distance from the central input supply point , the carrying cost of fertiliser is usually added to its price , leading to a rise in per unit price .

Right people are also not being posted to right places in the bureaucracy , and that ultimately making it inefficient , the report added . <p> IGS Chief of Programme Christina Rozario said the government has a number of social safety net programmes , but the ultra poor people often do not get the benefit of those .

There is a serious lack of regulation to protect migrant workers who contribute to the national economy immensely , it said . <h> Comments <p> This nation is passing through a very difficult time . This is reinforced when people like Justice Rahman speaks out . Partisan views , harassment to people by ridiculous charges , name calling , labeling people for unscrupulous intent and politicization of the administration are few elements that this AL government is practicing at an alarming rate . <p> Election is a process of choosing a political party and a government , but it never guarantees that a democratically elected government will remain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a political party captures more than majority seats in the parliament ( say , two-thirds ) , it tends to degenerate into autocracy or any other bad form of government .

But before they could be formed , Bangabandhu was assassinated on August 15 , 1975 , and a military rule ensued . <p> Till 1990 , the military strongmen ran the country either directly or indirectly . They used the local government system to gain political base at the grassroots level . <p> After restoration of democracy in 1991 , the twelfth amendment revived the provisions on local government that had been deleted in 1975 . <p> It also brought back articles 59 and 60 . Article 59 says , ? Local government in every administrative unit of the republic shall be entrusted to bodies composed of persons elected in accordance with law. ? <p> Besides , it adds , parliament shall prescribe the functions of the local government bodies . <p> Those functions may cover administration and work of public offices , maintenance of public order and preparation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ local government mark out Bangladesh 's constitution from those in other countries . No constitution contains such definitive provisions on local government , Justice Mustafa Kamal observed in Kudrat-e-Elahi and others vs Bangladesh case in 1992 . <p> Justice Kamal , who later became chief justice , also said local government is part of the constitutional system ; it is not mere adornment . So , articles 59 and 60 can not be left to lie dead . <p> In a landmark verdict on the case of Kudrat-e-Elahi and others vs Bangladesh , the then chief justice Shahabuddin Ahmed said local government is an integral part of the democratic polity . <p> ? The system of local government institutions may be altered , re-organised or re-structured , and their powers and functions may be enlarged or curtailed by act of parliament , but the system as a whole can not be abolished , ? he asserted . <p> About the significance of the local government provisions , former attorney general Mahmudul Islam in his book ? Constitutional Law of Bangladesh ? said the idea is that the central government should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Administration at district and lower levels should mostly be left to the local government bodies . <p> The reality , however , is quite the opposite . The government has all local administrative tasks done by bureaucrats and in some cases lawmakers . <p> Successive governments since independence had moved to reform the local government system . But as most of those reforms were politically motivated , they failed to strengthen the local government bodies . <p> ? So , despite a long historical existence , local government institutions in Bangladesh could not really take root , ? observed a study by Bangladesh Academy for Rural Development , an autonomous institution for training , research and experiment on rural development . <p> LOCAL GOVERNMENTS : PAST AND PRESENT <p> After revisions of its structure by different governments , the local government system now has three tiers--union parishad , upazila parishad and zila parishad . <p> Besides , there are municipalities and city corporations for urban areas . All are considered administrative units in line with the constitutional provisions . <p> In 1976 , General Ziaur Rahman promulgated a local government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Though the ordinance said the parishads shall be composed of elected representatives for a five-year term , no elections have yet been held . <p> Instead , deputy commissioners were appointed ex-officio chairmen of the parishads . <p> Two years after promulgation of the ordinance , the country 's first military ruler amended the constitution through a martial law proclamation to bring back the provision requiring the government to promote local government institutions . <p> Grabbing state power in 1982 , General HM Ershad introduced upazila parishads . <p> During his rule , he promulgated an ordinance and five acts including the zila parishad act of 1988 . Each thana was upgraded to upazila and designated as focal point of administration with responsibility for all local development activities . <p> The central government retained the authority to oversee regulatory functions and major development activities of national and regional importance . <p> Ershad regime held two upazila elections--one in 1985 and the other in 1990 . <p> Zila parishads constituted under the act of 1988 worked up to 1990 . <p> With the downfall of Ershad , the zila parishad chairmen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Party , were removed and DCs returned as ex-officio chairmen . <p> The BNP-led government also abolished the upazila system shortly after coming to power in 1991 . <p> Things did not improve even after reintroduction of the constitutional provisions on local government in 1991 . The zila parishads continued functioning under the act of 1988 during the BNP rule between 1991 and 1996 . <p> In 2000 , the AL-led government repealed the zila parishad act of 1988 and framed a new law providing for direct election to the parishads . But up till now , no election has been held , allowing the bureaucrats to run the parishads . <p> In 1998 , the AL-led government reinstated the upazila system . But over 12 more years were needed to hold elections . <p> Upazila polls were finally held in January last year , but the elected representatives have not yet been able to do much due to opposition from local administration and interference from the lawmakers who are advisers to the parishads . <p> ? We are kind of left to rot . We have little to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help of the MPs , ? Ataur Rahman Ata , chairman of Manikganj sadar upazila , told The Daily Star recently . <p> Though elections to union parishads , the lowest tier of local government , were held almost regularly since independence , no major reforms have been made to strengthen them . <p> The present union parishads are facing a legitimacy crisis , as two years have passed since expiry of their tenure . <p> The last union parishad elections were held between January 25 and March 16 in 2003 . The next elections were supposed to be held in early 2008 , but that could not happen as the country was under a state of emergency and there was no union parishad act . <h> Share on <p> In spite of the importance and potential of local government institutions , they remain weak and are increasingly becoming weaker .

Except for the City Corporation , both the Paurashava and the Union Parishad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ centralized system , the local government bodies are deprived of functions , functionaries , finances and freedom ( the four Fs ) .

Our Union Parisad ( UP ) should be re-organised and real administrative power should be given at this grassroots level . Each UP should have an elected body with an independent administrative unit to execute the decisions at local level . UP members should have a reasonable salary . The executive branch of the UP should be independent but only to carry out or execute the UPs decision . UP shall be responsible for primary and middle school education , healthcare , law and order , housing , care for the destitute , employment of union every able-bodied person ( men or women ) and in short , UP should do everything that goes with the welfare of its inhabitants .

Rule of law and an effective , corruption free administration can be established by giving power to micro-level . A UP member and the chairman are local leaders , everybody knows them and these leaders also know well who their followers are . Thus , crime levels would fall sharply in the villages , unnecessary litigation organised by the local leaders in most cases to the full benefit of some touts called advocates in the district headquarters would be settled by the UP .

In all developed countries in the world local government is the all powerful unit and their development and prosperity are due to strong local government . <p> Local government is deemed to be the base of a democratic system . If democracy is not being practiced at the root level than how would it take root in the country ? We have to keep in mind that the country 's overall development and establishment of rule of law are directly tied to proper functioning of local government institutions . Any government truly committed to the countrys development must tread the path that leads to strengthening the local government . Without practicing true democracy in selecting their leaders , political parties will not have the necessary base to promote strengthening of local government system .
