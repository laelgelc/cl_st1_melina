@@16370236 <h> Capital punishment and justice <p> Opponents of capital punishment often put forward the proposition that it does n't deter murder . That proposition is unprovable . But more than that , it disregards the reason for capital punishment persisting throughout history : the need for retributive justice . <p> Inasmuch as a concern to prevent crime is noble , it being the reason for not executing murderers minimises the gravity of murder ; and it denies the survivors of victims the psychic satisfaction that condign punishment has been suffered for their loss . To me , that is n't justice . <p> So what is justice ? Russel Kirk , writing for the Heritage Foundation in 1993 , gave this as the classical definition of justice : " The classical definition , which comes to us through Plato , Aristotle , Saint Ambrose , and Saint Augustine of Hippo , is expressed in a single phrase : suum cuique , or to each his own . " <p> As this is put in Justinian 's Corpus Juris Civilis , " Justice is a habit whereby a man renders to each one his due with constant and perpetual will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This means that justice must be constant , being ' a habit ' ; and it is about punishing the offender , not deterring crime or rehabilitating the offender . That kind of justice is obvious and retributive . It validates the enduring maxim from Chief Justice Lord Hewart that , " It is not merely of some importance , but of fundamental importance that justice should not only be done , but should be manifestly and undoubtedly seen to be done . " <h> DETERRING CRIME <p> Those who insist that executing a man for murder does n't deter other men from committing murder , because murders continue despite executions , should tell us why we should punish people for any crime . For crimes continue despite punishment . People are punished every day for theft , child abuse , and a host of other crimes , yet other people continue to do them , well knowing of the punishment . <p> To argue that the death penalty does n't deter murder , and insist on giving life sentence instead , implies that life sentence is a deterrent ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sentence is a deterrent in the view of those who oppose execution on the ground that it is n't a deterrent why do n't we just catch a bunch of people and lock them up for life , to prevent murder ? <p> C.S. Lewis , British thinker and apologist , said of the deterrence argument : " If deterrence is all that matters , the execution of an innocent man , provided the public think him guilty , would be fully justified . " <p> Another argument against the death penalty is that it is cruel and unusual punishment . That is , it is too severe for a human being . But is it cruel and unusual for a man who has taken the life of another human being , in a most brutal fashion , as is murder , to be given the same or equivalent treatment he gave to his victim ? <h> MERCIFUL PUNISHMENT <p> I believe there is an element of mercy in the application of the death penalty , especially today in the Western world .

Lethal injection and electrocution are clean and efficient methods : the convict gets his dessert in minutes , not suffering the agonising ordeal to which he subjected his victim or victims . <p> And a man who knows he will be executed at a set time has the opportunity to make things right between himself and his Maker before his execution . In light of this , execution could be an instant passage into eternal bliss . <p> Contrast that with having a man in prison for life , sometimes for decades , in the most inhuman conditions , where he is denied contact with the outside world . That is cruel and unusual punishment . <p> Finally , to those who insist that DNA has shown that sometimes innocent people have been executed , I say that since DNA is so precise , it means the chance of executing an innocent person , where DNA evidence is available , is almost nil .

In fact , many women like Jackson have defied the odds to give birth well past the age when medical professionals have said women should not . <p> Their reasons range from using their prime childbearing years to focus on their careers , lack of stability in their youth , or an inability to find a partner .

I wrote a piece on the interview with her . What also came out of that interaction was a conversation I had with someone else who told me he was on the scene at the shooting of Moore and his two friends , and was shot in the finger during the execution but miraculously escaped . <p> " All a wi dey pon di scene at Black Roses when di three man dem come up wid dem gun .

@@17243237 <h> Daniel Thwaites Kartel mash up society ? <p> Anyone who has bothered to pay the slightest attention to Vybz Kartel 's prodigious output has long been aware that he 's a sociopath . Kid not thyself : He is n't celebrated in spite of his sociopathy , but because of it . <p> Antisocial attitudes are held in high esteem in many quarters . Nor should it come as a jaw-dropping surprise that the most committed fans of a sociopath get unhinged relatively quickly and will say and write vicious things in his defence . <p> Having made that observation while counting myself among Kartel 's ( less-ardent ) fans , I suppose I have some explaining to do . For it would seem that I am guilty of an elemental hypocrisy , enjoying something which probably is n't that good for me or anyone else . <p> My only weak excuse is the self-evident truth that most enjoyable things are n't that good for you , and the things that are good for you do n't tend to be very enjoyable . <p> And then let 's not be too harsh about a little low-level hypocrisy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the homage vice renders to virtue . " <p> The danger , it appears , is when people forget that something is a vice , and then try to convince themselves it 's not one , maybe even good . This , however , is a general malady afflicting so much around us : the renaming and rebranding of stupidity and evil . It 's sort of like the people who tell you that drinking rum is just great for your health . <p> Anyway , being a fan of Lisa and Kartel , you can imagine the distress of the last couple weeks . But from a while back , I could tell that Lisa was heading into uncharted territory by publicly noting the dilapidation of our pop culture . In fact , an anecdote she shared even before the whole Kartel flare-up ( It 's Time to Get Real ) is quite unforgettable : <p> " I no longer have children dance competitions in my constituency as any part of fun day activities that I have as MP . Why ? Because I remember having to take a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other three little girls dropped to the floor in splits ... . " <h> SHOCKING KIDDIE TALENT SHOWS <p> I know of another MP who attended a school where the ' talent show ' featured clear-eyed innocents only about five or six years old , dressed up in tights gyrating aggressively to the lyrics , " I want a man fi dismankle mi ! " <p> Now remember , we were trying to have a civilisation here . But I find these stories darkly humorous because they force us to confront the idea that perhaps we 've actually abandoned that difficult enterprise , even though we may not yet be quite ready to admit it . <p> As a general point , of course , there 's no question that Lisa is in the right to point to our society 's incipient madness of feeding the children offal but expecting them to produce diamonds . As if life is n't tough enough already , and self-discipline is n't already difficult , we burden them by valorising antisocial attitudes and behaviours , then expect them to do the opposite to find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Lisa merely questioned how Kartel seems to be constantly releasing new music despite his supposed incapacitation . She also wondered aloud whether we should be debating the question of banning the music of convicts . The major point seemed to be the porousness of the prison system . <p> Predictably , the social-media response was swift , intense , and vicious . Say what you will , but our people 's talent for invective , however deformed in choosing its targets , is as sharp as ever . The overwhelming number of outraged respondents , from what I could discern behind the rape threats and so on , were incensed that a politician would put another ding in their suffering idol . As in the conflict in the original Middle East Gaza , this conflict was about a woefully small bit of territory , and seasoned liberally with misinformation and misunderstanding , but all the more vicious because of that . <p> By the way , I would n't want to see Kartel 's music banned from airplay , and I would oppose any such blanket prohibition on convicts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he should be recording while incarcerated . If that 's happening , as seems evident , those responsible should face the music . <h> JAILBIRD ARTISTES <p> Since history should always inform us , consider the great artistes who were jailbirds at one time or another . It 's an impressive list . And we 're not talking about throwaway talents either : Billie Holliday , James Brown , Ronald Isley , Leadbelly , Rick James , and mucho importante , let 's not forget Ol ' Dirty Bastard of the Wu Tang . Nor do we have to look abroad . Some of our very greatest spent time in the can : Toots was incarcerated , and Don Drummond . In the final analysis , we do n't know if Kartel is someone with the usual mixture of good and evil who did something really awful , or a completely psychotic murderer . <p> Of course , in light of the conviction , you view everything that he puts out a little differently , the way every movie by Woody Allen looks slightly different once he ' convicted himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you might hear certain florid threats and descriptions of murderous activity and think : " This cat is the real deal ! He was n't joking around , and he probably was n't being metaphorical like they argue up at the university . " <p> On another point , I actually believe Vybz should be allowed to continue creating . Only thing is that the majority of the profits ought to be confiscated for the support and maintenance of his victim 's family . That way , everyone wins : Lizard 's family will have sustenance , the artiste will have self-expression , and , best of all , we the public can continue to , aaahhhhmmm , back it up like dumpa truck

The difference between us and the US is this : The United States will not sit idly by and allow its citizens to be preyed upon and exploited . They expect to prepare 300 more indictments in the near future . Jamaica , on the other hand , has demonstrated that it is weak in its attempt at reining in criminals , whether they are white-collar offenders who ravage people via Ponzi schemes , or they are heavily armed street gangs . <p> The extraditions and the pending requests offer important lessons scammers would be foolish to ignore . We see the reported cowering of scammers not so much as a victory for bilateral cooperation , but an indictment of the tepid response of the Jamaican justice system .

That error triggered the involvement of a prosecutorial apparatus and justice system that , however many its considerable flaws , seems geared towards protecting the public from outright shysters . <h> THE INJUSTICE SYSTEM <p> However , the Jamaican injustice system has made it very clear that the jurisdiction is a safe haven for bandits . <p> Well , I should add nuance . Although farmers are at the mercy of praedial thieves , and although you 've put yourself in considerable danger if you own a fruitful mango tree , the system does seem to occasionally and haphazardly rouse itself into denunciatory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sheer arbitrariness of it can astonish , and that 's why it is now a commonplace to contrast the ackee thief who got no mercy to the billion-dollar swindlers who get nothing but . <p> By and by , the picture of Mr Hill taking off as a free man from the court precincts in a mere taxi was another piece of his marketing genius . A less accomplished impresario would have been whisked away in one of those new Porches or a Range , and had he done that , one could be reasonably certain that Crash Plus was gone for good .

@@18678236 <h> Carolyn Cooper Taking liberties with Marcus Garvey <p> Jamaican art critics can be very intolerant . Not just the professionals who arrogantly expect us to take as gospel their point of view . It 's also the amateurs who depend on the evidence of our own eyes to pass judgment about the value of art . Especially when it 's about public figures ! <p> I remember the controversy over Christopher Gonzalez 's inventive sculpture of Bob Marley that the Government commissioned in 1981 . Born in Kingston , Gonzalez was living in Atlanta . David Boxer , then chief curator at the National Gallery , was sent to check on the progress of the work . He immediately ' sighted ' problems . <p> Bob was growing out of a tree root . Like a merman , the singer had no feet . Worst of all , the face looked nothing like Marley 's . When the sculpture arrived in Jamaica , angry reviewers comprehensively dissed it . They authoritatively declared , " Dat a no Bob . " The statue was a brilliant evocation of the spirit of Marley . But that 's not what the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cedella Booker and Rita Marley insisted that the image was inappropriate . Edward Seaga , then prime minister , agreed . Alvin Marriott was commissioned to do a realistic sculpture , which stands ( on feet ) across from the National Stadium . <p> Gonzalez 's sculpture is now rooted at Island Village in Ocho Rios after languishing for many years in the National Gallery . It should be transplanted to The Edna Manley College of the Visual and Performing Arts . There it would inspire students to " be bright and out of order " - as a clever sign on the college campus advocates . <h> DEADLY REVIEWS <p> Two Fridays ago , a bust of Marcus Garvey , made by the renowned sculptor Raymond Watson , was unveiled at the University of the West Indies ( UWI ) , Mona . The swift response of the amateur art critics was uncompromising : " Dat a no Marcus Garvey . " Some of the reviews I 've heard are deadly : " Im look like im have cancer " ; " It look like bees sting im pon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " . <p> A Gleaner article by Paul Williams , published last Wednesday , records more responses : " ' Tek it dung , ' one woman said calmly . ' That statue does not represent Marcus Garvey - that 's a fraud , ' pronounced an elderly Rasta , donning the colours of the Universal Negro Improvement Association ( UNIA ) . With photos of Garvey , and sometimes using expletives , he ranted until way after the formalities were over . " <p> Edward Seaga , a former distinguished fellow in the School for Graduate Studies and Research at the UWI , could have given valuable advice about the politics of commissioning public monuments . A student of anthropology , Seaga fully understands the power of symbols . He knows that Garvey is the embodiment of Black Power , not just for Rastafari but also for the black majority . <p> As minister of finance , Seaga played a leading role in bringing home Garvey 's remains from the UK in November 1964 . That was an eloquent political statement . Seaga was also instrumental in ensuring that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1969 . I 'm sure Seaga would empathise with those critics who are distressed by Raymond Watson 's representation of Garvey . <h> MOTHER MARIAMNE SAMAD <p> The worst thing about the image is not that it does n't look like Garvey . Most of us have n't seen Garvey in the flesh . Mother Mariamne Samad , who is 94 , is the only person at the ceremony who actually met Garvey . She was five years old and she remembers being at the corner of 132nd Street and 5th Avenue in Harlem when Garvey briefly spoke to her . <p> Our images of Garvey have been mostly defined by photographs . We trust that they are accurate . But long before Instagram filtering , photos have been touched up , often to remove melanin .

His posture conveys passivity . He looks like a weakling . Who approved this diminished portrayal ? <p> The bust should be replaced with an image that inspires unequivocal admiration of Garvey 's accomplishments as an illustrious pan-Africanist rallying the black world to affirm pride in race . Perhaps the CHASE Fund could support the commissioning of a new sculpture for UWI . And Watson 's could be donated to Liberty Hall : The Legacy of Marcus Garvey . It would take its rightful place among the many images of Garvey archived there . <p> Under the visionary leadership of Dr Donna McFarlane , director/curator of Liberty Hall , the interactive museum has recently been redesigned by the brilliant creative team , Art on The Loose , based in Chicago . Marcus Garvey 's life story is told in inspiring words , sounds and images . It 's a completely engaging multimedia experience . <p> The best thing about the UWI monument is the Garvey quotation inscribed on its base : " What I write @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , my writing lives on ; therefore , what you do or write must be so clear as to live on when you are gone , that others who may read it might get a clear conception of what you mean .

What Jamaica does later this week at a meeting of foreign ministers of the Organization of American States ( OAS ) will indicate how deeply this holds . <p> While the current iteration of Venezuela 's situation , with its daily demonstrations and increasing death toll , is months old , it 's really a problem nearly two decades old , since the 1999 election of the late Hugo Ch*vez as president and his efforts to place the country on a socialist path .

Nor does he have the oil income to shore up a badly faltering economy . <p> And , as the results of the December 2015 legislative election when the Opposition won 64 per cent of the seats in the assembly , indicate , Mr Maduro 's socialists no longer enjoy majority support in the country . But that does not mean they are without a substantial support or that Mr Maduro still heads the constitutionally elected government . <h> VICTIM OF DESTABILISATION <p> The Opposition wants to change the latter , insisting on presidential elections before they are due in 2018 , and accuses the government of frustrating its efforts of gaining the required signatures to force a recall referendum . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the use of the courts to stymie the work of the legislature .

We have , in the past , suggested that they might learn lessons from Jamaica 's reform efforts . But from this distance , it seems to us that neither side is totally innocent of the accusations levelled against it . <p> Indeed , we have previously suggested to Jamaica and others in CARICOM , who have long-standing friendly relations with Venezuela and have benefited from its PetroCaribe oil facility , to talk frankly with President Maduro about their concerns and to offer the Community 's good offices in mediating an internal dialogue .

And we take our cue from Prime Minister Andrew Holness ' recent letter on the issue to his Vincentian counterpart , Ralph Gonsalves , disagreeing with this week 's meeting . Mr Holness said : " CARICOM should maintain a unified position , reaffirming that Venezuela should engage with its own national stakeholders through an inclusive and mediated national dialogue to resolve its domestic challenges .

How are they related ? What does sex work have to do with marital rape ? <p> I could answer that they are together because they are both topical issues on the legislative agenda at this time . They both predominantly affect women , and bodily autonomy is at the centre of both . I , however , want to focus on the last of the three . <p> The Jamaica AIDS Support for Life , in its submissions to the joint select committee of Parliament reviewing the sexual offences and related acts , proposed that sex work be decriminalised and marital rape exemptions be removed from the act . <p> The proposal to decriminalise sex work is made on the premise that the law , as it stands , has devastating effects on not only the sex workers themselves , but their children , the elderly , other family members and friends of sex workers , health-care workers and service providers . This is so because , besides the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offence to " knowingly live off the earnings of prostitution " and " be habitually found in the company of a prostitute " ( Sexual Offences Act , S 23 ) . <p> This means that the children of sex workers who are afforded an education from the proceeds are criminalised , the elderly parents of sex workers who are maintained from the proceeds are criminalised , and health-care workers and service providers who are constantly around sex workers are criminalised . <p> As it relates to the sex workers , they are driven underground in order to escape prosecution ; their the risk of violence increases and goes unreported ; their ability to negotiate condom use is reduced ; risk of contracting HIV and other STIs is increased ; and access to , and uptake of , sexual and reproductive health services and commodities are reduced .

Moreover , even if the court is satisfied that the rule should be varied , there is no specific guidance about the weight to be attached to each such factor . In other words , if a marriage is of short duration , to what extent should the equal share rule be varied ? The answer lies in the exercise of the judge 's discretion . <p> There is not yet a significant body of local case law that defines all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weight to be attached to each factor . However , what is clear is that the burden of disproving the applicability of the Section 6 presumption is on the person who alleges that it would be unreasonable or unjust to apply it . <p> Below are some of the cases I found in which there were successful Section 7 challenges : <p> - Graham v Graham 2006 HCV 03158 ( judgment on April 8 , 2008 ) - The wife 's interest in the family home was reduced to 40 per cent because the court found that the contribution by the husband 's extended family towards the cost of expanding the family home entitled him to a greater interest in it . <p> - Gardner v Gardner 2012 JMSC Civ 54 - In a marriage that lasted four years in which the husband owned the family home prior to the marriage , the court awarded the wife no interest in the family home .

The parties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resided with them . <p> - Collie v Collie ( Unreported ) Claim No. 2013 HCV 5949 - The parties cohabited prior to a marriage that lasted less than two years , the family home was acquired by the wife prior to the marriage and was substantially improved using only her resources . Two of the three factors existed to justify variation of the equal share rule . However , the husband 's financial contribution towards installing air-condition units , tiling the patio , paving sections of the yard and other general maintenance earned him a 20 per cent interest in the family home . <p> - Kelly-Lasisi v Lasisi 2016 JMSC Civ 25 - The fact that the property was acquired before the marriage , as well as the fact that the marriage was one of short duration , led the court to conclude that it would be unreasonable and unjust not to vary the equal share rule . The claimant was awarded a 10 per cent in the property . <p> An important issue was addressed in the case concerning the computation of the period of a marriage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marriage . One school of thought was that there is no legal basis for the court to take into account the period that the parties were cohabiting before the marriage and to include it in the calculation of the duration of the marriage , while the other was that the two periods should be merged . The judge found that the period of cohabitation prior to marriage should not be included in calculating the duration of a marriage . <p> From these cases , it is clear that ownership of the family home prior to marriage and the fact that the marriage is of short duration are the two most common factors that lead to variation of the equal share rule ; but parties should always remember that the list of factors is not closed .

The SDG Index and Dashboard , a tool available online , classifies signatory countries according to their performance in each of the 17 areas of interest . It provides the basis for the SDSN/Bertelsmann Stiftung annual SDG Global Report , which revealed in 2016 that out of 16 Caribbean small island developing states ( SIDS ) , 10 were not featured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Data collection challenges <p> These countries , due to limited capacity , face challenges in collecting data in a streamlined and timely manner .

While the goal is to see as many Caribbean countries included on the SDG Dashboard , time and resource constraints required CaPRI to focus on a limited number of countries which could , in a first step , make significant progress towards efficient monitoring of the SDG goals . Within CARICOM , four countries were selected according to data sets already available , response rate , and willingness to accommodate on-the-ground interviews : Antigua &amp; Barbuda , Dominica , St Kitts &amp; Nevis , and St Lucia . <p> CAPRI Affiliate researcher Dr Natainia Lummen visited the four selected countries to meet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heads of statistical units , in order to facilitate access to data held within government agencies and ministries . <h> Statistical capacity building needed within small island economies <p> While sufficient data were collected for St Lucia to be included in the dashboard ( and , therefore , the next Global Annual Report ) , the other three countries averaged 73 per cent data coverage - falling short of the required 80 per cent to be eligible for inclusion in the dashboard . While all four countries have made significant strides , through this project , towards monitoring their progress , this experience highlighted the need for statistical capacity building in order for the SDGs to be a success within small island economies . Indeed , the measurement of a country 's progress towards the attainment of the SDGs is highly data-driven , intensive in nature , and requires robust systems . <h> Institute aims for business process management system <p> To facilitate future data gathering as part of the SDG monitoring process , existing data collection instruments ( such as the Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey , or the Survey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relevant to the goals , such as literacy rate or demand for contraception . Additionally , with dispersed data a challenge , the digitisation and centralisation of government data will facilitate an efficient monitoring process . CaPRI and ISD also hope to progress , provided there is adequate funding , towards the development of a business process management system for the SDGs , which will facilitate the automation of the processes involved in data acquisition/ transcription . <p> This issue of data collection is , however , not limited to the Caribbean , and extends to most SIDS . Lessons learnt within the region have therefore enabled CaPRI to extrapolate recommendations for Pacific SIDS to gather the data they require . For example , it was noted that an SDG point person ( in the best cases , supported by a steering committee ) within the country was a crucial asset . With a substantial amount of the information needed being technical in nature ( relating to , for example , climate change or sustainable nitrogen management ) , a region-specific technical team is valuable in collecting , analysing and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the more scientific SDG indicators . <p> The recent Sustainable Development Goals conference also highlighted the need for a Caribbean SDG agenda - an issue which CaPRI had already addressed in 2015 , with a policy brief which suggested areas of focus , within the goals , that would best support Caribbean growth .

Areas of focus would include tourism , disaster vulnerability , climate change and non-communicable diseases .

@@19855231 <p> Usain Bolt leads the men off the turn in the 200m final , going on to win gold , during the 2016 Summer Olympics at Olympic Stadium in Rio de Janeiro , August 18 , 2016 . <p> 1 <p> 2 <p> 3 <p> 4 <p> DALLAS : <p> Usain Bolt of Jamaica appeared on a video screen in a white singlet and black tights , sprinting in slow motion through the final half of a 100-metre race . Each stride covered nine feet , his upper body moving up and down almost imperceptibly , his feet striking the track and rising so rapidly that his heels did not touch the ground . <p> Bolt is the fastest sprinter in history , the world record holder at 100 and 200 metres and the only person to win both events at three Olympics . Yet , as he approaches his 31st birthday and retirement this summer , scientists are still trying to fully understand how Bolt achieved his unprecedented speed . <p> Last June , researchers here at Southern Methodist University ( SMU ) , among the leading experts on the biomechanics of sprinting , said they found something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right leg appears to strike the track with about 13 per cent more peak force than his left leg . And with each stride , his left leg remains on the ground about 14 per cent longer than his right leg . <p> This runs counter to conventional wisdom , based on limited science , that an uneven stride tends to slow a runner down . <p> So the research team at SMU 's Locomotor Performance Laboratory is considering a number of questions as Bolt prepares for what he said would be his final performances at a major international competition - the 100 metres today and 4x100-metre relay next Saturday at the IAAF World Championships in London . <p> Among those questions : Does evenness of stride matter for speed ? Did Bolt optimise this irregularity to become the fastest human ? Or , with a more balanced stride during his prime , could he have run even faster than 9.58 seconds at the 100 metres and 19.19 seconds at the 200 metres ? <p> " That 's the million-dollar question , " said Peter Weyand , director of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A SOUTHERN Methodist University ( SMU ) study of Usain Bolt , led by Andrew Udofa , a doctoral researcher , is not yet complete . And the effect of asymmetrical strides on speed is still not well understood . But rather than being detrimental for Bolt , the consequences of an uneven stride may actually be beneficial , said Peter Weyand , director of the SMU lab . <p> It could be that Bolt has naturally settled into his stride to accommodate the effects of scoliosis . The condition curved his spine to the right and made his right leg half an inch shorter than his left , according to his autobiography . <p> Initial findings from the study were presented in June at an international conference on biomechanics in Cologne , Germany . Most elite sprinters have relatively even strides , but not all . The extent of Bolt 's variability appears to be unusual , Weyand said . <p> " Our working idea is that he 's probably optimised his speed , and that asymmetry reflects that , " said Weyand . <p> " In other words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might even slow him down . If he were to run symmetrically , it could be an unnatural gait for him . " <p> Antti Mero , an exercise physiologist at the University of Jyvaskyla in Finland , who has researched Bolt 's fastest races , said he was intrigued by the SMU findings . <p> " Generally , there are small differences between the right and left leg , but I think they are normally about one , two , three per cent , " Mero said in a telephone interview . " This sounds a little bigger . " <p> Given the scoliosis and discrepancy in the length of Bolt 's legs , Mero said , the sprinter 's stride appeared optimal for him . <p> " If the coach would try to change the pattern , it would not be good , " Mero said . <p> - Jere Longman , New York Times News Service <p> Bolt leads Jamaican sprinting dominance <h> Some background <p> Jamaican men and women won 11 of the 18 available medals in the 100 at the past three Olympics , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Theories about Jamaican sprinting success have ranged from their proportion of fast-twitch muscle fibres to a renowned youth development system to a public health campaign dating to the 1920s . <p> At its most basic , speed is the product of stride length times stride frequency . Though Bolt stands 6 feet 5 inches , he starts nearly as explosively as smaller sprinters and needs only 41 strides to cover 100 metres , while other elite runners need 43 or 45 or even 48 . <p> No sprinter can accelerate for a full 100 metres . But once Bolt reaches top speed at 60 to 70 metres , he maintains his velocity more efficiently than others , decelerating less towards the finish line . The winner of a sprint is not the person speeding up the fastest at the end but slowing down the slowest . <p> It was once widely assumed that the swiftest runners achieved top speed by swinging their legs more rapidly than slow runners while repositioning their limbs between take-off and landing . <p> In a 2000 study , Peter Weyand , director of Southern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ team at Harvard , determined that elite sprinters did not swing their legs appreciably quicker through the air . Instead , they gained maximum speed by striking the ground with a greater force than others in relation to their body weight , and for a shorter period of time . <p> For Olympic-calibre sprinters , that peak force can equal five times their body weight , providing lift and propulsion to begin the next stride . In Bolt 's case , his peak force can surpass 1,000 pounds . <p> Peak impact force is delivered within 0.03 seconds of striking the track . It is one of the most critical moments of sprinting . Less force put into the ground means less pop back into the air . Laurence Ryan , a physicist in the SMU lab , calls that period " 30 milliseconds to glory " . <p> In other words , Weyand said , " You win your medal or you 're out of the running based on that short duration . " <p> Machine-like Bolt <p> Unlike elite marathon runners , who strike the ground with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who must repeat each step about 25,000 times over 26.2 miles , sprinters are not concerned with endurance and fuel efficiency over 100 metres . <p> Marathon runners are the biped equivalent of a Prius . Sprinters are like dragsters , seeking to generate maximum speed and power over a short distance . <p> Elite sprinters do not land passively and spring back into the air as if their legs were pogo sticks , the SMU lab found in two 2014 studies . Instead , the sprinters cock the lead knee high and drive the foot into the track with a stiffened ankle . Essentially , it is a punch delivered with high velocity and a sudden stop . <p> " It 's like a ball bearing hitting the ground , " said Laurence Ryan , a physicist at SMU . <p> Sprinters like Bolt land just behind the ball of the foot , which strikes the ground at an angle of about six degrees . His lower leg decelerates abruptly , absorbing 16 Gs of force . His heel drops for only 0.02 seconds - the equivalent of an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the ground with each stride is about 0.09 seconds . <p> In effect , there is one biomechanical way for world-class sprinters to run extremely fast . <p> " They 're machine-like , " said Peter Weyand , director of SMU . " It 's incredible the extent to which they do the same thing . " <p> The SMU researchers did not know that one of Bolt 's legs was longer than the other when they began their study six months ago . They were testing a new motion-based technique , called the two-mass model , which allows them to determine ground forces by using high-speed video of races instead of specially equipped treadmills in the lab . <p> Andrew Udofa , a doctoral researcher at SMU , examined 20 steps apiece taken by Bolt and three other elite 100-metre sprinters , using video from a race in Monaco in 2011 . <p> On average , Bolt struck the ground with 1,080 pounds of peak force on his right leg and 955 pounds on his left leg . Because his right leg is shorter , it has a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ higher velocity for that step . <p> " The logical thing to think is , well , you want both legs to deliver as much force as possible and if one is not delivering as much force , if it delivered more force , he 'd go faster , " Weyand said . " But that superficial logic does n't really flesh out . " <p> A natural adaptation for Bolt has been to keep his left leg on the ground for slightly more time with each step - 97-thousandths of a second , compared with 85-thousandths of a second for the right leg . This gives him slightly more time to generate force with the left leg , Weyand said , providing greater lift off the ground . <p> Wanted : Bolt 's forces for science <p> Ralph Mann , a pioneering biomechanics researcher in the United States , said he could detect a kind of gallop in Bolt 's uneven stride . But a variability of 13 or 14 per cent was surprising , Mann said , given that his consulting work with USA Track and Field generally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elite sprinters . <p> " That 's a huge number ; when you see that you 're going to find a physical abnormality , " said Mann , who won a silver medal in the 400-metre hurdles at the 1972 Munich Olympics . But by strengthening the so-called weaker leg , he added , " I can think of no reason why that 's not going to improve performance . " <p> There is one person who apparently does not find the SMU research particularly interesting . That is Bolt himself , according to his agent , Ricky Simms , who said in an email , " He is n't the kind of person who studies this type of thing . " <p> But Simms , an Irishman who studied biomechanics at university , said he found the research illuminating , given Bolt 's history of back and leg injuries and his need for regular therapy to stay healthy . He has struggled in his two races this year and has yet to break 10 seconds in the 100 . <p> " I expect the researchers may get varying results @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ analysing and depending on what particular muscle or joint was tight at the time , " Simms said . <p> Shortly after Bolt retires , the SMU researchers hope to persuade him to visit their lab for more direct testing on a treadmill . <p> " People donate their bodies to science , " said Peter Weyand , director of ( SMU ) , who is leading the study .

@@19855232 <h> Clinton Chisholm Defending and dismantling buggery law sloppily <p> Two respected clergy colleagues have gone public in support of decriminalising buggery . These are my former UTCWI lecturer in psychology , Dr Howard Gregory , Anglican Lord Bishop of Jamaica , and my JTS classmate and former boss , Dr Garnett Roper , president of the Jamaica Theological Seminary . <p> While I disagree with aspects of their stance , I think it useful to point out a few crucial things . <p> The first has to do with a distinction between arguing for decriminalisation and being in support of a decriminalised behaviour or act . The online legal dictionary ( Oxford ) sees decriminalisation as " the process of removing criminal sanctions from any activity , either by removing any prohibition of the activity or by moving responsibility for enforcement to a non-criminal process " . <p> It may help to point out that the idea of a crime ( not simply an offence ) is at the heart of decriminalisation . Hence , getting a speeding ticket is an offence in law but not a crime , but robbery , like murder , is a crime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be drawn about my two colleagues , or anyone else arguing for decriminalisation of buggery , is that they do not think that it should be a criminal act . It does not follow , without knowing more , that they support the act of buggery as being amoral ( neither right nor wrong in and of itself ) . We all need to think critically and be fair to others whose views we may not share . <p> To be sure , an act that is decriminalised now could , over time , be legalised . Bear in mind , too , that a legal act or practice could be immoral . Compare slavery or double taxation by successive political regimes in Jamaica ! <p> Adultery used to be both criminal and immoral . I suspect that not a few persons are happy that it has been decriminalised ( no longer a criminal act ) ! <p> It is also important to know that law and morality do n't always overlap , though at times they do . Here is where I disagree somewhat with my dear friend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a TVJ show called ' That 's a Rap ' , as urging : <p> " Buggery/anal sex is a moral matter that is between consenting persons ; it is a choice which I do not approve of , but that does not make it a criminal act , and what the ... 1864 law ( Section 61 of the Offences Against the Person Act ) does is to make it criminal with a maximum punishment of 10 years in prison ... . " <p> I would suggest to him that buggery in Jamaica is at once a moral and a criminal matter . Saying it ought not to be a criminal matter is radically different from saying it is not a criminal matter when there is a law against it . <p> Notice , though , lest we be sloppy in our reading of Dr Roper , that he says that " buggery is a choice that I do not approve of ... " . <p> To the average person in the street , it 's only a very thin , almost invisible line that separates support for decriminalisation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such persons , what is deemed as not criminal is regarded as implicitly okay for behaviour . <p> This is not so for lawyers , though , or for the non-lawyer who is thinking critically . As Dr Roper 's comment shows , one can argue for decriminalisation of an act but still find the act unworthy of one 's support . <p> Why do I disagree with Bishop Gregory ? His pivots for decriminalisation , namely , privacy , consensuality and age maturity , do not sufficiently justify any sexual behaviour , without more , as the lawyers would say . <p> The same questionable pivots could be used for incest and other non-sexual acts that are still unlawful . Additionally , buggery must be evaluated intrinsically ( what it is in itself ) . Is it the kind of act/behaviour that a society concerned with individual and societal health should encourage ? I do n't think so .

@@20734230 <h> Jaevion Nelson Politicians must prioritise the working poor <p> People who are paid low wages are among the most abused in Jamaica . Their rights are taken for granted daily by their employers and supervisors who treat them unfairly and constantly threaten to fire them . <p> Remedies for redress and opportunities to negotiate fairer wages or increases and better working conditions are non-existent . Consequently , a significant number of people are forced to endure unending abuse and wallow in misery and disillusionment until they , hopefully , find an employer with a conscience . I have found this is particularly common among those working in the service industry , at hotels , restaurants , and bars , for example . <p> About two weeks ago , a friend was telling me about a woman working at a gas station whose young baby was terribly ill . She had no one to attend to her child . When she asked her boss for the time off to take care of her child , she was told not to return if she left . <p> On Twitter , a friend mentioned that at one of her favourite fast-food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lunch . Apparently , this was recently increased from 20 minutes . <p> In a training workshop with health-care workers , one nurse spoke about a pregnant woman working at a fast-food restaurant where the staff is prohibited from taking their lunch into the kitchen . No accommodation was made for her . Her partner had to meet her each day with the fruits and vegetables she needed to consume , which she would have in his car . <p> Another friend shared about some co-workers who are paid low wages and are not provided with the required tools to do their job effectively . <p> In some companies , employees who work late are not assisted with transportation at nights . They have to find their way home in the wee hours of the morning in sometimes volatile communities . It is also not unusual that people do not get paid for overtime work . <p> We absolutely must do something to ensure the working poor can enjoy their rights and live in dignity . I ca n't imagine how difficult it must be for these individuals . Their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ POLITICAL WILL <p> What I find most frightening is the seeming unconcern by many of us regarding the plight of the working poor . The lack of political will to introduce and enforce policies and laws which prioritise the interests and welfare of the working poor as a central component of our development plan is quite telling . It is most regrettable that there is hardly any protection for individuals who earn low wages . Their employers abuse their rights and wallow in the state 's ineptitude to ensure they are protected . <p> It is important to note that although we are party to the International Covenant on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights ( ICESCR ) from 1975 , such considerations were not included in the Charter of Fundamental Rights and Freedoms which was passed in April 2011 . <p> Articles 6-9 of the ICESCR speak to the " right to work . The enjoyment of just and favourable conditions of work , to form and join unions , for the promotion and protection of his economic and social interests and the right to social security . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rights of the working poor , argues that " the rights of employed persons in Jamaica are safeguarded in a piecemeal fashion by a kaleidoscope of laws which , unfortunately , has gaps and loopholes in protection " . <p> One wonders why our politicians , especially those who represent constituencies where a significant portion of their constituents are among the poorest and most vulnerable , have been so silent about these issues . Is it that people do not share their experiences with them and ask them to speak up on their behalf ? Why is it that civil society , which is in large part supposed to be the voice of the people , so deafeningly silent as well ? Why is n't the Government being held accountable to their obligations to protect , promote and fulfil their human-rights commitments ? I 'm certain it 's not very hard to see that people are being terribly abused all over the country and are in dire need of representation . <p> As Campbell said , " We have to do away with the tendency to pay lip service to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and cosmetic ways in which we attempt to address the issues they face , and move to action so we are better able to facilitate their full and meaningful development . " <p> I urge the Government to put workers ' rights on the legislative agenda for 2018 . I believe this should be followed by consultations and research , led by the Economic Growth Council and human-rights and community-based groups and organisations , into the challenges people face and how they can be addressed . We can not develop our country if only some of us are paid and treated fairly and have the full protection of the law .

It is alleged that the incident was sparked by a minor accident when a taxi hit a BMW X6 sports utility vehicle , whose driver opened fire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ owner of the X6 , was , eventually , after his return from the United States , arrested for the murder . His murder trial , however , collapsed when the State 's key witness , the driver of the taxi , testified that he did n't see who was driving the X6 or who had fired the shots , recanting earlier statements to the police . <p> In one of the case 's several twists , Mr Powell , a businessman , failed to submit his licensed firearm for testing , in breach of the law . For that he is serving a nine-month jail term . In another of the turns , it was discovered that the file relating to Mr Powell 's gun was missing from the Firearm Licensing Authority . <p> In the meantime , Khajeel Mais ' parents , Allana and Novel Mais , had brought a civil case against Mr Powell for the wrongful death of their son , utilising the Law Reform ( Miscellaneous Provisions ) Act of 1955 , which allows for actions of civil tort by the estate of a deceased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ C ) implies , in the circumstances " where the death of that person has been caused by the act or omission " of another person . <p> In their statement of claim , the Maises contended that Mr Powell " stopped alongside the taxicab ( in which their son was a passenger ) ... and negligently and without lawful cause discharged his firearm and shot the deceased " , who was " unarmed and posed no threat " . <h> NOT UNHEARD OF <p> On the face of it , the Maises would have had to put Mr Powell at the scene of the incident and prove that it was he who shot their son , a claim that the Crown could not cause to stick during the criminal trial . Civil tort on behalf of a deceased person is not uncommon in Jamaica , but it is rare , if not unheard of , for such cases to be brought in a circumstance where the accused person , as was Mr Powell , was already freed of criminal liability . <p> In the event , Mr Powell has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ claims filed two years ago , hence the default judgment . He is required to pay J$206,786 , for loss of expectation of life and J$1.7 million in special damages as reimbursement to the Maises for funeral expenses . <p> This action by the Maises could well open the way to similar claims of compensation by the families and or estates of murder victims , even in circumstances where the alleged killer has been freed of the crime . Moreover , it has a potential to sharpen the spotlight on the obligations , at Section 13 ( 1 ) ( c ) of the Constitution , for all " all persons ... to respect and uphold the rights and others recognised in this chapter " . Among those rights is the right to life . <p> Critically , individuals , and not only the State , are responsible , and can be held to account for infringing the rights and freedoms guaranteed by the Constitution , which , it seems to us , gives greater potency to actions such as those taken by the Maises.

Celebratory glasses of bubbly are on hand and delicious cocktails are being served as we spend time with family , friends and colleagues . <p> But with all the season 's merriment , open bars and the growing popularity of cooler fetes and bucket deals , even the most conservative may be tempted to push the limits with alcohol . <p> Occupational health advisor at Red Stripe Veronica Benain says there is a way to enjoy the season 's offerings and strategically manage alcohol consumption at the same time . <p> " When we talk about responsible drinking , it means different things to different people , " explains Benain .

Men can consume a little bit more because of how they 're built , while women tend to feel the effects of alcohol quicker , " she points out . She advises that as a rule , women should usually have up to two units in a night while men no more than four units .

Drinking soft drinks may seem so pleasant and so innocent because this cold , artificially flavoured , sweet liquid with its acidic tang , combined with the tickle of gas bubbles , is carefully designed to seduce and addict the consumer . <p> According to market surveys , soft drink sales continue to escalate each year , fuelled by aggressive multimillion-dollar advertisement campaigns directed mainly at children and teenagers . In the United States , for example , young males aged 12-29 are the biggest soda consumers , drinking over 160 gallons per year - almost two quarts per day , and the girls are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soft drinks indicate that they are not healthy .

One study found that for each additional 12-ounce soda children drink each day , their risk of becoming obese increases by 60 per cent . <p> Adults and children who consume sugary drinks regularly ( one to two cans per day or more ) have a 26 per cent greater risk of developing type 2 diabetes than those who rarely have such drinks .

In my opinion , the same type of health warnings that appear on cigarette packages should also appear on soft drink containers . <h> ANATOMY OF A SOFT DRINK <p> When carefully examined , the ingredients in soft drinks look like a witch 's brew of undesirable chemicals : <p> High fructose corn syrup ( HFCS ) : This is now the preferred sweetener ( instead of cane sugar ) in soft drinks , as it is cheaper and sweeter . The liver is the organ that must metabolise the fructose in HFCS , and researchers have found that animals on high-fructose diets develop liver disease , metabolic disorders like diabetes , and high blood cholesterol levels . <p> Despite loud disclaimers from corn syrup manufacturers , an army of respected experts strongly believes that HFCS consumption is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the poor development of collagen , a very important structural protein found in all body tissues , especially in the circulatory system , the muscles and skeleton . <p> Aspartame : This has been the main artificial sweetener used in diet sodas . It has been proven to be a potent neurotoxin ( nerve poison ) and hormonal disrupter . I agree with experts who state that it should not be allowed in the human food supply . <p> Caffeine : In the right nutritional context , this compound has the useful ability to stimulate mental alertness and stave off fatigue , but when consumed in soft drinks , it stimulates the adrenal glands without providing any of the nutrients ( vitamin and minerals ) that the organ needs to function . The combination of caffeine and sugar in the amounts found in soft drinks , without key nutrients , can lead to adrenal exhaustion , especially in children . The mixture of HFCS and caffeine in soft drinks may well be the major cause of the modern epidemic of attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder in our children . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tang and bite . But this acid may disturb the delicate balance between calcium and phosphorus in the body , and is associated with excess loss of calcium from the urine and weakening of the bones . <p> For decades , much research has been published linking soft drink consumption to a rise in osteoporosis and bone fractures . With increased soft drink use , dentists have noticed a problem in teenagers that formerly occurred only in the elderly - a total loss of tooth enamel , resulting in yellow teeth . Phosphoric acid in soft drinks is the likely culprit . <p> Artificial flavours : Citric acid is a flavour enhancer added to further acidify soft drinks . It worsens the effect of phosphoric acid . Traces of the flavour enhancer MSG , another well-known neurotoxin , is also now commonly found in soft drinks . <p> Caramel : This common artificial colouring agent is used in soft drinks , especially cola drinks . Chronic intake of caramel has been linked to genetic defects and cancer . <p> Carbon dioxide : This gas is added to soft drinks to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a waste product of our body 's metabolism that we naturally expel with each breath we exhale . Why should we be ingesting something that the body is always trying to eliminate ? The carbon dioxide levels in your bloodstream powerfully impact the acidity of the body . <p> Water : This is potentially the healthiest part of the soft drink , although many questions have been raised about the quality of the water used in its manufacture . It is suspected that the producers use the cheapest , and not the healthiest type of water . Also , the water may contain large amounts of fluoride ( dissolved from the aluminium lining of the soda can ) as well as other harmful contaminants . Soft drinks can indeed deliver a hard knock !
