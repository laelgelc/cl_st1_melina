@@2097231 <h> Voters wait in queue to cast their vote during the second phase of Bihar Assembly elections at Gaya on Friday . ( PTI Photo ) <p> In Indian elections , a big campaign tool to ensure victory is to project the inevitability of victory .

This was a key tactic used by Narendra Modi in the 2014 election . <p> And that is why BJP can not quite understand how they are losing this battle in projecting the inevitability of victory . Both television channels and newspapers have done stories on the dip in the morale of the party , and the mood in Patna -- among those who shape opinion -- has shifted . <p> Over breakfast at Patna 's Panache Hotel near Gandhi Maidan , I spoke to BJP mid-level activists , who rejected this ' spin ' and attributed it to Nitish Kumar 's publicity-machinery and the handiwork of journalists close to him . One whispered , " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not getting the kind of space and access they wanted under Modiji . This is their revenge .

" They have a small lead , but we will make up for it in the next phase , " said a member of the BJP campaign team , who was travelling on the ground . He then went on to discuss specific seat-by-seat dynamics , rejected the argument that there is a broad forward-backward caste polarization , and insisted BJP has been able to make substantial inroads into backwards . <p> The perception battle will continue , and the party hopes to change the narrative after the third phase . <p> The heir-apparent <p> I was driving around Vaishali district , hoping to catch a Lalu Prasad rally in the evening , when we turned into a village @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is Lalu 's younger son , a former cricketer , and is contesting his first election from Raghopur , a constituency both his father and mother have represented in the past .

Tejaswi was going from door-to-door to canvas support . Dressed in white kurta-pyajama , a gamcha around his neck , he was walking briskly , asking for ' ashirward ' , blessings , from the women and shaking hands with the men . He deployed the same campaign trope that the alliance had been using against BJP when he asked a villager , " Have you got 15 lakh in your bank account yet ? Remember Modi had promised it . Did he deliver ? " <p> Tejaswi sat for a few minutes in the courtyard of a house , and was forced into having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the crowd . " Laluji is a world leader . And it is your duty to make Tejaswi win without Laluji coming to this village even once . This is about his izzat . " <p> Tejaswi told me while this was his first contest , he had campaigned several times in the past . He was confident and felt the elections had turned in their favour . " The RSS chief 's reservation remarks really changed the game . Backwards have come together . The BJP is making one last attempt in the third phase because there are many urban centres , but I think we will win even there . " As we walked together into a Dalit quarter , he added , " BJP thinks that like 2014 , people would once again vote for Modi from different castes . But it wo n't happen .

But without using the binary , I could not but resist asking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is everywhere . In US , is n't it about whites and blacks ? Caste has been the way our society has been organized for centuries , and it will be the key for a very long time to come . It matters . " <p> Was I talking to the next deputy chief minister of Bihar ? Tejaswi brushed aside the question and said this was not the time to talk about it . As he headed out to his next stop on the trail , I rushed back to the car , hoping to catch Lalu 's rally -- my original motive for coming to Vaishali . The public meeting was over . We had missed the father , while covering the son . <p> The perils of reporting <p> Samastipur has already voted . But I thought it may be useful to do a ' post-poll ' reporting journey .

" Had they voted for vikaas or because they did not want to vote BJP because of their religion ? " Because of vikaas , " he insisted . <p> I felt guilty for asking the somewhat rude question on religion . He had not taken offence . But it was not something we journalists would ask each other , or members of our own class . We took liberties and talked down to people , by asking them to open up about their deeply personal , constitutionally protected , choices ; their reasons for making those choices ; and tested our assumptions on them .

For example , they are more likely than behind-the-curve companies to have set up a separate unit with responsibility for digital business and have a chief digital officer leading their transformation initiatives . <p> However , these are transitional measures , the report concluded .

Besides , the upscale hotel did not want to upset its visitors by appearing to be intrusive -- the experience of premier guests at the hotels mattered a lot . <p> Lemon Tree Premier opted for a face recognition solution called NeoFace from the India unit of NEC Corp to help it deliver a more secure and elevated guest experience . <p> Face recognition software typically identifies a face and extracts it from the rest of the background scene to compare it with a database of stored images .

The impulse not to drive , to see driving and car ownership instead of as the efficiency that defined the 20th century , but rather as something hugely inefficient and inconvenient , an ill-conceived and illogical act , may be the perception that animates the 21st century . Not driving could define the superior and modern sensibility . <p> Hardly yet coherent , without a catchy name , or media excitement , or zeitgeist awareness , a revolution in mobility is underway that might not only be larger in its effect than the information revolution , but larger than how , beginning a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already one of the world 's fastest growing companies , on its way to being the world 's largest transportation company , employing more than a million drivers . On its part , Google 's management is said to believe that the company 's driverless car will be more profitable than search . <p> Carl Icahn , among the most successful investors of the era , and as good a barometer of investment flows as any , is now the largest shareholder in Hertz , the rent-a-car colossus , and also a significant investor in Lyft , the ride-share competition to Uber . Curiously , Icahn joins in Lyft one of his particular nemeses , Marc Andreessen , the founder of Netscape and among the most important technology investors . Smart money invests in Lyft , because that 's probably the cheapest way into Uber , who will , inevitably , buy its competition . You invest in Hertz because its future customers are not you and me , but Uber drivers who fetch us from the airport . <p> There are many things that have upset people about Uber @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confounded by Uber 's various options for all people . <p> All the signs agree : a new generation is eschewing conventional car ownership . The demographic rush is to urban centres , where car ownership is more expensive and less convenient ; more cars remain idle ( in expensive garages ) far longer than ever before ; urban policies designed to lessen carbon footprints and traffic flows discourage car ownership . Cars could be the new cigarettes . <p> Digital disruption , that take-down of established corporate power and transformer of market-driven behaviour , is , of course , the highest business and social mantra , defining a new tech-driven ideology and politics . Now , the world 's capital structure and economic hegemony might most be disrupted by a radical decrease in car ownership . And yet , the tech left , with sudden cold feet , has rallied against Uber , turning it into the newest ugliest face of capitalism . <p> For Uber , it is a bizarre order of disconnect . It is embraced by a marketplace whose very foundation , car ownership , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anti-materialist anti-ownership anti-corporatists , whose social vision it might help realize . Uber 's response , as in its New York dinner , has been an ambitious effort to get its PR affairs in order . It hired David Plouffe , the former Obama campaign manager , to run its communications strategy , then kicked him upstairs and brought in Rachel Whetstone who had performed this role at Google , and whose husband is Steve Hilton , the former Conservative Party political operative close to David Cameron . At Uber , they are confounded by how Google has got away with seeking worldwide dominance , and why Uber , with a similar intent to reorder the world , is on the hook . <p> A world without having to own a car , or aspiring to own a better car , is an entirely new one . <p> Uber 's intent , only magnified by its name , has suddenly made it the blowback company , or the tipping-point company . Twenty years of unchecked enthusiasm for technology in all its " disruptive " forms may now come crashing down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ technologies , swept up for a generation by the novelty of business culture but , curiously , ever left-wing in their instincts and ideals , embracing disruption as somehow a left-wing business ethos , are now face-to-face with a real-world economic disruption . Bloody cars . <p> Google , surely among the most beloved companies in history -- regarded somehow in the rosy light of Fifties corporate giants -- has largely been able to function in a world of its own making . Its hegemonic control is over , in a sense , nothing . Virtual . A world in a box . <p> Uber , on the other hand , and soon enough Google cars and the countless other iterations of actual real-life reordering to our physical selves , may be where the rubber meets the true emotional road of disruption . <p> Conspiracy theories , however wakadoo , create a unified system of evil , and are usually a good indicator of severe political alienation . <p> The beginning of a great Uber conspiracy theory came my way not long ago because I play a cameo role in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beginning of this piece . In other words , a dinner I can vouch for as entirely happenstance and convivial becomes , in the anti-Uber conspiracists ' telling , one of the various nexuses of worldwide takeover . Of course , if I am a member of this conspiracy , I can hardly do any vouching that it is other than a conspiracy . <p> Anyway , PandoDaily is a tech media site that through particularly grating self-dramatization has managed to achieve more presence than it might naturally deserve , suggesting an incipient hysterical side to tech life and politics . Part of its raison d ' ? tre has involved a campaign against Uber , which , PandoDaily believes is not only out to take over the world but has singled out Pando 's founder , Sarah Lacy , for special harassment because of her principled opposition to Uber . <p> Pando 's theory , and aha moment , was sparked by Whetstone 's hiring : " It 's ... a story " , according to Pando staffer , Paul Carr , in a long post on the site @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more , not less , aggressive and shady in its dealings with both lawmakers and the media . If you were worried about Uber 's power under Plouffe , you should be shitting yourself at what they 'll be capable of under Whetstone . " This is , worth noting , a giant power leap for the PR trade . <p> Uber is angrily opposed by eco-friendly , anti-materialist anti-ownership anti-corporatists , whose social vision it might help realize . <p> The background here , as in all conspiracy tales , involves efforts both to subvert government power and yet to insidiously use it . <p> While technology companies have benefitted from the sense that they were anti-government -- and capable of circumventing governments and old hat laws -- and have used popular anti-government sentiment ( both left wing and right wing ) to help avoid new regulation , Uber has so excelled at circumventing regulations that anti-Uberists , many tech-leftists among them , are more and more demanding that governments do something to stop Uber 's masterful workaround of local regulations . <p> Accordingly , if you are of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is doing all it can to subvert and co-opt governments to avoid a great clampdown -- and that it is working its shadowy magic within other shadows . " The problem is , " says Pando , " to tell the story properly , one needs to understand not just the inner workings of Uber , but also the surprising , and growing , global influence of a small group of Anglos and Anglophiles credited with guiding Britain 's ' nasty party ' from political exile to landslide electoral victory , despite being tangled up in Rupert Murdoch 's international phone-hacking scandal . <p> " The relationship , " continues Pando , " between Whetstone and the Camerons is by no means limited to 9-to-5 hours . Whetstone was godmother to Cameron 's first child , Ivan , and today Whetstone , Hilton and Cameron are all affiliated with the so-called Chipping Norton Set -- a high status group of politicians , celebrities and upper-class power-players , all of whom have ( second ) homes close to the same town , not far from London . The Daily Mail has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Cronies ' . " <p> Thanks to an interview I did with David Cameron for Vanity Fair in 2008 , and my attendance at the dinner I described earlier , I am now connected to Plouffe , Whetstone and Uber in a conspiracy that reaches into the highest reaches of the US and British government and beyond . <p> In this theory , supposing my connection to Uber and Cameron , and my " closeness to Rupert Murdoch " , this then connects Murdoch to Uber and its plans for evergreater world domination . Oh yes , and in this theory , I am a card-carrying member of the Chipping Norton Set . <p> In some sense , the surprise is that the technology business is not more at the centre of ever-raging conspiracy theories . That perhaps is part of this PR-driven theory : the PRs are so successful that they are able to detect everybody 's attention from the real plotting going on . <p> The message here -- as in all conspiracies -- is to be afraid . Uber , nefariously , is out to undermine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> As far as I can tell , that most-dear thing for some is car ownership . The digital revolution may have destroyed print and print culture , changed how we make relationships , altered how we shop and communicate , but all that is merely twaddle when placed next to the deep emotional connection between individual freedom and the right to own your own car . <p> Indeed , the implications of a worldwide decrease in car ownership alters , practically speaking , everything . The shape of cities , our central symbols of status , the most fundamental and time-consuming behaviour patterns of our daily lives , the nature of time and space -- measured , of course , by driving distance -- so many aspects of what we talk about ( I can barely remember anyone talking about anything else where I grew up than preferred local highway strategies ) , and , as well , the economic basis of the world . <p> Modernity is about owning cars . Power is about owning cars -- who makes them , who buys them . Cars are a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buys more of them rules . Any change in this equation is rife for conspiracies and for deep existential alarm . A world without having to own a car , or aspiring to own a better car , is an entirely new one . <p> There are many things that have upset people about Uber : its elitist connotations , even when that has been confounded by Uber 's ever-greater all-flavour options for all people . Its surge-pricing strategy , even though this is , arguably , a much more responsive way to meet over-burdened demand . Its effect on existing taxi fleets and labour pools , even though it breaks the worst kind of inefficient monopoly . Its safety and insurance issues , even though most of the worldwide livery industry has a terrible safety record and famously difficult insurance bureaucracies and procedures . <p> Uber 's intent , only magnified by its name , has suddenly made it the blowback company , or the tipping-point company . <p> But all this , I believe , is just a greater sense of agitation surrounding the real issue which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Uber , and the revolution that it has helped spark , many , if not most , of us wo n't need to own a car , or even learn how to drive . The central experience of modern life , a bond between parent and child , a world-view , the look and feel of the landscape everywhere , reality 's organizing principle -- where to park -- gone , uniting right and left in a perfectly understandable fear of the future .

@@2119231 <h> Third time lucky ? <p> No package in the power sector will succeed without improved operational efficiencies <p> Three major aspects need to be addressed while attempting to reform State electricity distribution utilities -- restructuring their finances , ensuring future financial discipline and improving operational efficiencies , including the important matter of tariff rationalisation . The Ujwal Discom Assurance Yojna or UDAY grapples only with the first two as the third and most important issue lies squarely in the domain of the State governments . Unless operational efficiencies are improved and tariffs rationalised , the UDAY package may well go the way of the other two packages devised by the government in 2002 and 2011 . That three bailouts have been necessary in just over a decade shows how difficult it is to reform this sector , which is prone to political interference and populist subsidies . Yet , the fact is that the distribution segment is crucial in the power chain and no meaningful reform of the power sector is possible without cleaning up distribution . <p> The UDAY package is different from the preceding two bailouts in two ways . First , it transfers three-quarters of the outstanding debt of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all , to the respective State governments in a phased manner . This is unlike the past when the dues were converted into bonds issued by the utilities . The advantage of the UDAY move is that it will reduce interest costs as the States will issue bonds at rates linked to government securities . Second , it attempts to enforce discipline on States as it requires them to absorb a part of future losses of the discoms . This is a commendable step that will , at best , force States to prevent utilities from going into losses , and at worst , ensure that such losses are funded out of the State budget . The package , thus , clearly pins responsibility for the financial health of the utilities on the shoulders of the respective State governments . <p> The success of the package , which aims to bring down aggregate technical and commercial losses ( AT&amp;C ) from 22 per cent now to 15 per cent , hinges on improving operational efficiencies of the utilities . Stuff such as smart metering or upgrading of transformers , separating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simple matter of weeding out pilferage will be difficult to implement unless the utilities play ball . Tariffs also need to be rationalised with subsidies for agricultural connections coming out of the State government budgets .

Clearly , there is only so much the Centre can do , given the constraints of the federal set-up . It is now up to the States to see reason and cooperate with the Centre in reforming this critical infrastructure sector .

@@2119238 <h> Tales From The Borderland ( series ) review : Great dialogues make this game worth the price <p> Have you played the Borderland games earlier ? If your answer is yes , you will be right at home in the Tales From the Borderlands , a five-episode adventure game series by Telltale Games . Telltale Games have been known to take universes and blend their own magic in them . The Tales From the Borderlands is by far the best iteration of the fantastic Borderland games and offers players a revisit to this lore and universe . It 's imbued with an amazing sense of humour and blend of comedic seriousness . But then we do n't expect anything less from a Borderland game . <p> The tales take place in the fictional universe of Pandora . There are long standing fables and a number of adventures in Borderlands that offer incredible riches to anyone brave enough to venture into this area . These riches have enticed vault hunters as well as interest of Hyperion , a corporate entity that operates a military-like control from a base in orbit , to enter this area . Next , we learn that Hyperion 's long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has also been discovered that they are searching for vault keys across the galaxy . <p> Tales from the Borderlands follows two protagonists -- Fiona , a con artist trying to make a living on the harsh world of Pandora and Rhys an employee of the Hyperion -- trying to make it big . Those familiar with the lore will immediately recognize the names . The events take place immediately after the events of Borderlands 2 . There is an introductory note at the beginning of each episode that tells a summary of the last episode . <p> These are standalone games but feature recurring characters from the Borderland series . There is an emotional investment in all the characters . All the choices you make affect your decisions in the 5 episodes as you explore the universe . A player is introduced to both protagonists while they narrate their story to a masked man . There are constant cutbacks between the flashback and reality which often breaks the tension and adds comedic relief . <p> We learn that Fiona and her sister Sasha are trying to pull off a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They have been brought up by Felix , a master con artist . Rhys , meanwhile , is a Hyperion employee who is on the verge of making it big with help of his best friend Vaughn and Yvette , only to be thwarted by his rival Hugo Vasquez and demoted to janitorial duties . <p> There are a number of recurring characters and there is plenty of fan service throughout the series . The gameplay , though linear , is extremely enjoyable as it is littered with witty and crisp dialogue from serious moments to moments of absolute hilarity . You ca n't help but feel emotionally invested in these characters as you progress in the game with them . Though there are a few moments where the story does drag its feet but then immediately makes up for it with amazing dialogues . <p> The last episode is the best of the series as there is a major event that takes place towards the end and Fiona has to decide the team she forms . This particular setting actually takes into account of all the major choices you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question side with you or against you based on those decisions . <p> The graphics are brilliant and the picturesque cell-shaded animations stay true to the Borderland universe . The sound is good . The music is phenomenal . The whole series is padded with music that sets the tone for each episode and whether it is Jungle 's ' Busy Earnin ' peppy dance number or the sorrowful ' Retrograde ' by James Blake you will feel that music goes a long way in making the game more enjoyable . <p> If you are video gamer , this game should be up there high on your list of " games to play " . Yep , it is phenomenally good .

@@2123230 <p> MOSCOW : The main bell in St. Isaac 's Cathedral in St. Petersburg tolled 224 times Sunday , once for each victim of the destruction of a Russian charter flight in Egypt a week ago . <p> Although President Vladimir Putin and his aides at first indignantly dismissed suspicions of a terrorist act , the Kremlin has since then clearly come to grips with the idea that a bomb was probably involved in the crash : Late Friday it suspended all travel by Russians to Egypt , and initiated an emergency airlift that by Sunday had repatriated 11,000 Russians , by government count . <p> Should an attack be confirmed -- and particularly if the Islamic State 's claim that it bombed the plane in revenge for Russia 's intervention in Syria turns out to be true -- analysts and other experts expect that it will only strengthen Putin 's resolve to become more deeply involved in the Middle East . <p> First , Putin said the Russian air force 's bombing campaign in Syria was partly intended to help dismantle the Islamic State , also known as ISIS or ISIL , which includes up to 7,000 fighters from Russia and the former @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to wage a terrorist war in Russia . An attack against a civilian airliner would confirm that Russian interests were already being threatened -- and might cause Russia to begin targeting the Islamic State more aggressively . <p> Second , Putin 's Syrian intervention has been taken as an attempt to show that Russia has again become a global power capable of tackling the world 's most intractable problems . Reversing course after the first setback , however violent , would undercut that image . <p> Third , the Russian leader has painted the West , and the United States in particular , as quick to abandon its Arab allies since the dawn of the Arab Spring in 2011 and its chaotic aftermath . Syria , now beleaguered , has been Russia 's only Arab ally for decades , but Putin has also been courting President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi of Egypt . A terrorist attack by enemies of the Egyptian government will most likely strengthen , not diminish , that effort . <p> Ever since the Russian air force began bombing targets in Syria at the end of September , Putin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terrorists on their home territory . His response in the face of any terrorist attack will probably be to double down , analysts said . But he is still likely to avoid committing ground forces , which polls show remains highly unpopular among Russians . <p> " If it was a terrorist act , that pushes the stakes higher and makes this Syria operation more costly , " said Vladimir Frolov , a political analyst . " It also proves the point that terrorists have to be destroyed before they come to our own land . " <p> The problem , he said , is that " Russia 's current strategy can not defeat the Islamic State . " <p> Russia deployed more than 50 combat aircraft in Syria , along with some 4,000 troops . About half of them were there as advisers and technicians , while most of the rest are ground forces needed to protect the pilots and various bases . <p> The strategy as laid out by Putin was that the Russian air force would bolster the weakened military forces under President Bashar Assad , allowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take on the Islamic State strongholds in western Syria , using Syrian and allied ground forces . <p> Alexei Makarkin , an analyst at the Center for Political Technologies , saw two main options for Russia . One , he said , was that " Russia can intensify the Syria operation , send more troops and volunteers to support Assad . " That move , he said , would probably worsen already strained ties with the West . <p> In the second option , " Fighting the Islamic State will become a priority rather than supporting Assad , " he said . " In this situation , Russia will pressure Assad to move toward a transitional government . " Those efforts had started but not gotten very far before the attack . <p> In the few instances that Putin has spoken out about the crash , it was mostly to offer his condolences . Soon , though , he will need to explain the catastrophe at home -- especially given the Kremlin 's initial insistence on dismissing the idea that the plane 's downing could be linked to Syria . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ critic , argued that Putin intervened in Syria to fulfill his own international political ambitions and so would avoid anything suggesting that ordinary Russians might pay a price for his gamble . <p> " They do not want to link the plane crash with Syria , because then the question is , ' Why did we go into fight in Syria at all ? Does it correspond to Russia 's basic national interests ? ' " Belkovsky said on Dozhd television , a tiny independent media outlet . <p> Last week somebody floated two plain wooden coffins in a canal in St. Petersburg -- home to most of the victims -- one spray-painted with the question " For what ? " in red , and the other with " For whom ? " <p> Some analysts thought the Kremlin was most likely struggling with an explanation . <p> " The Kremlin will have to reverse cause and effect here so that its strategy is not seen as leading to civilian deaths , " said Maxim Trudolyubov , an editor at large for the newspaper Vedomosti . <p> Still , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seeks to shape public opinion : a deepening belief in the Russian public , stoked by Putin 's propaganda machine , that Western governments are conspiring against the country 's interests . <p> Indeed , the idea that the West created the Islamic State in the first place is taken as a given here . And it took little time for allies of the Kremlin to frame the plane 's downing as yet another example of Western malfeasance . <p> One official almost immediately seized on the early British suspension of flights to Sharm el-Sheikh , from which the downed plane took off , calling it a form of psychological warfare on Russia . <p> " There is a geopolitical pressure against Russia 's actions in Syria , " Konstantin Kosachev , head of the Foreign Relations Committee in the Federation Council , Russia 's upper house , was quoted as saying by the RIA Novosti news agency . <p> He added : " It might sound blasphemous , but there are plenty of those who , without any grounds , would like to deliberately blame this catastrophe on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Sputnik News , an arm of the Russian government efforts to spread its point of view globally , published a column suggesting that British intelligence might have blown up the plane . <p> " It is not hard to imagine that both would like to see Russian President Vladimir Putin incurring a political backlash from his nation over what is Russia 's worst-ever air crash , " the commentary said . " Was it really terrorists , or was it British MI-6 agents palming the deed off as terrorists ? " <p> Suspicions that the West is withholding information , voiced by the Russian Foreign Ministry , reflect the distrust between the two sides . The United States raised similar suspicions after the Boston Marathon bombers turned out to be two brothers with roots in the Russian Caucasus . <p> Other analysts said the slow Kremlin reaction compared with other governments ' responses reflected both Putin 's own caution and the desire not to harm Egypt : Russians make up about a third of the 9 million tourists who visit the country annually . Almost 80,000 still need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used to be the Soviet Union 's most important ally in the region , until President Anwar Sadat expelled all its military advisers in 1972 .

The estimated 20 million Muslims in Russia are overwhelmingly Sunni . <p> " It is important for Russia to be seen in the Middle East to be in close touch with the biggest Arab country , " said Dimitri Trenin of the Carnegie Moscow Center . " It feels uncomfortable with this alliance with Shiite power . " <p> Still , many expect a forceful response in Syria if the airplane downing is traced back to the Islamic State . <p> " A terrorist attack against Russian citizens means a declaration of war against all Russians , " wrote Tatiana Stanovaya , an analyst , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ campaign will thus become not a matter of Putin 's ambitions , but of national revenge .

@@2123240 <h> In Bengal , why is Kali Pujo being wrapped under the banner of Diwali ? <h> Photo Credit : Creative Commons <p> 83.2K <p> Total Views <p> The importance accorded to people by governments is often revealed by official calendars . The Central government does n't recognise a holiday ( neither compulsory nor optional ) on November 10 on account of Kali Pujo . The next day , however , is a compulsory " national " holiday for Diwali . The government of Bangladesh recognises November 10 as an optional holiday for Hindus on account of Kali Pujo . There 's no Diwali . There 's no Diwali in the West Bengal government 's official holiday either , although it lists both the November 10 and 11 as holidays -- the first as Kali Pujo and second as day for immersion of goddess Kali . <p> There will be customary Diwali greetings from her but the priorities and hierarchies are clear . Her Congress background also makes it natural for her to patronise Ma Kali politically . From Bengal 's pre-partition Swadeshi political terrorists and their physical culture associations to neighbourhood Congressite dadas and their local youth clubs , all of these have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Kali pujo : only show in town <p> I share with Mamata Banerjee our extended residential neighbourhood , the Kalighat-Chetla area , the world capital of Kali Pujo in terms of variety , with scores of manifestations of the goddess . The roughly 3 square kilometre Chetla-Kalighat area has several hundred Kali pujos pandals . Here , on the only Shaktipeeth in metropolitan Kolkata , stands the famous Kali temple at Kalighat . For me , being a Shakto and a Chetla resident , Kali Pujo has always been special . The prasad of curried goat meat , preferably sacrificed and offered to our holy mother beforehand , is one of the high notes of Kali Pujo for millions in Bengal . <p> Till only a couple of decades ago , in the period after Durga Pujo period , Kali Pujo was the only show in town -- Diwali was minuscule . But that 's not the case any more . Now Diwali jostles with Kali Pujo in Kolkata 's public spaces . In fact , if anything the situation is being reversed : Ma Kali Pujo is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Bengal . <p> Kolkata is bombarded by huge advertisements of " Diwali Dhamaka " offers in Bangla and English newspapers , by corporations headquartered in Delhi or Mumbai . Driven by this commercial pressure , some Bengal-based entities are also joining the fray . There are relentless text messages for Diwali-themed sales pitches . One Bangla paper also carried an advertisement on " Diwali fashion " for Bengalis , whatever that means . If one picked up the leading Bangla and English newspapers of Bengal , the glitzy and colourful advertisements in it would'nt give anyone a clue that this is Bengal and one of this region 's greatest festivals , Kali Pujo is around the corner . So then , whom are these ads for ? <p> Kali Pujo has traditionally been one of those festivals where the so-called lower castes have dominated much of the happenings . While the upper-castes also celebrate Kali Pujo with vigour , a small but well-off section of the new generation of Bengalis has grown alienated from a celebration so rooted in Bengal . This is the section that these Diwali ads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Diwali <p> Moreover , this new commercial culture is working . Economic elites influence the aspirational tastes of those lower down the rung . Pan-India corporations , which would hate things like tariff barriers between states , inundate us with " Diwali " and not Kali Pujo around this time of the year . Kali Pujo is something that commercial entities that cater largely to the aspirational urban classes can not easily negotiate . It 's too democratic and suffused with actual religiousity and culture -- unlike the range of " pan-Indian " religious festivals , which can be sold commercially to the aspirational rootless urban class of India . <p> Unfortunately , the commercial forces behind this smothering of local culture are strong : the Diwali-Dhanteras combination is here to stay in Bengal and even to spread . Kali Pujo will , in the end , become Diwali , or rather , Diwali with Bengali characteristics -- the only kind of " diversity " that the " unity in diversity " ideology tolerates . And this is n't the first time this subsumation will happen . In Bengal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( never mind that they do n't even fall on the same date ) . The Navratri-isation of Durga Pujo has also started . <p> Diwali is perfect for the self identity of the small but increasing bloc of urban Bengalis whose non-rooted Hinduness also makes them Indian without qualifications of ethnicity and culture . They are only Indians , without hyphenations. and nothing but Indians ? -- their Bengaliness is but a footnote in their identity . They are ideal citizens -- the " Indian " for whom a centralised Union was dreamt up in the first place . Except that such Indians are still a small minority , even if they are the elite . Most people do n't measure up to such a non-hyphenated and flat version of Indianness . <p> Let me make it clear that this is n't a xenophobic argument : cultural exchange and spread has happened throughout human history and will continue to happen . The problem arises when certain forms of culture are spread via cultural dominance and with the active connivance of government , media and business -- and all of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . With deracinated elites of vernacular origin as collaborators , their project has started acquiring the qualities that the US conservative political strategist Karl Rove had in mind when he said , " We 're an empire now , and when we act , we create our own reality . " <p> Ostensibly national <p> This reality is created when ostensibly national TV channels carry a Diwali icon on their screen on Diwali day but never on Kali Pujo or Onam , hence signalling not so subtly what it means to be " Indian " . A North-Indian savarna 's domestic culture is " Indian " without qualifications but a Bengali ' ' s Kali Pujo is not similarly " Indian " in a mainstream sense but a variant or a quirk . A one-way cultural flow on the strength of money , media and political power is not exchange but cultural aggression . Since 1947 , I can not think of any religious spread from Kali Pujo-land or Onam-land into Diwali-land but the opposite is progressively true . In this particular scheme of unidirectional entry , Diwali is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exams , Holi and Hindi , with the pace quickening in the post-liberalisation period . <p> Join those apparently disparate dots and the contours of the post-1990 Bharatmata is revealed . Whose " local " culture is fashioned into a " national " culture and whose " local " culture disappears altogether when ideas such as " all India " and " mainstream " are evoked ? Why is the direction of traffic in this supposedly two-way street so predictable ? Why does the ruling party and its leading star , Narendra Modi , focus most of his political energy and reap maximal benefits in areas where Diwali is the uncontested name for the festival of lights ? In all of this , what is the lesson for us , the non-Diwali people ? <p> While Kali Pujo has a non-vegetarian overtone , Diwali signifies quite the opposite . Around Kali Pujo time , why are there no " Diwali Dhamaka " deals for a wholesome biryani in the non-vegetarian land of Bengal , something that 's common during Durga Pujo ? These are subtle undercurrents with far-reaching consequences for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ religious festival , around which other rituals like Bhoot Chaturdashi are woven . All of these entail generationally handed down customs of eating , behaving and being . <p> Bengal , in the face of this state and capital-sponsored cultural aggression , is undergoing a hollowing out of its rich and ancient ways of life . The resultant Anglo-Hindiisation of public culture is a poor replacement . Interestingly , Chhat Puja of Biharis has n't encroached in the Bengali cultural space in the way Diwali has , even while the ethnic observers of Chhat Puja far outnumber Diwali 's ethnic celebrators in Kolkata . So the Diwali effect is n't due to the cultural mixing that occurs due to mere physical presence of cultural " others " , but is the expansion of an external ideology wedded to power . Will this encroaching front invoke a wall of resistance from Mother Kali , the protector of her earthly children , whose cultures and identities are under siege ?

" Hartosh Bal , " The Truth-teller " in Sahgal ( ed. ) , p. 150 One of the few contemporary non-Congress leaders to make a handsome acknowledgement of Nehru 's great contribution towards the Hindu law reform legislation of the 1950s was the late Socialist , Madhu Limaye.2 <p> On the other aspects referred to by Bal , the fact certainly is that though the present-day Congress can not entirely be separated from the legacy of the pre-freedom Indian National Congress , yet the former formation has distinct characteristics and must be organisationally distinguished from its historical predecessor . Moreover , with the current decline of the Congress , we need to remind ourselves that many of us outside that organisation are also legatees of the space created and occupied by Indian nationalism since 1885 . This includes the political legacy of , for example , early Indian nationalists like Badruddin Tyabji , Dadabhai Naoroji and Gopal Krishna Gokhale and the social legacy of Mahadev Govind Ranade that had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Indian National Congress in 1969 and the dissolution eight years later of the Congress ( O ) , with its merger into the newly-formed Janata Party in 1977 , had the undesirable consequence that the entire Congress space came to be occupied by Mrs Indira Gandhi 's party , then known as Congress ( I ) . It is this latter party which has in recent years been receding politically . In the circumstances , it should not have been difficult to foresee that unless those outside this party who still saw themselves as legatees of the Indian freedom struggle as represented by the pre-freedom Indian National Congress , organised themselves , the vacuum left by the decline of the Congress would inevitably be filled by other forces . <p> There was a wide range of issues that had engaged the pre-independence Indian nationa-lists -- for example , from Dadabhai Naoroji to Romesh Chandra Dutt on the economic aspects ; to Gandhi , Abbas Tyabji , Motilal Nehru , C.R. Das and Tagore on civil liberties questions arising especially out of the 1919 events and after and Asaf Ali @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; to Narendra Deva and the language-related contradictions in the education system pointed out by the Education Committee headed by him in the United Provinces in 1938-39 ; to the Rashtriya Stree Sabha of the 1920s , Desh Sevika Sangh of the 1930s , Sarojini Naidu and socialists Kamladevi Chattopadhyaya , Rama Devi and Malati Choudhury on questions of the relation between nationalism and gender ; to the entire legacy of constructive work associated with the freedom movement , as represented for example , by Thakkar Bapa , Kaka Kalelkar , Ginwala , Mithu Petit , Jugatram Dave , Khurshed Naoroji , B.F. Bharucha , Bibi Amtu-ssalam , Perin Captain , Walunjkar , Zakir Husain , Asha Devi and Aryanayakam , and countless others . <p> The anti-Nehru space in India is populated not merely by Hindutva but also often by the epigones of Rammanohar Lohia . This seems to be a gap in the volume under review , except for a passing reference to Lohia 's politics in Kumar Ketkar 's contribution Ketkar , " The Platonic Republican : Philosopher-Statesman " , Sahgal ( ed. ) . p. 47 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The answers that the latter-day Socialists in the Lohia years provided to some of the social , linguistic and cultural issues Lohia raised are not necessarily so complete or final that they can not be re-thought.3 On other issues too , remaining confined to some of the post-independence Lohia-Nehru contr-oversies , especially of the 1960s and the thinking that emerged then , has constricted the intellectual growth of the socialist movement . A similar point was once made also by the late Kishan Patnaik in the socialist journal Janata in 1980.4 It is worth recalling here also that the late Surendra Mohan , in an introspective article written for Janata , had once pointed to the connection between the negativities in the Opposition politics of the late sixties and the negativities of the post-Shastri establishment.5 <p> Another aspect of the matter is worth appreciating . The writings of Lohia and the politics of Lohia need , to some extent , to be distinguished as these are not necessarily congruent . Speaking generally , the writings of both Lohia and JP may be rated considerably higher than their politics -- especially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 1970s . Incidentally , this is the reverse of what is true in the case of Mahatma Gandhi whose praxis would often race ahead of his writings , phenomenal though these themselves were ; Gandhi himself recognised this when he said that his writings could be burnt for all he cared and that it was his life that was his message ; in the same vein , Nehru too had once observed how much greater Gandhi was than his " little books " . <p> Every movement requires periodic renewal ; its dominant doctrines and practices need to be reconsidered in the light of experience . Nitish Kumar 's break with the Bharatiya Janata Party in Bihar would , it may at least be hoped , also help initiate a renewal of this kind . The political alliances Lohia forged and also the thinking associated with these alliances certainly need to be re-thought in the light of subsequent experience and also the changed circumstances in which the Congress is no longer the force that it used to be . The Socialist alliance with the Jana Sangh in the run-up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to further such unthinking linkages by Jayaprakash Narayan in the mid-1970s and by V.P. Singh in the late 1980s . The remedies sought by Lohia , JP and V.P. Singh , and especially the manner in which these were sought , may have proved worse than the disease . Few precautions were taken by them in the forging of their strategies and no adequate steps taken for the ideological training of cadres . Even if such precautions had been taken , it should have been obvious that aligning with reactionary forces , whether tacitly or otherwise , would have long-term deleterious ramifications for the country . <p> The caste-based political formations that have come to the fore in recent years need to nuance their approaches ; religious sectarianism can perhaps be obstructed but not wholly countered through caste-centric politics at the national level . Caste is relevant as a social reality whose influence one must seek to reduce and counter-act ; it is also relevant as a basis for hostile discrimination which one must seek to eliminate . Caste can not become an organising principle in itself since such mobilisation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some decades ago , the late Kishan Patnaik had also deprecated attempts made by Socialists " to bolster the middle caste lobbies for electoral power politics " .7 Narendra Deva 's early insight that the institution of caste is essentially anti-democratic remains relevant . <p> In the pursuit of democracy too , we must not remain confined to the civil liberties frame-work which tends toward a pre-occupation with constitutional and legal transgressions like the Emergency , while often neglecting the social changes that underpin such phenomena across the political spectrum and also developments like the growth of fascist tendencies that sometimes flank and skirt these phenomena . <p> Contemporary India must positively re-engage with the legacy of Jawaharlal Nehru in his role as a great fighter for Indian freedom and connect with him just as , say , the founders of the Congress Socialist party had . The founders of the Socialist movement did not see themselves as being apart from Nehru . Narendra Deva , in his presidential address at the first session of the of the All-India Congress Socialist Conference at Patna on May 17 , 1934 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ following terms : " My task is made all the more difficult by the absence of our beloved friend , Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru , whose absence today we all so keenly feel and whose valuable advice and guidance would have been of immense value to us on this occasion " . Twelve years later , Narendra Deva wrote a perceptive appraisal of Nehru . Narendra Deva recognised that " Jawaharlalji took great interest in class-organisation . He was elected President of the All-India Trade Union Congress in the year 1929 and it has been his constant endeavour to make the Congress interest itself in the economic struggles of the workers . He tried to bring economic questions to the forefront . The resolution of Fundamental Rights passed at the Karachi Congress in 1931 was his contribution . His activities brought about a general radicalisation of political thought in the country . " 8 <p> So far as the State was concerned , Nehru was committed to its religious neutrality as postulated by the Karachi resolution of 1931 which he had taken the lead in drafting . As Narendra Deva points @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .9 On Nehru 's personal attitude toward religion , Narendra Deva had reflected : " Religion in its institutional form is repugnant to him as it is the bulwark of reaction and the defender of status quo . Its function in society has been to make social inequalities less irksome to the lower classes . But he has no quarrel with that purer form of religious faith which inspires the conduct of individuals . He , however , believes in ethical social conduct and has a deep sense of human values . " 10 So far as the State was concerned , Nehru was committed to its religious neutrality as postu-lated by the Karachi resolution of 1931 . <p> It was Nehru who , as the Congress President in 1936 , had re-organised the Congress headquarters and introduced an internationalist perspective into it . Nearly 40 years younger to Gandhi and some 19 years to Nehru , Rammanohar Lohia wrote to the latter on May 23 , 1946 : " .... please do n't forget that you and another have influenced men like me so much that there never has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " A photocopy of Lohia 's letter to Nehru was published by the socialist Bhola Chatterji ( 1922-1992 ) in an article in Sunday magazine some decades ago . <p> The socialist leader and intellectual , Madhu Limaye , who was close to Lohia and nearly three decades younger than Nehru , was conscious of the need " to take an objective view and keep out my personal likes and dislikes , prejudices and predilections " ; he refers to Jawaharlalji as the " uncompromising sentinel of Independence " and acknowledges that he " gave a new orientation to ( the ) Congress policy and programme " ; and that " he championed the cause of the peasantry " and " took up the case of the workers working in mines and the factories who were being treated as slaves " . <p> Jawaharlal Nehru is an intrinsic part of the legacy of Indian freedom ; no contemporary Indian politics that seeks to take India forward can be defined by excluding him . On inter-communal questions , which have a bearing on the very definition of India , Nehru @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Mahatma Gandhi . <p> The intelligentsia must re-engage positively also with Jawaharlal Nehru as the builder of post-independence India . It was Nehru who got the Congress committed to a socialistic pattern of society in its session at Avadi in 1955 . The building up of the public sector enabled India for long to hold its own in a world that various international powers sought to bend to their own image . One of the contributors to the Sahgal volume has referred to Nehru 's tendency to " lecturing the West " . Aakar Patel , " The Many Faces of Jawaharlal " in Sahgal ( ed. ) p. 159 Many writers in India and abroad often refer to this but easily forget that the " lectures " may not have been entirely unnecessary . Stupendous efforts were made under Nehru to reduce India 's external dependence on oil . How vital this effort was may be gauged from the lengths to which Western powers went in opposing similar Iranian efforts under Prime Minister Mossadegh against whom a successful coup was organised in the 1950s . ( This latter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recent book , Patriot of Persia : Muhammad Mossadegh and a Very British Coup. ) 11 The building up of an independent public sector tradition had other ramifications as well . The emphasis on research and development , 90 per cent of which was done in the public sector , induced a tradition of self-reliance , partly squandered by later regimes . In the case of drugs , this tradition has enabled Indian firms today to be prime suppliers of relatively low-priced vital medication to countries with similar problems as ours , such as countries in Africa . The social scientist , Shiv Vishwanathan , belonging to a family with many scientists , refers in his contribution to Nehru 's emphasis on science and technology : " Talking science meant talking Nehru .... " . Shiv Visvanathan , " A Tryst with Nehru " , in Sahgal ( ed. ) p. 93 The focus on science is emphasised also by the editor of the volume , in her introduction . Nayantara Sahgal , " Introduction : Nehru 's India : In Context " , Sahgal ( ed. ) , p. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , J.B.S. Haldane , moved to India in the aftermath of the Suez events , saying of his Indian environment in 1956 : " One has the iabsolute impression of being in a highly civilised community ... I feel far more at home there than I do in some European and most American cities . " Quoted by Nayantara Sahgal , Idem <p> An important point Visvanathan makes , even if it embodies only part of the truth , is that " the very people we thought of as Nehruvian destroyed Nehru " . Visvanathan in Sahgal ( ed. ) . p. 100 One need not squawk at the question whether Nehru has , in fact , been destroyed even if any government that deviates very greatly from the basic structure of the foreign policy and domestic institutions that emerged under Nehru 's auspices soon finds itself in stormy waters . One may abandon words like socialism and non-alignment but one can not do away with a mixed economy or a middle-of-the road foreign policy , name these what you may please . That lumpen elements entered the Congress , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's younger son , is quite probable . There was even a rapprochement of sorts at least at the Youth Congress level and the RSS , post the Turkman Gate incident of April 1976 . This connection had deepened , even if the younger son had by then passed away in a tragic accident , by the time of the municipal and Metropolitan Council elections in Delhi in 1982-83 in which the RSS is supposed to have backed many Congress candidates . By the time the 1984 anti-Sikh pogrom occurred in the wake of Indira Gandhi 's assassination , the infiltration must have been substantial . There are understood to have been an appreciable number of FIRs , not merely against individuals from the Congress , but also reportedly against some RSS persons for their involvement in the 1984 pogrom . But not much is heard of these in the media ; a very useful talking-point would perhaps be lost to Hindutva if the matter were actually and systematically pursued . The writer and critic , Kiran Nagarkar , has a well-deserved critique of the late Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My Quotidian Companion " , in Sahgal ( ed. ) , p. 181 The role of the more experienced Home Minister at the time also perhaps requires critical scrutiny in this context . He focuses also on Kashmir as a source of tension between India and Pakistan but refers mainly to the post-Nehru phase . Sahgal ( ed. ) , p. 171 Rakesh Batabyal seems to underscore Nehru 's sense of moderation when he mentions the 1947 war in Kashmir to make the point that Britain 's complicating role in those events nevertheless did not provoke Nehru into spurning the Commonwealth itself . Rakesh Batabyal , " Nehru : The Home Maker " , in Sahgal ( ed. ) , pp. 112-113 A fresh perspective on Nehru in the context of these events in Kashmir , more positive than the prevailing narratives , emerged a few years ago with Chandrasekhar Dasgupta 's work which is also referred to by Batabyal.12 <p> The economic historian , Aditya Mukherjee , and Mridula Mukherjee , historian of India 's freedom movement , in their essay have done well to take on " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dismiss or run down the economic achievements of the Nehruvian era " . Aditya Mukherjee and Mridula Mukherjee , " The Indian Economy in the Nehru Era " in Sahgal ( ed. ) , pp. 66-67 In particular , Meghnad Desai , the economist and UK Lord , has been a prolific supporter of the post-2014 dispensation in India which nurtures strong anti-Nehru allergies . I have my own bones to pick with Desai 's compulsive forays into some desultory history writing , but this is not the place for it . In his own essay Mani Shankar Aiyar rightly laments the abandonment of the Planning Commission and the planning process , currently a major bogey in the anti-Nehruvian onslaught . Mani Shankar Aiyar , " Interpreting Nehru in the 21st Century " , in Sahgal ( ed. ) , p. 37 ? <p> Nehru respected Parliament and urged the judiciary , nurtured in colonial times , to recognise social concerns in a changing India . At least two rounds of land reform legislation , at the onset of the fifties and sixties , took place under Nehru 's leadership @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rakesh Batabyal in his contribution . Rakesh Batabyal , " Nehru : The Home Maker " , in Sahgal ( ed. ) , p. 119 The breaking of " the back of the over 150-year-old zamindari system " within a democratic framework is referred to by the Mukherjees in their essay Sahgal ( ed. ) , p. 75 The Mukherjees cite Daniel Thorner who had devoted much of his life to studying Indian land and agriculture : " It is sometimes said that the ( initial ) Five Year Plans neglected agriculture . This charge can not be taken seriously . The facts are that in India 's first twenty-one years of independence more has been done to foster change in agriculture and more change has actually taken place than in the preceding two hundred years . " Sahgal ( ed. ) , pp. 77-78 <p> It will be readily conceded , of course , that more could have been done and still needs to be done with regard to irrigation , proper land and water management and liberating diverse regions of India from the cycle of flood and drought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ensuing from the country 's partition in 1947 , the Nehru dispensation maintained inter-communal peace , with the first major riot occurring only in the early sixties . The extent to which Nehru moulded the post-independence Congress may be gauged from remarks that Jayaprakash Narayan made in July 1964 , a few weeks after Jawaharlalji 's death . JP was reported to have said that leaving the Congress in 1948 to form the Socialist Party was a mistake committed on account of " the wrong assessment of the character of the Congress " .13 According to JP , " ( m ) ost of his partymen thought at that time that the Congress would slowly develop into a conservative-cum-liberal party just like ' what the Swatantra Party is today ' . But history belied this assessment . " 14 Ironically , the then assessment may have provided an accurate description of the later post-Emergency Congress and especially towards the last two decades of the twentieth century . <p> It is necessary energetically to counter the maligning and attempted discrediting of Gandhi and of Nehru by the Hindu Mahasabha , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and supporters . This is dealt with well in his essay by Kumar Ketkar who also makes reference to the fact that Nehru too was in line for assassination Ketkar , " The Platonic Republican : Philosopher-Statesman " , Sahgal ( ed. ) , pp. 43-61 Mahatma Gandhi 's biographer , Pyarelal , has also mentioned this . The vilification tendency has now been in evidence for several decades ; but it has lately assumed a virulent character . The direct attacks on Gandhi which used to be made by the RSS ( and , I would add , its later associates in the Jana Sangh days ) since Gandhi was , as Ketkar puts it , " their direct enemy " as the Mahatma did not disclaim Hinduism and " occupied the socio-cultural political space which they believed was theirs " . Ketkar in Sahgal ( ed. ) , at p. 44 and p. 46 In addition , in Ketkar 's words , " Gandhiji 's advocacy of ' Ishwar-Allah tera naam ' stood in direct opposition to their idea of Hindu and Muslim communities . The Mahatma 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to love all humanity , including Muslims and Christians , was a direct challenge to their social philosophy . To their dismay and disgust , the Congress under Gandhiji had won the people 's hearts and had a pan-Indian and international following . There was no chance or possibility to remove Gandhiji from that political space except by way of killing him . " Ketkar in Sahgal ( ed. ) , at p. 46 That is why , as Ketkar points out , attempts to assassinate Gandhi preceded partition . In fact , as the post-assassination direct attacks on Gandhi have proved ineffective for their purposes , these have been replaced with more subtle strategies that would seek to invoke Gandhi for such matters as cleaning-up while ignoring his pluralism and mocking his humanism . The direct attacks are now made mainly by the Mahasabha and its related organisations which have sought even to glorify Gandhi 's assassins . That blame for partition itself was conveniently and hypocritically attached by Hindutva on to Gandhi ( and Nehru ) would emerge from Aiyar 's essay in which attention is drawn to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " publicly endorsed Muhammed Ali Jinnah 's two-nation theory in a speech in Nagpur on August 15 , 1943 " . Mani Shankar Aiyar , " Interpreting Nehru in the 21st Century " , in Sahgal ( ed. ) , p. 3115 <p> The differing responses of Nehru and Sardar Patel to the Hindu Mahasabha and the RSS in the aftermath of Gandhi 's assassination are mentioned by Rakesh Batabyal in his essay which is excellent in its analysis of post-independence developments : " The Mahatma 's assassin .... Had been associated with the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh ( RSS ) and the Hindu Mahasabha ... , Hindu supremacist organisations that now came under scrutiny . Though Sardar Patel was convinced of the communal nature of the RSS , he said the Hindu Mahasabha was the bigger danger to the country .... Unlike Patel , Nehru never had any illusions about the RSS . " Rakesh Batabyal , " Nehru : The Home Maker " , in Sahgal ( ed. ) , p. 11116 <p> In the case of Nehru , the direct attacks , combined with efforts to erase his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to independence , however , Ketkar argues that " Nehru came on the radar of the Sangh Parivar only after Gandhiji declared that he would be his successor . Nehru 's rising popularity had upset the Parivar , but Gandhiji confronted the succession issue upfront . " Ketkar in Sahgal ( ed. ) , at p. 52 Ketkar correctly notes that Gandhi and Nehru were " in complete agreement " on " the most important and explosive issue of communalism " . Ketkar in Sahgal ( ed. ) , at p. 53 Indeed it is not widely known or appreciated that Gandhi supported the Secular State in what would be described today as the Nehruvian sense.17 It is not at the level of the state but at that of society and the individual that the Gandhian and Nehruvian understanding may vary . Incidentally , Ketkar 's remark in passing on Gandhi and Chaturvarna is not entirely correct.18 <p> At the recent Indo-African summit in New Delhi , the tendency to ignore Nehru 's contribution was carried to the point where the African dignitaries had to remind the current Indian government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nehru to Africa and its struggles . Nehru 's wider foreign policy initiatives are referred to in the essay by Mani Shankar Aiyar who analyses the " four pillars of Nehruvian thought " , that is , democracy , secularism , socialism and non-alignment . Aiyar , " Interpreting Nehru in the 21st Century " , in Sahgal ( ed. ) , pp. 21-42 Inder Malhotra too in his essay touched on all four of these , drawing attention also to some foreign policy failures as in the case of China . Inder Malhotra in Sahgal ( ed. ) , p. 64 The United Kingdom was particularly upset with Nehru 's stance in the Suez crisis and the Anglo-French attack on Egypt in the late fifties . It is difficult to say how much of this Anglo-centric angst was reflected in the one-sided nature of Neville Maxwell 's India 's ChinaWar but the latter is still the dominant version of the Sino-Indian conflict . It is all to the good therefore that some correctives have emerged in recent years , including a book edited by the late Air Commodore Jasjit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Nayantara Sahgal herself invites attention in this context to the work of a Tibetan historian , Tsering Shakya " Introduction : Nehru 's India : In Context " , Sahgal ( ed. ) , p. 15 , who suggests that India and China might well have managed their differences but for the Tibetan angle and the external interest in the Tibetan question which raised Chinese hackles . This is not of course a terribly novel point . The China angle is also one of the themes touched upon by Gopal Gandhi in his delightful essay . Gopalkrishna Gandhi , " Trustingly , JN " in Sahgal ( ed. ) , pp. 123-138 Gopal Gandhi brings out Nehru 's deeply human characteristics which had made him so lovable to the generations that knew him and that includes , with few exceptions , his political opponents . It is necessary scientifically and objectively to defend from vilification not only Gandhi 's but also Nehru 's legacy against attacks from communal-sectarian forces ; when Gandhi and Nehru are sought to be belittled , especially by forces unfriendly to the composite national struggle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is sought to be traduced . <p> The currently dominant Indian intelligentsia 's attitude toward Nehru induces some of them into making overt and covert arrangements with the BJP and its associates , just as they had in the past with the BJP 's predecessors . This predilection needs rectification . For example , in the case of the Socialists , the Draft Platform of the Socialist Party in 1972 had ruled out any modus vivendi with the Jana Sangh . Yet this formulation was abandoned within a couple of years of it being advanced . <p> Those who consider themselves to be inheritors of the heritage of the Indian freedom struggle , especially those belonging to the socialist tradition , naturally speak of such figures as Gandhi , Narendra Deva , Jayaprakash , Yusuf Meherally and Lohia . They have no difficulty also in seeking bridges between the social struggles of Gandhi and of Ambedkar ; although the latter was an outsider to the political struggle for Indian freedom , his social legacies are correctly seen by Socialists as being convergent with their own objectives , as Lohia himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a section of Socialists to recognise their obvious affinities and convergences with Jawaharlal Nehru ? It is difficult to avoid the conclusion that Nehru is unjustly excluded for subjective and even irrational reasons connected with the Lohia-Nehru controversies and because family domination emerged within the Congress especially after the crisis of the Emergency in 1975-77 . Such exclusion is patently unfair to Jawaharlal Nehru , attacking whom has become a major organising point for Hindutva . Besides , to remain silent in the face of such attacks has the effect of denying the 20th century history of the Indian nation 's strivings and aspirations , a denial which , of course , the Hindutva forces ardently desire . <p> The crucial issue before the country is the social fascism associated with the ascendancy of the currently ruling forces and their associate organisations . Though it is right in this context to focus on the protection of civil liberties and on safeguards against a repeat of the Emergency , it is necessary to go beyond form and formalism . There is an undeclared social emergency in the country . Developments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2014 General Elections should have left no doubt on that score . The lives and property of members of the minority communities , Dalits and poor peasants are endangered . These forces operate with the support of elements within the Central and provincial state apparatus , the business world and affluent non-resident Indians . The fight against the malaise of corruption is only one part of the larger question of the accountability of power ; the latter subsumes within itself struggles against governmental malfeasance and misfeasance in protecting citizens ' lives and welfare . Such accountability and protection is a solemn obligation also on all political parties , a duty which Gandhi as well as Jawaharlal Nehru fully recognised . <p> 3 . For some possible ideas in this context , see my article , " Three Outstanding Linguistic Issues : Some Suggestions " , Janata , June 26 , 1994 . <p> 4 .

The reference to this speech by Savarkar may be found in Indian Annual Register , 1943 , Vol 2 , p. 10 . <p> 16 . In his analysis of some pre-independence developments , such as the Congress split in 1939 , Batabyal rightly notes Nehru 's attempts to bring about a rapprochement between the two sides . He does not , however , deal with the fact that both Bose and Gandhi were willing to have Narendra Deva as the Congress President .

Why would Salman want to sell someone else 's talent on his show ? Even my votes were n't less ! I figured out that I got huge support from my people who had actually voted for me . But Salman personally did n't like me . Or maybe even the channel thought I am not being how they wanted me to be inside the house . They introduced me to create fights , controversies . But after a while , I was like why should I act so fake ? I am not such a kind of person and ca n't live in lies ! So yea , everything came against me but I am glad I am out .

@@2144237 <h> The legendary mural has continued to evolve and find new meaning , from the time of the Spanish Civil War to Paris attacks . <p> Admittedly , I have not seen the original Guernica . I have heard that for three months after he was commissioned to paint the keynote feature for the Spanish pavilion of the 1937 Paris World Fair , Picasso has been on the lookout for an inspiration . The great artist himself was going through a bad patch both in his personal and professional life at that time . During the Spanish civil war , the democratically elected republican government was under siege from the fascists shepherded by General Francisco Franco . As Picasso had moved base to Paris since 1904 , a few old colleagues representing the Spanish government came to the French capital to talk to him about the painting in the hope of exposing General Franco 's betrayal to the rest of the world . <p> It 's ironical that the most dreadful deeds of war have often led to the foremost artistic expressions .

The survivors of the bombardment are now in their late eighties . One witness said , when he saw the images of the collapsing twin towers in New York , he remembered that fateful day 78 years ago . <p> Ruins of Guernica in 1937 . Courtesy : Associated Press <p> Even in those days , news travelled pretty fast and on May Day more than a million activists flooded the streets of Paris protesting over the Guernica genocide .

Initial responses to Guernica were not encouraging , the German pavilion guide book addressing it as a mixed bag of body parts . What Picasso had to say about the painting was that it was up to the public who view the painting to interpret the symbols as they would identify with them . On the other hand if the painter himself chose to define those symbols , it would be an encroachment into the viewers ' territory of indulgence . Nevertheless , the painting toured Europe and North America fostering popular awareness about the threat fascism posed . <p> Pablo Picasso paints Guernica . Courtesy : National Gallery of Victoria <p> Many in the young generation may not be able to connect the unseen dots that exist between Picasso and Guernica .

As a consequence until his birth centenary in 1981 , when the Spanish government resurrected it as a national treasure in " Reina Sof ? a " , the Spanish National Museum of Modern Art , Guernica had rested in its laurels in New York 's Museum of Modern Art . Having been considered the most significant anti-war arty expression of the 20th century , the Nelson Rockfeller estate donated a tapestry reproduction of the painting to the UN in 1985 . I believe it adorned the outer wall of the Security Council chamber in New York City until 2009 , which I ( as a tourist ) have been fortunate enough to cast a fleeting glance upon , nearly 20 years ago . A few months later when we were moving into a new apartment that had a fairly large drawing-cum-dining cosmos , I thought of the legendary mural . <p> Picasso had never wanted Guernica to be in his native soil as long as it did not revel in civil liberty and democratic governance . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite excited and straight away got it framed and hung it as a centrepiece in our living area . But as days passed by and seeing it most of the time while we were at home , a kind of uneasiness slowly began to creep into our cognisance .

Eventually , we removed it from where it was suspended . A week later , we donated it to the school library that once formed part of our son 's boyhood , who now happens to live in Ontario . Over the weekend , when I told him about what we did about the famed reproduction he appeared to feel proud .

Not surprisingly , in the first two days of the Iraq invasion , 800 missiles were launched by the coalition forces targeting the country 's infrastructure . <p> In October 2004 , Lancet medical journal uploaded on their website the appalling results of a research survey led by Les Roberts of the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in Baltimore . It said that since the beginning of the invasion nearly one hundred thousand Iraqi civilians had perished in coalition air strikes out of which number more than half accounted for women and children . ( These figures have more than doubled in later years . ) <p> Quoting US General Tommy Frank 's admission " we do n't do body counts " , the researchers disapproved the insolence of the coalition war machine in that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ causalities it caused , which apparently was a flagrant disregard for the responsibilities of occupying forces as laid down in the Geneva convention . But how much of it matters to the world now , only the war theatre stretches from the West Bank , to Syria to Afghanistan . Nazi General Erich Ludendorff in his book The Total War had advocated that modern warfare has to incorporate the whole society and does spare no one . Perhaps this argument has legitimised the killing of civilians in the contemporary war theatre , which could be why the military strategists have coined the fancy expression " collateral damage " . <p> During the 1980s ' Soviet occupation of Afghanistan , the death toll had touched the million mark . By the same token , the 2003 invasion of Iraq by the coalition forces and their punctuated withdrawals that took as long as eight years had also resulted in an estimated 2,00,000 deaths , most of them civilians .

Will the hushed whispers in stately corridors that a turnaround in strategy from being unsuccessfully offensive to successfully defensive come true ? <p> From the point when Guernica was conceived until its completion , it continued to evolve . It is said that once Picasso had even considered the inclusion of a red tear drop emerging from the eye of a distraught woman . Paradoxically enough , despite the fact that the tear drop did not make the final cut , Guernica continues to bleed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @

" @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are a ' brand ' in themselves , and so naturally , they are quite brand conscious , " says Swarup Das , senior manager of Sycoriaan Marriage Bureau , one of the oldest firms in the elite matchmaking business . " In their case , the marriage also involves joining one brand to another brand . " It is n't just at the brand level , a marriage can also mean a merger ( in the future or otherwise ) of two successful family businesses . <p> " The ' industry ' the prospective match 's family belongs to , is a criterion we look at . Say the groom 's family has a jewellery business ; there is a feeling that someone who was raised in a similar background will be better able to help .

" The truth is that it is not directly about money , " says Kirtania . " These families -- because they have been rich for so many generations -- are used to a particular culture that comes with money . Our focus is on matching the styles of living , culture and traditions between prospective matches , " says Kirtania . <p> If their clients are choosy , so also are these firms about just who they extend their services to . Subh Lagan counts among its clients the Marwari community 's upper middle class " all the way up to the level of Birlas and Ambanis " . Sanjay Kirtania has had among his clients " Anil Agarwal ( Vedanta ) , the Bangurs and even a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eternity has very strict eligibility criteria and only arranges matches for " affluent global Indians/NRIs in the age range of 24-45 " .

Ultra Rich Match , on the other hand , has a " Royal Package " available to only those clients whose annual incomes are in the Rs 100 crore+ range . <p> And arranging matches for the rich does n't come cheap . Sycoriaan has a basic fee that begins from Rs 30,000 . However , fees can go as high as Rs 3 lakh , says Swarup Das , adding , " But this is still a basic sum as a number of our clients have special preferences and priorities and we customise our services for them , which costs a lot more than Rs 3 lakh . " At Ultra Rich Match , subscription fees are made available at three levels ; the highest is upwards of Rs 1 lakh for the Rs 100 crore income group . " We charge another Rs 1 lakh after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they continue until the marriage is fixed , " says Saurabh Goswami . <p> With so much money on the anvil , these firms ca n't be too careful about ensuring that prospective matches are genuine . At Ultra Rich Match , for instance , " soft searches " and phone calls are the first step , followed by primary research . Next up is a personal visit and collecting documentation . " Then we get references from peers , the social circle etc . It is only after this that we consider verification by a chartered accountant etc , " says Saurabh Goswami . Swarup Das says that a majority of Sycoriaan 's clients are taken on through personal referrals , which ensures authenticity . <p> But for all the money involved , most of these elite matchmakers also assert that the bottom line for them is all about fixing a happy marriage . <p> EliteMatrimony.com 's Murugavel Janakiraman tells us that the matchmaking service takes pride in serving as a " gateway to happy marriages " . And that satisfaction is especially important since the industry is still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to monetise in a sustainable manner at scale and it is a fragmented and unorganised industry , " says Murugavel . <p> That may change as Gen Next among the super rich turns to these elite matchmaking services to find the perfect partner .

@@2148240 <h> Repose Faith in God , Not the Astrologer <p> Children , many people become addicted to astrology due to their anxiety and fear over the future . There is no dearth of people who panic and worry about subjects like marriage , business , job , promotions , and so on . The favourable and unfavourable situations we face in this life are primarily caused by the actions we have performed in past lives . While astrology can give us hints about our fate to some extent and recommend various means to mitigate our negative experiences , it can not prevent them entirely . Therefore , it is important that we make our mind , capable of enduring problems with equanimity . <p> Once a mahatma gave two idols to a king and said , " Be very careful with these idols . If they break , big calamities will befall the kingdom . There may be war or famine or floods . " The king entrusted the idols with a servant , who kept them very carefully in a special place . One day , one of the idols broke . The servant informed the king . The irate king imprisoned him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the kingdom . Seeing this as the fault of the servant , he ordered him to be hung . When asked whether he had any last wish , the servant said , " Before I die , I should be allowed to break the second idol .

Another innocent person should not be forced to die because of the other idol . The mahatma who gave those idols to you said that if the idols break , bad things will happen . He did not say that bad things will happen because the idols broke . The breaking of the idol was merely an indication of the war that was to happen .

A good , intuitive astrologer may be able to recount your past and make fairly accurate predictions about your future . More than an astrologer 's scholarship is his ability to tune his mind with the higher realms . Ultimately , it is the divine grace he is capable of tapping into that gives accuracy to his predictions . <p> Similarly , ultimately only God 's grace can change a situation or an experience we are fated to undergo . It is also important to remember that no karmic situation can be completely averted .

Thus , let us understand that our faith should neither be in the astrologer nor in his predictions , but in that ultimate governing power of this universe : God . The unintelligent and undiscerning actions we 've performed in the past should be counterbalanced with intelligent and discerning actions in the present .

The attackers even hoisted Pakistan and Bangladesh flags and attacked hundreds of vehicles carrying Durga Puja idols , he said " ; 27 . <p> In September 2010 , Islamists launched organised violence on a Durga Puja pandal ( makeshift structure ) in Deganga Bengal , followed by arson and loot of properties of local Hindus . As senior journalist Kanchan Gupta then reported , " Starting September 6 , Haji Nurul Islam ( local TMC MP ) and his thugs , who met with resistance when they tried to demolish the main Durga Mandap that has existed for long , ran riot in Deganga block of West Bengal 's North 24 Parganas district , a short distance from Calcutta .

Humiliated and simmering with rage , abandoned and forsaken by their own in West Bengal and elsewhere , the grieving Hindus of Deganga decided not to celebrate Durga Puja , the most important festival in the Bengali Hindu calendar , this year . The Durga mandaps in Deganga wore a deserted look , the joyous sound of dhaak , the traditional drum , was not heard , and an overwhelming sense of mourning prevailed . Fear played spoil sport , too : If the September riots were any indication , Muslim belligerence was not to be taken lightly . Meanwhile , in a demonstration of crude triumphalism , Haji Nurul Islam and his goons , with the full support and blessings of the Trinamool Congress , have built and inaugurated a new mosque right in the middle of Deganga market .

Yet another report on Deganga riots echoes the same : " Rapid Action Force was called out as members of two communities clashed in the Basirhat sub-division of North 24 Parganas , about 150km from Kolkata , leaving at least 24 persons , including the officer-in-charge of a police station , injured . Reportedly , clashes started around 11pm on Monday and continued intermittently till Tuesday morning when members of one community started digging the pathway leading to a Durga temple at Chattal Pally village in Deganga police station , sources said . " When repeated requests to stop the digging failed , we called the police , " said one of the victims , adding that the clashes started only when the police intervened . Some people reportedly led by local ruffians -- Maqbur Rehman and Mintu Sahji -- attacked shops selectively and ransacked a couple of religious places , sources said , adding that a mob of about 500 persons resorted to massive stone-pelting , injuring three policemen . Officer-in-charge of Deganga , Arup Ghosh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ District Magistrate V Kumar said precautions had been taken and curfew had been clamped in the area .

To make matters worse , the violence - taking place just 45 km from Kolkata - is backed by local MP Nurul Islam . " " Either kill us or give us a reason to live with dignity . They have torched our houses and shops , looted everything we had , " cried Uttam Saha of Saha Communications , who lost goods worth Rs 4.5 lakh to the bedlam on Monday . Niranjan Sarkar of Kartickpur said , " I myself saw Nurul Islam shouting at his men , who came in trucks from Beliaghata , Sashan and Basirhat , to ravage the temple .

" They would return on Id , " he said . ... Earlier , the row reached a flashpoint when members of one community dug up the pathway leading to a Durga temple at Chattal Pally village , barely 100 metres from the Deganga police station . They attacked the other community members , when they were requested to stop the digging . The land , which originally belonged to Rani Rashmani of Kolkata , is now disputed . Part of it is used as a graveyard and another part by the Durga Puja committee for the past 40 years . A narrow road slices the two pieces of land .

The rioters looted at least 250 shops , torched 50 houses and desecrated five temples since Monday afternoon as punishment for raising objections to digging the pathway leading to the Durga Puja pandal . " They did not only burn the Kakra Mirza Nagar Kali temple , but also desecrated the Mother goddess , " complained another resident ; 82 . <p> In Kannauj , Durga Puja procession was attacked by Islamists and curfew was imposed in the area 26 . The newschannel Zee News is quoted as saying , " SP Kalanidhi Naithani said the prohibitory orders were imposed following tension here over yesterday 's clash at the Lakhan tri-section after some people allegedly opened fire and hurled brickbats at a procession for the immersion of Durga idols ; " 26 . <p> Similar attacks on Durga Puja processions were reported from Allahabad , Bulandshahr and Raebareli .

Krishna Veer , a police @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clashes broke out in Allahabad and Raebareli , leaving five people injured " . <p> In Hooghly district , Durga idols were vandalised during Durga Puja as chronicled in IndiaFacts 25 . In Nandlalpur , in Maldah District , the procession to immerse Goddess Durga at the Charianantapur Ghat was attacked by the Islamists on October 30 , 2015 71 . In Harua village , PS Pursurah , Hooghly district , twenty five Kali idols were beheaded by the Islamists on November 8 , 2015 70 . <p> The other Abrahamism is not to be outdone either . Christianist terrorists have long targeted the Hindus and Bengalis in the North East . In particular , the National Liberation Front of Tripura ( NLFT ) , a self-confessed Christianist group , has carried out several attacks on Durga Puja 28 . In 2008 , the NLFT set off bombs in Agartala during Durga Puja as a strike against Hindus . Further , in 1999 and 2000 , the NLFT had issued bans on the Durga Puja 29 . As Abhinav Prakash , a research scholar of Jawaharlal Nehru University ( JNU @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christian magazine , Forward Press , reprinted the ' re-interpretation ' of the Durga Puja story , which was first published in an obscure hate magazine named Yadav-Shakti . The story asserts that Durga Puja has its origin in the Aryan invasion of India . According to it , Mahishasura was a just and valiant defender of a buffalo-rearing tribe , which is equated with the Yadavs of today . The Aryans failed to defeat him in open battle , so they hired a prostitute called Durga to seduce and kill him by treachery . Durga honeymooned with Mahishasura for several days and killed him on the ninth day . Thereafter , the Aryans committed a large-scale massacre on the tenth day , which is now celebrated as Vijayadashmi . While the original story was just a perversion of the sacred lore with wild speculations peppered with ' maybe ' , ' there might have been ' , it metamorphosed under the poisonous pen of Forward Press and was presented as an authentic historical account . In 2011 , it was used a poster in JNU by AIBSF during Durga @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ borne the brunt of attacks from Islamists and Christians , other Hindu public worship and festivals have not been spared either . These follow from the injunctions left by Islamist scholars such as Hamdani , as recorded in the prequel to this article ( Part I ) . In Kashmir , Hindu Yatras and festivals have been routinely attacked . The Amarnath Yatra has been subjected to repeated attacks by Islamist terrorists , with many fatalities and injuries 22 , 23 , 24 . Then , in August 2014 , Hindus were denied permission to conduct the Kousar Nag Yatra 19 ( we describe this episode in detail later ) . <p> The Hindu festivals in the districts of West Bengal where Muslims constitute a substantial component of the demographics have encountered similar destiny . On January 28 , 2015 , Saraswati idols were broken by Islamists during an immersion procession at Bhawanipur More of Kharagpur in West Medinipur district ( near Golbazar market ) . The procession was taken out by scheduled tribe youth of the Adivasi dominated area Singhpara of Debalpur , who were attacked with swords and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years was rushed to and admitted in Kharagpur Sub-Divisional Hospital ( was kept at 1st floor Bed No. 23 ) and FIR lodged immediately at Kharagpur ( Town ) police station against five known Islamist miscreants , who were later identified by the Adivasi Hindu boys . Complainants have subsequently been harassed by police , administration and local TMC councilors , many of the complainants are absconding now 83 . As often , local media did not follow this incident up . <p> Nonetheless , this is quite consistent with the trend reported in the following ( translated ) report from Bartoman , a leading Bengali newspaper in West Bengal : <p> " Islamists are targeting Hindu religious and social festivals in different villages of Murshidabad district through Talibani fatwas issues at regular intervals . Often times , they are succeeding owing to the inaction of police . The Bharat Sebashram Sangha of Beladanga has been a recent victim .

Local Hindus however fear that the traditional festival of Karthik contest will have to be eventually discontinued because processions with Karthik idols will not be permitted . Earlier , in 2010 March , a fatwa was issued that Saraswati Puja must be stopped in the Beladanga Jhautala High School.Everyone surrendered to the fundamentalists and silently accepted the fatwa . In the same school , it was later demanded that a separate room must be provided where the four Muslim teachers can perform their daily namaz . Hindu students demanded that they be allowed to perform their annual Saraswati Puja if Muslim teachers are allowed separate facilities for performing namaz . Then a crowd of about 10,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hindu families livimg in the village were ransacked . Roads were blocked using trees to prevent the arrival of police .

The participants of the processions had to leave relinquishing the idol on the road . Later police did the immersion . Similarly , attacks were organised in 2011 on the annual Chaitra Sankranti fair in Panchkhupi . <p> After retirement , a teacher in the Amtala High School had planned to place a statue of Swami Vivekananda in the school courtyard , using his personal savings . He was thwarted by the obstructionist activities of Islamic fundamentalists . This incident has happened this September . Statues of renowned individuals were installed on the walls of the Mapukuria and Natunpara schools , utilising the funds that were not used in the complete education mission . Those statues were all destroyed . <p> In the last three to four years , fundamentalist fatwas have stopped the annual Saraswati Puja in at least five schools @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were decorating their courtyard with the traditional Alpana . They were stopped from doing so on the pretext that such decorations were against Islam .

Team India responded to the ebullience of Kohli in Tests as winning was all that mattered . <p> NEW DELHI : The biggest Indian cricket news in 2015 all developed off the field , either in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ courtroom intrigues . Hushed confabulations among men in suits followed raucous open-forum attacks across Parliament to press club . A Test match was conducted by a legal doyen . A state government head was sued by a Union minister . Two leading IPL teams were given marching orders . <p> The game had a rough time , perhaps its roughest since the match-fixing scandal broke at the turn of the millennium . This was Indian cricket 's year of being loud , often ugly loud . Of being in-your-face , pummelled and torn by forces alternately hostile and hospitable , depending on which version was loudest on the day . In keeping with the tenor , a piercing revolution took place on the field too . Virat Kohli , he of the brash manner , persuasive talk and fierce combat-readiness , discovered winning ways as Test captain . Kohli left us all breathless with his energy , impressed with his enterprise and bemused at his audacity . <p> The only person who was quiet , even when he spoke at length , was MS Dhoni . He seemed out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ successful sportsman - a slow crawl to athletic obscurity as body ages and the mind tires . The limited-overs skipper is still around , and may be so for a while , but in 2015 , for the first time since 2007 , MS Dhoni offered glimpses of leading on reputation - a euphemism for having ceased to be relevant . <p> Interestingly , he relinquished captaincy in the longer format first , instead of letting the hungry , young leader test the waters in limited-overs cricket as is the norm . <p> In spite of a good World Cup this year - in which Dhoni orchestrated seven straight wins before India fell to the eventual champions - Test cricket hogged headlines because Kohli 's push for results made it unpredictable , watchable , controversial and often deliciously debatable . Dhoni did n't win a single ODI series or tournament as India lost to Bangladesh away and to South Africa at home , but more lasting than the immediate result was the aftertaste of an ODI stratagem which has run its course . <p> Dhoni was silent even when , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ captaincy in Melbourne in typically obtuse fashion , talking about everything from PETA to pace bowlers except the one thing on his mind . The indications had arrived a few weeks before , of course , when in his absence Kohli oh-so-nearly orchestrated a foolhardy , bravura Indian performance in Adelaide , talking up - in the company of supportive team director Ravi Shastri - a new-found willingness to risk defeat for victory , to punt on pace and wicket-taking prowess , to attack relentlessly with the bat even when faced with a logically insurmountable target . It all ended in defeat , of course , but for the first time in a long while in Indian cricket , a defeat did n't matter - the need for injecting fresh ideas into a jaded outfit was a theme recognized all the way from the January Sydney Test , which followed after Melbourne , right up to December in Delhi and the series win against South Africa . A defeat in Galle , somewhat similar to Adelaide in the frittering away of a memorable opportunity , was followed by a turnaround @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 22 years . Kohli had shown he could be flexible enough to recognize the flaws and chip away at the shortcomings , all the while relentlessly enforcing his core beliefs on the team . <p> ( PTI Photo ) <p> The year began with Kohli betraying his nerves , changing bowlers after every over in a session at the SCG , to adroitly applying the slow choke on opposition batsmen at the SSC and Kotla with an impressive interplay of attacking fields and penetrative spin options . He was patience personified when there were partnerships and a dynamo when it came to reviving flagging team spirit . <p> This willing to evolve offered reassurance that Kohli was man for the job , though his strengths were unfairly contrasted with MS Dhoni 's failings , including a new-found tendency to be unsteady in the face of criticism . The team , after all , was no longer always MSD 's to command . <p> Wins and losses aside , Dhoni also failed to recognize that an opportunity for communication , or connection , passed him by this year , maybe both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the longwinded explanations which said a lot but revealed nothing , the disdain for debate , all went against him . There was a public run-down for his pacers when the same personnel were being taught to bring a champion mentality to the table in the other format . An ugly jibe at Ajinkya Rahane , who was India 's best Test batsman this year across conditions , was followed by Rahane 's appointment to ODI captaincy for a tour of Zimbabwe . An uncharacteristic barge into an opposition bowler , a tendency to offer to resign after every big loss , these were all signs that Dhoni was n't his usual self . <p> An impetuous Kohli was n't immune to skirmishes with the mass media either -witness his heated defence of the doctoring of pitches for the SA home series , or the run-in with a journo during the World Cup -but on most cricket matters he was forthright and earnest , and by being a bowler 's captain unlike Dhoni , he presided over an important turnaround in India 's approach to Test cricket . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man of the moment to lead across formats , if the selectors are so inclined . <p> Some cricketing empires fell this year but strangely , it may be time to celebrate this temporary clash of philosophies in the dressing room . To suggest differences may lead to discord is doing both men 's leadership capabilities a disservice - Kohli would do well to borrow some of Dhoni 's still - famed equanimity even as the more experienced campaigner seeks to pull a few remaining rabbits out of the hat . <p> This year , Kohli sought to win at all cost . In future , he may come across a line he must not cross . It 's best if Kohli identifies that line now , while Dhoni is still around to temper young steel . <p> RELATED <h> From around the web <h> More from The Times of India <p> Recommended By Colombia <h> From Around the Web <h> More From The Times of India <p> Recommended By Colombia <h> Comments <p> Characters Remaining : 3000 <h> OR PROCEED WITHOUT REGISTRATION <p> Share on Twitter <h> SIGN IN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obscene , defamatory or inflammatory , and do not indulge in personal attacks , name calling or inciting hatred against any community .

One , are they working on something people want ? Second , in what form are people willing to consume it ? Third , is there any willingness to pay ( and who will that be ) ? <p> Getting evidence for these three questions will require founders to go out into the real world and meet real people . This will help them understand whether the problems they are trying to address are real , and where they exist .

What if our first version of the product is not good enough ? Should we not hire a couple more programmers to build some more features quickly ? <p> The list can be expanded . But as much as these temptations are real , they are also distractions . They suck away founders ' time and create a false sense of progress . They also are wrong areas to focus on especially in the early stages . There is a time and place when these questions become important . But that is certainly not in your first few days . <p> So , how do you know if you are making progress ? Contrary to what most founders believe , there must be several other teams working on exactly the same idea -- stealth-mode or otherwise ! In fact , at Axilor , in the first week of our accelerator programme , we ask the startups to identify other startups who are working on similar ideas . In most cases , the number always runs into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your insurance ? The only insurance in the early stages of working on an idea is the number of proprietary insights you have . This could be about your customers , competition , alternatives , experience -- anything important to the idea . <p> The more specific these insights are , the better . ' People between 28-35 years of age owning cars that are more than two years old and looking to buy their next car in the next 12-18 months are interested in using our service ' is a good example of a specific insight compared to ' a lot of people find our idea interesting ' . The key difference between the two is that the second one you can come up with yourselves , the first one you can not ! <p> The early stages of a startup are just a series of experiments .

In fact , this kind of experiment was displayed in Delhi as part of Nehru Shatabdi Natya Samaroh in 1989 by Sangeet Natak Akademi featuring 15 masterpieces by great Indian theatre practitioners , including " Kallol " ( Bengali ) by Utpal Dutt and Habib Tanvir 's " Agra Bazar " ( Urdu ) . Two decades ago Abhinav Rangmandal did the same experiment by staging Habib 's six plays at Ujjain . The connoisseurs of the arts of the Indore city gave tremendous response to this six day festival , experimenting to recapture the joy and excitement these productions evoked years ago when these were premiered . It was also an event to celebrate the four decades creative journey of Bansi Kaul , making Madhya Pradesh his home , establishing Rang Vidushhak in Bhopal and enriching contemporary Indian theatre as a director . <p> The convenor of the Rang-Bansi and the president of Abhinav Rang Mandal , Sharad Sharma struggled to raise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for financial assistance to the government of Madhya Pradesh remained unanswered . Thanks to the support of National School of Drama , Delhi , Indore Police Department and the theatre lovers of Indore , it was possible for the organisers to make the festival a grand success . The collections from ticket sale was Rs.73,000 . This is something unprecedented , especially in the Hindi belt where ticketed shows are few and far between . <p> Recipient of Padma Shri , Bansi Kaul has won several awards , including the Sangeet Natak Akademi Award . He reached the acme of his art the hard way . Starting as cinema poster painter and later painting natural scenery for heavy trucks , he graduated from National School of Drama , engaging himself on exploring the possibility to innovate a vibrant theatre form based on traditional and folk elements . He has also studied the art of wrestlers , acrobats and kabaddi players . He has fascination for circus clowns .

As a designer , he treads two worlds -- the designer of mega events with plenty of resources and the designer of the theatrical productions suffering from utter paucity of funds . <p> The Rang-Bansi opened with the staging of " Saudagar " , an adaptation in Hindi by Shrikant Kishore from Bertolt Brecht 's " The Exception and the Rule " . The play reveals the class conflict in a capitalist mode of production . A merchant kills his innocent worker in cold blood . The court acquits the murderer .

There is mystery about his birth place , parentage and the same mystery continues to shroud about the rumour of his death and sudden survival . It illustrates the callousness of society and man 's innate will power to survive even in the most brutal conditions . Kanhaiyalal Kaithwas creates an outstanding portrait of Rajua which evokes strong fillings of laughter , hate , sympathy and enigma . <p> Bansi 's third play that featured at the festival was " Kahan Kabir " .

The conflict is resolved metaphorically to stress the point that Kabir 's message is equally relevant to all mankind irrespective of religious differences . <p> Music composed by Anjana Puri , who also leads the chorus in rendering Kabir 's verses , is the soul of the production . The choreography , the dramatic action and music are all blended into an artistic whole . <p> Adapted by Rajesh Joshi from Chinese folktale " Three Promotion in Succession " included in an anthology of folktales by Liu Baorui , " Seedi Dar Seedi Urf Tukke Pe Tukka " is a comedy that has element of farce , acrobats , wrestling and music with colourful costumes and painted faces of the performers .

The way Uday delivers his lines in typically Bhopali Urdu accent is another source of hilarious moments . With his sheer luck and wit , he outwits his highly educated rivals but his Tukku is magnanimous who forgives his conspirators doing their utmost to expose him .

Written by Swadesh Deepak , the play was discovered by Sahitya Kala Parishad and staged under the direction of Ranjit Kapur about two and a half decades ago at Shri Ram Centre , Delhi .

@@2946237 <h> Potential of regenerative medicine <p> January 8 , 2015 <p> Application of stem cell-based therapies will be the turning point in the treatment of hitherto inadequately treated or incurable diseases of the 21st century . But we urgently need stem cell regulations as a deterrent to indiscriminate use of stem cell products . An insight by Dr Chandra Viswanathan , Head , Regenerative Medicine , Reliance Life Sciences <p> Stem cells are special cells which are able to differentiate into either fewer cell types , called the multipotent adult stem cells or most cell types called the pluripotent embryonic stem cells , while self-renewing extensively to generate more stem cells . Human Embryonic stem cells ( hESCs ) are examples of pluripotent cells and adult stem cells like the Mesenchymal stem cells ( MSCs ) are multi-potent in nature . Because of their potency of differentiation , stem cells are often foreseen as the hope of novel cell replacement based therapies to regenerate tissues/ organs damaged by injury or disease . Transplantation of stem cells or their derivatives into respective tissues or organs , is considered as one of the most promising remedies for hitherto incurable diseases . <p> Dr Chandra Viswanathan <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become increasingly clear that realisation of this intuitively logical concept is far more complex than originally envisaged . Thus , the scope of regenerative medicine extends much beyond the simple paradigm of providing new building blocks to a failing organ , to processes that dynamically alters the molecular landscape within the tissue via a number of paracrine factors and other multiple potential reparative processes . <p> Even though the feasibility and safety of stem cell use has been reasonably established by several groups , the superior efficacy of stem cell therapy in clinical settings seems to be better only in certain clinical conditions so far . All current efforts are directed towards this . <p> Due to ethical issues involved regarding harvest of hE S , the propensity for uncontrolled growth in vivo and the likely rejection upon differentiation , clinical focus shifted to the adult-derived phenotypes . The advent of bioengineered pluripotent stem cells from adult somatic tissues called the Induced Pluripotent cells , iPSCs has revolutionised the potential availability and applicability of personalised stem cells . The bioengineered platform has the potential to bypass the ethical and allogeneic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be reprogrammed back to the embryonic phenotype and the opportunity to utilise the ' autologous ' approach . As newer sources of pluripotent cells provide the capacity to achieve specified tissue differentiation from all three germinal layers , newer enabling technologies will probably be a stepping stone to maximise repair potency and has now ignited renewed clinical interest . Genomic and proteomic evaluation of adult stem cells will throw more light on the small molecule development for the future , help in companion diagnostics , and make Theranostics very significant . <p> Such approaches would move na ? ve ' first generation ' stem cells from achieving a specific limited therapeutic objective to another level of understanding delivery , evaluation of the risks and benefits of repeat therapy and use of well characterised , lineage specified stem cells , transplanted either alone or in combination , which will mark the beginning of ' second generation ' stem cell medicine . <p> So far , only haematopoietic stem cells based medical treatment is approved in the management of several acquired and congenital haematological disorders . As an extension to this , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unique abilities . Several thousand cord blood transplants have been so far been conducted , and is now serving as an alternative to bone marrow transplants . <p> Reliance Life Sciences established the first public cord blood repository in this part of the world , and is licensed by the Drug Controller General of India ( DCG ( I ) ) , India . In the last few years , we have supplied cord blood grafts to at least 75 patients , admitted to various institutes of the country . The other interesting stem cell type are the MSCs , initially isolated derived from the bone marrow , but now even from other sources like the umbilical cord tissue , umbilical cord blood , placental blood , adipose tissue , etc . MSCs are self-renewing , multi-potential , easy to cultivate , and immune modulatory in nature and hence are under extensive research to evaluate its potential in treating several hitherto unmet medical needs . These can differentiate into cells of mesodermal , ectodermal and endodermal origin . This along with their property to secreting soluble factors help induce an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ based therapies . Reliance Life Sciences is actively researching the applicability of these cells in diabetes , cirrhosis , wound healing , neurological disorders , closely adhering to the National stem cell guidelines released by the ICMR in 2013 , and ably supported by the Institutional Stem Cell Ethics Committee . <p> Reliance Life Sciences has been a pioneer in stem cell research with several ' firsts ' to credit . It has a significant commitment to developing stem cell therapies , right from research , cell processing in cGMP facilities , clinical research and clinical practice . There is no other player in India comparable to Reliance Life Sciences in the stem cell therapy domain . <p> Limitations <p> Reliance Life Sciences has also completed clinical trials after regulatory approvals , using MSCs derived from the patient 's own bone marrow for myocardial infarction , Parkinson 's disease , spinal cord injury , application of stem cell-based therapies for stable vitiligo , non-healing diabetic ulcers , and autologous conjuctival and limbal stem cell graft . The strategy now is to see the effect of cell combinations at R&amp;D and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' approaches are less accepted by stem cell ethics committees and approving bodies . <p> The other limitation for stem cell research in India is the lack of sufficient funds for conduct of large clinical trials and access to appropriate preclinical disease models . The funding agencies need to step up their support further , in this area . We believe and as can be seen from scores of publications from global researchers , through stem cells , the potential to treat a wide range of disease conditions ( viz. spinal injury , muscular dystrophy , Parkinson 's disease , multiple sclerosis , diabetes , retinitis pigmentosa , ALS etc . ) <p> In India , there are multiple agencies which directly or indirectly govern stem cell research . i.e. Department of Biotechnology ( DBT ) , Indian Council of Medical Research ( ICMR ) and the DCG ( I ) . The revised comprehensive guidelines from the ICMR in India is aimed at guiding researchers and indirectly ensures ethical and responsible conduct of stem cell research . The efforts of the International Society for Stem Cell Research ( ISSCR @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standards is a reflection of this global realisation . <p> The main concern in India now , is the absence of stem cell regulations , without which the translation is taking too long despite stem cell committees ' support with review of applications from industry and academia . This must come into force very soon , as it can be a deterrent to the mushrooming of stem cell clinics and indiscriminate use of stem cell products . <p> The way ahead <p> To keep the promise of cell-based therapies , we have miles and miles to tread . Although clinical trials of stem cell therapy have been criticised by a few as being premature , there is no substitute for the human model as stem cell therapies enter the era of translation . The pace of medical and scientific advance is gaining significant momentum , and the travel from the bench to the bedside takes time and patience and close collaboration among multiple disciplines alone will define success . With more and more new molecules under development , the present challenges faced by this industry feels the need for organ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ S and adult stem cell-based toxicity experiments . <p> With the market size expected to touch the $200 million mark by the end of this decade , stem cell-based therapies will be a major component of the new era medicine . When results expected are significant , let us not dwell on the enormous cost implications . There are at least about 200 clinical trials in various stages registered in various websites , but results are yet to come ! <p> Regenerative medicine , comprising stem cell therapies and tissue engineered products , is still at a nascent stage in India . It is expected to be definitely useful for those suffering from diabetes , cardiovascular disorders , neurological disorders , burns and wounds , osteoarthritis , osteoporosis , bone , cartilage ( joints and replacements ) , liver disorders , congenital abnormalities and neoplasms . <p> Going by the results of the experiments from all corners of the globe , stem cell medicine and tissue engineered-based stem cell devices will find a major place in medical prescriptions in the next five to 10 years ' time frame . With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next 20 years , regenerative medicine will be the standard of care for replacing all tissue/ organ systems in the body , in addition to its extensive industrial use for pharmaceutical testing . <p> A conducive environment for international collaboration , industry academia relationships , safeguarding patents on process and products will instill the much needed confidence that researchers look forward to . In the coming months , we also hope to achieve major milestones starting with establishment of standards for the regulatory approvals and fast track review of applications within a defined time frame . <p> Just as discovery and usage of penicillin was the inflection point in the fight against infectious diseases , application of stem cell based therapies will be the turning point in the treatment of hitherto inadequately treated or incurable diseases of the 21st century . <h> About <p> Express Pharma , first published as Express Pharma Pulse in 1994 , is today India 's leading business fortnightly for the pharmaceutical industry .

" We expect Xiaomi to build an ecosystem of Mi devices and apps for the home , office and car . " <p> Lei 's push has credibility because of Xiaomi 's roots in software . The Beijing-based company only started selling phones after developing an adaptation of Google 's Android software called MIUI , which now has more than 85 million users worldwide . Xiaomi is the world 's fastest-growing smartphone maker and ranks No. 3 globally . <p> Xiaomi has added applications -- including data backup , music and a photo gallery -- and offered themes that allow devices to be customized . <p> The company followed with a popular instant-messaging app , cloud services and software to explore restaurants , purchase movie tickets , track packages and make medical appointments . <p> " We have made significant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smart products , " Lei said in a letter to employees this month .

" But Xiaomi has its work cut out to develop the scale of applications , software and services to fight the big giants .

The company in December raised $1.1 billion from investors , including Yuri Milner , who said Xiaomi 's valuation could reach $100 billion . <p> Startup moves After conquering its home market with smartphones and adding web-connected TVs and set-top boxes , Xiaomi knows that to make its system stronger it ca n't develop all the pieces itself .

As for the professors , in the US they have created an entirely new religion that might be called " American collegiate Islam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beheading of apostates and unbelievers and the enslavement of their women are simply edited out . Students at Georgetown University are even taught that Islam is the only religion that condemns terrorism as such -- a misrepresentation of the sin of haraba , which just means " destruction " . <p> While presidents , prime ministers , professors and priests cut increasingly ridiculous figures as they follow each act of Islamic violence with renewed praise for the " beauty " of Islam , and its very , very , peaceful nature , the effect on the hard-working , much-sacrificing parents who are trying to bring up post-Islamic children is much less funny . Having recited all the reasons for their choice -- bombings , beheadings , mass-killings and kidnappings from the Philippines to Nigeria , from Boston to Paris -- they are confronted by their own children citing the feckless endorsements of an imaginary Islam by presidents , prime ministers , professors and priests . <p> This is the betrayal of freedom . <p> Let Muslim preachers defend their religion , though they would be better employed in cutting out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of course nobody in authority -- or not -- should endorse extremist calls for revenge or persecution . <p> But non-Muslim authority figures should stop legitimizing Islam as it is , for that means legitimizing Islamic violence , and de-legitimizing the parents who are striving to educate new generations of post-Islamic youth ready to uphold liberal democracy . <p> Edward N.

Considering international titles are now easily available @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indian authors ? <p> Even till the 1990s , Indian publishers were not interested in children 's books .

Still , for most publishers , children 's books are low priority even though it is the fastest growing segment . <p> Compared to the foreign books , our books are still not as smartly written , designed or printed . But we are getting there . <p> This book is part of a series called " World 's Worst " . The diary format happened when I was doing the first book , " Secret Diary of the World 's Worst Cook .

Now it is more about everyday life , secret adventures and is also age specific . Do you see this shift contributing to our children 's reading habit ? <p> It was all folk and fairy tales because the publishers did not think anything else will sell . They scare easily , I 'm afraid . Now that our books are selling , they are open to new ideas . I talk a lot to kids and a book is often a result of what they tell me . " The Secret Diary of the World 's Worst Friend " started with a session with teenagers where they talked about peer pressure . So kids guide me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I have no idea if I influence their reading habits or not . <p> We now have children 's book festivals . But they primarily concentrate on English books , not our regional writings which have a lot to offer to the genre . <p> Sadly , the literature festivals are more about finding sponsors and making money . We need language festivals and as people read more , I 'm hoping they will start soon . Some languages like Bengali , Tamil and Marathi have always had a rich tradition of children 's writing . For example , even today , most Bengali writers do books for adults and children as well . We also need language magazines that open a space for language writers to learn their craft . <p> You also wrote a book on the environment recently . <p> I have done a set of four books for TERI about Indians who spoke of the environment , like Ashoka and Gandhiji , or loved nature , like Tagore .

" That 's as early as I can remember , " she says . " My romance with fabric started at an early age , when I sewed my own clothes .

Being familiar with Lonavla , the holiday spot that she frequented with her family since school days , Khandelwal began her journey from here . " There was no documentation available to guide us in our search , " she says , adding that she hopes the book inspires researchers on the subject of quilts to study it in greater detail . <p> The first thing that Khandelwal and her team spotted on a curve on the road in Kamshet , on the outskirts of Lonavala as they undertook their trip was a godhari drying in the sun .

@@3010237 <h> ' Hawala at Midnight ' is just the latest example of irresponsible media coverage of corruption <h> Photo Credit : Sam Panthaky/AFP <p> 68K <p> Total Views <p> With four days to go until the Delhi elections , the top two Twitter trends in India are #HawalaAtMidnight and #AAPFundingScam , the former a hashtag popularised by Times Now and the Times of India . The timing of the allegations -- the donations in question were made 10 months ago -- suggest that they are a desperate attempt to check an Aam Aadmi Party surge that has been acknowledged even by the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh mouthpiece Organiser . Whether or not this attempt is successful , both print and television media have covered the so-called scam with shameful inaccuracy . The reporting on claims that AAP received large donations from dubious companies that were fronts for money laundering is only the latest example of irresponsible media coverage of political corruption . <p> The mere use of the words " hawala " and " money laundering " in this case borders on yellow journalism . Even the Bharatiya Janata Party -- which compelled three senior ministers , Arun Jaitley , Piyush Goyal and Nirmala Sitharaman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favour of attacking Arvind Kejriwal -- has not accused the politician or his party of committing any illegality . Neither the BJP nor the Congress dispute Kejriwal 's assertion that the donations in question were received by cheque . <p> Any suggestion of illegality is restricted to the four companies that made the donations . Nirmala Sitharaman may have rhetorically referred to Keriwal as a chor , but she has declined either to accuse him of a specific crime or to call for an investigation ( only AAP itself has done the latter ) . No evidence has been offered either by AVAM , the group that made the allegations , or by the BJP to support their claims that AAP is guilty of hawala transactions or money laundering . <p> Grave incident <p> None of this is to downplay the seriousness of AAP receiving large donations of highly dubious provenance . From its inception , the party has employed a tone of relentless sanctimony , and it is not enough to say that the BJP and Congress have no credibility on the question of political funding . AAP deserves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But its failings in this case appear to be moral , not legal . It is guilty of negligence and perhaps of hypocrisy , but not -- at least on all the evidence presented -- of hawala or money laundering . <p> Contrary to the allegation made by some AAP supporters , the sensationalist media coverage does not reflect an anti-AAP bias . Network 18 aside , there is no such systematic bias in the English-language media . Indeed , AAP owes its rise more than any other party to the quantity and nature of its media coverage , testament to the media 's fixation with Delhi . It is , rather , sadly representative of the way in which allegations of corruption have been reported in recent years . <p> The classic case of dangerously misleading media coverage is the 2G scam . The mere fact that this was almost universally reported , especially in headlines , as the " 1.76 lakh crore 2G scam " gave the impression that A Raja and the United Progressive Alliance government had pocketed that sum of money . The alleged loss was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by both the National Democratic Alliance and the UPA . But these facts were presented as the flimsy defence of criminals whose guilt was beyond question . <p> Serious consequences <p> The media 's promotion of the 1.76 lakh crore figure gave rise to the popular image of the UPA as a government not merely corrupt but uniquely corrupt . The 2G scam had a direct influence on the 2011 assembly elections in Tamil Nadu and , more indirectly , on the 2014 Lok Sabha elections . The Central Bureau of Investigation inquiry into the allocation did raise serious questions of crony capitalism . But coupled with its veneration of former Comptroller and Attorney General Vinod Rai , a man who exposed no criminality , as the voice of honesty , the media 's use of the 1.76 lakh crore figure seriously misconstrued the nature and scope of the so-called scam with far-reaching political consequences . <p> There are at least three factors driving inaccurate or exaggerated coverage of corruption . The first is the rise of he-said she-said journalism at the expense of reporting and , in particular , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AAP cases , the media were guilty of uncritically reporting allegations made by groups that lacked credibility , and in particular of adopting language and figures -- " hawala " , " 1.76 lakh crore " -- that made for good headlines but were unsupported by fact . This in keeping with a wider trend , particularly prevalent in television news , of allowing politicians to throw mud at opponents without having their accusations fact-checked or even questioned by journalists . The return from political obscurity of Subramanian Swamy -- who not coincidentally is currently fighting to decriminalise libel in India -- embodies this new climate of fact-free accusation . <p> Scams are good news <p> The second factor is simply that scams are good for circulation and TV ratings , not to mention Twitter trends . No political issue unites the English-language audience as much as political corruption , and if allegations of corruption are simultaneously exaggerated and reported as fact , they circulate all the quicker . As the British Prime Minister James Callaghan once ruefully remarked , " A lie can be halfway around the world before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is this truer than in India . <p> Finally , the media reports allegations of corruption in much the same way as it reports other kinds of crime , most notably rape and murder -- reserving for itself the role of both prosecution and judge , and operating under the principle of guilty until proven innocent . This is , in part , a response to the perception that the CBI is no more than a tool of the government of the day , and the failure of the courts to speedily or effectively punish corruption . The two prominent politicians jailed for corruption in recent years , Jayalithaa and Laloo Prasad Yadav , were convicted after 18 and 17 years respectively . In this climate , the public are more than happy to allow the press and television to determine matters of guilt or innocence . <p> We thus have a tragic situation in which the area in which the media is most capable of serving the public interest -- by exposing the wrongdoings of elected representatives -- is an area where journalists are actually causing sustained harm to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that " comment is free , but facts are sacred " was once the most famous expression of journalistic ethics .

Jumpstart IoT is a platform that carriers can use to provide value added services to enterprise customers , who can use the system for greater efficiencies in areas such as inventory management with the use of automated sensors that can send updates using the cellular network . <p> In the run-up to the Nasscom India Leadership Forum taking place in Mumbai this week , we spoke to Jagdish Mitra , Head Mobility Business and Large Deals , Tech Mahindra , who talked at length about the company 's role in the Internet of Things space , and how we are going to see both consumer level products , and smart cities , both of which leverage the concept of IoT . <p> " The consumer market for cellular networks in India is a pretty mature market , " says Mitra , " so today , the carriers need to sell to enterprise .

If you see a parent walking around the mall with a two-year- old clamped to his leg , it means Operation Barnacle has been a success . <p> And so , if I could , I 'd tell my former self to enjoy all the ' personal space ' she can before motherhood . But I 'd also tell her that having your own space is n't everything . That sometimes , having a warm little body snuggled against you at night , or having a baby sleeping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and incredibly fulfilling sensations . That after a few years of motherhood , you 'll reach the point that when your child is n't constantly in your space , you 'll feel like something is missing .

In case of diesel , the charges would come down by one paisa , he said . <p> Meanwhile , looking to underline his ministry 's approach in drawing up the budget , Prabhu said , " Till now we used to make rail budget for others .

@@3069240 <h> Why Rajan is wrong : What RBI needs is a good dose of Appellate Raj <p> The central question in India 's journey , today , is that of constructing state capacity . How should laws , agencies , processes and accountability be designed to engender high performance ? In a recent speech titled Democracy , inclusion and prosperity , ( RBI Governor ) Raghuram Rajan talks about the joint process of evolution of economics , politics and the State . Rajan provides a brief summary of the framework articulated in the first of Francis Fukuyama 's twovolumes on political development . Fukuyama uses three pillars to trace political development globally : State-building , rule of law , and accountable government . <p> RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan . <p> Late in the speech , he asserts that India is unique in having built democratic accountability and rule of law before building a strong government . He argues that there is a conflict between government accountability and government capacity , and since checks and balances make it difficult for the government to do its job , we should focus more on State-building and less on accountability . In other words , we have plenty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the latter . The key text is : <p> An important difference from the historical experience of other countries is that elsewhere typically strong government has emerged there first , and it is then restrained by rule of law and democratic accountability . In India , we have the opposite situation today , with strong institutions like the judiciary , opposition parties , the free press , and NGOs , whose aim is to check government excess . However , necessary government function is sometimes hard to distinguish from excess . We will have to strengthen government ( and regulatory ) capability resisting the temptation to implant layers and layers of checks and balances even before capacity has taken root . We must choose a happy medium between giving the administration unchecked power and creating complete paralysis , recognizing that our task is different from the one that confronted the West when it developed , or even the task faced by other Asian economies . <p> For instance , a business approval process that mandates numerous government surveys in remote areas should also consider our administrative capacity to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not provide for that capacity , it ensures there will be no movement forward . Similarly , if we create a multiple appellate process against government or regulatory action that is slow and undiscriminating , we contain government excess but also risk halting necessary government actions . If the government or regulator is less effective in preparing its case than private parties , we ensure that the appellate process largely biases justice towards those who have the resources to use it , rather than rectifying a miscarriage of justice . So in thinking through reforms , we may want to move from the theoretical ideal of how a system might work in a country with enormous administrative capacity , to how it would work in the actual Indian situation . Let me emphasize , we need " checks and balance " , but we should ensure a balance of checks . We can not have escaped from the License Permit Raj only to end up in the Appellate Raj ! <p> In this article , we disagree with this argument . We analyse RBI in some detail as an example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We see the argument above as a restatement of the present mores of the Indian State . This way of thinking is integral to the poor outcomes that we see in India today , and yields low State capacity and abuses of power . The essence of making progress on the construction of liberal democracy in India , and of building State capacity , is to break with this position . <h> The three big phrases in this debate <p> State-building . Fukuyama uses the term State ' in the sense that Max Weber used it : An organisation deploying a legitimate monopoly of violence over a defined territory . He also borrows the definition of a modern state : A state that is subject to a rational division of labor , based on technical specialisation and expertise , and impersonal both with regard to recruitment and their authority over citizens . State-building essentially amounts to successfully extending the state 's legitimate monopoly on force over the territory it governs , and modernising the use of this force by division of labor , technical expertise , and impersonal recruitment and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ends , but it has the power to do the opposite . This monopoly is necessary but it is also dangerous , and therefore it must be constrained . That is why democratic accountability and rule of law become important . <p> Rule of law . For many people in India , the phrase rule of law means ' obeying all laws ' . However , it means much more than this ; it is about a deeper constitutionalism that pervades the working of the State . The essence of this complex and multi-faceted concept is the restriction of arbitrary use of power . When the power of the State is given to an individual , that individual is expected to use it in good faith for the precise purpose for which it was given , without undue intrusion into the people 's lives . However , trust in good faith is not enough . If men were angels , no government would be necessary . Hence , the rule of law must be enshrined in procedures and policies . All use of power must be subordinated to established laws @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of law is strengthened when laws limit the use of power , and prescribe due process for use of power . Under the rule of law , the law is known , State behaviour is predictable and aggrieved persons have efficacious mechanisms for appeal . <p> Accountable government : In Fukuyama 's words , accountable government means that the rulers believe that they are responsible to the people they govern and put the people 's interests above their own . This moral concept of accountable government has formal manifestations . One major way in which this manifests itself in democratic societies is through the Constitution and parliamentary laws . The government is mandated to put the public interest above its own interest . If the government fails to meet the objectives satisfactorily or if it uses its powers for some other ends , the electorate would hold it accountable at the elections . Alongside this , well drafted laws create an array of additional accountability mechanism , which constantly keep government agencies and their employees under check . <h> Ordering or interdependence ? <p> While many countries developed strong governments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there are important examples of countries where this was not the case . The US and UK saw the emergence of democratic accountability and rule of law alongside the rise of strong governments . Democratic accountability and rule of law helped decide what kind of strong and capable government the country needed . That is what protected the populace from a rapacious state . Even James Madison who wrote about enabling the government to control the governed , and then obliging it to control itself , helped build accountability and rule of law in the US Constitution from day 1 , which helped shape the nature and extent of strengths of the US government ( see Federalist 47-51 by James Madison ) . <p> There is a deep dialectical relationship between government capacity and government accountability , and not some simple ordering . Accountability may shape State capacity , and the opposite could also happen . As Tocqueville demonstrated in his book on the French Revolution , The Old Regime and the Revolution , the French monarchy unintentionally paved way for a democratic revolution by creating a rational , centralised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on equal footing , thus laying the foundations of democratic society . <p> Education in India shows us an opposite story : if so many people in the country had not exercised the " exit " option by taking their kids to private schools , and instead " voiced " their dissatisfaction with government schools , we would have seen much better performance from the government schools . <p> It is more risky to have the State build capacity in a vacuum as it is all too easy to misuse coercive power . State capacity must be built within the contestations and pressures of democratic accountability and it must operate within the bounds of rule of law . <h> Strong as in scary vs. strong as in capable <p> At first blush , it seems that India has a ' weak State ' and has rushed ahead on greater democratic accountability and rule of law . However , the precise sense of strong ' or weak ' needs to be carefully understood . There are two aspects of the ' strength ' of a State . <p> One feature of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the ability to force them to do certain things , and the ability to hurt them . By this definition , large parts of the Indian State qualify . Many regulators in the financial and infrastructure sectors are fairly strong in terms of their ability to make their regulated sectors follow their commands . The tax bureaucracy in India is very powerful , to the point where the phrase tax terrorism ' has entered the lexicon . If we think of the word strong ' as scary ' , then a lot of the Indian State meets the test . <p> Another feature of a strong ' State is one that delivers the desired results . A strong ' criminal justice system is one that delivers law and order . If we think of strong ' as capable ' , most of the Indian State apparatus is faulty . <p> Rajan says that asking for more accountability and the rule of law will hold back the emergence of a strong State . At present , all too often , the Indian State is strong as in scary but not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power has been given to the government and its agents , but they do not build sufficient capacity to do their jobs . At the same time , they use the power as they wish . <p> How to map power into the desired outcomes ? This is substantially about accountability and the rule of law . If results are not delivered , it is very likely because there is not enough accountability and the rule of law . The journey from a scary State ( which has the coercive power over citizens ) to a capable State ( one that delivers on governance outcomes ) runs through the bridge of accountability mechanisms and the rule of law . <h> ' Leave it to the experts ' or ' give them power and hold them accountable ' ? <p> Rajan says that since it is difficult to distinguish necessary government function from excess , the government should get a long rope . But it is precisely because government function is hard to distinguish from excess , that government and regulators can amass illegitimate power and use it excessively . Only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for excess be curtailed . <p> To place Rajan 's comments in context , in a recent debate , he opposed judicial review of regulations . Is such review an example of " excessive checks and balances " ? In the working of liberal democracy , nobody has the ability to write law without checks and balances . As an example , a committee report led by Professor Rajan in 2009 strongly and repeatedly recommends the idea of an appellate system for all financial regulators . Now , Governor Rajan opposes the idea . <h> Looking at the RBI through this framework <p> It is well and good to talk about high principles , the big picture and the long march of history . However , specific actions , real institutions and the current context also matter . When talking of the entire system , one is vulnerable to commit a fallacy of division , i.e. assuming that what is true of the whole must also be true of the parts . What is true of the overall Indian government may not actually be true of all its parts . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ RBI . He has completed about half of the term . This is hence a good time to look at how issues of State capacity , accountability and rule of law are working at RBI . <p> Regulators such as RBI subsume within them legislative , executive and judicial powers . They make regulations , implement them and adjudicate over those they claim have breached the regulations . This devolution of authority from the Parliament is justified because of technical expertise required , and because there is a need for independence from day-to-day political intervention . However , if such power is not checked , it is a recipe for tyranny . <p> Is the grand narrative of the Indian state - high on accountability and rule of law , and low on capacity and strength - true of the RBI ? RBI is strong as in scary . It lords over banking , payments , capital flows , etc with such strength that it is almost unimaginable that a regulated entity would do anything against RBI 's wishes . Most employees of financial firms privately excoriate the RBI but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a level of fear , and self-censorship , that is seldom found in argumentative India . <p> While India has high democratic accountability overall , this is not true of RBI . RBI is a set of unelected bureaucrats who are , in effect , largely unaccountable . Although it is supposed to be held accountable by the Parliament , one can not see how such accountability can be enforced . At present , RBI pursues multiple , conflicting objectives , which give endless opportunities of offering alibis for non-performance . It is a central bank , manager of government debt , redistributor ( e.g. priority sector requirements ) , regulator of banks , non-banking financial companies , payments and capital flows . It runs exchange and payments infrastructure . When failing on beating inflation , it can say it was keeping interest rates low on government debt . When failing on safety and soundness regulation , it can argue that it was busy ensuring banks lend to priority sectors where they incurred losses . Multiple objectives , and conflicts of interest , has given a loss of accountability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? RBI has taken undue advantage of what Rajan calls " the difficulty of distinguishing between necessary government function and excess " . <p> Example : RBI has arbitrarily arrogated to itself the power to restrict competition in banking by giving only 2 licenses a decade , and there is no effective mechanism to question this power . This is partly because the RBI Act and the Banking Regulation Act do not impose sufficient procedural restrictions on such misuse of powers . If , for example , the RBI was mandated to conduct a cost-benefit analysis of its regulations , we would learn about the economic consequences of the restrictions it imposes , but no such mandate exists . <p> Example : RBI 's actions on exchange-trade currency derivatives , which damaged the liquidity in the market , and increased currency volatility . These mistakes would have been less likely if there were better checks and balances . <p> Example : Under Rajan , RBI 's intervention of the Rupee has grown manifold compared to that in the previous Governor 's tenure . <p> This major shift in the actions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the public . This change in course is an exercise of arbitrary power conducted under opacity . <p> Example : In a recent case involving Docomo , RBI arbitrarily announced that one particular transaction was allowed to violate its own regulations . This violates the rule of law . See : Good sense on Docomo vs. the rule of law by Bhargavi Zaveri and Pratik Datta . <p> RBI has almost completely unchecked powers . Judicial review would be a valuable check . The judiciary will not rewrite regulations or order , but it may strike down regulations and orders that are found violating the Constitution , some laws or regulations . This helps improve the quality of regulations and orders . <p> Rajan seems to be arguing that because RBI is low on capacity , the accountability mechanisms should be reduced . We have one interesting counter-example in the Indian experience . SEBI was weak , and issuing a stream of low quality orders . The application of constitutional principles led to the introduction of appeals against SEBI orders , in 1997 , at the Securities Appellate Tribunal . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hear appeals from SEBI orders , the quality of SEBI orders has improved , and indeed , the quality of investigations and enforcement at SEBI has been pushed up . <p> In similar fashion , the highway to a superior RBI runs through subjecting RBI actions to judicial review . State capacity at RBI is 18 years behind the capacity which has come up at SEBI as a consequence of the pressure that SEBI faced in the form of appeals at SAT . We have Governor Raj ' . If we add some Appellate Raj ' , we might get a good mix . <p> Accountability and rule of law are not just about judicial review . The rule of law is violated when RBI makes a regulation without proper cost-benefit analysis , without a two-way public consultation , without detailed reasoning for the regulation . This is arbitrary use of power . This happens , among other things , because the idea of rule of law is not properly embedded in the institutional framework of the RBI . <p> Take the example of payment regulation . At present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two-factor authentication requirement even for small value transactions link , link . So , if I want to be able to transact upto Rs. 1000 transactions every day without a second factor of authentication , I am not allowed to do that , even though it is my own money . We have the same level of security for Rs. 10 lakh transaction as for Rs. 100 transaction . This imposes undue transaction costs on small value transactions and makes many businesses difficult to do . If the RBI followed due process in making regulations ( cost-benefit analysis , consultations , etc ) , it may have , in the process , modernised its regulatory approach and liberalised the sector . <p> Greater accountability and rule of law would help RBI build the right kind of capacity and to use it to regulate free markets optimally , and not to constrain the markets unnecessarily . Will more due process and judicial review slow down RBI ? In fact , RBI will have to speed up its game . It will not be able to centrally plan the sectors it regulates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actually regulate the fast-moving innovations of the financial system , rather than slowing down innovations to make its own life easy . It is only in a police state that a policeman 's job is easy . Our thinking on public policy should not cater to the convenience of an RBI official . <p> The RBI has recently allowed two more types of banks - payment banks and small banks . However , the basic framework of central planning by RBI , and the License-Permit Raj , is intact . RBI continues to decide what innovation the market will do , and market participants bend over backwards to modify their business models to accommodate RBI 's notions of innovation . Once in a decade or so , a committee is set up to tell the market what kinds of business models it can pursue . Now that RBI has released two new types of business models that it was preventing from getting out , we are happy and thankful . Institutional reform would be to change this system of " innovation by committees " . More pressures of accountability mechanisms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We have not escaped from License-Permit Raj ; more Appellate Raj will help break down License-Permit Raj . <h> Four strands of thinking <p> There are four strands of thinking in India on the project of building the Republic : <p> At one end is the Left , which just wants an intensification of the socialist republic of India . <p> A second group wants to do direct democracy - get citizens to devote a large amount of their time to participate in governance in pursuit of the common good , just like ancient Athens . This group also wants to hand over arbitrary power to a watchdog agency - Lok Pal . <p> A third group wistfully looks back at the power concentrated in Nehru and Indira Gandhi and thinks " Gee , what would I do with that power ! " This is not about the rule of law , it is not about the rule of men , it is the craving for the " rule of me " . <p> A fourth group wants to construct a liberal democracy , where performance is obtained out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , some in the elite pay lip service to words like liberal democracy , rule of law , and free markets . At the same time , there is limited commitment to enlightenment values , and limited understanding of how a complex State works . For some in the elite , arbitrary power for the State means increasing their own power . We need to do more in terms of improving knowledge and the quality of the debate . <p> As Fareed Zakaria has emphasised , holding elections is not the essence of liberal democracy . The real story of liberal democracy lies in the internal machinery of checks and balances , of the intricate systems of rule of law , judicial review , separation of powers , freedom of speech and myriad accountability mechanisms . The main story of India should be about making these institutions work

@@3072235 <h> Their beaches eroding and disturbed by human interference , fewer turtles are returning to nest every year <p> Every winter , the Olive Ridley turtles begin returning to the beaches of the Eastern coast to lay their eggs . Theirs is a treacherous journey . Trawlers and fishing boats are a threat for them , lights on shore confuse them , and they are routinely disoriented by human disturbances along the beach . But a more obstinate problem awaits the turtles lucky enough to make it to shore : in many places , beach erosion , which has been more pronounced post cyclone Hudhud , has left them with little place to dig a good nest . <p> In part the problem is not only the extensive loss of beach due to the severe erosion this season . As the endangered turtles lumber out of the surf in the darkness of a balmy spring night to look for a spot to nest , it is a combination of factors -- human disturbances and unfavourable environmental conditions -- that are resulting in disorienting these highly sensitive marine creatures . <p> Forest officials and environmentalists have expressed concern over the dwindling numbers of the eggs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every year , the Forest Department has set up two hatcheries -- one at R.K. Beach and another at Jodugullapalem -- a project being carried out at the cost of Rs 6 lakhs . However , according to the figures provided by the Forest Department , there is a drop in the number of eggs collected in the month of January this year as compared to the corresponding period last year . In 2014 , nearly 2,900 eggs were collected in January alone , which were kept in the hatcheries . The figure has dropped to 2,100 this year for the month of January . Overall , 3,078 eggs were collected last year . Interestingly , the maximum egg collection happened in the month of January last year . <p> " This time , there have been many factors leading to the disturbance of the nesting area of the Oliver Ridley turtles . One of the factors is the massive erosion that has affected major portions of the R.K. Beach , one of the main nesting grounds of the turtles . The beach stretch is now less . To assess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we will have to wait for a couple of more weeks , " says P.

The enclosed hatchery protects the eggs from predators like dogs and visitors to the beach who flock the area unaware of the eggs . Incidentally , the Olive Ridley Turtles take 25 to 30 years to reach adulthood but the survival rate of the young ones is abysmally low . <p> While the shrinking beach stretch is one of the concerns , the alarming frequency of deaths of Olive Ridley turtles along the coast continues to haunt the forest department and environmentalists .

" Erosion may just be one part of the problem . A much larger issue haunts the Olive Ridleys and that is human interference . Tourist activities have increased substantially along the Vizag beaches , especially the R.K. Beach , one of the main nesting grounds of the turtles . Due to this , the fecundity rate ( number of eggs laid at a time ) goes down . The turtles may be going through fear psychosis due to human disturbances resulting in lower eggs being laid , " points out Prof. D.E . Babu of Dept. of Zoology , Andhra University . <p> While conservationist say they want to help the turtles , but they can not agree how . Every time someone proposes a remedy , someone else is quick to rebut on how it will only make things worse . Because the possible solutions involve access to the beach , a crucial part of Vizag 's growing tourism industry , the arguments are bitter . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turtles are returning to nest every year , hinting at a possible migration of turtles from the Vizag coast to a different spot . " Mortality rates are high due to the conflict between the turtles and the fishing community , " says Prof. Babu . Interestingly , this time red tidal waves were spotted at certain critical zones of the coast like the R.K. Beach and Lawsons Bay , which are caused due to " harmful plankton " and are hazardous for the aquatic species . " Turtles have a natural tendency to stay away from such zones , " he adds .

So , I told her not to proceed with the matter . To the best of my knowledge , neither Reliance nor Essar bought copies of my book . Regarding tweets : Yes , I asked all my friends and colleagues to tweet on my book as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Airy also alleged that Deputy Business Bureau Chief Gaurav Choudhury accepted expensive gifts from corporates which would be delivered to his house . Choudhury said those allegations were " incorrect . " <p> Responding to Scroll 's email on how the paper proposed to tackle the questions over editorial integrity arising from the episode , Dawes wrote : <p> " Ms Airy drew these allegations to our attention last night , shortly after she chose to resign instead of participating in an inquiry into her own conduct . That inquiry would have been a good opportunity to ventilate her concerns , and to provide substantive evidence in support of her claims . It is regrettable that she has not done so . <p> Nevertheless , we take these issues extremely seriously . The ability to demonstrate genuine independence , honesty , and transparency are critical to the trust our readers place in us . We will be reviewing the ethical environment across our newsroom operations comprehensively in the coming months , with a view to strengthening both our formal controls and our culture . We will not shy away from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and we will take appropriate action where it is indicated , but we will also be thorough and deliberate . <p> We do not believe it is wise or fair to make public statements against named individuals in the absence of both evidence , and a right-of-reply . That is the standard we applied in the case of Ms Airy and that we will continue in our ongoing efforts to strengthen newsroom standards . " <p> A steady slide <p> This is not the first time that the Indian media has been roiled with controversy over the ethical lapses of journalists . In 2010 , the newsmagazines , Open and Outlook , published transcripts of the taped conversations of a corporate lobbyist , Nira Radia , with senior journalists , including Vir Sanghvi of the Hindustan Times and Barkha Dutt of NDTV . In the conversations , Radia sought the help of Dutt in influencing the decision of the appointment of the telecom minister . Sanghvi was heard discussing the slant of his column . Dutt has denied that the conversations amounted to an ethical impropriety . Saghvi said the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ controversy grabbed much attention , the steady erosion of ethics in newsrooms goes unnoticed . After he resigned on Friday , the editor of Mail Today , Sandeep Bamzai , whose name featured in the PIL in the Essar Leaks case as one of the journalists who asked for free car rides from Essar , told the Indian Express : " In hindsight , it was a stupid mistake . I need n't have done that ... but the fact is I did ask for the cab and I decided to pay for that mistake by resigning today ... " <p> Airy 's letter , however , raises questions that go beyond individual indiscretions in accepting corporate gifts and favours . Should news organisations accept corporate sponsorships for their events , if it impinges on the independence of their editorial staff ?

She wanted to understand better the relation between nature and human beings . The trio began at Allahabad and , for the next three months , they travelled steadily , till they reached the Farakka Barrage in West Bengal , 800 kms away .

" The journey gave an understanding of how people live and cope with the river , not only economically and physically , but mentally . Then I realised that the Ganga is a backbone of the country . So many rivers , like the Indus and Brahmaputra , are the backbone of civilisations . Somewhere along , the concept of the backbone came up .

" The actual spinal cord has 33 links , " says Santhamani . " But I did not want a too-obvious reference to the human backbone . " <p> In fact , when you look at the sculpture , you get a feeling of a flow , like that of the river , near the site .

" Wood is burnt to become charcoal , while the pulp of wood is grinded to make paper . Both are fragmented and fragile . So I felt that the material lends itself to talk about issues like global warming , which is leaving the planet in a fragile state . " <p> Her attraction to paper occurred when , in 1991 , following her MA in painting from The Maharaja Sayajirao University of Baroda , she went to Glasgow and worked with Jacki Perry , one of the foremost artist papermakers in Europe .

@@3074237 <h> Reigning Queen of Kerala Honeypots <p> It is 9 pm . Outside their house at Panathady in Kasaragod district in Kerala , Aleyamma and her husband Siby are hurriedly placing beehives inside a van . Later , they climb in and the van sets out towards the Coorg district in Karnataka , which is only 30 km away . Once there , they quickly place the hives in three-foot-high stands , below trees , at a distance of three metres . " We have to do this before the sun comes up , " says Aleyamma . " Because at sunbreak , the bees would want to come out in search of nectar and pollen . And if we keep the hives shut they will die of asphyxiation . " <p> Aleyamma is a breeder who practices migratory beekeeping . Once the honey is harvested at all the hives placed near her house from January to March , she sets off to Coorg and does bee farming there . " Somehow , the quality of the honey is far better there , " she says . <p> But there is a reason for that . In Kerala , the major source of nectar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is called unifloral honey , " says Dr Stephen Devanesan , principal scientist , All India Coordinated Research Project on Honeybees and Pollinators , Kerala Agricultural University . " But in Coorg , the hives are placed in forests where there is diverse flora . So , the quality of this multi-floral honey is much better . " <p> However , the collection of honey is not an easy process . First the bees have to be warded off using smoke . Then the honeycombs are removed from the hive . With the help of a honey extractor , the honey is taken out of the cells and stored in containers . All this has to happen in less than an hour , before the bees start stinging the person . <p> " In the beginning , the stings used to hurt a lot and there would be swelling as well , " says Aleyamma . " But now , though there is pain , there is no swelling . This is my bread and butter , so I have learnt to tolerate the aches , " she adds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crystallises and ferments . To avoid this , Aleyamma uses the double-boiling method . In this technique , she pours water into a large container . Then she places a smaller bowl , which contains honey , inside it , resting on three bricks . The bottom container is heated , so that the temperature inside the smaller bowl reaches 45 degrees centigrade . Then the honey is taken out , and put through a sieve , to get rid of wax particles , dust and pollen . Following this , it is reheated to 65 degrees centigrade for about 10 minutes . " After the honey cools , it is filtered , " says Aleyamma . " Once this is done , the honey will last for years , without going bad . " <p> Interestingly , Aleyamma is the only woman beekeeper in Kerala . Last year , she produced 40 tonne of honey , thanks to the 5,000 colonies of Indian and Italian bees that she has . <p> And thanks to this high productivity , Aleyamma was recently conferred the Stephen Memorial Award for the best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This award has been instituted by the Federation of Indigenous Apiculturists . <p> To get a high productivity , Aleyamma depends a lot on the Tamil workers , who are experts at bee collection .

This was conducted by Devanesan , along with Dr K Prathapan , director of the State Horticulture Mission . Devanesan says : " I have imparted training to Aleyamma and other breeders on how to maintain the health of the bees , manage colonies , and do high-tech apiculture .

Maintaining vaginal hygiene is very important , hence , here is a list of rules concerning your nether regions , which many women do not know about . <p> 1 . Wet and Sweaty Bottoms Can Cause Bacteria : Women often get their panties wet due to vaginal discharge , sweat or not cleaning the vagina after urinating . Wet bottoms for a long period can cause bacteria to develop , resulting in bad odour or infections . Hence , always keep your vagina clean and dry . <p> 2 .

If sanitary napkins are worn for long , they can cause rashes , bad odour and put you at the risk of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ May Cause Harm : The vagina naturally keeps itself safe from bacteria and infections by maintaining an optimum temperature and moisture with a specific pH balance . Normally , the pH level of a vagina is around 3.8 to 4.5 , which can be drastically altered by using harsh soaps or chemical cleansers . This can permanently damage your vagina and cause constant irritation and infections . To maintain this pH level , use a mild soap and water to clean your sensitive parts . In case if you find a strong and unpleasant odour , consult your doctor immediately . <p> 5 . Cleaning Vagina After Intercourse Is A Must : Body fluids and particles from condom and other innate products can cause infection in the vagina . Hence , it 's very important to clean the vagina with a mild soap and water to keep it safe from infections and bacteria . <p> 6 .

The douching involves rinsing your private parts with an acidic chemical fluid and is often done post-intercourse to kill the sperms . But douches interfere with pH level and can cause infection and more over it is an ineffective contraceptive at best . Hence , abstain from this practice . <p> 9 . Avoid Scrubbing Your Nether Regions : The skin on your private parts is sensitive and can easily peel off when scrubbed with a harsh product . Hence always opt for products that are gentle and easy on the skin .

But the times , they are a-changin ' and we love it like we hate it .

Used like a filler word . #Duang has however nearly broken the Chinese internet after being used over 8.4 million times on Weibo - the Chinese version of Twitter . <p> And we can all blame Jackie Chan for the birth of this weird new word with no meaning whatsoever - or rather let us blame the person who did the voiceover for him in this fake advert for Bawang shampoo : <p> Meaning : Short for babe , and also an acronym for Before Anyone Else .

" #SinksTwoFeetUnder <p> Meaning : No , not a female deer . An alternate for the word ' though ' . Used by the laziest people on the planet who have no respect for the English language . This word may make you lose faith in humanity . <p> Usage : " Cray cray is a better word than doe . Eh no . Not really . The former wastes more alphabets . " <p> Meaning : Sounds like something you should get vaccinated against but is really urban lingo for something that 's amazing or perfect . The word became popular after Vine user Peaches Monroe posted a video where her ' eyebrows were on fleek . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kim Kardashian posted a picture on Instagram with the caption , #EyebrowsonFleek . Because yes , we live in world where Kim is the purveyor of everything cool . <p> Meaning : Something so exciting that the word ' exciting ' was not deemed okay to use . Used as an exclamation . Became a trend after a kid posted a Vine video #Yeet . The dance is just as weird as its name . <p> Meaning : Once upon a time , flexing had to do with muscular tissues only . You know , like flexing one 's muscles . But thanks to Nicky Minaj , it now means showing off . She came up with a song , No Flex Zone , where she does nothing but flex her muscles . Such is the irony . <p> Usage : " Let 's all flex our ability to ruin language as the world once knew it . "

Is rape such an alien concept ? Is the ' rapist ' such a rare breed ? Looking back , long forgotten memories came creeping out of the past . <p> Growing up in idyllic small towns and strict missionary boarding schools , our first introduction to the concept was courtesy the tacky Bollywood films of the 70s and 80s , in which pretty young heroines were invariably raped , almost raped or faced the ever inevitable threat of rape . A heroine in a Bollywood film was synonymous with rape at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ titillation were so effective that by our teenage years I can remember most of my male friends agreeing that we got excited by the rape scenes . Of course none of us ( I hope ) would have ever dreamt of actually indulging in the act ourselves . If boys from secure , sheltered families could feel that way , one ca n't even begin to comprehend the effect on the less fortunate , with no one to teach them right from wrong . <p> Cut to college life in Delhi . An ex-girlfriend whom I 'd recently parted ways with , revealed to me that one night she had one too many drinks with her so-called best male friend and passed out . When she came to , she realised that she had been taken advantage of . At that point of time it did n't occur to me to classify the incident as rape . It would be almost a decade before the western media began to make a hue and cry about the evils of ' date rape ' . <p> Fresh in my memory also is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his fulfilling sex life with his steady girlfriend . On a whim , he apparently raped her once , spurred on , no doubt by the western pornographic fantasies that we all loved to read . However , he seemed to genuinely regret it , confessing that she did n't enjoy it at all . Is there a term like marital rape to describe this particular crime ? <p> In a Mumbai advertising agency , a colleague confided to me that back in his southern state he and a group of friends would take advantage of unsuspecting girls . The modus operandi involved a guy sweet talking a girl into indulging in sex . No sooner was he done , than the rest of them would barge in and compel the girl into obliging them as well , since she had already ' done it ' with one of them . Who knows if threats , force or blackmail were resorted to , or if the hapless girl was so terrified that she may have found it easier to give in . <p> Years later , in my hometown when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my elder brother advised me not to get involved with her as he happened to know that she had been raped by two men . <p> Later in a Bangalore ad agency , my women colleagues were all aflutter about an incident in another agency where a woman had been raped by her male colleague . Apparently the duo had been watching pornographic movies in the conference room . At this point , one of the ladies got outraged enough to declare , ' Oh no wonder . She deserved it . ' Nobody disagreed with her , just as nobody paid any attention to a quiet young man who wondered aloud , " But I heard that if a woman says no , it means no . " Please tell me that me and my buddies were not the only men to have watched porn with female friends without similar consequences . <p> Back in Delhi , a friend who happened to be blessed ( or cursed ) with striking looks , related her horrific experience . After spending a day taking her boss around the city , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picking up some brochures . He then proceeded to force himself on her but the plucky girl managed to fight him off and flee from the room . Shaken and in total shock , she broke down in the lobby , explaining to the management what had transpired . However she was apparently so overcome by " shame " ( would you believe it ? ) that she stubbornly refused to reveal the room number or the name of the perpetrator . Shockingly enough , she preferred to promptly quit her means of livelihood , and spend the next couple of days crying her heart out , convinced , that somehow she brought it on herself . <p> Let 's wake up and smell the coffee . Rapists are n't just faceless bus drivers and uneducated criminals roaming the streets . They lurk everywhere . In the plush MNCs , top notch universities , among your own drinking buddies and maybe even the guy next door .

" Even during the tournament in Malaysia it felt like a matter of time . " <p> In fact , that time had already come for one of them . Southee had made his New Zealand debut two weeks before the opening game of the tournament in a T20 against England , claiming Paul Collingwood as his maiden international wicket . He played the second match of the series two days later , bagging Kevin Pietersen in his 2 for 22 . <p> " We went to Australia before the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Tim was playing for the Black Caps and I remember watching him in a restaurant in Brisbane , and then a couple of weeks later he was playing for us , so that was a little surreal . " <p> Then , a few weeks after the U-19 World Cup , Southee made his Test debut in Napier , striking in his second over and taking 5 for 55 in the first innings . He ended up on the losing side , but not before smoking 77 off 40 balls with nine sixes . <p> Over the years , Southee 's batting has faded from the promise he showed as an U-19 player . At the 2006 World Cup in Sri Lanka he made 92 off 55 balls against Ireland ( a game , incidentally , where Eoin Morgan made 124 ) , but he has become a master of his swing craft . <p> Southee 's international career was already born when he took the new ball alongside Boult in Malaysia , but Patel says that there was no sense of superiority . " Tim was probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but I think the young guys in the team appreciated it . He was already a Black Cap but he was still one of the lads and he saw the fun side of the game . Of course he and Trent were close mates from Northern Districts , so it helped build that good partnership . " Boult confirms Southee " retains the reputation as the joker " . <p> It took some time , though , for the quartet to be reunited on the international stage . Boult had to wait until December 2011 for his New Zealand debut , against Australia in the Hobart Test that New Zealand won by seven runs . His first wicket was Michael Hussey . <p> Williamson had made his first appearance in 2010 , one-dayers first ( starting with two ducks ) , followed by a century on Test debut against India . <p> Anderson was the last to reach the top level , in late 2012 with a T20 debut , although he had to wait another six months for an ODI spot . <p> " Corey was more of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he did , " Patel says of the U-19 days . " I admired how they carried themselves . Corey was more of a batsman who bowled a bit . He was going through a growth spurt and we were very conscious of overbowling him ; he 's still used quite sparingly these days . His batting has certainly gone to another level . He was very destructive but there was n't always much structure to his batting . " <p> Of Williamson , there was little doubt , though he did not stand out in Malaysia , making 124 runs at 31 . " He was a very solid individual , very mature , on and off the field , " Patel remembers . " He showed that from a very early stage . His maturity as a batsman shone through at U-19 level , he was a couple of notches ahead of anyone else . It was the way he went about batting , excellent plans , and the time he had . His greatest asset is his hunger to bat , and that was the case back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His work ethic was so far ahead of everyone else in that squad . " <p> Watching New Zealand 's training sessions at the World Cup , it is clear nothing has dimmed that work ethic . " He certainly still enjoys his throwdowns now , " Boult says . " There were rumours going around that he 'd have millions of them when he was younger . " <p> It has only been of late , however , since Boult was elevated to the one-day squad shortly before the World Cup , that they have all become regular team-mates again with the white ball . During the U-19 tournament , Boult and Southee shared 28 wickets ; Southee took 17 to be named Player of the Tournament , and Boult 11 , seven of which came against Malaysia when only he and Southee were required to bowl . It did not take a crystal ball to see a rosy future , although as often happens it was not a smooth transition . <p> " In all my reports that was a strong point I made , " Patel says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it was important that they were allowed to stay who they were and not to change too many things , especially with their bowling actions . You could see from a very early stage that they had the tools and that they could swing the ball at pace . " <p> For the players , though , thoughts of the future were a long way away and playing a future World Cup was not a topic of conversation . " We always had personal goals , but we did n't sit down and think too far ahead . It 's great it 's happened , " Boult says . <p> However , for a while Patel feared his concerns about their bowling actions being tinkered with would have cause for existence . Boult was first included in a New Zealand squad for the 2009 Chappell-Hadlee series but did not get a game and then suffered a stress fracture of his back . Southee , meanwhile , struggled to build on the promising debut against England and his Test average ballooned into the 40s until mid-2012 , although his one-day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only played a handful of Tests . Then , in October 2012 , Shane Bond joined as bowling coach . <p> " What I see now is what I saw when they were with the Under-19s , " Patel says . " There was a period when their bowling actions changed for the worse , but it 's good to see that Shane Bond has done a very good job of bringing them back to where they were when they were 18-19 years old . I 've still got video footage on my laptop as evidence . No question , these are their natural bowling actions and the results over the last 12-18 months is testimony to that . " <p> Patel was at Eden Park for the recent match against Australia . Boult grabbed the early kudos with 5 for 27 and Williamson finished it with that six , but Southee and Anderson also played their parts . For Patel , it was a chance for some quiet satisfaction at having helped nurture a new generation . <p> " I certainly take great pride in watching their successes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I sit back now - I 'm just writing some reports in PNG as we speak , about my current players , and you read the ones you did then and think , ' Maybe I did make a difference . ' " <p> Now among the best bowlers in the world , and preparing for a World Cup quarter-final , Boult 's overriding memories of those few weeks in Malaysia are of wide-eyed excitement and of lifelong friendships being forged . " We were all so young and just loving getting the opportunity to play in a World Cup . A lot of us remain good mates from that tournament . The majority are playing first-class cricket . To say there would be four of us representing our country in a World Cup would have been a bit of a long shot but it 's fantastic .

@@3117238 <h> The Ides of March for Kejriwal and AAP <p> ( Critical theorist and writer Rukmini Bhaya Nair is a professor at IIT Delhi . She is the author of several academic books , three volumes of poetry and a novel recently long-listed for the DSC Prize . ) <p> Shakespeare 's ' Julius Caesar ' is a play about personal loyalty , political conspiracy and public anger . In it , a seer warns : ' Beware the Ides of March ' . Well , that would be about now , mid-March - perhaps as good a time as any to take stock of the drama of political loyalties in India . <p> Loyalty , we know , is a prime value in the Indian political scenario . Caesars , first families and coteries around ' tall leaders ' abound in almost every party and loyalty to them is accounted a major virtue . The Congress , for instance , has long gathered round the Gandhis . Likewise , loyalty to Arvind Kejriwal within AAP , if the recent violent dissension within this young party is any indication , marks a deep schism within it . The BJP is harder to read owing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Elections , but even here , rumours are rife concerning the centralization of power - and where there is any hint of concentrated power , there is always the possibility of ' conspirators ' waiting in the wings who can easily turn from being friends to becoming foes . <p> Politics is about the irresistible forces of dissension meeting the immovable forces of loyalty . Awful damage can be caused during this process without any necessary benefits finally resulting . In India , we call it a ' manthan ' ( churning ) from which the hope is that some drops of ' amrit ' ( divine nectar ) will be produced . Shakespeare 's vision seems bleaker . What is remarkable about his play is that it glamorises no one , conspirator , loyalist or even ' the public ' . <p> Enter the conspirators <p> In a black-and-white moral universe , the conspirators , of course , should be the baddies . Led as they are by the honest senators , Brutus and Cassius , however , they turn out to be far from a gang of evil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is presented as a good man , a noble human being . Everyone , including Caesar himself , sees Brutus as Caesar 's loyal friend . If , in the end Brutus ' betrays ' Caesar , it is because he believes it is for the greater good of the Roman state . The play thus raises the hard , moral , question : Is Brutus and Cassius ' ' conspiratorial ' act really ' betrayal ' ? Or is it a deep commitment to ' saving democracy ' from a charismatic leader 's perceived will to absolute power ? <p> These old Shakespearian questions certainly seem relevant let 's say , for example , to the AAP party 's present predicament . Few who has watched the drama play out in that party over the past couple of weeks with Yogendra Yadav ( Brutus/Cassius ? ) and Prashant Bhushan ( Cassius/Brutus ? ) apparently questioning Kejriwal 's ( Caesar 's ? ) ' absolute power ' can doubt this . " Hum chodenge bhi nahi , todenge bhi nahi. sudhrenge , sudhaarenge " ( we will not flit , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we will improve others ) Yogendra Yadav has declared in an eloquent Shakespearean vein , immediately prompting the question : Is this really the voice of a ' conspirator ' or a high-minded hero ? A potential quitter or a man above the fray ? And is Kejriwal , in his turn , justified in exclaiming ' Et tu , Brutus ? ' at Yadav 's possibly well-meant but possibly hurtful censure ? Is Kejriwal the one , far from the madding crowd on his naturopathic farm , the one who is really ' above the fray ' ? We may not have the answers to these dilemmas but Shakespeare 's play helps bring them into sharp focus . <p> We know already from Vishal Bharadwaj 's films , for instance , that Shakespeare translates well into Indian settings . In the present case , too , ancient Rome may have been where Shakespeare 's 400-year old play was set but it could as well have been modern India . What he does for us in ' Julius Caesar ' is to imagine a classic ' democratic society ' and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can examine its flaws . <p> In this ' ideal democracy ' , individual loyalties and political ideals are in conflict . In such cases of divided loyalties , Shakespeare shows , ethical boundaries are just as blurred in realpolitik as in life . No choices between factions can be made with confidence . That is why the disarray we see among the mainly raw aam aadmi volunteers today seems to have a familiar feel . They are discovering , as in Shakespeare 's play , the painful human cost of entering politics . Ashutosh 's recent remarks about the ' unhappiness ' of ' growing up ' are not entirely off the mark in this context . <p> Enter the loyalists <p> In ' Julius Caesar ' the loyalists are , of course , represented by Mark Antony whose citizens ' address beginning " Friends , Romans , countrymen " remains the epitome of the moving , yet polarizing , political speech . Current academic studies of political loyalty in the west focus on ' polarization ' as well but they usually foreground ' voter loyalties ' and how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In India , however , ' Julius Caesar ' is particularly resonant because it also references personal loyalties , less associated with political discourse in the west . <p> Under what circumstances can loyalty , a generally good quality , turn pernicious ? This is a central question in Shakespeare 's play . Mark Antony is ready to go to any lengths to avenge the death of his friend , Julius Caesar . His personal loyalty , in short , completely blinds him and , again , we are forced to ask : Is blind loyalty to someone , no matter how dear , ever justified ? Especially in the political sphere , can total loyalty actually indicate moral failing because it could lead to ' betrayal ' of the very people whom the political classes come into power to serve ? <p> In India , we have to recognize that across the political spectrum , unquestioning political loyalty has become almost a pathology . It has led to shameless sycophancy , even a ' feudal courtier culture ' , lack of fearless and rational judgement and unwarranted punishment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the party line . In its extreme form , absolute political loyalty can be seen as the opposite of free speech or , at any rate , of honest speech . It is , in fact , secret cousin to another word , namely ' opportunism ' . Opportunism is sometimes presented in our political discourse as the antithesis of ' loyalty ' but what Mark Antony 's character in Shakespeare 's play brings out is the kinship between these two concepts when each is pushed to its limits . Even a superficial reading of ' Julius Caesar ' makes us aware of the poignancy of the moral dilemmas that attach to the ' simple ' politics of loyalty in the present-day Indian context . <p> Exit the people , left , right and centre <p> Finally , there 's the great Roman public , which we get to see in action as Mark Antony 's words take effect . These ordinary Roman citizens are so incensed that they just go about destroying everything in their path . Their anger does not spare even the totally innocent like the poet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... I am not Cinna the conspirator ! " This does not help him overmuch , though . He is torn to pieces anyway by an enraged mob aroused to fever pitch . <p> The Latin dictum ' vox populi , vox dei ' ( the voice of the people is the voice of god ) was in circulation in Shakespeare 's time , as in ours . But Shakespeare makes us question even the wisdom of the masses . In India , where we so often see lynch mobs go berserk ; where we have , over decades , witnessed crowd fury provoked by political action ( and sometimes , inaction ) cause mass deaths among the innocent , we recognize only too well the disturbing truths Shakespeare reveals in ' Julius Caesar ' . We also note that politicians seldom come to grief during these bouts of fury ; they survive , even triumph . It is the helpless , like Cinna , who suffer .

@@3117239 <p> NEW DELHI : Pub goers in Gurgaon -- one of the biggest eating-out destinations in the country -- will have to shell out about three times more for their imported beer and spirits from April 1 as Haryana has steeply increased excise duty on imported liquor . Restaurant and pub owners say the move will entirely cripple the industry in Gurgaon , which contributes as much as 7%-9% of overall eating out orders across the country , according to estimates by online food delivery marketplace Foodpanda . <p> Haryana government last week announced a new excise policy for 2015-16 that includes a new levy called ' assessment fee ' on imported alcoholic beverages . It has also more than doubled restaurant license fee for selling alcoholic beverages in Gurgaon to Rs 12.5 lakh from existing Rs 6 lakh . Now , Gurgaon has established itself as one of the primary destinations for top pubs , restaurants and cafes in the country . <p> " Since it 's a corporate hub and given the number of marquee restaurant brands in the city , Gurgaon contributes one of the highest average ticket sizes for eating out across the country , " said Rohit Chadda , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ticket size in Gurgaon is about 20% higher than most other cities in the country . <p> Restaurant , pub and cafe owners , however , say the new policy will drive away many of their customers . " It is like saying do n't do business , " said Rahul Singh , founder and CEO of The Beer Cafe , and secretary at the National Restaurant Association of India ( NRAI ) . " They have increased the alcohol licence fee by 110% and because of this assessment fee , the consumer will now have to pay up to three times more for imported beers , " he said . Singh said Gurgaon accounts for 99% of Haryana 's pub and restaurant business . <p> Top selling imported brands there include Corona and Hoegaarden beer , Jacobs Creek wine and Johnny Walker Black Label whiskey . Shiv Karan Singh , owner at marquee barbeque and grill chain Smokey 's BBQ and Grill , said the move will discourage people from eating out . " I 'm not sure whether I can pass down the increased costs to my customers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coming to my restaurant to drink .

" The US " prisoner " has muddled incentives - parts of him lose heavily in the changing climate , parts are unaffected while some powerful parts of him stand to lose if status quo is altered . The payoff of the Chinese " prisoner " is uniformly negative if status quo persists - so he would prefer to see cooperative action on climate change .

How they perform in future will depend on what their " payoff " is . <p> Air pollution ( some of which exacerbates global warming ) causes half a million deaths in Europe annually ; Glacier melting and the flooding of rivers and rising sea levels threaten low lying countries like the Netherlands ( where up to an eighth of the country lies below sea level ) .

Part of it maybe a desire to gain prominence in the world stage , a stage increasingly being dominated by the US and China . They can get leadership credibility only if they lead by example . Second , a higher sense of social equity in European countries may be driving action through a social justice angle . Third , European companies stand to gain from action on climate change . Some of the world 's leading wind energy manufacturers and LED lighting companies are European . 92% of responding Euro 300 companies report that climate regulation presents an opportunity to their business . <p> Now , India . India is and will be badly affected by the changing climate .

India can not afford to cut its emissions aggressively - but even if it did , this would be futile if the rest of the world continued to emit for then , the world would still get warmer . <p> Taken together , India 's payoffs if status quo persists are very negative unless everyone cooperates ; China 's is negative ; US 's is very mixed ; Europe , though the status quo payoff is not very negative , by credibly signalling that they will always cooperate , has made it more likely for others to cooperate .

@@3183231 <h> Ambedkar as the brand ambassador for ghar wapsi ? RSS creates stir on eve of birth anniversary <p> Even as political parties fall all over themselves to celebrate his 125th birth anniversary on 14 April , the RSS is all set to give BR Ambedkar a complete image makeover , or to be reaccurate , a wholesale reinvention . <p> According to media reports , the RSS is planning to bring out bumper issues on the Dalit icon in both its RSS mouthpieces , Panchjanya and Organiser . And the Ambedkar they portray is going to be completely different to the Ambedkar most of us are familiar with . <p> PTI <p> In a detailed report , the Economic Times reveals that " Ambedkar will be celebrated as a ' purifier ' who vehemently spoke against Islamic ' aggression ' , conversion to Islam , communism and Article 370 . " <p> " He saw the universal brotherhood of Islam uniting just Muslims . He was critical of the spirit of aggression of political Islam that takes advantage of the weakness of Hindus and follows gangsterism , " Prafulla Ketkar , Organiser 's editor told Economic Times . " <p> But the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ India 's constitution was also an advocate of ghar wapsi ! <p> Ketkar added that " when in Pakistan and some provinces such as Hyderabad , Scheduled Caste Hindus were forcibly converted , Ambedkar warned them against it and told the converted Hindus they would be welcomed back . In a way , he also supported ghar wapsi . " <p> Unsurprisingly this RSS reinterpretation has not found too many takers . <p> The ET report quotes Anand Teltumbde , professor IIT Kharagpur who has studied Ambedkar closely , who accuses the RSS of long trying to appropriate Ambedkar by twisting his views on Pakistan and Muslims . Others complain that the RSS has taken elements from Ambedkar 's books and quoted them out of context in order to push its own agenda . <p> But this repurposing of Ambedkar is hardly the first attempt by the RSS to reclaim key elements of Dalit history . <p> The organisation came under fire in September for trying to blame the emergence of the Indian caste system on ' foreign invaders ' - seen as yet another attempt to woo Dalits while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Dalit history , the RSS released three books whose authors held ' foreign invaders ' responsible for the emergence of lower castes . <p> The books , authored by BJP spokesperson Vijay Sonkar Shastri , were released by RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat . RSS leaders had written the preface for all three books . <p> According to a report in the Hindustan Times , top RSS leader Bhaiyyaji Joshi wrote in the preface to one of the books , " To violate Hindu swabhiman ( dignity ) of Chanwarvanshiya Kshatriyas , foreign invaders from Arab , Muslim rulers and beef-eaters , forced them to do abominable works like killing cows , skinning them and throwing their carcasses in deserted places . Foreign invaders thus created a caste of charma-karma ( dealing with skin ) by giving such works as punishment to proud Hindu prisoners . " <p> Speaking on Joshi 's writing prominent Dalit scholar associated with the Indian Institute of Dalit Studies , Dilip G Diwakar , linked this remaking of history with an anti-minority agenda : " This is an unnecessary reactionary move by the RSS that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is not merely a caste comment per se . This argument that is being made by the RSS is a very communal one . " <p> The other reason is electoral . Over time it has become increasingly clear that the impact of the Dalit vote has only been growing in recent years , as political parties become more and more fragmented . It was perhaps most evident in Mayawati 's massive success in Uttar Pradesh in 2008 . Even AAP has demonstrated the value of the lower caste vote in its recent sweeps in the Delhi assembly polls . <p> However there is also a larger ideological push at play . An extension as it were , of ghar wapasi . An attempt to subsume Dalit identity into a larger Hindu whole , with Muslims as the common enemy . <p> When asked if he saw efforts to rewrite Dalit history as an attempt in that direction , Diwakar told PTI , " Of course .

This is clearly another way of breaking up the excluded communities - like Dalits , minorities and lower-caste groups . "

But if you look at the long list of movies whose complete stories or parts of it are copied from foreign movies , you 'll get my point . Take a look at this list that puts together the names of Bollywood movies that have been copied from foreign ones . The list is surprising , for there are a couple of movies in there that have for long been considered as classics of the Indian cinema ! <p> 1 .

Its story line has close resemblance with the 1946 Hollywood film ' To Each His Own ' . Gulzar wrote &amp; directed this sweet film about a teacher &amp; how he earns the love of a bunch of orphan kids &amp; helps them mend their relationship with their estranged grandpa . The film borrows heavily from another Hollywood film ' The Sound Of Music ' which had released 6 years before Parichay hit the screens . Another shocker ! <p> 3 . Ek Choti Si Love Story <p> Shashilal Nair , the guy who directed this 2002 film did n't even bother to think of a new name &amp; copied his film from the 1998 film ' A Short Film about Love ' . There are so many more films that I found on this list &amp; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of such films ever increasing . <p> Reading the names of movies like Dil Hai Ki Manta Nahi , Baghban , Life In A Metro , Peepli Live , Kati Patang , Rang De Basanti , Ghajini , Phir Hera Pheri , Koi Mil Gaya &amp; so many more ( the most recent being Barfi ) , that made so much money at the box office &amp; were critically acclaimed was astounding . It is not mentioned in any current statute , either criminal or civil , although some cases may be treated as unfair competition or a violation of the doctrine of moral rights . It is considered academic dishonesty and a breach of journalistic ethics , but may be our Bollywood film makers think otherwise , may be because there are no laws against it .

@@3221232 <h> Benami property : Follow Britain , Australia and take on Torrens system of direct registration <p> The government is getting ready with its Brahmastra . It will soon introduce anew version of a 27-year-old law to unearth benami property , or property held in the name of someone other than the actual owner . <p> A brainchild of former Congress law minister P Shiv Shankar , the Benami Transaction ( Prohibition ) Act , was passed by Parliament in 1988 . The story pretty much turned out like the boy who cried wolf . The law was never enforced although successive governments vowed to write rules to punish abenami property-holder . The file even went missing mysteriously once but resurfaced only to gather dust in North Block . <p> Version 2.0 will be much more stringent . That 's what Jayant Sinha , minister of state for finance , told Lok Sabha . He said the law will enable confiscation of benami property and provide for prosecution , blocking a major avenue for generation and holding of black money in the form of benami property , especially in real estate . <p> Agreed , benami transactions , speculative in nature , push up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to expect the new avatar of an old law to be a serious threat to the black economy is plain naive . The cure for the disease lies elsewhere : land market reforms , issuing an Aadhaar to every Indian citizen , tax reform that includes bringing property deals under the goods and services tax ( GST ) and making poll-funding transparent . <p> To end speculation in property , the government needs to do away with the artificial shortage of land , which is policy-induced , and free more land for urban development . It 's baffling why , say , government departments like Indian Railways and defence sit on huge unused tracts of land . Also , there is no reason why many states persist with an outdated classification of whether land is for farming or for setting up factories . Absurd rules on usage should go . <p> All states should modernise land records to enhance transparency in ownership . Already , some state governments capture electronic records of land ownership , which is akin to dematerialising shares . Conclusive titling must also be ensured as presumptive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ land deals . India should follow Britain and Australia and take on the Torrens system of direct registration of title in a central registry . For that , all the parcels of land will have to be entered in a register with the owner specified . The state has to guarantee ownership and become the keeper of land and title records . Benami deals will drop dramatically when the title becomes a certificate of valid ownership . <p> The UPA 's draft model Bill on land titling sought to provide conclusive titles . It also required every state to establish a Land Titling Authority to write rules , create and update the register of titles , assign a unique identity number to each piece of land and provide valuation details , if need be . Narendra Modi government should revive the Bill . As land is a state subject , all states should come on board to implement the reform to improve governance .

The Supreme Court , which is against making Aadhaar mandatory , should see reason .

Benami deals will be difficult when every citizen has an Aadhaar . This will obviate the need for a mandatory PAN . <p> Bringing the real estate sector into GST is also a good idea . The suggestion , made by a task force of the Thirteenth Finance Commission , would mean subsuming stamp duties levied by states into GST . Credit for the taxes paid on inputs would be available once this is done , creating audit trails . This will cut out benami deals . <p> We need action on all these fronts to stem the generation of black money , rather than introduce the so-called black money Bill and another law to punish benami property-holders in the country .

These are not enforced , so almost no one knows such earthquake-resistant standards and guidelines for home-owners exist . <p> The Delhi Metro is one of the few Indian structures built to withstand a quake . Many of the houses built in Bhuj after the Gujarat quake of 2001 are now earthquake-resistant . <p> But nothing has changed since 1993 , when a relatively milder earthquake of magnitude 6.4 in Maharashtra 's Latur district killed nearly 10,000 people in what was considered a non-seismic zone . Most died because shoddily constructed houses collapsed at the first major shake , as they did in Gujarat eight years later . <p> The government of India today lists 38 cities in moderate to high-risk seismic zones .

Sometime in the geological past , before humans , India broke off from an ancient supercontinent called Gondwana , a name still used for what is now Chhattisgarh . <p> The Indian plate skewed north , displaced an ancient sea , travelled more than 2,000 km - the fastest a plate has ever moved - and slammed into the Eurasian plate , creating the Himalayas . <p> India still grinds northeast into Asia at roughly 5 cm every year .

Around 80,000 people died . <p> About 60 percent of India is vulnerable to earthquakes caused by the great , northward grind of the Indian subcontinental landmass . <p> The only serious earthquake that modern India remembers is the temblor that killed about 20,000 in Gujarat in 2001 . The 2004 tsunami , which resulted from the third-most severe quake ever recorded , 9.3 on the Richter scale , occurred when the Indian plate slid with greater violence than it normally does under the neighbouring Burma plate , upon which rest the Andaman and Nicobar Islands . <p> It caused a 100-km-long rupture in the crust , thrusting the seafloor upwards and pushing up masses of water , setting off the tsunami that killed 230,000 people in 14 countries . <p> No Indian metropolis has witnessed a serious earthquake , although Delhi lies in high-risk seismic zone 4 .

@@3241230 <h> Clash of the titans <h> Tamil novelist Jayakanthan 's long-term association with Periyar , and the mutual respect they shared , is an interesting chapter in history . <p> An incident in a literary conference over half a century ago is etched in Tamil cultural memory . It 's a meeting in which two personalities laid bare the cultural fault lines in Tamil society . On October 15 , 1961 , the Sixth Conference of the Tamil Writers Association was held in Tiruchi . Narana Duraikkannan , the doyen of Tamil writers ; A.V.R. Krishnaswamy Reddiar , the moving spirit behind the literary journals Grama Ooliyan and Shivaji ; and T.M. Narayanaswamy Pillai , former Vice-Chancellor of Annamalai University were present . God-fearing men , they sported sacred ash and namam on their foreheads . <p> Periyar E.V . Ramasamy would have been the most unlikely candidate to inaugurate such a conference . But there he was ! With over a half-century of selfless political work in the cause of political and social emancipation behind him , he still continued his relentless rationalist campaign despite being shy of 82 . His subversive views on god and religion notwithstanding , Periyar 's challenge to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among the believers . Members of the Dravidar Kazhagam in their trademark black shirts sat in the front . With Periyar being the strongest backer of Chief Minister K. Kamaraj , Congressmen too were present in considerable numbers among the audience in Devar Hall . <p> Periyar commenced his speech disavowing any literary credentials . He was no ezhuthalan ( writer ; the one who wields the pen ) , he insisted , but a karuthalan , one who dealt with ideas -- a pregnant neologism coined for the moment . Delivered in the spoken register , shorn of rhetoric , it was a characteristic performance . His critique of caste , religion , Brahmins , god , and their baneful influence on Tamil language and writing was replete with proverbs and spiced with an earthy humour . Without burning the Puranas and epics , he asked , how was Tamil literature to flourish ? Was it not the duty of writers to debunk such fanciful writing and lead the people on the path of reason ? <p> Seated on the dais was Jayakanthan , then the enfant terrible of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ address . Jayakanthan 's grandfather and father had been ardent followers of Periyar and his boyhood friend in his hometown , Cuddalore , was none other than K. Veeramani , soon to become the editor of Periyar 's daily , Viduthalai , and ultimately inherit the party mantle . <p> But Jayakanthan took a different path . In a remarkable spurt of creativity in the 1950s , he had penned nearly 100 short stories and was quite a literary rage . And he was not yet 28 . After his initial grooming in the undivided Communist Party of India , he had more recently distanced himself from the literary pieties of socialist realism , and had taken a neo-Brahmin ideological turn . <p> As Periyar launched his sharp attack , Jayakanthan could barely conceal his disagreement . A.V.R. Krishnaswamy Reddiar , one of the organisers , sensing that he was spoiling for a fight , sent a quick note pleading with him not to take issue with Periyar . But Jayakanthan would have none of it . <p> When he rose to speak , Jayakanthan clarified that he had no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason as the touchstone of all thinking and action , and wanted to decimate the ancient wisdom of the Hindus , Jayakanthan declared that he too would employ reason to refute him . Invoking the great Siddha poet Sivavakkiyar , he argued that rationalism could follow not only the atheistic route but take recourse to belief as well . Drawing on pop anthropology , he provided a defence of Hindu Puranas . Rather than blame Brahmins for the ills of Tamil society , Jayakanthan defended the pristine and ancient varnashrama ordering of society , and argued that it was because Brahmins had failed in their duty that India had fallen to its present state ! Finally , he declared that , as a writer , he would brook no instruction on what he should or should not write . <p> The proceedings were recorded on tape , which unfortunately has not survived . But in recounting this incident at length in his political memoirs ( though he gets the date wrong by two years ) , an unrepentant Jayakanthan recalled that , if all hell did not break loose ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Periyar heard me keenly , his hands cupped around his ears , with acute attention . " Whenever he agreed , or when the audience applauded his words , Periyar enthusiastically tapped his stick on the floor , and even encouraged Jayakanthan when he was vociferously -- for Jayakanthan , modelling himself on the Communist leader P. Jeevanandam , was no mean public speaker -- criticising him . <p> When some of his party men later complained to Periyar that they were offended by Jayakanthan , Periyar admonished them : " In public life , one should not take personal offence . He is one young man who has responded to us . We have questioned others on so many occasions . Did we then think of the offence we may have caused ? " In keeping with this spirit , the Viduthalai carried a full report of the meeting that included Jayakanthan 's challenge to its undisputed leader . <p> As Jayakanthan returned to take his seat , Periyar beckoned to him , his hands folded in respectful greeting " like the head of a theistic monastery " . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fortnightly Tughlaq , and published when Periyar was alive , a moved Jayakanthan observed , " In those days I would never prostrate at anybody 's feet to seek blessings .

Venkatachalapathy is a Tamil writer and historian working on a biography of Periyar . <p> This is the first of three short stories by Seetha Ravi on the musical trinity -- Syama Sastri , Tyagaraja and Muthuswami Dikshitar .

@@3241232 <p> MUMBAI : Over a family dinner at home with his wife and kids Aparajita and Aryaman , Sanjay Thakker finally made up his mind . Always an outlier in business , he was again ready to step into something that none of his peers ever dreamt off . He was set to rope in a foreign investor - that too a marque private equity player -- into his family jewel . <p> Over 17 years , Thakker 's auto dealership chain Landmark had already transformed into one of the largest networks nationally with 36 outlets across five states . More importantly , unlike most of his peers who happen to be married to a single brand , he was already partnering four . Three of whom - Honda , Volkswagen and Mercedes-Benz - also happen to be the biggest brands in trade around the world . As if that was not enough : Each of his franchisees make money , together clocking Rs 1500 crore in annual sales as on FY15 . <p> Why then do you need a financial partner when capital and success was already in abundance ? Queries from well-wishers and friends were relentless . <p> " I am generally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ improvement , " says Thakker ( 49 ) , the unassuming chairman of Landmark Group sitting in his basement office in Mumbai 's midtown Worli . " In my office there is a poster of a man running and it says there is no finish line ... That 's my mantra in life , " he says . <p> And so it was decided . Landmark will rope in TPG - one of the world 's biggest private equity investor - for a $25 million investment for a minority stake in his company . Manish Chokhani , the India chairman TPG 's Growth arm , and a graduate school mate Syndenham College , has been pursuing Thakker for long since December of 2013 . After almost a year of discussions , it was time to sign on the dotted lines and push the pedal for the next phase of growth . <p> " They bring in credibility and we are getting exposed to global best practices . I would not calculate ROI on a regular basis , per sq foot cost . We were doing a fair job , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of their global TPG colleagues who handled similar investments in China . Already they are helping us to focus on efficiency of capital usage , " he adds . " We have national aspirations and south is the obvious next market for us .

" <p> TPG 's investment into Landmark happens at a time when more than half of the organized automotive dealerships in the country are bleeding due to sluggish vehicle sales , with almost 10-20 entrepreneurs exiting the business or shutting dealership over the last few years . The sector remains largely unorganized , sub-scale and very scattered . For most , it 's a play on real estate and not retail . " From builders to diamond merchants , people have entered this space for all the wrong reasons , " quipped an industry executive . <p> It 's starkly different elsewhere .

In China , TPG has had a successful history of investing in China Grand Auto -- the largest automotive chains in the world with over 500 touch points and 5 lakh cars of annual sales . <p> With annual sales of 2.5 million cars , India was the logical next frontier even though options have been limited . Landmark -- though among the largest - sold only 15,000 vehicles last fiscal .

High infrastructure and manpower costs , increased exposure to working capital and the need to operate multi location set ups are making this business out of bounds od family owned businesses .

@@3241240 <h> Sometimes the chic street food you get in swanky indoor settings may be better than the fare outside . <p> For 150 years almost , Jallaluddin 's family has been cooking kheer at Lal Quan in Shahjahanabad using the exact same recipe . Full fat milk is slow-cooked on a charcoal fire for almost eight hours , with rice . The result is a thick , creamy pudding , full of smoky aromas , a rich golden colour . This is kheer whose fame has spread far and wide ; the shop -- Bade Mian 's , as it is popularly called -- is an urban legend . Yet , while all of us may have dined on its reputation , far fewer have actually sampled the kheer . It is , after all , not easy for an average South Dilliwalla , and others , to brave Chawri Bazaar , get past the hustle-bustle , dodge the onslaught of rickshaws , pedestrians walking into you , thelas carrying bulky sacks and more ... <p> In distant Saket , at the other end of the city , where the crowds may be just as energetic but the scenario drastically different , a new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is quirky , colourful . It puts galauti kebab pate on the menu , to be delicately scooped off with bits of ulte tawe ka parantha-chips . There are sinkable couches , a bar and memorabilia that takes you back to an earlier India . But what is most striking is its dessert special : Jalalludin ki kheer . Presented in a fashionable jar , this is Bade Miyan stuff : charcoal flavour , the same thickened sweetness . The restaurant actually buys the kheer everyday from the Lal Quan shop , plates it differently , and serves up to its young customers . <p> All over India , traditional street food -- chaat , vada pao , bhel puri , samose , mithai , farsaan , and indeed kheer -- is making a huge new transition . From single-dish stalls and shops that traded both in bold flavours and reputations built over hundreds of years , the snacks and sweets are now getting " caf ? -ised " . Bade Miyan 's kheer being retailed out of a chic south Delhi establishment may be an extreme example , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lanes and by-lanes of Agra and Delhi , Mathura and Mumbai , Kolkata , Chennai , Ahmedabad and Pune to get a bite of your favourite street flavours . <p> Cafes , pubs and chains of restaurants such as Monkey Bar , Soda Bottle Openerwalla , Farzi Caf ? and more have put the much-loved street eats in jazzed-up formats for their urban , young and aspirational consumers , so that whether you are in Delhi , Mumbai , Chennai or Bangalore has now become irrelevant to the process of accessing and enjoying the intrinsic flavours of the bazaars of different towns . <p> This month , when Soda Bottle Openerwalla opens up its third outpost in the country -- after its overwhelming success in Delhi -- Bangalore fooderati will have a chance to dine on some tweaked nostalgia . It 's not just the Irani caf ? staples that are on the menu , brun maska and berry pulao notwithstanding . But also quintessential Bombay creations : Baida Roti , Tardeo grilled sandwiches , Bhendi Bazaar Seekh Parantha , Royal Willingdon Sports Club creation Eggs Kejriwal and more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sample these . <p> The flip side is what all street food fans stop to ask : do these replications taste the same ? There is no simple answer . Part of the romance of eating the common man 's food is also the common man 's setting . When you have worked hard for a meal -- shopped relentlessly in Chandni Chowk , braved the Mumbai locals and more , a hot or spicy offering , reasonably priced , will seem better than a gourmet meal in a fancy restaurant , where expectations are that much higher . <p> But there is also a question of nuances . Chaat , for instance , as it has evolved all over U.P . ( and then spread to other parts of the country ) , uses the same basic ingredients but cooked with slightly different spices and variations as you traverse from region to region . Even in cities as close as Delhi and Agra , both capitals of the Mughal empire ( which is when chaat developed ) , an aloo tikki is not the same . <p> In Shahjahanabad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mash of chana dal , pan-fried , then sliced into two and served as such with the fresh coriander green chutney and its counterpart , the tangy saunth or tamarind sauce . In Agra , conversely , the tikki goes under the name of " bhalla " ; the patty remains un-stuffed and is smashed up and served with a lashing of yoghurt and other sauces . The chaat masala used in both these cities is also quite distinct . <p> It is such finer nuances that tend to get lost when more homogenised forms of food retail take over . But the poshing up of street food also needs to be looked at from the prism of Indian chefs finding a more self confident " desi " vocabulary to express themselves and Indian consumers growing more comfortable in their skins to demand familiar flavours with a touch ( or more ) of inventiveness . <p> As a phenomenon , it is quite akin to sushi or rice buns or indeed burgers and crepes redefining themselves globally . People want the ease of dining on nostalgia , but also quirkiness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indian Accent experimenting with khandvi-ravioli or puchkas with multiple flavours of water , or Farzi Caf ? serving up smashed bhel with cold liquid nitrogen or even a Gaggan Anand in Bangkok serving up his famous " Yoghurt " ( a sphere that reminds you of yoghurt in a papri-chaat ) are all efforts to appease this sensibility towards **25;0;TOOLONG . Whether some of these handiworks work , whether they are better than the " originals " may be debatable . It is perhaps also a question of your own sensibilities as a diner . <p> It may be easy to dismiss modern restaurants experimenting with chaat and street eats . After all , it is a form of reverse snobbery to point out that exact hole-in-the-wall shop that serves the best titbit . But in the hand of competent chefs , much of this modern retail manages to retain the essence of its origins . At the fashionable Pali Bhavan in Mumbai , I had galauti kebab almost as good as in Lucknow . That urban legend Tundey Kebabi -- the one-armed cook -- does not make them as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in that city and now seen the proliferation of the kebab empire . <p> Similarly , I like the version of the vada pav that Monkey Bar in Delhi serves up with its square laadi pav and ghaati masala , as also SodaBottleOpenerWalla 's Berry Pulao , though it may be different from Britannia 's . And when I took a bite of the kulle , a now-disappearing chaat from old Delhi , at Desi Roots , it was exactly how my family would do them -- ginger slivers , small distinctive chickpeas in place , inside the fruit cups . There is only one chaatwalla in Chandni Chowk who still dishes these out . But dare I say , Desi Roots offers much better . <p> Sometimes , traditional places are not the most " authentic " -- steadily watering down their wares , tweaking flavours in response to perceived changes in palates and demand . Besides which , at the end of the day , all street food is a matter of innovation .

They had the budgets and the resources for changing the status quo . Although the biggies still continue to do so there has been an explosive spurt in creative ideas and their implementation by individual artists , producers and entrepreneurs . Indie is an acronym for ' independent ' and refers to all such self-motivated people . <p> Bruce Nussbaum , a former editor at ' BusinessWeek ' and current professor at Parsons the New School for Design , refers to a term ' Indie Capitalism ' which points to a ' socially focused , not technology-focused , more designer &amp; artist-centric than engineering-centric ' culture of entrepreneurship .

Each contributes with specific expertise to the creative entrepreneurial process . However , the indie economy is disrupting these traditional roles . The omnipresent equalizing power of the internet is at the heart of this economy . Crowdsourcing &amp; crowdfunding platforms have radically altered the landscape of how things are created . A large number of individuals across the globe contribute ideas , inputs , designs and funds to creative projects and see them coming to life . They also become the initial consumers of the products &amp; services arising out of these projects . Low-cost creative services marketplaces have taken the service industry by a storm . Talented designers , digital marketers , content writers and other creative artists offer their services at highly affordable costs to the indie entrepreneurs thus making their projects economically viable . <p> Value over volume <p> Indie economy does n't run on the mercantile or transactional approach of the traditional services and product industry . The focus is on aspects of higher utility , sustainability of the process of creation , reusing or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ value than mass produced goods that compete on price . <p> Sometime back I had the opportunity of photographing Arushi Aggarwal , a designer of hand-crafted home products with an aim of providing employment to women from lower social strata through her social enterprise ' The Initiative ' . She represents the indie entrepreneur of today who believes in bringing value to consumers through user-friendly and innovative designs than providing the cheapest products . <p> What 's innate in the process of value creation more often than not is the focus of the indie entrepreneur on creating demand for unconventional and ingenious products or services where none exists . Like Jay &amp; Jothsna Rege of Paaduks ; their hand-made , eco-friendly footwear offer a unique alternative to consumers over conventional factory produced shoes . <p> Paaduks shoes <p> It 's mostly about passion than just money <p> Indie entrepreneurs , be it in creative fields like art , music , visual media or social space , are motivated to alter the status quo by introducing a fresh perspective .

@@3257238 <p> Although coincidental , there seems a strong parallelism of the dynamics of changes between the writings of Shakespeare and socio-political discourses of Kashmir . Around four centuries ago , it seems as if Shakespeare knew how Kashmir , like his plays , would turn from an idealistic honeymoon destination to a tragic spot ( from " most beautiful to most dangerous place on earth " ) . Many of us who are aware of the history of Kashmir know that pre-1989 Kashmir ( as a geographical space ) was primarily identified as pornotropic land , with lush green valleys , snow covered mountainous peaks , house boats , Dal Lake , fresh streams and springs . Apart from portraying Kashmir as a celebrated ' beauty myth ' , the world 's second largest Indian based film industry , Bollywood played a crucial role in representing it as a romantic geographical spot , dominated by its scenic landscape . Nevertheless , when it came to representing more than landscape of Kashmir , for example its inhabitants , pre-1989 ' Kashmiri ' , was either a houseboat owner , or a tourist guide , almost a neglected entity entirely engulfed by the landscape . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Haider " discussing Kashmir . Nevertheless , before criticising/analysing ' Haider , ' perhaps an overview of the Bollywood 's historical account of Kashmir would facilitate to examine why it is different and significant from most of the post and pre-1989 accounts . <p> Pre-1989 Bollywood 's Romance with Kashmir : <p> Most of the pre-89 Bollywood movies ' shot in Kashmir ' or ' about Kashmir , ' hardly represent any constituent of Kashmiri identity--be it culture , dress , cuisine , music , or language . The diminutive representation of ' Kashmiri ' was first time seen in Shakti Samanta 's ( 1964 ) film " Kashmir Ki Kali " which was followed by Suraj Prakash 's ( 1965 ) " Jab Jab Phool Khile " and Manmohan Krishna 's ( 1979 ) " Noorie " . It was Manmohan Desai 's ( 1974 ) " Roti " , Bollywood 's first experiment to replicate the Kashmiri traditional dress pheran a long gown , and a headscarf traditional Kashmiri head cover for women . " Apart from being jingoistic , the filmmakers mixed the dress and culture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ further distorted the essence of real Kashmiri characters " , notes Fokiya , of Manipal University . <p> Post Conflict Films : <p> As the focus of the writings of Shakespeare which initially were ' love and romance ' cantered changed in his later writings which were based on tragedy , likewise , the idea and imagination of Kashmir changed from the pre-1989 a ' romantic spot ' to the post-1989 a ' tragic hamlet ' . ' The post-1989 narrative entirely changed the ' image and representation ' of Kashmir , both for the Bollywood , common masses , media houses and potential tourists . After the conflict ( post-1989 ) , ' Kashmiri ' was represented as either a militant/terrorist or a sympathiser of militants who conquered the picturesque view of mountain peaks . The inference was obvious , --Kashmir as a geographic spot is about peace , love , and romance , and Kashmir with its people explicates problem and violence . Bollywood 's such representation of Kashmir was backed by some biased print and electronic media houses , who were hell-bent on associating anything which sounds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , post-89 Kashmir is a breathtaking landscape in which art and violence coalesce into one unforgettable experience . Political , ideological , religious and conflict discourses dominate the post-89 account of Kashmir depicted by Bollywood . The reverberation of soothing waters and falling of soft snow was replaced by gunshots and bomb blasts , and the peaceful flocks of sheep near the meadows were replaced by fearful armed men with lethal weapons . Violence and geopolitics , argues Rai , " have finally intervened within Kashmir 's cinematic performance and reception : with the emergence of Kashmiri separatism in 1989 , the Valley now offers a theatre for a new ' cinepatriotism ' " ( Amit Rai , 2003 ) . <p> Mani Ratnam 's ( 1992 ) Tamil-language ( dubbed in Hindi ) political drama-romance film " Roja " was Bollywood 's first experiment representing post-89 Kashmir . Unlike Vishal Bhardwaj 's last adapted trilogy Haider based on ' Hamlet ' , ( the other two include ' Maqbool ' and ' Omkara , ' adaptations of ' Macbeth ' and ' Othello ' respectively ) , Roja was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human relationships against a background of politics , ( the other two include Bombay and Dil Se ) . These were followed by Vidhu Vinod Chopra 's ( 2000 ) action thriller-drama " Mission Kashmir . " Although their illustration of violence is superficial and exploitative-a strategy what Margaret Bruder calls ' violated cinematography to spectacularize the context . ' Such films brought acceptable outlets for anti-Kashmir impulses among the Indian masses . They were non-realistic sequence of fragmented narratives with exaggerated referential content , and such referential interpretations were without any ' internal evidence ' from Kashmir . Such film narratives worked as propaganda to sell false information to those who can not access reality . Bollywood , in fact , has emerged more as a source of encouragement than just a source of entertainment . Therefore , movies like ' Mission Kashmir ' played a crucial role , in re-shaping the idea of post-89 Kashmir among the majority of Indian masses . Based on the assumptions of " Roja " and " Mission Kashmir , " many non-Kashmiris used to ask me , " Have you seen terrorists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kill people ? " Both the films had the same effect , what the Leni Riefenstahl 's most famous propaganda film mistakenly considered a ' factual film ' ' Triumph of the Will ' ( 1935 ) had . <p> Ironically , very few among the Indian masses have some understanding of the politico-historical discourse of Kashmir , for the majority it constitutes what Ratnam , and Vidhu Vinod Chopra have filmed . Post-89 Kashmiri 's identity assertion changed from a houseboat owner and tourist guide to a suspected militant . It was followed by Shoojit Sircar 's ( 2005 ) war drama romance " Yahaan " and Kunal Kohli 's ( 2006 ) romantic crime drama , " Fanna " -- the first Bollywood movie , where the protagonist sacrifices his life for a ' cause ' rather than romance/love . It semiotically illustrated that Kashmir is perhaps more about a ' cause ' than a ' natural beauty spot ' and apart from its magnificence it inhabits people who have a bigger issue to resolve than just to romance with its snow covered mountains and lush green valleys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discourse , where in one of its scenes , a TV correspondent is shown reporting openly the bomb blast at Rashtrapati Bhawan , Delhi , says " IKF ki maang Kashmir ko azaad karna hai Hindustan aur Pakistan se " meaning ' the demand of IFK ( a militant group ) is to get Kashmir free from India and Pakistan . ' The movie also courageously tried to underscore the politico-historical understanding of the Kashmir conflict -- where in a discussion with high-level officers , Tyagi ( Tabu ) debates about the referendum of Kashmiris . " Kashmir ko 1947 mein referendum ka waada kiya gaya tha , jo abhi tak pura nahin kiya gaya hai " that ' Kashmiris were promised right to referendum , but the promise has not been fulfilled yet ' . Nevertheless , keeping the Bollywood 's traditional rhythm with nationalistic venture alive , it also propagated how the protagonist , a Kashmiri tourist guide becomes a militant and extends his boundaries from Kashmir to Delhi . Such representation of Kashmiris by Bolloywood might be a reason to persuade the people of India to think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to interact , entertain , or trust a Kashmiri Muslim who travels outside Kashmir , be it in buses , trains , or even to get a rented accommodation outside Kashmir . <p> Within the grand narrative of the ' Kashmir conflict ' , there are many sub-narratives , which remained suppressed for long time . However , in 2004 , Ashok Pandit ( a Kashmiri Pandit ) highlighted one of the crucial ( sub ) narratives of the Kashmir conflict-the predicament of Kashmiri pandits . In his film " Sheen " he showed the journey of a Kashmiri Pandit from its idyllic home to a refugee camp . Similarly Rahul Dholakia 's ( 2010 ) " Lamhaa " apart from courageously presetting the account of Kashmir history , highlighted one of the crucial sub-narratives and out come of the conflict -- the plight of ' half-widows ' ( the wives of disappeared men , who are not sure if they are alive or not ) . The film also dared to break the ice by depicting the ( unwanted and unexpected ) image of the armed forces in Kashmir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disappearances and the corruption levels in the Indian Army . Among one of its many intrepid scenes , it showed how the border is opened up to let militants sneak in for a cash payment . It also shows how the Indian government has failed to conduct a free and fair electoral process in Kashmir , where in one scene , a Delhi based politician says , " kursi uski hogi jisse Dilli chunegi , " which literally meant , " Delhi will choose the boss for Kashmir irrespective of who wins or loses in elections " . Rahul Dholakiya also broke the age-old catchphrase from " welcome to Kashmir , the most beautiful place in the world " to " welcome to Kashmir , the most dangerous place in the World . " <p> Haider : <p> There is , probably , always something tragic and twisted in " the world 's most filmed story , Hamlet , " after Cinderella and Haider is the latest .

Following the Revenge Tragedy genre , Bhardwaj 's attempt to depict staple emotions of Hamlet while keeping his focus firmly on Kashmir is praiseworthy . It would not be an exaggeration to consider Haider a remarkable adaptation of Hamlet , intertwined in a story that encompasses Kashmir , militants , politics , power , lust , love and the concept of chutzpah . <p> Haider , according to its director Vishal Bhardwaj , is the first film where we see Kashmir from the inside . The controversies it invited were mainly based on two issues . The first , it attempted to ' feed ' the viewer with new real senses about Kashmir , which many viewers treat unusual and non-intersecting with their understanding vis- ? -vis Kashmir .

In the same manner , some self-styled hyper nationalists assume @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indian masses , thereby exposing the ' real ' picture of Kashmir and Kashmiris . The realist cinema , like naked art is always disturbing , and Haider being realistic is mainly because it engaged a well-informed insider , Basharat Peer , to frame its screenplay . Apart from the controversies , it is essential to understand what ' Haider ' offers different from the Bollywood 's earlier discourses depicting Kashmir . <p> Moreover , there are two main types of audiences , who presumably have interpreted the entire narrative differently . One , the people ( mostly non-Kashmiris ) , who know Kashmir and the conflict , through Bollywood movies and media houses . The other type includes those who are born in Kashmir and are not only the part of the entire conflict but also know/understand subject of Kashmir more thoroughly . For the first group of audiences , it is probably genuine to be reluctant to accept some naked realities filmed in the movie , simply because they have not experienced it , they have not heard about it , they can not understand it , contextualises @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the film was subjective-ethnocentric than rational . I , as a viewer belong to the second group , and analyse the entire film narrative as a Kashmiri who was not only born and brought up in Kashmir but have experienced each part of the conflict , and can relate with each scene of ' Haider ' not with anger or emotions but with haunting memories . <p> Haider 's famous monologue " ' Hum hain ki hum nahin " the direct adaptation of Michael Almeria 's ' Hamlet 2000 ' " To be or not to be " explains the Haider 's psychological conundrum at its best . Haider 's love equations for Gertrude ( Taboo ) , Ophelia ( Shraddha Kapoor ) and King Hamlet ( Narendra Jha ) and hate equations with Claudius ( Kay Kay Menon ) are intricate and befuddling . The protagonist , a politically aware youth engages with the outside world as much as he battles the banes within . His conundrum as a hero who neither kills the villain nor dies in the end sustains until the last moment . <p> Assertion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nevertheless , Haider asserts and articulates many indigenous linguistic and non-linguistic identity symbols . Probably Bollywood 's first project on Kashmir , which starts with a cavernous Kashmiri expression ' hata'ye mou'ji ' ' oh mother ! ' It is not a simple Kashmiri linguistic expression and assertion of identity , but an expression of pain , grief and suffering , whose usage frequency has increased more than any other word in Kashmiri language , at least from the last twenty-five years . Be it a Kashmiri woman , men , old , young , Hindu , Muslim , Sikh all have memories associated with this expression , which are not pleasant . It is followed by a background sound of ' aazan ' in typical Kashmiri accent . One of my friends from South India visited Kashmir in 2006 , once he heard ' aazan ' from a local mosque ; he asked me ' is it in Kashmiri ' ? Such overt assertion of linguistic identity statements is prominent in many scenes of the film . For example , Tabu , as a teacher in a school employed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entail many facetious and serious narratives . For instance , a friend of mine from Delhi once jokingly told me : ' aap Kashmiri log na dil se Bharat bolte ho na zuban se bolte ho ' meaning , " You Kashmiris neither speak the word ' Bharat ' by heart nor do you pronounce it correctly " . He was pointing to the aspirated sound b which the native Kashmiri speakers can not pronounce properly ; instead , native Kashmiri speakers pronounce it as Barat without aspirated bh . Therefore , from a linguistic-identity assertion , ' Haider ' is different from the other older Bollywood narratives . <p> The film exposes a crucial aspect of harassment of common masses by the security agencies on the pretext of search operation- ' crackdown , ' the ' biggest tragedy ' that took place in the mid-1990s . During the peak of militancy , the early morning news from the adjacent towns used to be dominated by the crackdowns , cordons , encounters , bomb blasts , raids , cross-firing and ambushes between the military and armed militants . For the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people used to sleep in open fields far away from their homes . To terrorize locals , in many such crackdowns , the men in uniform ( Armed forces ) , will pick up a random person , torture him in front of the entire public of the area , the crowd will listen his cries helplessly and feel humiliated . I assume that in a generation that has lived through such traumatic events in the 1990s , the memories are potent -- and sufficient to provoke the Kashmiri populace to violent incidents such as ' stone-pelting ' against the Indian security forces at a moment 's notice . In this context , as I see it , the innumerable ' stone-pelting ' events from 2008 and 2010 , for instance , were not the sudden , ' flash ' uprisings that they appeared to be but involved deep-rooted memories of the atrocities and terror of the 1990s . <p> Disappeared Husbands and Half-widows Wives : <p> Haider candidly reveals the theme of ' disappeared ' there by uncovers the mystery of the term and portrays how it is rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is obvious to everyone who took them away from their homes . For example , Haider 's father turns out to have been " disappeared " . It tries to make a note for the people who always claimed that the people who disappeared in Kashmir crossed the border and went to Pakistan for armed training , and for those who are still unaware that the wives of those disappeared people are called ' half-widows ' . Because these married women are always , in a state of uncertainty whether their husbands are alive or dead but only thing they are sure about their husbands is that they are ' disappeared ' . <p> Fearful Temporal Voyage : Colours of Freedom <p> ' Haider ' rightly demonstrates that among the various outcomes of the militancy in Kashmir , one was that to save the lives of their children , many parents , who , because of their socio-economic conditions , otherwise , could not have managed to send their children away from Kashmir , did so . This migration proved rewarding for many who not only saved their lives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A distant relative of mine , who fled from his home to avoid any possible detention by the men in uniform , after a militant had hidden a gun in his apple orchid , and was later impounded by army , returned with an MBBS degree from Russia . Unthinkable , but it happened ! <p> Nevertheless , no matter wherever and for whatever reason we travel , most of us constantly carry consciously or unconsciously with us a post-conflict anxiety and our discussions are dominated by haunting memories of horror , which we have experienced in Kashmir . Many young Kashmiris still get anxious when they see men in army uniforms anywhere outside Kashmir . Even many Kashmiris residing outside Kashmir reported that they were reluctant to talk freely over the phone , specifically back home to Kashmir . Our dreams are still dominated by the conflict-ridden memories ; I dream of crackdowns , identification parades , the army rushing to cordon our locality , cross-firing etc . <p> The film shows how a family friend suggests Haider 's family to send Haider outside the state so that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand how people live outside freely without any fear . In fact , we used to be surprised , as I remember it , how a bus driver in Delhi was not afraid or bothered to give side to an Army vehicle following the bus , an unusual and courageous act for us . Because not stopping bus and avoiding giving side to any vehicle of the armed forces in Kashmir was a death inviting act . For us , it was almost believing unbelievable . Nevertheless , later we realised that their power to terrorize the masses is limited to Kashmir , where they , enjoy freedom granted by New Delhi and treat themselves as deputy-kings ! <p> Moreover , Haider went outside for studies ( Aligarh Muslim University ) , however , his studies were again dominated by ' freedom issues ' where he studied ' Revolutionary Poets of British India . ' Many of us who went outside the state during the conflict years for studies , either our discussions or our studies were dominated with ' Kashmir , problems , sufferings and memories . ' <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Kashmir during holidays , we were supposed to answer many questions at every check post , and prove we were students and came from ABC state of India , not from Pakistan . Many of us like Haider had committed unconscious mistakes like calling Anantnag as Islamabad . This was no less than a kind of linguistic terrorism where they do n't let them speak what they want to like islamaabad but force corce them to articulate what they do n't wish to like jai hind . <p> Similarly , Haider 's destroyed house , semi-burnt cricket bat symbolises how both the inner , and outer spaces for the Kashmiri youth were completely taken away , destroyed and squawked . Like Haider , they were not responsible for many acts they were punished for , and never deserved the ill-treatment they were gifted . The way Haider is being troubled for no fault of his , in the same pattern ; I have witnessed many real life narratives where innocent people were tortured or even killed . For example , I can not forget June 1995 , when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the neighbouring village Seer , abducted our neighbour , who was an employee of the state irrigation department along with two other men . After five days of the abduction , in the ill-fated night of June 23 , only a limb of our neighbour was found and the newspapers reported that he along with the other two abducted men were butchered , their heads and limbs were separated from their bodies . A wave of discontent , fear and hate engulfed the entire district . Following this brutal episode , for the entire younger generation of our area , the Indian Army is perceived through what they did to our neighbour along with the two others . Later , the son of this murdered neighbour , who is now considered as representing our village among the list of martyrs , was also once arrested and threatened by the local police on some lame excuse . After his release , he once told me : " my father was innocent , he was murdered ; I am not being allowed to live peacefully , do you think that I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he luckily did not do , possibly because of his widowed mother and young sister . This is the story and fate of many fathers and sons of Kashmir . Similarly , another friend like the protagonist of the film is still waiting for his father ( to see him at least , dead or alive ) , who used to run a medical store and about whom everybody knows that he was arrested during a nocturnal raid by the armed forces . Many young men were outcast and stigmatized , and still are , they wo n't get passport or a government jobs . If anyone would still expect such youth to be loyal to the nation and constitution , then he/she has some severe cognitive deficiencies . <p> Role of the Locals : <p> They say there are lot of complexities working together in a conflict zone and that holds true for Kashmir . Haider 's triangular-conflict with his mother , uncle and Self and the scene about the creation of ' ikhwanis ' can be fairly be extended to the Kashmir of 1990s . Some local people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ etc . Many locals were used by the different agencies or they let themselves to get used for their immediate selfish gains . One evening a gunman with an assault rifle was a freedom fighter ( fighting for ' azadi , with Indian armed forces ) , was an ' ikhwani ' ( the counter insurgency group of surrendered militants , who later collaborated with the armed forces ) the following morning . The Ikhwanis created a reign of terror throughout Kashmir and they became synonymous with terror . The government-backed group of gunmen apart from the selective killing of the hundreds of militant-sympathizers , relatives of militants , Jamaat-i-Islami activists and pro-Aazadi people , heedless of their social stature , indulged in ransacking , torture , forced labour , kidnapping and ransom . I have witnessed at least ten killings by this terror group . They were fully protected by the Army and the government , and used to roam around in broad daylight with loaded AK47 assault rifles . Apart from disturbing the ecology and environment by looting the forests of Kashmir , it is believed that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Islamabad and Kulgam districts alone . They not only ran a parallel government , but also worked as the police , the court , the executers , builders , collected hafta from traders , and ' sold ' government land . Hundreds more fled the area , making a new class of migrants . The Ikhwanis were madly conceited which made people apprehensive . People are unable to forget the atrocities and the crimes committed by the government sponsored ikhwanis , and hold the Indian State and the army equally responsible for their crimes , because they know it all was intentionally planned , purposely organised , motivated and executed with the evident knowledge and the facilitation from the State , the Centre and the armed forces . <p> The common Kashmiris also did n't behave less than ikhwanis-only difference was that the ikhwanis openly declared it , but common masses still think they are right and pious . Common people like Ikhwanis would one day come out in streets in thousands raising slogans in favour of aazadi and get killed in hundreds and the following morning will come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call ' Hindustan Nawaz ' " Indian Sponsored " more than national average and justify the act conveniently . They assume that casting vote is a collective exercise and collective sins are always legitimate . Haider 's scene at Lal Chowk , Srinagar consolidates the Kashmiri character , where he raises slogans in favour of aazadi , and suddenly when he saw his uncle recites ' Saare jahan se accha " . What fits for the common masses is : <p> The police officer mercilessly murders three young boys and says to KK Menon , ' mara hua militant be aajkal ek lakh ka hai ' means , " even a dead militant costs one Lakh ' and puts some assault rifles AK on their dead bodies , and orders to call the media . <p> Money , like everywhere matters in Kashmir too . Something remarkable , which never happened in any so called ' conflict zones ' of the world , did happen in Kashmir , where the economic discourses dominated the conflict zone . In the early 1990s when everything seemed perplexed , and when lawlessness was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ improved was the Jammu and Kashmir Bank . Assuming that India might withdraw from the Kashmir taking all our money with it , people withdrew all their money from other national banks and deposited it in the Jammu and Kashmir Bank . Moreover , apart from the growth of the Jammu and Kashmir Bank , a lot of construction work took place in Kashmir and thousands of posh-houses were built during these years of turmoil . Interestingly , on the other hand , Pakistan had effectively presented the base of the Kashmir problem purely as a religious discourse and framed it as jihad ( holy war ) thereby motivating many foreign militants to join the Kashmir Jihadi cadres . Several foreign militants , who had just arrived from Afghanistan , were astonished to see such a large-scale construction work going on in Kashmir . They were unable to understand the conundrum that if there is a warlike situation in Kashmir , as they had been told , why and how Kashmiris were constructing fancy houses . Smiling at a group of Kashmiri men , working at a construction site , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ye sub barbaad ho jaye ga , banake be koi faida nahee , Afghanistan ko nahee dekha , kuchh bhee nahee raha " : ' this all will get destroyed , nothing will be gained by constructing it , did n't you see what happened in Afghanistan , nothing remained . ' Ironically , even after such warfare circumstances , the state of Jammu and Kashmir holds the second position among the list of most corrupted states of India , which Haider has missed to note . <p> Haider shows how even the media houses are unaware about the real nature of the incidents but report what is being reported or briefed to them . Many people , who are largely uninformed about the real incidents in Kashmir , are still angry with Vishal Bhardwaj and co-screen play writer Basharat Peer accusing them for the cinema they assume would lower down the moral of the armed forces . Although , many such fake encounters were investigated by the prominent agencies , as CBI and many people were held guilty but the controversial ' Armed Forces Special Powers Act ' ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 25 , 2000 , at Pathribal , five kilometres away from my home , five men were picked up by the officers of the Indian Army 's Rashtriya Rifles in a conspiracy to display a quick breakthrough in the Chittisingh Pora massacre of March 20 , in which 36 Sikhs were gunned down by ' unidentified ' gunmen . The massacre took place at the time of US President Bill Clinton 's India visit . The Central Bureau of Investigation ( CBI ) , and DNA analyses , suggest the five men - two farmers , two goatherds and a cloth merchant - were innocent and were executed , their bodies mauled and in one case decapitated , and then burned to eliminate all vestiges of their identity . However , recently perhaps the impact of Haider the Army held eight of its men responsible for the 2010 Machil fake encounter . The Times of India on 14th November 2014 reported , " the Army has sentenced two officers and three soldiers to life imprisonment for gunning down three unemployed Kashmiri youths and then trying to pass them off as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sector along the Line of Control in April 2010 . " <p> There are many such incidents , some consolidated by the mass graves found in many places of Kashmir . Such incidents have played a crucial role in widening the gap between the Kashmir and New Delhi and have changed Kashmiris ' perception of the ' Indian democracy ' . People waited for justice ; the guilty were saved ; the wave of injustice has been treated as a routine affair by the Centre . <p> Land of Unfulfilled Promises : <p> In one of the scenes , the police officer says to Haider , " Kashmir is a land of unfulfilled promises . Which promise from Nehru 's promised plebiscite to demilitarisation was fulfilled ? " In other words , he suggests Haider , that even though he is genuine , seeking for rights and justice , nevertheless there is hardly any hope , and further suggested him to compromise , collaborate , forget and live . The root cause of the uninvited sufferings of Kashmiris , according to the police officer is the Indo-Pak confrontation . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hai " , which literally translates ' India and Pakistan are fighting and Kashmiris like grass are being unnecessarily ground in between ' . He tries to convince Haider to forget asking about his disappeared father , which otherwise would invite danger . Unlike the police officer 's suggestion to forget ' aazadi ' and unfulfilled promises , the film acknowledges that there are people who do not consider seeking aazadi a problem , but the stragety to seek it is the problem . Haider 's family friend tries to convince Haider by saying " Hindustan ki aazadi be laathiwala laya tha " , that ' India 's freedom was also achieved by peaceful means by non-violent man Gandhi ' . In other words , Haider infers that to seek freedom is not a problem but to use violence as a tool is unjustifiable . <p> Conflict Induced ' New ' Disease : <p> Apart from creating thousands of half-widows , orphans , and physically disabled , the conflict era has produced thousands of cardiac and psychiatric patients in Kashmir . The film brings out ' a new disease ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a person standing outside his residence was unable to enter , unless he is frisked by someone . The violence in the region has taken a toll on residents , with many people suffering from mental health disorders as a result . On any given day , hundreds of people line up at the dilapidated Rainawari Psychiatric Hospital in Kashmir 's summer capital , Srinagar . One of the psychiatrist noted , " the prevailing situation over the last two decades is contributing to psychiatric disorders . In the early 90 's , we had about 2,000 patients visit us in our psychiatric diseases hospital . Currently we are having more than 100,000 visitors per year . The patients that we see are just the tip of the iceberg . " There are many with post-traumatic disorder and many suffer silently . Moreover , a recent research report indicated that due to the conflict , Kashmir is witnessing an alarming increase in childlessness and infertility among local women . Therefore , the emergence of ' new disease ' is more than fiction and ' Haider ' has rightly filmed it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the best literary parallels is that it makes Rasool Mir 's literary meeting with Shakespeare imaginably successful . Mir was one of the leading Kashmiri poets of the 19th century . Born at Dooru Shahabad , a historic town in Anantnag district Kashmir , he has been titled as Keats of Kashmir for his powerful romantic poetry . Haider has facilitated Shakespeare 's meeting ( through Hamlet ) with Rasool Mir 's through his song : <p> Rasool Mir 's lyrics absolutely fit to the context of Haider and post-89 Kashmir . This historical literary-meeting 's credit goes to " Haider " . <p> Chutzpah : <p> " Chutzpah " artistically adopted by Haider , is a Hebrew word meaning the quality of audacity for good or for bad , could be the title of the History of Kashmir . The most intriguing feature of the film according to ' The Dawn ' is perhaps the scriptwriter 's fixation with the metaphor ' chutzpah ' to entwine the ' separatist militancy ' of 1995 in Kashmir and military excesses inflicted upon the masses through the AFSPA ( Armed Forces Special @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it sound like a local cuss word 's the figure of speech somehow becomes the punch line of Haider 's conflict or the situation of Kashmir . Focusing this " chutzpah " through his lens , the director , inadvertently reveals not only the subtext of his own adapted plot but the ruthlessly capitalised tragedy of Kashmir by Bollywood directors , as well as the political actors of India and Pakistan . <p> Unnoticed Symbols : <p> The symbolism starts right from the title design- white and red , signifying blood on snow . Haider also attempted to demonstrate some symbols , which are highly contextualised , but hard for non-Kashmiris to conceptualize . Such symbols would even have been difficult for the director to interpret , had the Kashmiri writer not assisted him . For example , in one of its scenes , it shows a group of ' Kashmiri eagles ' . I recall during the 1990s , the eagles almost disappeared from the valley , and people used to speculate and gossip that ' eagles have flown to border , to eat the human flesh , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Similarly , it shows graveyard with hundreds of graves and every grave has just been reduced to a number , which is unusual though . Many people put a gravestone with name engraved in it . The graves just indicated by numbers interpret that no one knows the identity of the buried , and therefore no one is able to assert the identity of the killed and the killer . Many associate such unidentified graves with ' disappeared persons . ' <p> Similarly , it shows " a ghost " - appearing and disappearing out of nowhere , and calls himself the ' doctor 's ghost ' . Because Haider 's father , the doctor had disappeared , and forcing Haider to assume he may appear or disappear somewhere . <p> In the last scene , it tries to present violence as a form of expressive art filming ' the burning of snow , ' which symbolises unforeseen tragedy . Snow , in Kashmir has many axioms associated with it . For example , ' kruhun sheen ' ' black snow ' which infers impossible or oxymoron . Haider shows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and burns . It perhaps symbolises that when enough blood has spilled on the blemishless snow , limbs are severed and flesh burned . It ends with graveyard , blood , guilt , death and regrets , perhaps the outcome of every tragic conflict . <p> Concluding Remarks : <p> Haider is hardly an allusion , but it is indeed an allegory in which the characters and developments symbolise real people and events of post-89 Kashmir . During the last 25 years , Kashmiri youth ( like the protagonist Haider ) have suffered as Segismundo-the character of Heiner M ? ller 's excellent drama " Hamletmachine " - who was imprisoned for the crime of having been born . The final questions remains here : Does Haider 's conundrum still prevail among the Kashmiri youth ? <p> Intekam is the voice that drives the film forward , but the film ends with last hope words possibly looking for a hope by giving up revenge by closing words " Revenge only results in revenge .

@@3266238 <h> BlackBerry Leap Review : For Some , a Leap of Faith <p> It seemed for a long time as though this day might never come , but we 're finally able to write about BlackBerry 's recovery . After years of battling irrelevance , making bad decisions and watching its market evaporate , the company seems to have found a stable path . It has pivoted from being primarily a handset maker to a provider of services for all platforms , and the strategy seems to be working . <p> In terms of hardware BlackBerry has narrowed its focus to business users and the enterprise , and is committed to staying out of the sub-Rs. 10,000 consumer market which it clearly can not compete in . Each product it now releases is crafted for a specific audience and delivers exactly what is demanded of it - the innovative BlackBerry Passport ( Review Pictures ) is for those who demand top-notch quality and want to stand out ; the BlackBerry Classic ( Review Pictures ) is for QWERTY loyalists who could never let go , and now the BlackBerry Leap is for touchscreen natives who feel that there might be something better out there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ niches and refusing to play the price and popularity games , BlackBerry is missing out on the mainstream . However , it knows that there are a lot of people who want to be better and more responsive at work , and there are companies that are willing to pay good money to ensure their communications are secure . <p> Look and feelThe BlackBerry Leap is an elegant phone , with a slick black front face and strong lines . There 's nothing to see with the screen off except a bright silver company logo on the bottom . The sides and back have a very grippy rubber finish which contributes to the overall premium feel . You ca n't take the back off , so the battery is inaccessible . The only part of it that we did n't like was the huge " 8 MP auto focus " label printed near the rear camera which seemed out of place on an otherwise sober , professional-looking device . <p> The Leap is strikingly similar to last year 's BlackBerry Z3 ( Review Pictures ) model , and if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be able to tell the two apart . The Leap is only a few millimetres wider and a few grams heavier , but little things are different , such as the power button being on top rather than the side , and the SIM and microSD card flap swapping places with the volume controls , which are now on the left and right sides respectively . There 's still a 3.5mm audio jack on top and a Micro-USB port on the bottom . <p> The Leap will be available in dark grey and white , and we much prefer the former . It feels solid and reliable , though it is a bit too large to use comfortably with one hand . Considering the Z3 was launched only in a few Asian markets but was well received for its build quality and style , it makes sense for the company to recycle the look . What 's surprising is that the Leap is not built by Foxconn as the Z3 was . <p> Specifications and softwareThe two phones have more in common than just looks . While the Z3 was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in our opinion , cut too many corners to justify its price ) the Leap is not quite so constrained . The first thing we noticed was that the display was much improved . The 720x1280 resolution is n't groundbreaking for a 5-inch screen , but it 's far better than the atrocious 540x960 screen of the Z3 . Text is crisp enough and colours pop nicely without being too harsh , which makes for a pleasant overall experience . Sunlight legibility could have been a bit better , but things are okay as they are . <p> Unfortunately that 's pretty much where the improvements end . We are truly amazed that BlackBerry continues to use the now-ancient dual-core 1.5GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon S4 Plus processor - MSM8960 to be precise - which has been in use since the BlackBerry Z10 launched over two years ago . No other company on the planet has such a long lifecycle , and if BlackBerry wants to compete with similarly priced phones in terms of performance , this is not the way to go . <p> The rest of the specifications are somewhat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of RAM , 16GB of internal storage , support for microSD cards of up to 128GB , Wi-Fi b/g/n , and Bluetooth 4.0 . Unfortunately , LTE is not supported the 2300MHz Indian band . The non-removable battery has a rated capacity of 2,800mAh . You get only a proximity sensor and a basic accelerometer . Overall , we 're unimpressed with BlackBerry 's warmed-over offering . <p> The company claims that the value of its platform lies in software and services . As the only mobile handset player other than Apple to control its hardware and operating system , BlackBerry hopes that people will buy the Leap for its ability to help them get work done . BlackBerry OS 10.3.1 has a lot of neat tricks including the ability to run most Android apps and a central communications hub that lets you quickly see your messages across services and react to them quickly . We still are n't convinced that gestures are the most natural way to get around a smartphone OS , but on the other hand the touch keyboard is one of the best we 've ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ features since the Z3 was launched , so you can read all about the platform in our review of that phone . One difference is that the limit of four app tiles on the first menu page has been raised to eight , most likely thanks to the increase in available RAM . <p> PerformancePredictably , the BlackBerry Leap lagged a little in day-to-day use . There were noticeable pauses when launching and switching between apps , and some of the OS animations seemed to drag on just a bit too long . Flipping around through the interface and using the Hub or other simple apps did n't present any problem though . <p> Android benchmarks might run , but would n't paint a true picture of this phone 's capabilities . The cross-platform browser-based SunSpider and Mozilla Kraken tests gave us scores of 1284.8ms and 26889.7ms respectively , which are roughly what we see from ultra-budget Android phones today . <p> ( Click to see full size ) <p> The battery lasted 7 hours , 19 minutes in our video loop test which is respectable but not spectacular . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ non-intensive usage , but the phone did seem to last longer than that in the real world . Call quality was excellent . <p> ( Click to see full size ) <p> The camera is surprisingly competent - not great , but definitely good enough for casual shots now and then . Textures come out nicely and there 's very little noise and compression . The only thing it ca n't seem to handle well is frames with subjects in motion . Even at night , we were pleased with the photos we were able to take . Video is taken at 720p by default and is sharp but a bit shaky . <p> VerdictIn terms of price alone , the BlackBerry Leap is up against illustrious Android devices such as the OnePlus One ( Review Pictures ) . Even Android phones at half this price or less offer a competitive experience . You would really have to be committed to the BlackBerry platform in order to justify a purchase , and BlackBerry 's biggest challenge will be to convince people to give it a try . <p> Thankfully , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more who could be . The target audience is young , non-QWERTY-bound professionals who see value in paying for a hardcore business tool that could give them an edge , and this might be the right smartphone for the job . There 's also the chance that corporations attracted by the prospect of secure communications and manageability will buy them in large numbers for employees . <p> Even if the Leap is only ever considered a secondary phone and only ever used for work , BlackBerry still wins . That 's enough to sell products , and is enough to keep BlackBerry relevant . Sure , we would like to see the company get aggressive and go for competitive mainstream pricing , but this is the path it 's chosen and at least it 's still alive . <p> Download the Gadgets 360 app for Android and iOS to stay up to date with the latest tech news , product reviews , and exclusive deals on the popular mobiles.

The tunnel road project then developed into the Barapullah nallah flyover , which again he had reservations about . Correa eventually resigned from DUAC over the tunnel road project , a month before his tenure was ending , ' ' said an associate , who worked closely with him . <p> Correa is also credited with a lot of work for regularization of slums . " As chairman of National Urbanization Commission , Correa took a view that was contrary to the common perception . He used to say that slums were not a problem but a solution in the making and they should be treated as generators of economic growth , " said INTACH convener and urban planner AGK Menon .

" He felt no city can afford to have such a lowdensity area populated by the elite living in the centre of the city , " added Menon . <p> Architects described Correa 's style of architecture as abstract , with a futuristic approach . " What is not recognized often is his deep interest and concern for India 's historic urban city centres .

@@3368233 <h> Devil in the detail : Choice of base year in new GDP series and revisions need clarity <p> While revisions in GDP estimates are common globally , in India 's case , the magnitude of recent GDP revisions is somewhat higher than has been the case in the past . <p> Consider this : At the launch , new series ( base year 2011-12 ) estimated the 2013-14 GDP growth at 6.9% compared with 4.7% as per the old series . Further , the advanced estimates under the new series suggested a 7.5% growth in the third quarter of 2014-15 . Subsequently , it was revised down substantially to 6.6% . <p> However , it may not be appropriate to put the entire blame on specific methodology adopted or on inclusion of new data sources . Various reasons have been attributed to the divergence in the GDP growth as perceived by major constituents of the economy vis- ? -vis the growth as estimated in the new series ( base Year 2011-12 ) by CSO . <p> Reuters <p> These reasons include quality of information in new data sources such as the ministry of corporate affairs ' MCA21 database ( read here ) to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ data sources as well as their weightage in the calculation of overall GDP . However , debates on suitability of statistical techniques are often inconclusive . <p> One tentative explanation for these sharp revisions in the new series may be the choice of the base-year -- the timing of the launch of the new series as well as limitation in existing data infrastructure . Let us explore these aspects . <p> The base year : The GDP series with base year 2004-05 was launched in 2010 , while the series with base year 1999-2000 was launched in 2006 . Going by the past , the base year for the new series may have been 2009-10 instead of 2011-12 . However , 2009-10 was an atypical and may not be an ideal choice for the ' base year ' . The most obvious reason being , that the Indian GDP slipped in 2008-09 after four years of 8% plus growth . The growth revived to 8% plus levels in 2009-10 and 2010-11 . <p> As continuing with the old series ( base year 2004-05 ) was untenable and the new series @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ options of base year to choose from . With the benefit of hind sight it appears that 2011-12 was an inflection point when economic activity started slipping . The choice of 2011-12 as base year , when a lot of macro trends started exhibiting trend reversal , may present some analytical challenges . <p> Now that 2011-12 is chosen as the base year , it may be worthwhile to reflect how this choice may potentially impact GDP estimates . The year 2011-12 was when the GDP deflator -- an indicator of system inflation used to convert nominal GDP to real GDP -- as the highest in the last 10 years . The inflation has cooled off thanks to a combination of global commodity price correction and moderation in industrial demand ( WPI ) . <p> If inflation is benchmarked to 2011-12 , it may numerically look somewhat lower than otherwise , to that extent , numerically , the real GDP may look higher . However , the more important factor that may drive GDP numbers as well as any potential future GDP revisions is the availability of certain critical information @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Normal data limitations : The limitations of data availability are chronic in most nations including India . To address this well-acknowledged problem , the GDP for a period is first published as a provisional estimate . Then as more data from economy wide surveys as well as corporate balance sheet come in , the provisional estimates are revised approximately one year later and there may be a second revision after another two years . For instance , the 2014-15 GDP published in May 2015 may be revised in 2016 . It is only in 2017 one may finally have a reasonably good idea of the 2014-15 GDP . Of course , this is a global practice and not a revelation . <p> Not surprisingly , these data issues also persist in the new series that was launched in 2015 . At the time of the launch , the Annual Survey of Industries ( ASI ) as of 2011-12 was available . ASI is available with a two-year lag . Employment and Unemployment Surveys ( EUS ) of the National Sample Survey Organisation ( NSSO ) conducted once in five years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full year estimates is typically available with an 8-9 month lag . For example , for 2012-13 , the data available was of November-December 2013 . <p> In other words , the GDP calculation for 2014-15 would have used inputs from ASI 2011-12 , EUS 2011-12 and MCA21 data for the year 2013-14 . These data inputs are suitably extrapolated for the period 2014-15 . However , for extrapolation , high frequency data such as IIP , credit growth , vehicle sales for the 2014-15 are also used to capture the ' recency ' impact . In addition , the quarterly GDP estimates also benefit from the RBI Study on Company Finances , which considered financial results of around 2,500 companies . However , at least a quarterly lag remains in usage of corporate data as well . <p> How Data Limitations Impact GDP calculation : Gross value added ( GVA ) , which is a critical component of the GDP as per the new methodology , can be directly estimated for large listed entities . As such GVA is given as the sum of a ) compensation of employees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ captured from ' depreciation ' in corporate profit and loss ( P&amp;L ) account ; c ) operating surplus which may be approximated by profit after tax ( PAT ) adjusted for property income and current transfers to trade channels and d ) Production taxes less subsidies . <p> For small economic entities such as unregistered businesses , the GVA is calculated using statistical techniques , the input to which comes from surveys such as ASI and EUS . ASI and household sector account for roughly one-fourth of the critical manufacturing sector GVA , as per CSO . <p> Given the lag with respect to data availability , the GDP estimates for the most recent period ( advanced and provisional estimate ) have to depend on extrapolations based on corporate performance and also past trends reflected by the surveys . <p> For instance , the Q4 2014-15 GDP may not have incorporated the worrisome corporate performance of that quarter . Similarly , some of the constituents of GDP may have benefited from improving trends exhibited until ASI 2011-12 . <p> Guessing the direction of future revisions : As per ASI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 24% for the period from 2005-06 to 2011-12 . Comparable growth trends were also observed for depreciation and fixed capital growth , suggesting good economic activity during 2005-06 to 2011-12 . <p> To the extent the GVA calculation of smaller entities is based on these numbers they may show an upward bias . However , as of March 2015 the Volume I of ASI 2012-13 is made available . ASI 2012-13 suggests that not only aggregate worker 's compensation growth has fallen to 11% ( comparable growth rate last seen in 2004-05 ) but total number of workers has also de-grown . Likewise aggregate growth rate of fixed capital and depreciation have also shown muted growth rate as per ASI 2012-13 . <p> The latest ASI will be utilised for revised GDP estimates for all periods from 2012-13 till date and is expected to be published in 2016 . It is possible that these revised growth rates for the period 2013-14 and 2014-15 may be more closely aligned to the popular perception of the economic activity . <p> Removing the urgency from policy actions : GDP estimates are essential to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , idea of the current level of economic activity and how that level compares with the activity in previous time periods . Any confusion created in this regard may potentially lead to ineffective and even counter-productive policy decisions . <p> There is a broad consensus that the worst in terms of economic activity is clearly behind . Sporadic signs of recovery such as higher commercial vehicle sales , improved air passengers or higher electricity production are undeniable . <p> However , doubt remains in certain quarters about the pace of recovery . Those doubts are likely to be resolved when the revised estimates for the 2014-15 GDP are published in 2016 and then further revised in 2017 . <p> If the revised GDP estimates are broadly in line with the provisional estimates then it will be a relief . On the contrary , if the magnitude of the revision is comparable with the revisions of Q3 2014-15 , it is worrisome because then it may imply that India is losing out on the urgent concerted action required both by the government as well as the RBI .

Dedication to the Narasimhaswami of Melattur binds them to perform in a 10-day festival every year in front of the temple of Varadaraja Perumal .

@@3387233 <p> Chaitanya Shareef Kulkarni , from Dharwad , was finding it difficult to get excited about graduating in architecture , the cast-iron syllabus refusing to grab his attention and imagination . So one fine day , he dropped out and began interning at a firm . Browsing online , he chanced upon the courses on offer at the newly launched Ashoka University , Sonepat , Haryana . The variety and flexibility on offer made the 20-year-old change his mind : he now hopes to graduate from Ashoka with an interdisciplinary major in computer science and entrepreneurship . But he 'll take a final call on that later . For now , he 's enjoying a taste of history and philosophy ; he 'll zoom in on what to specialise in during later semesters . " In such an environment , instead of getting repelled by education , you feel like learning more and more , " he says . <p> The range , the exposure , the flexibility , the choices -- universities like Ashoka are offering students a free run of the garden of intellectual delights , and students like Kulkarni are experiencing something of the bracing , exuberant spirit of ancient Greek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' curiosity into a self-generated pursuit of knowledge . Liberal arts universities and colleges have brought relief and sustenance to free-thinking young people -- the kind who might take a gap year after Std XII , maybe working or pursuing a hobby , before deciding on a course of study or a creative vocation . Purvayi Krishnamurty , for instance , says she 's still not sure if she wants to major in English or philosophy -- or maybe history . But she 's happy with the " option of deciding later " , happy to bask in all three till then . <p> Broadly , liberal arts institutions focus on developing general intellectual capacities , in keen contrast to the courses offered in professional , vocational or technical colleges . The broad sweep is towards the humanities -- literature , language , philosophy , history , fine arts -- but the physical sciences , mathematics , life sciences and social sciences are also on offer , besides niche interdisciplinary areas like the history of science . To major in maths does not mean that you may not do a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It 's about openness and pluralism , within disciplines and between disciplines , " says Gilles Verniers , assistant professor of political science at Ashoka University . <p> Sociologist Dipankar Gupta says he feels sorry for himself that he was a student in a different era . As director of the Centre for Public Affairs and Critical Theory at Shiv Nadar University , Gautam Buddha Nagar district , Uttar Pradesh , the former JNU professor sees , and indeed has helped create , the flexibility on offer . " It has been about rethinking and repackaging the way students are taught , about reintegrating courses , offering composite degrees , " he says . College education in India has so far been about the drudgery of structured syllabuses and limited horizons . " The liberal arts colleges are about nursing your interests , exploiting your potentialities . " <p> My mindspace A student indulges her curiosity at the Ashoka library . ( Photograph by Tribhuvan Tiwari ) <p> There is a core common curriculum , however , designed to help students understand " the forces driving local , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awareness of the problems facing an increasingly integrated world " , as Shiv Nadar University puts it . Similarly , Ashoka has 12 mandatory foundation courses covering multiple disciplines in the sciences and humanities . Beyond that , students are free : they declare their major by the end of the third semester , and then complete 12 to 16 courses in the chosen subject to earn a degree . They have a range of minor subjects to choose from , they may opt for a double major , they may undertake project work and even ( within reasonable limits ) create unique curriculums for them ? s ? elves . Flame University , Pune , offers similar flexibility after a foundation course . Says a spokesperson , " Students can explore , reflect , wander and meander in the different universes of knowledge and discover their passion and calling . " <p> The new liberal arts institutions are free from the shackles of government and bureaucracy . Hence they offer innovative courses and allow for lots of choices . <p> India has historically nursed learning in the arts -- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began a tradition that was continued by the Benares Hindu University , Aligarh Muslim University , Santiniketan and Viswabharati . But in recent decades , liberal arts education in India has been on the decline . Policy and preference have favoured practical or professional courses . But there has always been a demand for liberal arts -- frustrated perhaps by the Indian university system and the drab opportunities it offered -- and new , private universities , more or less completely free of government control , are tapping into the business potential . But there is much to be said for the broad-based education on offer . <p> Rudrangshu Mukherjee , vice-chancellor of Ashoka University , says the emerging industrial sector is responsible for the rise and rise of technical and management education . <p> Jonathan Gil Harris , professor of English , blames liberalisation . " From the learner being encouraged to seek knowledge , he was being asked to passively absorb practical knowledge . What we got was an artificial hierarchy of knowledge guided by a myopic pragmatism , " says a Flame spokesperson . While that emphasis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of how society works , people skills and empathy were found lacking . Teachers at these universities hope to change that . Says Gil Harris , " There 's a demand for a new set of 21st century skills . " <p> Ira Bhaskar , professor of cinema studies and dean at JNU 's School of Arts and Aesthetics , speaks of how liberal arts education works . " It intervenes , makes you aware of and relate to the world in ways that are far-reaching , " she says . She holds up IIT Madras as an example for offering electives from economics , English , development studies , history , philosophy , politics , sociology and even an integrated MA in liberal arts . " The biggest problem is that not enough universities give this kind of value to liberal arts , " she says . Teachers like Ira and Mukherjee hope to eventually change the mindsets of Indian students and parents and make them see education as an end in itself , not just as a stepping stone to a job . <p> The new liberal arts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying out its own experiments . Being private universities , they are beyond the stranglehold of government and bureaucracy . Flame is a self-financed university in Maharashtra . Ashoka is notified as a private university under the Haryana Private Universities ( Amendment ) Bill , 2014 , with power to award its degrees , diplomas and doctorates . It is also listed on the UGC website . <p> Ashoka is fully devoted to liberal arts , but Shiv Nadar University has engineering , law and management degrees too . Flame , too , offers management courses . The thrust at Shiv Nadar University is on advanced research . Ashoka has a unique one-year Young India fellowship programme , a full-time academic programme , with emphasis on writing , research and experiential learning . Launched in 2011 , it is targeted at graduates and professionals from all walks of life . <p> Teaching methods are also novel : it 's all about interactions and discussions . At Ashoka , political science could mean visiting constituencies during elections , interviewing candidates , filing reports . Cinema could mean workshops , drama and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Flame , students take courses to understand the ' why ' of social realities in the Indian context . They do internships at NGOs , learn to make documentaries , face panelists in discussion . <p> The campuses are sprawling and the classrooms use state-of-the-art digital infrastructure , the libraries are well-stocked . But these universites also boast of some big names in academe . Students have access to professors at the top of their respective fields . Exchange programmes and collaborations with foreign universities are just as common . Shiv Nadar University has collaborations with Carnegie Mellon and Duke Universities ; Ashoka has alliances with University of Pennsylvania , University of Michigan and King 's College , London . <p> These institutes all proudly claim that they groom students into well-rounded personalities rather than churning out mass-produced nerds . But is it all so rosy ? There is a flip side . As in other fields , the competition for seats is intense and the admission process rigorous and highly selective . The promise of offering " Ivy League education " means that the fees would burn a hole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , and critics say they have an elitist streak . <p> However , Ashoka claims that it has allocated a sum of Rs 21 crore for the incoming batch of students in 2015 . " A student who has earned admission to the university will not be turned away if he or she is not able to pay tuitions , " says Mukh ? erjee . Eighty-eight students out of 133 in the first batch ( 68 per cent ) have received full or part scholarship on all expenses . Similar scholarships are available at Shiv Nadar and Flame .

In the Western markets Russian banks had recognizable brands , and even started to become familiar with the european retail ( Sberbank Europe AG , Sberbank subsidiary and VTB Deutschland , VTB Group subsidiary ) . Restrictions from the main financial partner for local bankers became more of a moral challenge than commercial . It was necessary to change the whole business paradigm , to look for alternative capital sources . <p> The sanctions issue continues to be extremely painful for banks - Sberbank , VTB , Gazprombank , Russian Agricultural Bank and VEB declined to comment on the annual results of its work to alleviate the impact of sanctions . <p> No serious consequences <p> According to the Cbonds 's data , the largest banks , subjects to sanctions , were even able to reduce the amount of debt load in that year . Redeemable Sberbank debt declined as of July 30 , in annual terms by 19% to $13.5 bln , Gazprombank 's - by 28% to $12.31 bln , VEB - by 15% to $17.23 bln . Total debt of VTB and Russian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respectively . In ruble terms the amount of debt to maturity showed an increase due to a devaluation of the ruble by 40% . <p> This year the banks do not have to repay not a large volume of the foreign currency debt . Sberbank has to pay 410 mln Swiss francs in the autumn , VTB - 300 bln Swiss francs and 2 bln yuan , Gazprombank - 500 mln Swiss francs and $1 bln , the Russian Agricultural Bank - 450 mln Swiss francs , VEB does not have payments on foreign currency debt in the near future . Russian banks did not have any problems with the repayment of the debt this year . <p> Although formally only the Western currency markets are closed for the five largest Russian banks , due to the global integration of the investment flows the Russian companies can easily find partners in other countries .

Late last year Gazprombank approved the placement of bonds for 70 bln rubles ( $1.16 bln ) . It is important to understand that the possibilities of the domestic bond market are very limited . The share of the Russian Central Bank in the liabilities of state banks for the year increased by 2.2% for Sberbank , VTB - by 8.3% , the Russian Agricultural Bank - by 5.4% ( according to Fitch ) . Thus , although the reliance on the Central Bank 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be yet estimated . <p> The banks suffered the most from the sanctions indirectly - external constraints hit on the solvency of clients , which led to an increase in the cost of risk and the formation of unprecedented reserves . For example , the cost of VTB 's risk at the end of last year reached 4.6% , having almost more than doubled in a year . However , the bank tightened its credit policy and risk management , which made it possible to reduce the cost of risk to 2.2% by the end of the Q1 of this year . In the Q1 Sberbank increased provision charges 1.5-fold to 115 bln rubles ( $1.9 bln ) . However , the quarterly rate of growth of Sberbank reserves somewhat reduced in quarterly terms . <p> Asian issue <p> Asian capital markets could become an outlet for Russian banks , but in the long run . The fact is that Asian investment bankers are afraid to work with banks subjects to sanctions because it may mean sanctions for them as well . For example , the US Treasury has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This year Russian bankers have visited Asia several times , hoping to attract capital : German Gref visited Singapore , Gazprombank held a series of road-shows in the capitals of the Asia-Pacific region .

VTB is traditionally present in the eastern capital markets ; Gazprombank in spring approved the documentation for the bank 's exchange bonds in yuan . " The specific plans for banks on placing these bonds have not been yet determined , " Gazprombank said . <p> Analysts doubt the possibility of the forced subjugation of Asian markets . " It is unclear whether the biggest banks will be able to place their bonds in the Asian capital markets . There are such capabilities and intentions , but is it really possible ? The situation is ambiguous . There is a possibility , but it is small , " a source in banking circles said . <p> Analysts fear that the sanctions could be extended indefinitely . The banks could withstand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but a 10-year break in relations would lead to serious consequences . " A further extension of the sectoral sanctions will lead to the isolation of the banks . We will slowly come to a planned economy .

It ends with a reference to India 's " continuous unprovoked ceasefire violations " and how Islamabad " impressed upon " New Delhi the need to " observe the 2003 Ceasefire Understanding to create peace and tranquility at the LoC and Working Boundary " . But Wednesday 's incident was only mentioned in a perfunctory statement by Qazi M Khalilullah , spokesperson , MOFA accusing India of " fabricated incidents " . <p> A number of newspapers have taken the cue and either buried or ignored the story entirely , opting instead to play up the Sialkot cross-border firing with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MOFA 's statement pronouncement of India 's " continuous unprovoked ceasefire violations " . <p> Among those that actually reported on the Udhampur attack , most ran a threadbare and largely perfunctory report like the one that appears in The Express Tribuneand Pakistan Today .

However , an opinion piece in the same newspaper questions the logic of differentiating between ' good ' and ' bad ' terrorists , but makes a thinly-veiled effort to shift the blame by hinting that Islamabad 's lack of action on anti-India groups may be linked to " Beijing ( being ) perfectly fine with eastward looking jihadists as long as they steer clear of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> In the past too , Pakistan has leaned heavily on its three-pronged approach . <p> The statement embodied all three elements of the typical response : Denial ( Pakistan " categorically rejects the baseless allegations " ) , misdirection ( noting that Singh 's " provocative comments are a threat to peace and security of the region " ) and finally , self-victimisation ( identifying " a continuing tendency of India to cast blame on Pakistan for any terrorist incident in India " ) .

Collaborations like these are commonplace in the world of fashion but in contemporary arts , such instances of coming together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few and far between . <p> Artist Puneet Kaushik is known to use textiles in his work but the opportunity has made him push the boundaries even further . " I have used crochet in my work earlier but for the first time , I used tufting . This exchange has pushed both the sides . Weavers were working in a conventional manner but collaborating with us , they could experiment . A lot of inputs came from them , " says Puneet , who is making five works for the show . <p> One of the works , in which he has used tufting -- -- a popular way of making carpets now -- -- combines convex mirrors and steel . In tufting , the yarn is stitched through a pre-constructed backing , to form a loop . To hold the loop in place , the back is coated with latex .

The weaver who has been with Raj Group since 1992 rues the fact that no young weavers are taking up weaving . Tufting still has more takers than other hand-led techniques because of tufting machine guns . <p> Participating artists have drawn differently from the environs .

She is also experimenting with namda , rugs made of felted wool and cotton , a heritage of Kashmir and Rajasthan . On the compressed wool , she would be doing embroidered drawings on it . <p> One of the most brilliant pieces is the map of Panipat by Nidhi Khurana , who Shailin says is the only artist employing each and every weaving technique . " Nidhi did extensive research . She made numerous trips to figure out Panipat and important spots like Kalandar Shah 's dargah , museum of Panipat , the historical battlegrounds .

As an industry that survives on the art of creating , it is imperative to find a way to create tangible memories from a tradition that may cease to exist in the future . And while we pride ourselves as being at the centre of Panipat , where it all happens , it was important for us to find the right channel to communicate our concern and what better way than art , " says Sumeet Nath , Managing Partner , Raj Group .

The condition is responsible for 50% of transplant failures . Developed by nephrologists at Sanjay Gandhi Post Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences , the test is non-invasive in nature . It involves isolation of a biomarker called KIM-1 ( kidney injury molecule-1 ) from urine samples . <p> Till now , symptoms of the trouble showed up 36 - 72 hours after the transplant procedure . Also , an equal time went in usual tests to finalise the diagnosis . All this while , significant damage to the kidney took place even as crucial time for intervention was wasted . The damage was in addition to the impact of certain nephrotoxic medicines administered in the post operative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the patient 's life expectancy was reduced while the suffering increased manifold . <p> Talking to TOI , Prof Narayan Prasad who 's team identified the bio-marker , said , " Acute kidney failure is caused by acute tubular necrosis ( ATN ) which instead occurs due to ischemic injury to the kidney ( something which is almost unavoidable in transplantation ) . The injury releases KIM-1 first in the kidney and then in the urine . Estimation of KIM-1 in the urine helps in predicting if the patient would eventually develop acute kideny failure or not . " <p> The method would be especially useful in Indian scenario where renal transplants are live in nature . In SGPGI for instance , nine of ten kidney transplants are live while just one is cadaveric ( organ donation from brain dead patients ) .

" Once confirmed , required medication alterations are made and extra care regimen is introduced to save patient 's life , " he said . <p> Test developed by PGI is <p> - Non-invasive . <p> - Saves time .

But the ones trying to enter the West are only a small fraction - less than 10 per cent of the millions of refugees for whom Europe remains out of reach . All this week , on Exodus , a special series on NDTV , we trace the invisible roots of the refugee crisis from its point of origin . This is the first of a series of reports , from the war-torn Syria-Turkey border . <p> SURUC , TURKEY : In a town at the edge of a country at war , we met 12-year-old Xemgin . Stacking shelves in a cloth shop in Suruc , a dusty Turkish town just a few miles from the border with Syria , Xemgin is from Kobane , the Syrian border town overrun by ISIS in October 2014 , ensuing in a bloodbath and thousands fleeing . <p> Xemgin 's family was one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , many of them impoverished - the invisible majority in the migrant crisis roiling the world . For eight hours of work , six days a week , Xemgin earns a pittance - just 20 Turkish lira ( less than USD 10 ) a week . <p> He told us he misses school in Kobane , where he learnt science , math and history , but there is little choice . <p> Across the road , in a tiny sewing shop , is Mohammed , also from Kobane and like Xemgin , no longer in school . The 13-year-old has a new skill - stitching curtains to be sold in the local market . <p> Mohammed works 8-10 hours every day and his wages are the same as Xemgin . Nearby is 13-year-old Khaled - looking older in his striped white shirt - who has learnt how to operate an embroidery machine . He told us he has been working at the shop for the last three years , which means he started at 10 . <p> Some of the children told us that there are no proper schools for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he has earned a small wage increase : from 20 to 50 liras a week . Khaled and the others are not the only ones . In the bazaars of Suruc , the children of Kobane are everywhere , working long , hard hours , at slave-like wages . <p> Their employers claim that the children are getting a fair deal . Mohammed 's employer said that Suruc is not a wealthy town , and what he pays is sufficient . But the minimum wage in Turkey is 1000 Liras per week and the children barely earn 2 per cent of that . Child labour is illegal . <p> Prompted by adults , some of the children told us that there are no proper schools for Syrian children in Turkey . The medium of instruction is Turkish or English , which Syrian children , familiar with Arabic , are not able to comprehend . <p> The more compelling reason , though , is hardship . In a rundown neighbourhood of Suruc , we met Khaled 's parents . Their story is harrowing . They lived in Raqqa , the Syrian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ISIS , before moving to Kobane , where the terrorist group followed them , and now here . <p> Khaled 's father Mustafa , a plumber , said he had little choice but to make his son work . " For a job , a Turkish plumber gets 700 lira while I would only get 400 lira for the same job , " he said . <p> Most of them are unlikely to land up at Europe 's gates . They just can not afford it . <p> Mustafa struggles to scrape a living , supporting his wife and four children of whom Khaled is the eldest . Pointing to a t-shirt that Khaled 's younger brother was wearing , their mother said it was bought in Syria three years back . " We can not afford new clothes , " she said . <p> Turkey , on its part , has tried to help , spending close to seven billion dollars to care for the nearly 2.5 million Syrian refugees inside its borders . The Syrian war has left an estimated four million people outside its borders . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it to the West but the popular narrative is that Europe is swamped with Syrian refugees , a distortion that angers Turkey . <p> In a grudging admission of this asymmetry , a meeting of European leaders in Brussels last week discussed greater funding for Turkey 's efforts to host Syrian refugees . But Sebnem Ackapar , a migration expert who teaches at the South Asian University in New Delhi , says promises of money have so far not materialized . " Turkey has received only USD 417,000 from the international community , " she said . <p> Khaled 's parents , and most others like them , are unlikely to land up at Europe 's gates . They just can not afford it . <p> As we found when we travelled to the Syrian border at Kobane , those who left can not return home anytime soon . The town is back under the control of the Kurds , who are fighting both the ISIS and Bashar al-Assad 's regime , but large parts remain devastated ; ISIS lurks in the nearby countryside . <p> Like Khaled , Mohammed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lifeless on a beach in western Turkey shocked the world - was also from Kobane . His family 's attempt to spirit him away to a better life ended in a tragedy when their boat capsized in the Aegean Sea between Turkey and Greece . <p> But as we found in the markets of Suruc , the choices for those refugees who stay back are hard , even harder for the very young .

It 's odd considering that Bluetooth has been an integral part of their SoundLink series , and given the staggering number of songs that are streamed across the world every single minute . We had our first brush with the SoundTouch 10 back in October as Bose showcased its entire new range of speakers . This was the smallest member of the new family but made a big impression . First impressions can sometimes be deceptive , so we decided to give the SoundTouch 10 a serious spin and see if it 's ready enough to move into your den or office . <p> The SoundTouch 10 is designed to blend into your most personal spaces . We love its minimalist design language -- it comes in black and white . There 's a set of controls ( including volume and channel pre-sets ) that merge seamlessly into the top of the speaker while four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the speaker . The speaker is slightly above eight inches tall and weighs under 2kg making it easy to move within and outside your house . Sadly , the device is not portable in the true sense of the word -- it requires a power source . The flip side is you do n't have to worry about the middling battery life that most portable Bluetooth speakers seem to struggle with . A portable speaker with the same form factor could be a winner . There are at least four power cables in the box , so you 're covered in almost any corner of the world . There 's also a slinky remote control unit that duplicates the controls that sit on top of the speaker . <p> Pairing the device via Bluetooth -- we tried it with three different devices , is a breeze . You can also hook up using the Bose SoundTouch app . The app allows you to sync up to your home or office WiFi network . The set up process was slightly faster on iOS than on the Android version . The app @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , making the remote control unit slightly redundant . The WiFi functionality allows you to effortlessly tune into Internet Radio stations across the world . You will be spoilt for choice with the sheer range of stations ; we wish they were categorised according to genre rather than by region and country . The streaming option also allows you to tap into your Pandora or Spotify subscription , services that are unfortunately not available in India . You can use the six pre-sets on the speaker to add your favourite radio channels . I found the app quite intuitive ; when I added a second device on the same Wi-Fi network it automatically signed into the account . The convergence of Bluetooth and WiFi allows you to stream any song ( from your device playlist ) , or even YouTube , and then use the WiFi to broadcast it to multiple SoundTouch speakers , allowing you to take your music around the house . <p> Ultimately , it all boils down to sound quality , and the Bose SoundTouch 10 comes out on top almost in all scenarios .

It 's not something you will need to worry about if you live in an apartment with pesky neighbours . We found this speaker produces much better sound than some of Bose 's portable SoundLink devices . <p> At Rs 19,013 , the SoundTouch 10 is certainly pricey ( it 's also slightly higher than its $199 US sticker price ) and you ca n't use it during a power shutdown or on the beach .

@@4867238 @ @ @ @ a Dire Picture of Rural Distress <h> Share this : <p> This year has been yet another bad one for the agriculture sector . With just 0.2% growth in the last quarter , a good monsoon was essential to revive the sector . However , a deficient monsoon worsened the situation and as many as nine states have been forced to declare a drought . With almost 60% of India 's workforce engaged in agriculture , the slowdown has immensely affected the rural economy . <p> The rural distress has in turn fed the number of farmer suicides , but more often than not , states have failed to give due recognition to this problem . <p> Of all states , Uttar Pradesh has the highest deficiency of rainfall this year , leading it to declare 50 of its 75 districts as drought-hit . It has sought an assistance of Rs.2,058 crore assistance from the Centre . UP 's data on farmer suicides is also dodgy . Farmer representatives accuse local officials of gathering information on farmer deaths but deliberately not registering it . <p> Recently , Swaraj Abhiyan , an initiative led by activist-politicians Yogendra Yadav and Prashant Bhushan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impact assessment across seven districts in the Bundelkhand region -- Jhansi , Jalaun , Lalitpur , Chitrakoot , Banda , Hamirpur and Mahoba . Some 1,206 households across 108 villages were surveyed and responses registered on five parameters : the extent of crop damage , impact on food and nutrition , impact on employment opportunities , impact on cattle , and availability of relief measure . <p> Bundelkhand region , Uttar Pradesh . <p> Damage to major crops <p> According to them , the deficient rainfall and the ensuing drought caused extensive damage to major crops . The worst affected was soybean : 96% of households reported a total loss . <p> A similar number also reported a total loss of previous rabi crops . <p> Drinking water crisis <p> The availability of water was a serious issue after crop-damage . As many as 38% of households reported inadequate availability of drinking water . As the table shows , the water situation has deteriorated from the past year . The groundwater crisis in Uttar Pradesh has worsened by nine times in the past 11 years . <p> Not getting adequate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ households consumed dal only for four days a month , against just three days by the poorest households . Protein intake is severely low , with households consuming egg , meat or fish just once a month at most . Sixty percent of general households have n't consumed milk even once in the past 30 days ; the same figure was 69% for their poorest counterparts . <p> In the last eight months , 38% of villages reported at least one death due to hunger and malnutrition . Fully two-thirds ( 67% ) of households did n't get or were n't sure of eating two meals a day while 79% of households reported eating rice and roti with just salt or chutney on a few occasions . <p> The data also suggests the drought may well be a famine . Almost one-fourth ( 24% ) of households reported sending their child for labour work while 36% had to borrow food for survival . <p> Cattle bears the brunt as well <p> Almost half of all villages surveyed ( 48% ) reported more than 10 cattle deaths due to starvation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cows or buffaloes were abandoned . <p> Despite the severe conditions faced by the region 's residents , the state government 's response has n't been satisfactory . <p> Only 59% of the poorest families had an MNREGA job card , while just 42% possess a BPL card . <p> The average foodgrains received from the ration shop is just 25.7 kg . <p> On average , just 9.5 days of MNREGA work has been provided to households since Holi . <p> After the survey , the Swaraj Abhiyan team met Akhilesh Yadav , the chief minister of Uttar Pradesh , to urge him to take some urgent steps . Though there have been some announcements , it is imperative that the affected families receive help immediately , the team says . <p> A recent report by the Associated Chambers of Commerce and Industry of India ( ASSOCHAM ) warned that the price of rice may shoot up in the coming months as stocks of the key staple cereal are depleting fast thanks to deficient rains and fall in output .

The reason is the small size of sample taken for study . There are certain grass root problems of Bundelkhand region which can be pointed as below . 1 : Anna Pratha ( free cattle roaming around ) 2 : Vanroz ( Neel gai ) 3 : Availability of power and power line to cater tubewells 4 : limited supply of water in canals and that too intermittent 5 : unsupportive and untimely monsoon 6 : unavailability of chak roads <p> 7 : poor connectivity of road and rail 8 : Absence of public and private institutions which can generate employment and help households to fetch some cash in case of poor yield . <p> Ram Prakash <p> Apart from frequent droughts , poverty and illiteracy , feudal society is biggest problem for the region . There are no social workers . Educated and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the corruption network . They are the link between the poor and government officials to misuse the government funds . Politicians take bribe to post officers in Bundelkhand and officer misuse development funds .

The Battle was a part of Burma Campaign which was fought during World War II be- tween the British and Japanese forces from 4 April 1944 and ended on 22 June 1944 . Japan 's entry into the war was driven by the need to expand its territory and get access to the natural resources of the occupied terri- tories so that it can enrich its economic condition and become world power . Japan in- vaded India through Kohima and its plan for invasion was mainly motivated by three factors -- one , to defend and keep hold of Burma from the British ; second , to wipe out the British from Asian countries ; third , Japan needed victory in order to boost her morale which was low due to their defeat in the pacific .

In order to do away with the Japanese from the Naga villages , the British conducted air raids . It was also reported that Naga houses containing paddy were set on fire by the British Army as a measure of denial to the Japanese , and the fire inevitably spread to other houses so that even before fighting began a good many houses and the greater portion of the paddy stocks were completely destroyed . The retreat of the Japanese caused destruction on a vast scale since each village on the line of retreat was defended by the British .

Looking for a solution , they zeroed in on using a speech analytics software to bridge the digital divide . <p> It took them a year to develop a working prototype , and within a month of developing the prototype , they received a seed funding of $100,000 . During the early days , the team focussed on using standard phones to allow users access to the services . <p> As customer engagement grew , their technology also evolved to provide speech analytics , voice biometrics , and virtual assistant solutions to enterprises . <p> Today , Uniphore has over 70 enterprise customers and over 4 million end users .

" We have also received appreciation for our products across The Philippines and the UAE , " says Umesh . <h> Understanding the voice of the customer <p> " For us , the eureka moment was the realisation that voice will always play a central role in any customer service and that service will be seriously hampered if it does not have the voice channel . We envisioned that if automation were to truly become a part of customer engagement , then machines should understand , process , and respond to human speech , " says Umesh . <p> The idea of Uniphore 's solutions is to extend the power of speech to revolutionise and transform human and machine interactions . Their solutions allow any software application to understand and respond to natural human speech , thus enabling humans to use the most natural of communication modes , speech , to engage and instruct machines . <p> One of Uniphore 's recognised pilot runs is the work they did for the financial inclusion project in rural areas . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used by micro-finance organisations and rural banks were capital-intensive . <p> " We spoke to the institutes and told them that today , everyone has phones with speech and voice biometrics , you can do banking without a card or a device , " adds Umesh .

We have SaaS-ified the business and adopted practices like ' try and buy ' to overcome this , " adds Umesh . <h> Back to the beginning <p> Starting out in 2008 as an IIT Madras-incubated company , Uniphore 's very first client was Thomson Reuters .

The likes of Brazil and Russia are facing the brunt of the sharp fall in commodity prices . Some like Malaysia have been on the brink of a currency crisis .

Most seem to argue the premise that things are so bad that they can only get better from here . Bank of America Merrill Lynch expects 2016 to mark the start of the recovery for emerging markets with annual growth seen rising for the first time since 2010 .

" A USD ( US dollar ) peak will come but not at the first Fed hike and maybe not until mid/late 2016 .

While Kern had spent time in Taiwan prior to his India posting in 2012 , Folger headed Mercedes ' operations in Malaysia . <p> " At one level , Malaysia is a developed market and enjoys a high penetration rate of 300 per thousand which is nearly 20 times India and more than Singapore or Thailand , " Folger said in a joint interview with Kern . <p> Yet , it is this untapped potential which matters to Mercedes .

" We were performing OK three years ago but being OK is not what Mercedes-Benz is looking at .

Most vehicle investments are based on business case strategies and , on some occasions , the market is not large enough to bring in small cars like the Mercedes A-class for instance . <p> The solution lies in a viable business structure which is not always easy with prevailing taxation levels and this is where the Malaysian government would step in to offer support .

The diversity of India was also something that amazed him which was also a reminder of the tremendous market opportunities for Mercedes . And even while he was heading out to a developed market , Kern said the experience gained here would hold him in good stead . <p> " India is a developing market which is growing unlike Europe that already has strong penetration levels in cars . Here , aspiration levels are high and , for me , the experience of putting things together has been useful , " he added . <p> On the issue of tackling the skills challenge in India , Kern said it eventually boiled down to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with its dealers and employees .

@@4886239 <p> Specialist third umpires , better representation for technology operators and a DRS funded and run by the game 's governing body were just a few issues to be raised by Nathan Lyon 's errant reprieve in Adelaide . <p> Day two of the Adelaide Test and Australia are in trouble . The No. 10 , Nathan Lyon , is batting ahead of the injured Mitchell Starc and trying to sweep everything twirled down at him by Mitchell Santner . <p> Lyon 's first attempt results in a bottom edge that scuttles away on the leg side . Unperturbed , he tries again next ball , this time to a Santner offering that is higher , shorter and further outside off stump . Lyon is not to the pitch , and his bat swishes ineffectually at a delivery that then thuds into his shoulder and loops to Kane Williamson at slip . <p> New Zealand appeal in unison , and Lyon looks decidedly guilty . Unconvinced about an edge he did not hear , the umpire , S Ravi , says not out , and is soon signalling for technological support as Brendon McCullum asks nearly instantly for a review . Lyon , wandering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt some sort of contact on the way through , and then the dull sting of the ball striking his body . <p> It is only when he looks down at his bat that he sees it : a pink cherry stain , clear as day , at the join between the edge and the back of his bat . " I 'm gone , " he thinks . <p> **** <p> Up in the third umpire 's room , Nigel Llong has had a straightforward match so far . It is his first stint in the chair for seven months , and his 19th overall . As the Nine telecast picks up his voice , he is calmly going through a process well established . He is engrossed by the pictures being beamed to him and the world , and in dialogue with the producers . <p> Front-on slow motion " Okay , I 'm going to need to come back and if you can get me as close as you can , that would be great , thank you . " <p> Slip view slow motion " Right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " <p> Front-on slow motion " Okay , have you got a Hot Spot on that , we can have a look and see if there 's a little top edge or a glove ? Thank you . Front-on Hot Spot , I think , is going to be the one . " <p> Side-on Hot Spot , off side " Take me back for that slightly , there 's a little mark as it goes round ... " <p> **** <p> At the moment of the first Hot Spot replay , a mark is visible on Lyon 's bat , standing out as clearly as the pink cherry the Australian offspinner can see . Plenty in the crowd can see it , and an audible cheer goes up around Adelaide Oval . <p> Downstairs , in the bowels of the Riverbank Stand , the technology operators of Hot Spot , Snicko and the Eagle Eye ball-tracker give each other a look of recognition : this is out . <p> Out in the middle , Lyon decides the world has now seen what he has known since he looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ field . Llong , staring hard at his television screen , is not made aware of Lyon 's movement . <p> **** <p> The crowd are still reacting , both to the Hot Spot and Lyon 's pre-emptive departure , as Llong asks for another shot . <p> Umpires are seldom seen downstairs among the television trucks , monitors , control rooms and technology operators . They are seldom seen when those operators are setting up the day before a match <p> " Can we go have a look at leg side Hot Spot , I think ? As he turns the bat over we might be able to get a better angle . " <p> Side-on Hot Spot , leg side " Just take that back slightly , I 'm just out of frame on the bat , let 's go to RTS and see what that brings up for me , if we can have a split screen on RTS , that would be great . " <p> On its introduction in 2013 , Real Time Snicko was described as an insurance policy for Hot Spot , picking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always discern . It is generally excellent for snicks procured by pace bowlers , and also by spinners when a batsman is playing back . <p> But a slow , turning ball met down the pitch and softly brushing the bat may not always be picked up by the highly directional stump microphones - especially if the batsman 's body is blocking the path of the sound , as Lyon was . There is no spike when the ball passes his bat , but likewise there is none when it thuds into his shoulder . <p> Front-on Hot Spot " There 's a mark there . Can I have a split screen on RTS , just to see , please ? Just to see when the ball passes the bat and if the RTS spikes . " <p> **** <p> All three Hot Spot angles have now shown a mark on the bat when the ball passes it , but still more replays are sought . There is evidence of disquiet as Llong asks for the split-screen RTS , which does not appear . A request for a slowed-down run-through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to after another replay is shown . The men operating the technology were by this stage two and a half minutes into the referral , wondering why they were still producing replays for a dismissal they thought was clear . <p> " We 'd already seen the mark on the back of the bat , " says one member of the technology team . " So downstairs in that room , everyone was convinced that it had run across the back of the bat . They were just waiting for him to see it and recognise it . When he said ' I have n't seen enough ' , everyone was caught by surprise . " <p> Lyon , still hovering at the boundary 's edge , is starting to think about wandering back to the middle . <p> **** <p> There is a concern , well established among the contractors hired by broadcasters such as Channel Nine , that they do not have the best possible relationship with the umpires . Most of them are cricket lovers , but they come to the game through the lens of highly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understanding of the devices they use to enhance the broadcast , and by extension , help the match officials make decisions . <p> Simon Taufel , the former umpire and now ICC umpire training manager , has always said that the relationship between the decision-makers and those who provide their pictures is absolutely critical . " Now that we have got DRS , it has opened up a new challenge to the role of the third umpire and how the on-field umpire deals with it , " he said in 2012 . " It is almost becoming a different skill in itself . <p> " Some would also argue that being a third umpire in a DRS environment is almost the most important umpiring role . So to be able to interpret , communicate and work with TV directors to get those decisions right is super-challenging . Part of what I am looking at doing is developing accreditation material to help umpires prepare and develop their skills to be able to work within an environment that involves the cooperation of broadcasters , that involves the cooperation of the providers of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among the television trucks , monitors , control rooms and technology operators . They are also seldom seen when those operators are doing the critical task of setting up their cameras and microphones on the day before a match , attempting to calibrate their devices in order to get accurate decisions . Few , if any , technology operators feel they are permitted to put their gadgetry in its optimal positions for results . <p> As such , those responsible for Hot Spot , Snicko and Eagle Eye or Hawk-Eye are often left debating the positions of their cameras with the ground staff , who have no official requirement to cooperate with them . A third umpire who works more closely in this set-up process would spend time with the technology operators and establish better relationships , leading to greater understanding . <p> He would also be able to speak more authoritatively to the ground staff , who must work with umpires on playing conditions and accede to requests about boundary ropes , sightscreens and crease lines , among other things . There has been talk , as well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all umpires and operators alike must take , so every person involved with a DRS judgement has undergone the same training . <p> **** <p> Llong , his voice rising slightly , is settling on the view that he can not make a decision . <p> Side-on Hot Spot , off side " I 'm going to go back on field . I ca n't definitely say he 's hit this . I 've got no convincing evidence he 's hit this ball . I want to check for ball-tracking and make sure this ball 's not going to go onto the stumps for lbw , because he has n't hit it . Then we can give the decision . " <p> It is now about four minutes into the referral and the crowd has started to boo . Llong 's mention of ball-tracking is the first time he has raised the possibility of an lbw , and he has done so within a sentence of saying " I ca n't say he 's definitely hit this . " <p> Downstairs , expectation of a prompt decision had been replaced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now the call for ball-tracking catches everyone on the hop . It is a delivery that no one expected to be referred to ball-tracking . It commonly takes between 15 and 20 seconds to cue up a delivery for tracking . But these circumstances are like being jolted awake with the terrible realisation of having slept through an alarm . Nobody has even thought to set it up , and now it is being demanded immediately . <p> Fifteen seconds after Llong mentions ball-tracking , the Eagle Eye picture appears . Santner is bowling and Lyon is sweeping , but the ball scuttles off the bottom edge to the leg side . It is the wrong ball . Llong , by now sounding a little flustered , does not appear to notice . " Okay , so it 's definitely not lbw . " <p> Lyon , seeing the wrong ball on the big screen , saunters back to the middle . " What are you doing ? " Nevill asks . " They 're not going to give this out , " Lyon tells his partner . <p> **** @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ third umpires is the matter of who controls and pays for the technology used by the DRS . <p> The call for ball-tracking catches everyone on the hop . It is a delivery that no one expected to be referred to ball-tracking .

In a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big data " adjudication of the race possible . <p> Naturally enough , the greatest obstacle to DRS technology being taken on by the ICC or members boards is cost . <p> **** <p> After taking one final look at Hot Spot , Llong hands the decision back to Ravi , who has waited implacably these past five minutes . Lyon has returned to join Nevill , while New Zealand 's players have long since become bemused . They have not been able to hear the dialogue accessible to television viewers - a major breakthrough in the development of the DRS , which made umpiring decisions more transparent . <p> " Ravi , are you there ? Ravi , I 've got no conclusive evidence about this . I 've looked at everything I 've got , I ca n't find anything to say he 's definitely hit this , no RTS .

There were similar expressions down among the operators of Hot Spot , Snicko and Eagle Eye , who wondered , not for the first time , how the umpires might be brought closer to their wavelength . <p> Sorry David Judge , that 's taking benefit of the doubt to ridiculous extremes . There were only two options - he either hit it or he did n't ; so if all of the other lbw questions were answered yes , and the fielder caught the ball , there 's no problem in giving a batsman out . To give him not out caught because he might have missed it and not out lbw because he might have hit it would just be silly . And Tattus - the Laws of Cricket clearly say that an appeal covers all modes of dismissal ; so NZ did appeal for lbw even if they did n't realise it . <p> Kulaputra on December 7 , 2015 , 8:15 GMT <p> One way or the other , Australia managed to win @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ December 7 , 2015 , 6:19 GMT <p> While I can understand Llong not giving it out caught as he is not fully convinced the mark has been indeed made by ball hitting bat as its not clearly visible - the ball actually making contact with the ball . <p> But I find it funny how Llong then goes on to check the LBW ! For one , NZ appealed for caught and second he is not fully convinced the ball has hit or not hit the bat . So benefit of the doubt has to go to the batsman . <p> But its really funny how , on a review , by an umpire or a player , ALL the possibilities are checked - even if appeal has not been made for the same - and how on other circumstances - when the umpire directly gives them out/ not out on the field , that is - they are not made ! <p> johnbnsa on December 7 , 2015 , 2:35 GMT <p> west indies had the same fate in perth 2009 , going down by 35 runs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 2015 , 23:02 GMT <p> perth 2009 same issue , no hot spot on Roach 's bat , cost windies the match , they almost won . <p> David Judge on December 6 , 2015 , 19:15 GMT <p> realtjamesjones - I disagree . When you listen to him commenting while making the decision , Llong gave not out for caught behind because he was n't 100% certain he had hit despite the hot spot mark . But then he also was n't 100% he had n't hit it either . Therefore , given there was an unexplained ( according to Llong ) hotspot mark on the bat he could never have given it out LBW as he would have given the benefit of the doubt to the batsman . <p> Mick Podbury on December 6 , 2015 , 18:33 GMT <p> Very well done , Daniel .

To give him not out caught because he might have missed it and not out lbw because he might have hit it would just be silly . And Tattus - the Laws of Cricket clearly say that an appeal covers all modes of dismissal ; so NZ did appeal for lbw even if they did n't realise it . <p> Kulaputra on December 7 , 2015 , 8:15 GMT <p> One way or the other , Australia managed to win . It is always the other z/ <p> TATTUs on December 7 , 2015 , 6:19 GMT <p> While I can understand Llong not giving it out caught as he is not fully convinced the mark has been indeed made by ball hitting bat as its not clearly visible - the ball actually making contact with the ball . <p> But I find it funny how Llong then goes on to check the LBW ! For one , NZ appealed for caught and second he is not fully convinced the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ benefit of the doubt has to go to the batsman . <p> But its really funny how , on a review , by an umpire or a player , ALL the possibilities are checked - even if appeal has not been made for the same - and how on other circumstances - when the umpire directly gives them out/ not out on the field , that is - they are not made ! <p> johnbnsa on December 7 , 2015 , 2:35 GMT <p> west indies had the same fate in perth 2009 , going down by 35 runs , no hotspot on roaches bat <p> johnbnsa on December 6 , 2015 , 23:02 GMT <p> perth 2009 same issue , no hot spot on Roach 's bat , cost windies the match , they almost won . <p> David Judge on December 6 , 2015 , 19:15 GMT <p> realtjamesjones - I disagree . When you listen to him commenting while making the decision , Llong gave not out for caught behind because he was n't 100% certain he had hit despite the hot spot mark . But then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either . Therefore , given there was an unexplained ( according to Llong ) hotspot mark on the bat he could never have given it out LBW as he would have given the benefit of the doubt to the batsman . <p> Mick Podbury on December 6 , 2015 , 18:33 GMT <p> Very well done , Daniel . This was a superbly clear analysis of the latest example of Murphy 's Law . What can go wrong , will go wrong . Or as Oriental wisdom tells ... What can go Llong , will go Llong ! <p> Martin Briggs on December 6 , 2015 , 14:57 GMT <p> @ JOEL CHAPLIN - Nigel Llong is n't a perfect human being and neither are you . There has n't been one born yet . To say he should n't be allowed near another game of cricket is utterly imbecilic . On that basis , if you make the smallest mistake at your place of work , then no doubt you would expect the sack and your employer to ensure that you never work in that job or profession again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GMT <p> David Judge : it made perfect sense for Llong to check for LBW . He had decided there was no convincing reason to overturn the onfield umpire 's decision that the ball had not been hit . So if the ball was going on to hit the stumps , then there was a chance of an LBW . For all the hue and cry , the onfield decision was not out , which was not a howler . When there was no shot of the ball hitting the bat Llong made a reasonable decision to stick with the onfield call . Without DRS , after all , the batsman was not out ( unless he chose to walk ) . <p> David Judge on December 6 , 2015 , 11:03 GMT <p> Rahul79 - you have the wrong attitude . You will never learn from your mistakes if you choose to ignore them . Rather than moving on and sweeping this under the carpet , it is much better to try and ensure this does n't happen again . As much as some people would love DRS to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need to learn how to utilise it to its best ability . <p> I do n't understand your scenario . If an umpire makes a decision and technology ca n't prove otherwise then you go with the original decision . What 's the problem ? <p> Technology may not be 100% but it is closer to 100% then umpires . <p> David Judge on December 6 , 2015 , 10:38 GMT <p> RogerC - why bring up the SA v India series ? Because every time I watch a test match in India I see one shocking decision after another . Absolute howlers . Decisions that would be clearly overturned if DRS was used . DRS is n't going to get every decision right . But it will do a lot better then the umpires in India . With the use of DRS you rarely see incorrect decisions anymore and when you do it blows up like the Lyon decision . <p> yorkshire-86 on December 6 , 2015 , 10:19 GMT <p> I 've said this several years ago and I 'll say it again . Cricket umpires are completely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DRS should not be an onfield ump , who is qualified and experienced in judging real time on the field . The DRS umpire should be someone with a tech background , at least 4 years at university and 10 years work experience in the tech industry , and a basic umpiring qualification . <p> Raj Pandey on December 6 , 2015 , 8:06 GMT <p> It was a howler made by a man even with assisted technology ! Period ! <p> DaisonGarvasis on December 6 , 2015 , 7:57 GMT <p> TINKERTINKER - you said it ! ! ! If anybody makes a mistake with DRS and draws criticism , go on and criticize India for something and that would fix the issue . Well done mate . <p> Rahul78 on December 6 , 2015 , 6:33 GMT <p> We need to move on . Both the Hot Spot and Sniko are unreliable under some circumstances as acknowledged by their respective makers . One day we are going to have a scenario where on field umpire makes erroneous decision and both Hot spot and Sniko fail to prove it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to upheld the original decision . Both the technologies are not 100% foolproof . For those making a comment that DRS did nt failed but the 3rd umpire failed to interpret it well the Sniko did failed to notice the edge on the Lyons bat . And just to put it in cold facts the on field umpire Ravi made an error too in giving that not out , Wrong reply was shown for LBW referral and Lyon could have walked . Hence there are many hypothetical ifs and buts involved in this case . Like McCullam has done we all need to move on . <p> Joel Chaplin on December 6 , 2015 , 4:36 GMT <p> if he has nt been sacked already , he needs to be . A grossly incompetent decision by a man who has had plenty of experience as 3rd umpire . A decision i do nt think anyone else in the world can comprehend , let alone agree with that absolutely changed the Test and therefore series result . Utterly unacceptable to let this man near a cricket game in any kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for not overturning the umpires decision <p> RogerC on December 6 , 2015 , 4:02 GMT <p> People supporting DRS are saying the technology got it right , but 3rd umpire did n't understand it . What they need to see is that the 3rd umpire is a part of DRS and his failure to make the right decision is the failure of DRS . A match without DRS does n't even have a 3rd umpire . Also , why bring the India-SA match into this situation ? Are you saying having no DRS creates howlers , so let 's have DRS and still have howlers ? Remember a team only has 2 shots at DRS in 80 overs which is usually enough for one innings and one howler means DRS failed 50% . Where is the 99% success that it is supposed to achieve ? <p> David Judge on December 6 , 2015 , 3:11 GMT <p> The other bizarre decision by Llong that has n't been commented on is when he wanted to check if the batsman was out LBW . Given he could n't prove whether Lyon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give it out leg before , irrespective of whether it was going to hit middle stump half way up . Llong had a complete brain cramp through that whole process . <p> tinkertinker on December 6 , 2015 , 3:04 GMT <p> You guys really are n't making a good case for no drs , <p> Yes with drs we still get the occasional howler but watching the indian series easily fixable mistakes are made every single game and all you can do is close your eyes put your fingers in your ears and pretend it is n't happening . <p> drs sure ai n't perfect but it 's a lot better than what they have over in india , focusing only on the lyon incident wo n't change that fact . <p> David Judge on December 6 , 2015 , 2:56 GMT <p> Criticism of DRS is ridiculous in this case . DRS showed it to be out . It was both the umpires that got this decision wrong . How can technology be blamed when umpires choose to ignore it . People 's solution for all this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right ) and replace it purely with umpires ( who got it wrong ) . Talk about rewarding the incompetent . <p> As for the comment that there was no angle that showed the ball hitting the bat , that is completely incorrect . The front on shot clearly showed the hot spot appearing as the ball reached the bat . The evidence was comprehensive . If the umpire had followed the correct protocols he would have given it out without asking fro Snicko . <p> Meanwhile while watching the India v South Africa match , I see an Indian batsman get caught off the arm guard . It missed his glove by a foot . But given the decision was made by an umpire that is just considered part of the game and everyone is fine by that . I know which system is working better . <p> ACrickLover on December 6 , 2015 , 2:37 GMT <p> @MARTIN BRIGGS , please see your opinions are not final . Like what you feel my points are ludicrous i also see your points ludicrous. you have made many assumptions in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ busy now if possible i will come back and write in more detail and explain why you have analysed the whole issue in a wrong manner . <p> RogerC on December 5 , 2015 , 23:58 GMT <p> What is DRS ? A system that gets rid of howlers created by on-field umpires . In Lyon 's case , the on-field umpire created a howler and DRS did n't correct it . There is no point saying the hotspot was right , the snicko was wrong , the third umpire was under stress and all that . DRS failed , its that simple . <p> Martin Briggs on December 5 , 2015 , 20:00 GMT <p> @ACRICKLOVER - your analogy with x-rays is commendable but your opening two points are totally erroneous . 1 ) Elite umpires assessed by the ICC generally have a correct decision-making percentage somewhere between 92 and 94% and when the DRS is absorbed into that it rises to around 95-96% . Having spoken recently to a ECB first-class umpire , he confirmed that every ball in county cricket is filmed for the umpires and every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to them . He further confirmed that umpires such as Llong , Illingworth , Kettleborough and Gould stand out as being between 90 and 95% correct in their decision-making over a whole English season . They are the cream of their trade . 2 ) To suggest umpires have their favourites is utterly preposterous , They do n't . You are correct to say that " DRS is here to stay " but under no circumstances could you ask people to look at your two points to justify that assertion , as they are ludicrous . <p> ssid on December 5 , 2015 , 19:50 GMT <p> A howler even with DRS ? India was right all along in opposing DRS <p> StJohn on December 5 , 2015 , 19:20 GMT <p> Umpires understanding the technicians and the technology better would be a good thing , but this sounds like a very odd , aberrant and incorrect decision from the third umpire . Llong has had a shocker here . Hot Spot alone should have been quite sufficient to reverse the on-field decision , looking at all the other stuff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few other aspects to this episode that merit attention though , and which seem to have gone unreported ( or under-reported ) . First , was it actually lbw ? Mention has constantly been made of the wrong ball being shown for the ball-tracking , but what would the correct ball have shown ? Secondly , and moreover , if Lyon knew he 'd hit it ( and this article suggests he did know that ) , then he should 've walked . <p> SLBiggestJoke on December 5 , 2015 , 18:38 GMT <p> @TINKERTINKER - Obviously you have never played Cricket ... The Umpire is never wrong my friend ! but , DRS , on the other hand .. is clearly suspect . <p> Rahul Gupta on December 5 , 2015 , 18:28 GMT <p> @TINKERTINKER bcz in india we have accepted that umpires can make mistake but in case of all the other countries that are using DRS the idea is to reduce these man made errors . In this particular case again there is a man made mistake which brings the DRS usage under question . No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Also in india they are making mistakes at that particular moment unlike in this case where umpire had all the time in the world yet he ruled it not out . Understood ? <p> samincolumbia on December 5 , 2015 , 16:23 GMT <p> Oh , the irony ! DRS that was supposed to get rid of howlers actually creates a howler that completely changes the course of a match ! People arguing that the human element got it wrong does not make a good case , since the human element is one half of DRS , the other half being technology . @TinkerTinker - You had to drag India into this ? Australia did not deserve that victory . <p> tinkertinker on December 5 , 2015 , 12:50 GMT <p> Why are we getting story after story on this while over in india they are making mistakes on a daily basis and barely a word is said ? <p> Why are those mistakes somehow less important than a number 11 getting given not out ? <p> Behindthebowlersarm on December 5 , 2015 , 11:59 GMT <p> How much training @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what they are seeing ? Perhaps the idea of third umpire specialists is a good one or one of the technicians could sit with the third umpire to help interpret what he is looking at . I still think DRS is a good thing which is shown by this issue being highlighted ... of course if there is no DRS then Lyon is not out . The positive thing is that we have had a chance to see all the anti Australian people out in force telling us how an Englishman would favour Australia and given NZ fans another chip to put on their shoulder to balance the underarm one . <p> SLBiggestJoke on December 5 , 2015 , 10:20 GMT <p> I do n't understand why this is Llong 's fault at all ! There was NO frame in the numerous replays that showed the ball touching the bat . All we see are frames before and after the bat swish . We have seen numerous times that the bat can show some alleged " hot spots " on the " after swish " . On the basis of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from umpire Llong . The fault is entirely of DRS in not capturing the frames correctly . I feel positioning of the camera(s) is the real issue . <p> ilovetests on December 5 , 2015 , 10:18 GMT <p> You might want to change the sub-heading on the Cricinfo main page which reads " The controversial dismissal proves why umpires must work closely with technology providers . " Perhaps controversial NON-dismissal would be appropriate . <p> SLBiggestJoke on December 5 , 2015 , 9:58 GMT <p> " DRS gets the decisions about 90% times correct " - as measured by who/what ? DRS itself ? ! <p> Uncapped on December 5 , 2015 , 8:47 GMT <p> We all agree a mistake was made here . And unfortunately it may have been quite influential . But I think it 's time to move on . Look to improve where possible but move on now ... <p> michua on December 5 , 2015 , 8:16 GMT <p> Its an Indian umpire who is involved in this hence all the controversies.No decision is perfect in the world.its very easy to comment sitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respect for their tough job.One mistake does not bring the world to an END . <p> ACrickLover on December 5 , 2015 , 7:22 GMT <p> 1 ) DRS technology commits less mistakes than human umpires . DRS gets the decisions about 90% times correct , whereas even the smartest and sharpest human umpire gets it right only upto 90% or lesser than this . <p> 2 ) DRS technology is 100% honest/100% unbiased whereas human umpires do have their own favorite team or player etc <p> So when you see these 2 points above it is obvious that DRS technology is to stay here , in fact we should use it more and more in the future so that we get better umpiring decisions compared to human umpiring . <p> The problem is not with the DRS , it is with the human umpires who interpret it so strict rules should be brought to reduce this happening . <p> It is like an x ray which easily diagnoses a bone fracture but the radiologist who reads the x ray misses the fracture , so blame the radiologist agree ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on December 5 , 2015 , 6:53 GMT <p> Name change to Nathan Llyon ? <p> RogerC on December 5 , 2015 , 5:19 GMT <p> One should also think how much all these technologies cost per day . ICC can pay the umpires what they pay DRS and more talented people will take up umpiring . <p> sumoslammer on December 5 , 2015 , 4:41 GMT <p> Excellent article.A good thorough analysis . <p> Ramfromlanka on December 5 , 2015 , 4:20 GMT <p> How about stanford/mit grad as an empire as he knows technlogy Daniel ? <p> doucmeasicu on December 5 , 2015 , 3:39 GMT <p> We should get rid of DRS and just leave it up to the field umpires . Umpires mistakes add spice to the game - especially when everyone sees the blunder on the big screen . It builds the animosity btw the teams and gives lovers of the game something to get passionate about . People need to accept that umpires mistakes are part of the game we love and always have been . If we replaced umpires with computers that are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about ... and nobody wants that . DRS just wastes time . <p> debatable on December 5 , 2015 , 3:12 GMT <p> Three comments . When Hotspot was failing to pick things up , people were pretty unanimous that Snicko was the be-all and end-all about this . When Broad edged one and did n't walk , Australia was pretty unanimous in condemning him for it . Lyon 's walk back to the middle is even worse . While I agree it looked out , Llong did the right thing by the rules . Hotspot was being ridiculed as useless not so long ago . <p> Marty on December 5 , 2015 , 2:53 GMT <p> Lyon knew he knicked it , Lyon knew the Black Caps knew he knicked it , he should have walked . <p> Paul McKechnie on December 5 , 2015 , 0:16 GMT <p> It 's nothing to do with cooperation or getting devices in even better positions than they are already in . The evidence was clear . What you ca n't fight against in the end , however , is stupidity . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Surely a professional full-time on-field cricket umpire is one of the least qualified people to be a third umpire ? Just how much cricket on TV would they watch ? Unlike the rest of us they are always at games on the field . Almost anyone reading this has seen more cricket on television than a full-time umpire . They need to train specialists whose interpretation of the game comes from watching it on TV - that 's what the job requires . Train people from scratch - pass an observation test , pass the umpire 's exam , train on the equipment . Also for the amount of money they are spending surely they could develop a controller the third umpire could use . Surely they can build a system that captures live off the cameras and is dedicated to giving the umpire control to review it ? Also , what 's wrong with a play-on advantage rule ? Let the third umpire review everything . If he spots something a few minutes later then pull the play up , rule advantage ( or no advantage ) and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 4 , 2015 , 23:37 GMT <p> Okay , okay , enough already . An umpire made a mistake . They do , every now and then , which is why we have the DRS in the first place . They make fewer now , but nothing 's perfect . The fact remains that Lyon is a number eleven batsman ( in at ten only because of injury ) and New Zealand lost because they let him go on to add 72 runs .

@@4886240 <p> Jason Holder 's West Indians are staring humiliating defeat in the face after three days of their opening tour match against a Cricket Australia XI in Brisbane . <p> The visitors are 7 for 125 , still needing another 76 runs to make the modest CA XI bat again , six of whose members are making their first-class debuts , while only Jordan Silk ( his 22nd match ) and Cameron Boyce ( 45th ) have played more than 10 fixtures apiece . <p> After resuming at 4 for 245 , the CA XI progressed to 444 thanks to solid contributions by Jimmy Peirson ( 64 ) , Matthew Short ( 76 ) , and James Bazley ( 50 ) , before the tail wagged via the blades of Tom Andrews ( 33 ) and Boyce ( 32 ) . <p> In addition to claiming four wickets , Holder was the only West Indian to concede fewer than four runs an over on the smallish Allan Border Field .

It will be one of the most boring Boxing-day and New year tests for many years . No wonder CA has asked India to visit again in January to make up for the loss in revenues . This is the most unsuitable time to host WI . Obviously NZ could n't visit late as they have their own home summer but CA should have asked another team which could bring in crowd and revenue .

It 's not only going to be a disastrous tour for the once mighty West Indian cricket team but also a disappointing summer of cricket for the cricket hungry aussie cricket fans . Surely the Australian Cricket Board should have realized this . Even though the new look Australian cricket team itself is still young and inexperienced they will be too good for the Windies . Having watched them in action on their recent cricket tour to Sri Lanka they looked a bunch of school boy cricketers in action and it is virtually the same team that has been picked for the Australian series . Atleast they have Phil Simmons back as coach after being suspended for the Sri Lanka tour . They have not won a test series in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Australia could see the beginning of the end for West Indies cricket . <p> Assertive-Indian on December 4 , 2015 , 21:06 GMT <p> So difficult to believe today that WI dominated world cricket starting from mid-70s to mid-90s . During that era , particularly when Clive Lloyd was the captain , if any team won a single test match against the mighty Windians , it was considered a great achievement . Today , just about any team can win a test match against WI , even a club level team with unknown faces . Is WI so short of cricketing talent , or something else is the problem ? <p> Blythesville on December 4 , 2015 , 20:57 GMT <p> Is it too late to cancel this tour and avoid a massive embarrassment ? <p> johnthekiwi on December 4 , 2015 , 20:28 GMT <p> I wonder if the time might be right for the WI to break apart to the constituent nations at least as it relates to the red ball WI identity . Clearly there is no interest from their best players in playing test cricket anymore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the glorious past . Maybe we need to have International XI 's playing home nations in matches that have test status ? That way those gifted red ball players from a multitude of countries ( including Jamaica , Namibia , Nepal , Scotland , Ireland , Barbados etc. ) could earn a good-great living playing in whites while giving test teams a decent challenge . They may always be playing on the road but if they were allowed to wear the caps of their home nations on the field I reckon the games would be watched . It would be kind of like the Barbarians in rugby . There are 3-4 guys in this current WI squad that look like they do care and if you threw in 9-10 other guys with some heart from affiliate nations they would have merit . <p> Tyryll on December 4 , 2015 , 19:56 GMT <p> you guys are a harsh on WI they may not be a good team but I rather the youngsters playing .

Include some in form players like Vishal Singh . <p> MightrySparrow on December 4 , 2015 , 19:22 GMT <p> West Indies cricket is a far cry from its heyday , yes , a time when they masterfully ruled the cricket world . Their performance in this tour match speaks for itself . Many of the players in the current squad , arguably , will have a hard time making it in many premier club leagues around the world . <p> The West Indies face a host of internecine challenges which must be first resolved if there is to be any chance of them rising to the top again . One of those challenges is to pick the best available team . I doubt the the above is the best they have in the Caribbean . <p> In the mean time , the world awaits the return of the exciting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all over the globe . <p> BILL4 on December 4 , 2015 , 18:29 GMT <p> It just does n't matter who is on WI team , the result will be the same . we have been seeing it for the last 15 years . yes , the team might surprise us and win a match once in a while , but WI can not win a Test series with the bunch of inconsistent jokers in the region . Players , management , coach , selectors , and officials , same old khaki pants . Just imagine the region does n't have an umpire on the international umpire Panel . WI need to quit playing Test cricket and stop embarrassing the region . However , that will never happen , so continue to expect the worst , but hope for the best . <p> RallyWindies on December 4 , 2015 , 17:20 GMT <p> Chandrika is in your test team ? <p> really ? He may be a prospect for the future .. but currently , he 'd have trouble making a Hong Kong team .... <p> we do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ replace a specialist off spinner .. <p> We should try Warican in Tests ... And play Pollard and Dwyne Bravo with Holder , Taylor and Roach ... <p> Dowrtich 's keeping is not up to mark for Tests ...

Surprised ? Not me . Not easy to get rid of that old culture from the last 10-15 years . They will play much better in the tests . As I have said before as long as Mr DJ Bravo , Mr Pollard , and Mr Rampaul play for WI together in any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that old culture will be difficult be get rid of . Move on WI ! ! Keep those three players far away from WI cricket . <p> WIRUS .... i do n't know what to add ... you have said everything spot on who do we have ? ? Shiv has been retired by the ( I do believe he should hv call in quits in last Caribbean tour ) board and the rest are not interest in playing test . The WICB president is not shy of getting into an ugly fight with the Caribbean governments over the control of cricket in the region . I say he should bite the bullet , and allow the recommendation of the report to fall through ...... how worst can we get ? ? ? ? <p> DivyT on December 4 , 2015 , 16:06 GMT <p> Must Second Sumit here , absolutely . When I saw Holder , I thought here it is , back to the 80s finally . Here is one man , who will win West Indies Tests . Instead , all the pressure was put on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for West Indies . All I have seen on field from him is that he is an able batsman and decent medium pacer . As a captain , he has a lot to learn . Seems like a bit taller Chris Jordan , now Imagine Chris Jordan captaining English Test side . I think there is a lot of talent in there , however he should be allowed to develop and not burdened with all the responsibilities in the world . ( Next they will make him coach as well ! ) Also , where in the world are Kirk Edwards , Leon Johnson , Kieran Powell , why does Shai Hope have to open ? Why ? <p> DivyT on December 4 , 2015 , 15:56 GMT <p> Possibly the weakest side on paper to tour Australia since B'desh in 2003 , the results will be the worst since the Indian side of 2011 ( which was at its nadir , led by an undecided management , weakened by injuries and out of form seniors ) . The difference from the latter is that even with all of that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a green squad , hit by injury to Bowling mainstay Starc . This is possibly the best chance for teams to compete if not win , yet we see a touring side which is staring innings defeat against the CA XI , which has many first class debutants . WI should do themselves a favour , take a flight to PNG , play some Limited over and first class games there . <p> Being an Indian , the Aussie summer is a special experience . To wake up early in the morning and witness some good old test match cricket . It has witnessed epic battles in 03,08 , 10 , 12 .

It is still beyond my comprehension why Shiv Chanderpaul is not on this tour.With the team we have , I am sure he is not going to make them win or draw the series , but at least he will bring some stability to the batting which will add confidence to the young players.Fly him to Australia , it 's not late . <p> pycon45 on December 4 , 2015 , 15:13 GMT <p> From the first day , this innings defeat was on the scorecard .

( HT ? Photo ) <p> Punjab 's facilities to handle , store and use blood are in a deep mess , in utter disrespect to ordinary people , who voluntarily donate nearly 97% of the state 's total collection in blood banks to save lives . <p> Most of the blood banks run by the government are failing their purpose outright , and the health department has no idea of how the private ones are functioning . <p> The state has a robust set of acts , rules and guidelines regarding blood banks , but it is the implementation , compliance and enforcement that is absent . <p> It is only now , after a recent petition was filed in the Punjab and Haryana high court , that the government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overnight , or at least by the next date of hearing . <p> Invalid licences <p> There are 101 blood banks in Punjab and , of these , at least 25 are running without a valid licence . A few blood banks are without a licence owing to the lengthy procedure involved in obtaining one , but there are also those whose licences have n't been renewed for the past 15 years and they are brazening it out without fulfilling the basic requirements . <p> Among the 101 blood banks , 45 are run by the government and 14 of these are without a licence simply because they do not have the requisite equipment or the equipment that is there is out of order . <p> The authorities are confused about why the blood banks that do not have a valid licence have been allowed to function . Not only that , there is also lack of agreement on whether the illegal blood banks should be allowed to run or not . <p> Dr Sukhvinder Singh , head of the State Blood Transfusion Council , Punjab , says the rules @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even without a valid license because they are dealing with human lives . <p> " The process of licensing is very long as the licence has to be renewed by the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation ( CDSCO ) , Government of India , " he says . " In the meanwhile the blood bank can not be shut down . " <p> the rules " clearly say " that a blood bank whose licence has not been renewed because of discrepancies should not be allowed to run , " precisely because it deals with human life " . <p> " CDSCO is not the licensing authority . The state drug controller renews licences . We only hold joint inspections with them , and later , when the licence is issued , we approve it .

" The delay caused by the process can be of one or , at the most , two years . There is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 10-15 years . These blood banks are obviously not complying with the conditions , " says drug controller , Punjab , Bhag Singh . <p> A glaring example of the mess is the government blood bank at Civil Hospital Nakodar . The facility has a licence that expired in 2000 . The case for the renewal of the licence till 2012 was sent to the authorities in September 2013 . The blood bank has yet to mitigate the discrepancies pointed out during an inspection in January 2013 .

Following a complaint to the blood bank 's vigilance cell , run under the state drug controller 's office , a team of drug controllers checked the Dayanand Medical College ( DMC ) , Ludhiana , in April this year and reported a host of glaring shortcomings . Many of the emergency medicines in the blood collection room were expired . Some other drugs , required to be available in the blood collection room , were not there . Dust had accumulated at several places in the blood bank and no colour coding was being done on blood bags . <p> The license of the DMC blood bank was suspended for 15 days , but Pradeep Mattoo , assistant drugs controller Punjab , says the hospital met with the various conditions and the license was revived . <p> Mattoo added that besides DMC , show cause notices were also issued to private blood banks in Phagwara , Nawashahr and Hoshiarpur aswell . <p> Overcharging by private banks <p> The prescribe that no charges can be levied on supplying blood to patients , although blood banks are allowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down by the State Blood Transfusion Council ( SBTC ) for government and private blood banks .

( see box ) <p> Till recently , the drug inspectors carried out no independent checks to find out exactly how much the private blood banks charged . <p> " Private hospitals are using blood to loot money . Other than the processing fee , some blood banks are also charging security from recipients in case they are not able to supply a replacement unit of blood . Other blood banks are taking two positive blood units for giving one negative blood unit , " alleges Vitin Puri , president of the Hindustan Welfare Blood Donors Club , which filed the petition in the high court . <p> Mandatory checks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rate of blood , the drug inspectors have also not conducted the annual checks prescribed under the rules .. <p> " An audit of records of June 2013 of the state drug controller showed that the shortfall in conducting inspections ranged between 53 and 61% in government blood banks and between 56 and 83% in private/charitable blood banks during 2010-13 , " says a 2013 CAG report on the working of blood banks in Punjab . <p> Many government blood banks have been checked only during a joint inspection for the renewal of licence , which is done once in five years . <p> High court makes impact <p> The government action against the blood banks came only after the issue was brought to the high court 's notice . <p> " The case was filed in July this year and action against some blood banks was initiated only after that , " says Hitesh Kaplish , the counsel for the petitioner . <p> Things are working indeed .

@@4919238 Habit of Reading <p> As Muslims , we can not underestimate the importance of reading , especially when the first word revealed to our Prophet Muhammad ( peace be upon him ) was " Read ! " Yet , whenever the topic of reading comes up , although we recognize its importance we always excuse ourselves with reminders of how busy we are , or assume that reading is a waste of time compared to the other chores we need to perform during the day . <p> I was recently reminded about the importance of reading in a self-development book which encourages its readers to read extensively into many topics in order to widen their horizons . You can evidently see the difference between someone who reads and someone who does n't read , at least in the vocabulary they use , never mind the ideas and creative thinking that book lovers tend to have . <p> As Productive Muslims , we should exercise two types of reading : <p> Islamic reading ( Quran , Hadeeth , Islamic books ) <p> General reading <p> If I were to ask any Muslim today , which category is more important , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general reading . I would agree and it would be hard for anyone to argue otherwise . But I would also argue that general reading is important depending on the intention you make . If I were to read a book on marketing skills , and my intention is to improve my business , make more profits , and be able to give more Zakah and support my family better , wo n't that be considered beneficial ? Plus , would n't I be rewarded for such reading ? If I were to read the latest industry journal so that I am acutely aware of what 's happening in the industry and attempt to stay " on top of it all " , and my intention is to better the Ummah by being a leader in this industry instead of a follower , is n't that something great ? <p> One may argue , that after reading the Quran , the Prophetic ahadeeth , and other Islamic books there is no need to read any further . And I would agree with that ; this is the Sacred Knowledge that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truly and sincerely attempt to understand the Quran , we will find wisdom within it which suffices all the books in the world ! Although it 's important to note that there is a case for reading extensively into numerous topics that interest you , ranging from reading widely into materials relating to your University degree or reading your industry 's journal , to biographies of men and women who achieved great missions regardless of their circumstances and self-help books that cultivate self-development or any other habits/traits in us that need to be developed . <p> We should read , read , read and constantly read in order to apply good knowledge to our lives . My advice is to be selective in reading . Whilst Islamic reading should be a priority over any type of reading , do n't forget to read extensively and be open minded about other topics . You will surely notice yourself develop ! <p> Now , the question begs itself : how should we read ? Or more specifically , how should we develop a reading habit so that we constantly read , both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tips to help you along the way : <p> If you have n't yet developed a daily habit of reading Quran and Islamic knowledge , begin by developing this habit first . I advise you to set yourself 10 minutes after Fajr in your first week into this exercise and read 5 minutes of Quran plus 5 minutes of Islamic knowledge or Hadeeth . Do this daily ! The key is to do it after Fajr Salah , as it will truly set your day straight.After one week , add 10 minutes to your time . So now you 're reading 10 minutes of Quran and 10 minutes of Islamic knowledge plus hadeeth.In the third week , do this for half an hour and read 20 minutes of Quran and 10 minutes of Islamic knowledge plus hadeeth ... and now just stick to that ! 30 minutes , no more ! You might say , I can do more . I 'd say go ahead , but for our purposes , it 's important you develop a ' habit ' that 's consistent rather than attempting more than you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will develop through deriving more beneficial lessons from the books you read . <p> Similarly , we should develop a reading habit for general knowledge . Again , begin with 10 minutes per day on any beneficial book you want to read . It is highly advised that you read before you sleep as it relaxes and stimulates your mind at the same time . Do this for a week and stick to it ! No matter how tired you are , just read for 10 minutes . In the following week , extend your ' bed-time ' reading to 20 minutes , then follow that by 30 minutes , and that 's it . Stick to that programme and be consistent . <p> After working on the above exercise for a month , you can take a step further . For Islamic knowledge , try to develop a habit of constantly reading something of Islamic knowledge after every prayer . Or between 2 Salah times , for example between Maghreb and Isha . This is where you can dig deeper into the reading and perhaps memorize or use your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general reading , after a month of the above exercise include some reading time at work during lunch break . What you read can be related to your work ( such as : FT , industry magazines , competitor work etc ... ) and leave your ' bed-time ' reading to self-development books , biographies , and books which inspire and motivate . <p> I hope that sets us all up to continually pursue reading in our lives so that it becomes an integral part of our development .

Ten years ago , a study by consulting company McKinsey &amp; Co. and software services industry lobby group Nasscom had already flagged this trend . The study , Extending India 's Leadership Of The Global IT And BPO Industries , said only 25% of the country 's engineering graduates were employable straight out of college . <p> Amrita Koul .

These include engineers as well as graduates looking for jobs in the information technology ( IT ) , hospitality , finance and insurance sectors . <p> The 3-hour test , which costs Rs.900 per student , is administered in specially set-up centres all over the country . It has various segments , including domain knowledge in disciplines like programming , and elements of cognitive reasoning , analytical ability , English and communication . After completing the test , students are given their scores , 14-page detailed analyses of their performances and recommendations on how to improve their chances of getting a job by working on weak areas like logical reasoning or communication . <p> Like many others , Koul also took the Amcat test last year .

Her India-centric research indicated that " 83% of educational institutions believe that their graduates are ready for the market , but only 51% of employers agreed with that " , she says . <p> Yash Mimani , an economics student of Mumbai 's St Xavier 's College , says he got interested in the Talerang training when he read a mail from them : " Academic brilliance is not equal to professional success .

Ten-page limit for new IPO forms goes for toss <p> New Delhi , Dec 20 : Even as market regulator SEBI was being questioned over the introduction of new IPO application norms , the abridged form norm has turned out to be a damp squib as the ten-page form has become a 16-page set -- apart from leading to further complications rather than solving any . The Securities and Exchange Board of India ( SEBI ) has issued a notification introducing a ten-page format -- five sheets , printed on both sides -- replacing the 48-page version of the prospectus , to be issued with IPO application forms . The new format came into effect on December 1 . <p> A look at the application forms of recent IPOs by Narayana Hrudayalaya , Alkem Laboratories and Path Labs shows that the companies have actually come out with 16-page forms instead of 10 .

Be that as it may , the 10-page format does not provide for the list of bidding centres which is a vital information for investors .

One school of thought has treated the emergence of the BRICS forum as a reflection of a new , multi-polar world order ; a result of the shift in economic and political power from the ' global north ' to the ' global south ' . The opposing school of thought has dismissed the forum as a clunky cobbling of misfits with varying geopolitical ambitions and countervailing economic strengths : a Goldman Sachs marketing gimmick taken too far . <p> Both perspectives make for easy summarisation .

The successful lobbying for the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) ' s quota reforms and the unsuccessful attempt to find a common candidate for leading the same are cases the author describes in detail . <p> Two , the detailed analysis of how the BRICS countries have engaged with each other under a common framework on 15 global issues such as agriculture , trade and national security .

But now , that role is evolving and they are now expected to be the delivery arm of the business in terms of implementing technologies , by evaluating costs , standardization and regulation . <p> From just implementing new technologies in an enterprise , CIOs are now expected to understand different delivery platforms and the role is to now work around services that their business requires .

Therefore , if my peers are looking or using certain services or products , I am more likely to take a look at it . So , clearly , the marketing team of an organization has to look at digital ways to reach customers . <p> On the financial side , micropayment channels like Paytm , have enabled users greatly . From cab payments to recharge to paying for stuff online , the amount of convenience available is immense .

In a world where everything is going mobile , connectivity is also an issue to look into , for people deploying data centers , because without proper bandwidth there is no network . Additionally , without applications on cloud , surviving in today 's market is going to be difficult , especially because of the rise of mobility . <p> We 've heard of bimodal IT . What is a cross-modal IT team ? <p> Currently , there are two modes of IT teams available .

Organizations do n't understand that the agility , scalability and the stability provided their innovative team can be applied to increase the functionality of the traditional one . However , cross-modal IT is a system where the innovative arm of the team actually optimizes and lifts the traditional arm in a faster and stable way . <p> How do you see enterprises evolving in 2016 ? <p> Enterprise companies are no longer afraid of newer technologies as they used to be in the past .

@@4938232 <h> Brands that stole the spotlight <p> In a few days , we will say goodbye to 2015 , and welcome the New Year . As the poet Tennyson so aptly said , we will ring out the old and ring in the new . Mumbai may have to celebrate without beef steak , and Delhi without its odd numbered cars , but the good news is that all of us can say Yippee ! to the new year with our favourite Maggi noodles , which are now happily back on the shelves . <p> What better time of the year to look back , and reflect on the brands that stole the spotlight during 2015 ? These are products , services or people who made the big news headlines this year , for better or for worse . <p> If you are wondering why famous people are included in this compilation , that 's simply because they are brands in their own right . And sometimes , brands may have made the headlines for all the wrong reasons , but we are talking here about the big headlines they made , and are not sitting in judgement on the reasons . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reflections is on a brand of two-minute noodles that most of us have eaten ( and slurped ) in our college hostels , roadside stalls and in our homes . In what were clearly the biggest Indian brand headlines of the year , Maggi was banned by the Indian food regulator FSSAI , in June 2015 , for allegedly failing food safety tests relating to lead and monosodium glutamate ( MSG ) . Newspapers and television channels went wild with their coverage of this sudden and unexpected development . <p> For the first two weeks , Nestle , which markets Maggi noodles , did not respond very coherently to this regulatory and media assault . Thereafter , the company did much better , and mounted a legal challenge to clear its name . In the meanwhile , the product stood withdrawn from the market , and has only returned to our shelves six months later . The absence of Maggi led to an upsurge of nostalgia amongst consumers , some of which the brand captured in beautiful YouTube videos which my wife and I watched with great delight . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ missed , by its loyal consumers . But most importantly , the Maggi episode has many lessons to teach marketers , on how to deal with a sudden , larger-than-life crisis . The lesson for our marketers : In today 's volatile times , crisis management is as important as brand management . <p> Patanjali 's challenge <p> If I had the privilege of handing out an award for the best emerging Indian brand of the year , I would have to give it to Patanjali . Whether you admire Baba Ramdev or whether you are indifferent to him , the brand he has created is making waves across the country . Patanjali claims to offer organic and natural food products and herbal medicines with wide-ranging health benefits . The brand itself is named after the Vedic scholar Patanjali , who wrote a treatise on medicine and Ayurveda . Products include foods , cosmetics and juices . <p> Here is a sampling , which indicates the wide range of offerings : Patanjali Chyawanprash , for overall wellness . Patanjali Dant Kanti dental cream , with the goodness of babul , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Amla and Aloe Vera juices . Divya Mukta Vati capsules that address high blood pressure in conjunction with yoga . Patanjali cow 's ghee , which is advertised as being good for eyesight . And now , Patanjali noodles and pasta , for those of us who want Italian cuisine blended with the blessings of nature ( or " Prakriti ka Ashirwad " , the byline of this brand ) . Somewhere and somehow , Patanjali has tapped into the Indian psyche . That is why this relatively new brand has reportedly already crossed revenues of ? 2,500 crore per annum , and continues to grow rapidly . <p> Most global foods companies , I suspect , are struggling to find the right response to Patanjali . The lesson for our marketers : Indian heritage and tradition hold a treasure trove that is ours to discover . Consumers are waiting . <p> Volkswagen 's dark hour <p> Moving away from India to the globe , the brand which made big headlines this year , and for all the wrong reasons , was Volkswagen . How could a blue-blooded brand of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and automobile technology , cheat its way to success ? <p> This was unbelievable , but unfortunately it was true . In September 2015 , Volkswagen admitted to cheating on emissions tests in the US by installing illegal " defeat device " software on its diesel cars , after it was accused of doing so by the Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) of that country . <p> By the company 's own admission , 11 million cars worldwide are fitted with this cheat software . Volkswagen reacted quickly once this unfortunate news went public . The company 's America boss , Michael Horn , used these memorable words -- " We 've totally screwed up . " The Group 's CEO resigned , an internal enquiry was launched , and a huge financial provision of over ? 6 billion was created to cover potential damages and recalls ( even this large amount is now thought to be woefully inadequate ) . <p> Winning back the trust of consumers , communities and Governments will now be a herculean task for Volkswagen .

I know such praise for Merkel is getting rather repetitive , because every single reputed global publication that I read ( Time , Financial Times , The Economist ) has either put her on the front page , or called her the leader of the free world , or has named her the Person of the year . Yet Brand Merkel has a very important lesson to teach us . <p> Over years , her core characteristic has been one of caution , of taking a measured approach . However , when the moment required it , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Her fearless and bold response to the refugee crisis in Europe , as she pledged to shelter anyone from war-torn Syria , was this year 's defining symbol of strong moral leadership . She stood virtually alone in this stance , which was unpopular even in large parts of her own country -- thus demonstrating that people and brands can potentially become great when they boldly embrace noble and relevant purpose , which may be well beyond their functional core . The lesson for our marketers : Brands with purpose win the hearts of people . What purpose does your brand have ? <p> Other brands in the spotlight <p> Many other brands were also in the spotlight this year . In a straw poll which I ran with a few of my colleagues and friends , the brand names which came up included many of the usual suspects -- Apple , Fitbit , Amazon , Airtel 4G , Facebook , Tesla and Uber .

He was an adolescent at the time , just a few weeks short of 18 years . As per the prevailing law , the adolescent could not be tried for the crime and convicted . He could only be put in a home for juvenile delinquents for a maximum of three years . <p> Ever since the tragedy of December 2012 , the issue of whether a boy of 16 years or 17 years is still a child or should be treated as an adult -- or should invite adult-like treatment for certain types of crimes -- has been debated .

The sense of betrayal that the Pandey family must have felt as a killer walked away three years after their daughter did n't return home is completely understandable . Women 's safety on the streets of Delhi remains a black joke .

The release of the former juvenile may not have appeared just and may not have brought a sense of closure -- if a sense of closure is ever possible for the Pandey family -- but it followed the letter of the law . <p> Neither could a new law be applied retrospectively . At best , and one believes the police is already doing this , monitoring the juvenile as he moves into his old neighbourhood , tracking his movements and keeping tabs on him is what one can hope for . <p> Perhaps a demand for electronic tracking , using a device attached to or embedded in the body of the former juvenile for a fixed period of time , could be considered and written into the system .

Nearly 200 kilometers of the pipeline will pass through the territory of Turkmenistan , 735 kilometers through Afghanistan , 800 kilometers through Pakistan and will reach Fazilka in India . <p> Launching the project , Ansari said TAPI is a great example of regional cooperation and the pipeline will export up to 33 billion cubic meters of natural gas a year from Turkmenistan to Afghanistan , Pakistan , and India over 30 years . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Afghanistan , the project has taken off recognising the economic expediency to bring about energy security in the region , at a time when global crude oil prices are falling .

Afghan President Ashraf Ghani succinctly summed up this great regional cooperation by calling the event historic as the region was ' renewing ties ' and ' overcoming the history of doubt and scepticism ' . <p> So in the last 10 years , TAPI has been one of the main agenda items at every major conference on Afghanistan and also an integral part of the American ' New Silk Road Strategy ' .

More recently , Total and Dragon Oil were in discussion with the Turkmenistan government . <p> But one of them committed to the project due to security and financial considerations . Also there was reluctance on the part of Turkmenistan government to sign production-sharing rights for onshore blocks with foreign companies because their domestic laws did not permit it . <p> This made the four countries find a solution within and rightly they agreed to a consortium of national oil companies of all four participating countries , with Turkmengaz , the national oil company of Turkmenistan , as the consortium leader .

These warning signs include chest pain , breathing difficulties , palpitations , nausea , abdominal pain , back pain , sudden drop in blood pressure or a loss of consciousness , according to the study in the Annals of Internal Medicine , an international journal . <p> Indeed , researchers found that half the patients they studied had warning symptoms as early as four weeks in advance , with these symptoms often repeating themselves over the 24 hours before sudden cardiac arrest . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who get medical help increase chances for survival . <p> If victims go into sudden cardiac arrest , the risk of death increases by the minute , so cardiopulmonary resuscitation ( CPR ) and defibrillation -- shocking the heart into restarting -- is critical . This means it is important for communities and neighbourhoods to be acquainted with CPR and have defibrillators handy . <p> The study is the latest to report that sudden cardiac arrest is not quite as sudden as it sounds . More than half of middle-aged men surveyed displayed warning signs a month before their hearts unexpectedly stopped , according to a 2013 American Heart Association study . As many as 56% of those reported chest pain , 13% shortness of breath and 4% dizziness , fainting or palpitations . <p> Nearly 80% of these symptoms were evident between four weeks and one hour before the hearts stopped pumping , the 2013 study said . Only half of the men had been tested for coronary heart disease , before their cardiac arrest . <p> Sudden cardiac arrest was once a death sentence . Chances of survival @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ victim of sudden cardiac arrest is saved roughly once every six hours , largely due to the use of defibrillators within hospitals and increased CPR by bystanders , said a 2011 thesis -- analysing data over 30 years -- from the Sahlgrenska Academy at the University of Gothenburg . Survival rates for sudden cardiac arrest outside hospital are as low as 7% , according to a 2013 European Society of Cardiology study . In the US , those rates are about 9.5% . <p> " The survival rate from cardiac arrest has remained low over the last 40 years despite major investment and the epidemiology of SCD ( sudden cardiac death ) in Western Europe is unclear , " Xavier Jouven , a professor with the Paris Sudden Death Expertise Centre Registry was quoted as saying . <p> Still , as I said , emergency measures do help . The administration of early CPR and access to a defibrillator allowed people at exercise facilities a higher chance of survival than at other indoor areas , reported a 2013 study by the American College of Cardiology . <p> New indicators for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ novel genetic variations ( 2011 ) to sex-hormone levels in blood ( 2014 ) . Earlier this year , greater understanding of heart mutations came from biosciences research at the University of Kent , UK , where they identified for the first time how -- at the level of a single molecule -- heart muscle is switched on and off by calcium . <p> Other researchers have probed the geography of cardiac arrest , coining the term cardio-toxic neighbourhoods to describe areas with a high incidence of cardiac arrest . A 2012 Heart and Stroke Foundation of Canada study , for instance , found three to five times higher rates of cardiac arrests in cardio-toxic neighbourhoods of Toronto . The main inhabitants of cardio-toxic neighbourhoods in that city were older people with slightly higher rates of diabetes and high blood pressure . " Our research suggests wealth , education and social inclusion are important factors , but only explain part of the puzzle , " Paul Dorian , a cardiologist and co-author , said at the time in a statement . <p> In India , the problem with assessing sudden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gleaned from secondary or so-called surrogate sources , such as cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) . Such extrapolation has resulted in a figure of 700,000 deaths from sudden cardiac arrest every year , or 10.3% of overall mortality , according to a 2012 International Journal of Cardiology study . It is clear that sudden cardiac arrest will haunt India . <p> " The incidence of SCD ( sudden cardiac death ) is on the rise , especially in the urban regions , which may be largely attributed to the alarming increase in prevalence of CVD , diabetes and hypertension in India , " said a review article in the December 2014 Journal of the Association of Physicians of India . <p> So , pay attention to warning signs , however trivial they may feel .

The price tag during the launch of the car was 2.56 lakh ( ex-showroom Delhi ) and that stunned its competitors too . The Renault Kwid deserves an applause and just shows that a good product is always a hit with the customers . <p> It was probably the biggest news to hit the automotive industry and Volkswagen admission of using a cheat device to pass emission norms made things worse . The news hit the company 's operations in Europe in a big way and India too bore the brunt of this .
