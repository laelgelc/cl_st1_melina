But reports from the capital , Bujumbura are quite unnerving .

@@10051240 <p> A new approach being pursued by the government with regard to the demolition of homes in unauthorised areas , which kicked off in Dar es Salaam a couple of weeks ago , makes a lot of sense . <p> The government has announced a reprieve of sorts to people who built houses in illegal locations but possess legal documents issued by public authorities in that the structures will only be pulled down after they have been given alternative plots . <p> The humane approach not only relieves those who were ill informed or misled into building in unauthorized locations but , more importantly , it intends to hold responsible all public officials who issued the non-sanctioned permits and title deeds to the victims .

That is why the new government approach on the demolitions is indeed laudable . <p> Land management plans should have precisely defined reserved areas such as river banks and valleys , sea and lake shores , roads and so forth , for the public to understand and and thereby avoid any encroachment .

It is argued that ' haste makes waste ' and I am scared that another chaotic and unplanned Dar es Salaam is on its way to replication in Dodoma . <p> To begin with , I would like to commend this relocation a very bold decision in the first place . As it might have already been said by others , the government 's decision to relocate to Dodoma was announced in October 1973 by the late Mwalimu Nyerere after the National Executive Committee of the Tanzania African National Union ( TANU ) resolved that the country 's capital , both for the government and the party , be relocated to Dodoma . <p> By the way , the idea to relocate had been suggested in 1915 by the German colonial government . It followed that , in 1974 the planning of the new capital began , and the plan was approved by Mwalimu Nyerere , the then president in July 1976 . This is because by 1973 Dar es Salaam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Nevertheless , all these years passed without the decision being put to practice . My main sources commending the relocation are based on at least three main issues regarding the Dar es Salaam City . <p> The first relates to its colonial history , the second to uneven distribution of national resources and services , and the third is poor and impracticable planning due to overpopulation . The modern history of Dar es Salaam began with Sultan of Zanzibar in the name of Majid bin Said in 1866 . <p> This Sultan built it as a minor haven . It was also the same Arabs who gave the name of Dar es Salaam . But it was possibly the German colonial state which elevated the status of Dar es Salaam when in 1891 they moved their capital from Bagamoyo to Dar es Salaam , and made it their East Africa regional capital . <p> So essentially , the planning of Dar es Salaam was colonial in nature . The construction arrangement was based on race ; there were locations for Whites , Asians and Africans . Traces of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The residential area for the Whites is now occupied by expatriates , affluent Tanzanians and those of the political caliber . The Indians are mostly in the City Centre and that was the original set-up . Other citizens , mainly of the black race , are to be found in other places like Buguruni , Ilala , Manzese , and now in the outskirts . <p> The unfortunate thing is that even the provision of social services was racially based . This explains why there are better roads and planning in Masaki , Oysterbay , and Upanga . The streets in these areas have names , and the houses have numbers . The situation is completely different in other locations of Dar es Salaam . Incidentally , this same kind of set-up caused all important offices and services to be concentrated close together in the city centre . This situation has led Dar es Salaam to have one of the most disgusting traffic jams in Africa . <p> Again , due to this same kind of history , trying to redo this set up is next to impossible . Additionally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Dar es Salaam , almost all resources are directed to Dar es Salaam . <p> In fact some people even think that Tanzania is Dar es Salaam . <p> As such , all main social services , including educational institutions , hospitals , media and publishing houses , radio stations , and what have you , are based in Dar es Salaam . Indeed , this necessarily brings about imbalances in national development . <p> Having said that , I now want to talk about why this shift to Dodoma needs more balanced reflection ( if ever this is possible ! ) . Nyerere and his TANU government were of the view that Tanzania needed a capital city which would reflect their aspiration of serving all Tanzanians equally . <p> So they had in mind a city whose planning would not be based on the race of the occupants . I am not sure whether or not this aspiration is ever possible , because there is already Uzunguni in Dodoma . <p> Furthermore , the set up of the Dar es Salaam combined with the ever growing populating makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ road network is throttled ; the number of cars is also ever increasing due to poor public transport . <p> I am therefore of the opinion that the haste should be temporary , but proper planning of Dodoma should be carried out . For example social services like schools , markets , shopping malls and the like need to spread in all directions of the city . It should not be the case that all roads lead to Ihumwa , Chamwino or Kizota . <p> The different embassies , tax collection authority , Bank of Tanzania , police force , industries , and the like , should be scattered all over the new Capital . The road network needs also to be carefully calculated so that one hundred years from now the Capital should still remain like able and manageable . <p> Dr Gastor Mapunda is senior lecturer in the College of Humanities ( CoHU ) , University of Dar es Salaam ( gmapunda@ udsm.ac.tz )

Mobile telecom networks have emerged as the major providers of financial services , bypassing the sparse retail networks of traditional banks . <p> The use of mobile phones for instance has brought about rapid transformation of urban and rural societies , putting Tanzania at the top in the region 's provision of mobile financial services . Mobile banking achievements in Tanzania are vivid in delivery of mobile saving , loan and interest bearing products through mobile money accounts . <p> In the developed world , according to KPMG , the rapid increase of smartphones and recently tablets has fueled the mobile banking fire , with the 2014 Juniper Research putting the total global mobile banking users at 0.8 billion . <p> The findings show that the impressive level of adoption is set to continually grow rapidly over the coming years , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1.8 billion people by 2019 . <p> The use of underlying mobile technologies like smartphones that support the internet have changed the course of people 's life , supporting economic growth and human development .

The mobile money development is the first of its kind in Africa and demonstrates how the system is becoming the essential means of offering financial services , especially to those who do not have access to the traditional banking system . <p> Regarding poverty reduction , mobile phone technology plays a critical role in enhancing the activities of the poor and increasing their productivity through increased access to market information or lowering the transaction costs of poor farmers and traders . <p> It provides governments , businesses and citizens with access to better information for more informed decisions .

At the three-days fourth Annual Mobile360 Africa conference in Dar es Salaam recently , Tanzania emerged among few countries in the continent with exemplary mobile financial services . <p> The mobile money services that all telecommunication companies provide in the country are instrumental in bringing financial services closer to the public , especially the rural dwellers who lack the traditional banking services . <p> The use of mobile money services reduces theft , saves time of physical visits to banks as well as the risk of carrying a lot of paper money .
