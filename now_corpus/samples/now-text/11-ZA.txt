It seems the same haste , not necessarily the urgency , influenced his call ups . <p> In the squad released on Thursday morning , the former Partizan Belgrade boss called up two players who only signed for the Serbian side last week . Prince Tagoe and Dominic Adiyiah are the two recognized strikers heading for the friendly , but both have inspired little confidence in front of goal for some time now . <p> Since inspiring Ghana to the World Youth Championship triumph in Egypt two years ago with eight goals , Adiyiah has gone from the next great hope of Ghana football to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ youth level is incredibly difficult to replicate at senior level . <p> He represented Ghana at the 2010 Nations Cup and World Cup , but he was clearly feeding off his exploits at the youth level . He has not played competitively for AC Milan since joining them in January 2010 . In his loan spell at Reginna , he managed one goal from 13 appearances , most of them from the bench . <p> Tagoe seems to have lost his scoring boots too since his move from Saudi Arabia to Europe . His return on goals for Hoffenheim was two goals in 12 games . In 22 games he has managed four goals for Ghana , but it is how he has played that is raising cause for concern . <p> So clearly for a boss keen to make a statement about his attacking intensions and his commitment to winning with style , Stevanovic did not back that up with his squad selection . In a way the messages he so eloquently delivered in his passable English , he did not measure up to with his actions . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Overall , this was a squad that does not ooze quality . John Mensah 's quality can not be understated , but he has not played since December because of injury . <p> John Boye is yet to make his senior debut for Stade Rennes since moving to France two years ago . That is simply not good enough for a player with Black Stars ambitions . <p> In midfield , Emmanuel Agyemang Badu has barely played for Udinese and then there is the case of Sulley Muntari . He got a visit from Stevanovic just as he did from the ex-boss Milovan Rajevac . And in both cases the flights to Milan happened after he had reportedly fallen foul of the side 's disciplinary code . <p> In traveling to Milan , Stevanovic made Muntari something of a special case . For someone who has consistently thrown the rule book in camp out of the window , that is sending a bad message to the rest of the squad . It says ' you can play boss , you can scream at the boss , but we will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with you over your return all at the expense of that nation ' . And that to sum it up in one of my favourite words is bogus . <p> The reaction to the call-ups especially on social networking sites summed up the feeling towards the squad . Television analyst Nana Agyemang wrote on his Facebook page that the ' nonsense ' has started again and argued there are far too many players in the squad who did not deserve to be there because of a lack of playing time . <p> On KickOffGhana.com 's official Facebook page , Eugene Asumado took issues with the squad , insisting Goran has started on a wrong note . <p> With the best crop of home based players away on duty at the championship of African Nations , Goran 's options were somehow limited even though even though the bosses barely consider the home boys . <p> You have to hope for the sake of Ghana football he gets back on the right path quickly because to make champions again , Ghana will require much more than strikers who ca n't count double @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not good enough for their club sides and midfielders who have spent time watching more than playing recently . <p> Article by : Michael Oti Adjei <h> Previous comments on this story ... <p> Showing 1 - 12 of 12 results <p> Anonymous <p> posted : 10:05 pm <p> massa man 4 no gossip why u bring facebuk matta 4 fotbal inside <p> Anonymous <p> posted : 10:36 pm <p> Micheal great piece and am over the moon for been acknowledged in the article .

Britain 's Got Talent judge Amanda Holden made her first public appearance this week after losing her second unborn baby . <p> Fiona Stonehouse , 36 , an unemployment consultant from Liverpool , had suffered two miscarriages . She then underwent a procedure that saved her next child , as she tells Carol Davis . <p> THE PATIENT <p> Rushing to get ready for work one morning , I kept feeling I needed the loo . I went to the bathroom and suddenly there was blood everywhere . I was 20 weeks pregnant and knew it was the baby . <p> I screamed for my partner , Paul , who took one look at me and called for an ambulance . <p> Once we arrived at Liverpool Women 's Hospital , the labour pains started , so they transferred me to a delivery suite and midwives gave me painkillers . <p> We just could n't believe it - the day before , a scan had showed the baby was well and healthy . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ born with a pulse , but within 20 minutes she passed away . <p> I held her for a while , feeling absolutely devastated , and left hospital that afternoon with only photographs of my lovely baby . <p> I wondered if it was something I 'd done . Fourteen years previously , my daughter Imogen was born healthy , though I went into labour eight weeks early . That time , the doctors managed to stop the labour with drugs until I was full term . <p> When I went back to hospital after the miscarriage , the consultant said I might have cervical weakness . This means the cervix - the neck of the womb - starts to open before the baby is due . <p> So , when I got pregnant again six months later , doctors placed a stitch in the cervix to prevent it dilating too early . This time they kept a close eye on me . <p> At 17 weeks , a scan showed the cervix was " funnelling " - opening and closing so it formed an hourglass shape - which the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at risk of infection . I was told to rest . <p> At 20 weeks , my waters broke at home . The stitch had failed to work . At hospital , the doctors had to take it out so I could give birth to baby Paul Joseph , who was born without a pulse . <p> After the second miscarriage , Paul and I were in despair and wondered if I 'd ever have another healthy baby . <p> Then my doctor told me about a procedure where surgeons put a strong nylon loop around the top of the cervix and secure it with a knot . <p> It is placed much higher up the cervix than the stitch - just below the womb . The operation would be done before I got pregnant ( the cervix is left open enough so you can conceive ) . <p> Around 20 percent of all pregnancies end in miscarriage - recurrent miscarriage , when it happens twice or more , affects around one in 100 women . <p> While it 's not always clear what has triggered a miscarriage , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blocks small blood vessels in the placenta . <p> We can treat this with blood-thinning injections , mini aspirin and the vitamin folic acid . <p> It can also be caused by the growth of bacteria in the vagina . <p> Another possible cause is cervical weakness . Here , the womb starts to open or funnel , and the rest of the cervix then opens , too , so labour begins early . Even women who 've previously had healthy pregnancies can develop this condition we do n't know why . <p> Putting a stitch in the cervix through the vagina can help prevent it opening early . But we can also offer transabdominal cerclage , which strengthens the cervix at the point where it starts to open . <p> This operation carries risks , including infection , bleeding , and damage to the bladder and bowel - but these are reduced if we do it before pregnancy . <p> The operation takes 90 minutes under general anaesthetic .

Then I pass a needle threaded with strong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the point where it joins the womb and pull it tight . <p> I secure it with a surgical knot and close the incision with stitches . The patient usually leaves hospital after four or five days . She can start trying to get pregnant once she 's had her next period . <p> The body will not absorb the nylon thread and it should last for ever , so the woman can have more full-term pregnancies if she wants . This is a wonderful operation that offers hope to women when all else has failed . - Daily Mail

The sounds of AK-47s and the singing of Hamba Kahle Mkhonto ... would confirm that I had indeed found the station .

" would start the day 's programme . <p> After a brief introduction , the standard update on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the anti-apartheid movement , the struggle in South Africa and Namibia , women 's struggles and similar issues , ANC president Oliver Reginald Tambo would address the nation in exile , diaspora and inside the country . <p> That is , all of us , those hiding in the street corners of our townships , the barren villages in the back and beyond of South Africa , and include us all in this movement with which we wanted to establish a connection . <p> Almost 30 years later I connect with those feelings evoked by those solitary and furtive years of listening to this radio station . For me , this was an important rite of passage . Like many others , political or otherwise , these experiences continue to shape the person who continues to evolve , the woman I am today and will be tomorrow . <p> The banned radio station fed my soul 's yearning for a different voice on the predicament of being a young black South African trapped in what were constructed as reserves for cheap labour . <p> Every day I had an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , most importantly , the possibility of being a free human being . <p> The case which has been brought by AfriForum and the Transvaal Agricultural Union against Julius Malema concerning the song Dubul ' iBhunu ( Shoot the Boer ) has taken me back so many decades . I am sure I am not alone in this . Many of us have stories that we have consciously or unconsciously buried within us but we nevertheless carry them in every fibre of our being and they mark us in fundamental ways . <p> We are not prisoners of our history but beneficiaries of past generations that imagined and yearned for freedom . Like those who came before us we also cut our teeth in the streets of South Africa and dived into the unfamiliar waters of trying to change a society . But , first , we had to know that and to name it as such . <p> As James Baldwin wrote so many decades ago , when the oppressed begin to articulate their oppression , they have taken the first step towards their own liberation . Radio Freedom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , digest and articulate the character of the South African socio-political conditions . <p> Regrettably , over time , much of the narrative of political song has become disembodied and truncated . Many of us can not identify with the use and abuse of these songs and slogans today . <p> Today , a song originating from black youth expressing pain and resolve to go away , appealing to their mothers to let them go , be trained and bring bazookas to free their land and people , has been reduced to a single line , Dubul ' iBhunu ( Shoot the Boer ) . <p> This line may be the most controversial and newsworthy but this distorts the song , its meaning , context and content . The focus on one line has undermined its essence . The resolve , the cry and the plea of the black youth to his mother , we mama ndiyeke ( oh mama let me go ) has been totally erased in the public discourse . We do not see their words , we do not hear their voices nor do we experience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here . History is often recorded from the voice of the powerful and the hegemonic paradigm . Those who are on the margins and the subaltern do not form part of this . But the ANC could have tried to bring their voices into court and centred their experience in the proceedings so no matter how uncomfortable many may feel , we are forced to see and connect with their experiences . We must ask how the song of youth willing to leave everything they know to go to foreign , unknown countries becomes a song about killing alone . How did we get to this point where the pain of the black youth and their willingness to sacrifice their lives becomes a song about the fear of white people , especially Afrikaners ? <p> Is this shift in focus and simultaneous erasure of voices accidental ? <p> As for Dubul ' ibhunu , this is part of a chorus and a refrain in the song . One does not require musicologists to explain that this is not necessarily the central part of the song , even more so in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issues were not raised in court . Important as the Equality Court is in this case , it can only work within the mandate of that institution . <p> Long after the judgment has been made , these questions of voice and history in the present will remain with us . <p> However , we can not expect to address questions of our complex historical heritage in this polarised manner . Our past lives in the present , no matter how hard we try to deny this . Similarly , the parts of our past with which we are no longer comfortable can not be easily sanitised , nor can we easily throw them away because they are no longer convenient . History is an untidy , inconsistent companion . It is with us all the time , but with all its complexity , meanings by no means settled . <p> Songs , buildings , poems , symbols are as much part of who we are as a people as our individual DNA . There is no escaping the social and historical construction that has shaped us . And yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how to take it into the present and the future . <p> Songs are also about context . I can not imagine a family procession to exhantini ( the entrance of the kraal , where ancestral spirits are addressed ) singing somagwaza , ndakugwza ngalo mkhonto . That is a song sung during the initiation of young men , when the celebrants tease each other about the power of their spear . To sing it at a time when one wants to intercede with the ancestors would be mindless , disrespectful and blasphemous . <p> Similarly , during the Christian Holy Week ( the week preceding Good Friday ) I can not imagine an Anglican congregation singing songs of the Advent . Similarly , one does not sing a funeral song at a wedding or at a baptism . <p> This is an area the ANC leadership might want to reflect on . The legitimacy of the song as part of our Struggle heritage is not an issue for many South Africans including , I suspect , those who may be sympathetic to AfriForum . <p> The ANC would help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directly confront these difficult issues . <p> Unfortunately , both sides in the case have fallen into the dangerous trap , debating whether the song is hate speech or not . Hate speech ? But that is for another day . Regrettably , the polarisation of the song ( albeit in a distorted fashion ) has robbed us of a rich , textured and , yes , untidy narrative of our history , including that of those who come from AfriForum . Consequently , many of us can not help finding it difficult to associate with such simplistic arguments , irrespective of the quarters from which they come . Yes , simplistic because in many ways the very political and jurisprudential edifice upon which this case is built limits human experience . <p> Even after these many years , Nazim Hikmet 's collection of poems , I Would Softly Tell My Love , hits me as powerfully as the songs I sang and danced to in the streets . <p> You 're a mountain village <p> in Anatolia , <p> You are my city , <p> the most beautiful and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I mean you are my country ; <p> the footsteps running towards you are mine <p> So wrote Nazim Hikmet , a Turkish political prisoner upon whom a multitude of indignities and torture was visited .

Jayne Alverca reports . <p> The Indian Ocean may be the stuff of dreams for tourists , but the authorities who manage Port Louis Harbour in Mauritius have more serious concerns to contend with . As an island state , the port 's management play a pivotal role in the Mauritian national economy , as it represents the main link with the external world for almost all transportation requirements . <p> The port itself consists of three main terminals which house a total of 14 separate quays . Together , these facilities handle about 99 per cent of the total volume of external trade and contribute more than two per cent to the country 's GDP . All strategic imports such as foodstuffs , petroleum products and raw materials for the textile industry must also rely on the port as a transit point . <p> By the turn of the millennium , two decades of heady growth and constant expansion had near exhausted the port 's capacity .

A key improvement has been the dredging of the access channel to the Mauritius Container Terminal to provide additional draft . This means that fifth generation vessels can now use the port 's facilities . The size of the container yard has been almost doubled to give a storage capacity of 550,000 TEUs and the existing container berth was expanded by an additional 150 metres so it could accommodate three container ships at any one time . <p> Because the Indian Ocean can be subject to devastating cyclones , the Mauritius Container Terminal had experienced recurrent floodings due to prevailing swell conditions . On occasion , this had caused major disruption to operations at the terminal .

In a handling operation that now meets world class standards of safety and efficiency , Port Louis Harbour handles well over a million tonnes of petroleum products each year .

The new oil jetty has a total throughput capacity of about four million tonnes per annum and has been built to meet requirements for many years to come <p> In another ambitious move , MPA has embarked on a project for the construction of a dedicated cruise jetty at Les Salines . At a total project cost of about Rs. 485 million , this has enabled the port to cater for larger cruise vessels and also facilitated improvements to passenger comfort , transfer and safety . The contract for the construction of the jetty was entrusted to Messrs Afcons ( India ) in November 2008 and was officially inaugurated on 15 February 2010 . <p> The move will provide the national economy with a major boost to tourism revenues by supporting a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' status for cruise tourism . During the last financial year , cruise traffic grew by almost 60 per cent with 22 passenger vessels calling in to the port . The ability to handle bigger vessels means that passenger numbers increased even more , growing by a record 105 per cent in a single year . <p> MPA is proud of its achievements to date , but the work to maintain the port 's newly won world class status is ongoing . Forecasts claim that container traffic will double by 2015 and major shipping lines have made plain their intention to use larger container vessels in the area . In response , the size of the container berth is set to increase again and further deepening of the channel that gives access to the container terminal is also planned . The next project , due for completion in 2013 , will include measures that will see the berth at the container yard extended by another 150 metres and able to accommodate ships with a draft of 16.5 metres . <p> Meanwhile the reclaimed land of Les Salines at the southern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ major waterfront development project which will provide a marina , top quality hotels and a wide spectrum of leisure and toursim facilities .

Selim Kaymak , Sumo 's executive director , sees its mission as reaching far beyond the profitable exploration and extraction of coal . For Kaymak , these values begin with strong corporate governance that emphasises an ethical and socially responsible approach to business . " From the outset , we have set out to make a stand and lead by example as an ethical investor . Sumo 's company policy is to practice and follow ethically correct business policies in all its endeavours .

" <p> Sumo is an active member of Business Unity South Africa , or BUSA , which aims to ensure that businesses make a positive and constructive contribution to the country 's economic growth , development and transformation goals -- not just within the mining industry , but within all sectors of South African society . " Mining is a very important element of the South African economy , but working through BUSA we aim to bring our influence and strive towards the progress of all companies in South Africa . We want to create an environment in which businesses of all sizes and in all sectors can thrive and grow , but in a way that supports South Africa 's goals for its people and development , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the South African people has led to a strong commitment to education , particularly for the races affected by discrimination during the apartheid era . Education has been identified as one of the most important pillars in building a successful future for the country .

It is now funding the construction of a school at Willow Glen , in the Tshwane Municipality of Pretoria . This ambitious project will cover an area of about 1 , 100 hectares and will have 400 pupils . Both schools will implement a curriculum that stresses technology , mathematics and science -- the subjects which are needed by the next generation of mine engineers , managers and technicians . The schools will also make a special point of reaching out to children from socially and economically disadvantaged communities . <p> From a commercial perspective , Kaymak believes that Sumo 's stance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For example , it means we can make fast decisions about opportunities which can be quickly implemented -- which is vital in this type of fast-moving business environment , " he says . <p> Strong management also allows for a corporate culture in which capable people can fulfill their potential .

" We look for a mix of education and experience in our staff , but it does not matter how capable a person is as an individual : they have to be able to co-operate and work as part of a team . That is the most important criteria by which we judge individual success and when we recruit contractors , " he states . <p> This team-focused approach also plays a useful role in the execution of Sumo 's wider objectives .

For those that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and would like to share the risk , Sumo can step in with investment and expertise , putting up funding for a project or resource which would be beneficial to both parties . <p> " In South Africa , we underline the importance of partnerships and joint ventures and our ethical stance means that everyone we deal with can have total confidence in our integrity . We believe this will help us to identify new partners who are the holders of prospecting and mining rights . Within Sumo , we have a proven in-house exploration company and the funds to bring new projects to production . Joint ventures are our future and we want others to come forward and work with us for the betterment of the nation . " <p> Looking to the future , Sumo 's key objectives are to continue creating a firm footprint as a diversified mining company across the African continent , and to pursue exciting opportunities and joint ventures with mining companies for coal , PGMs , iron ore and manganese .

@@4115236 <h> Rajhi Steel Industries <p> Rajhi Steel Industries turns out more than one million tons of steel products each year ; but the round figure keeps cropping up , as commercial vice president Abdul Aziz Al-Hudaib explains . <p> It was on December 31 2008 that the workers at the Al-Rajhi Steel plant in Jeddah knew they had hit their one million jackpot . They had vowed to have turned out by the end of that year one million tons of billet steel from the smelter that only started full production in June the previous year . It was quite an achievement given the difficult conditions in the steel market at the time , but the steel produced by Rajhi Steel does not have to be sold abroad and is all absorbed into the considerable demands of the Saudi economy , reducing the amounts that need to be imported and increasing the country 's proclaimed goal of becoming more self-reliant in strategic raw materials . <p> Work on the $300 million steel plant began in June 2005 and it was completed in December 2006 . This ultra-modern steel plant is designed to turn out 850,000 tons of billets annually , measuring 130 mm square @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the billets produced are consumed internally , feeding Rajhi Steel 's rolling mills in Riyadh and Jeddah , says commercial vice president Abdul Aziz Al-Hudaib . " The principal market for our products is within Saudi Arabia , where there is strong demand from manufacturing and the construction industry -- there is not enough capacity locally to supply these customers . " <p> Demand is being driven , he says , by massive current investment in Saudi Arabia 's infrastructure . " As one of the market leaders in the region it is our responsibility to provide these raw materials . Saudi Arabia has a huge government project coming up that will require a lot of steel bar among other materials . King Abdullah recently announced a major development push in the country ; part of that is to build 500,000 residential units and a simple calculation tells us that this will need about 20 million metric tons of steel bar just to reinforce all that concrete ! " <p> Now Rajhi Steel is rising to the challenge of meeting this demand , while maintaining its supplies to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ period of considerable expansion . The kingdom is highly focused on its programme of Saudization , which aims to maximise the number of jobs being given to Saudi nationals , the transfer of skills , and of course bring as much of the raw materials procurement chain within the country as possible . <p> Rajhi Steel 's rolling mills specialise in the production of rebar , which is simply short for reinforcement bar , the strengthening element in concrete structures . Currently it supplies around 17 per cent of the country 's requirement for these products and about the same amount of the industrial market for items such as steel tube , hot rolled sheet between one and 12 mm , galvanised steel and sheet for industrial flooring known as chequered steel from its raised profile . " We are a major producer of steel rebar from 10 to 40 mm with a current annual capacity of about 760,000 tons . This is produced at our three rolling mills . " <p> Two of the rolling mills at present operated by Rajhi Steel are in Riyadh , where about two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a capacity of 260,000 tons , is at the Jeddah site , which is in the process of undergoing a massive transformation . The existing rolling mill is to be joined by a brand new , state-of-the-art and environmentally friendly rolling mill that will produce a further one million tons of bar once it is opened in 2012 . <p> Commitment was made to invest in the $200 million plant following a study Rajhi Steel undertook on the market and the market needs going forward , says Al-Hudaib . " Apart from residential building , there is a lot of other expansion in hospitals , schools , social projects and industry that is going to take place over the next four years . There is annual growth from five to six per cent in our national economy , and a marked gap between production and consumption . Our projections show a considerable shortfall over that period and that we will have the need to import a massive amount of raw material . " <p> The new rolling mill was commissioned as a turnkey contract from the Italian steel plant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secured a rolling mill at a lower cost , but we wanted to have the best performance , the greatest efficiency , the most reliable and the most environmentally sustainable plant that was available . " The plant is being constructed from the foundations up , on a space adjacent to the existing Jeddah melt shop , and it is due to be commissioned in April next year . Clearly the new rolling mill is going to have to be fed . As part of the plan , the existing melt shop in Jeddah is being expanded from its current 850,000 to one million tons -- that magic figure again -- by the time the plant is commissioned . <p> Being one of the largest steel producers in the country carries a weight of responsibility , Al-Hudaib emphasises . " This is a strategic project for the whole country and the region and it puts more pressure on us to maintain ourselves as an industry leader , and to maintain and develop the market whether in raw material or finished product . " <p> The deal is that all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the rolling mill will be sourced locally , though the rolling mill itself will be imported from Italy and assembled on site . Closer to the time of completion , the company will start a recruitment effort to recruit and train workmen , engineers and plant operators . <p> In the past Rajhi Steel has positioned itself as a regional rather than a national supplier , and it still intends to grow its operations outside of Saudi Arabia . However , the domestic market must come first . " It is part of our plan to open up new markets in the region but we know that with all this growth there is market share to be taken both from local producers and from imported materials . In 2010 more than one million tons of rebar was imported by Saudi Arabia . We are keen to replace that with locally produced product .

@@4115237 <h> African stock markets look at regional integration <p> A major priority area that has been set by governments in East Africa has to do with the integration of capital market activity in the East African Community ( Kenya , Tanzania , Uganda , Rwanda , Burundi ) and building a platform on which a regional stock exchange can be set up . <p> It also appears that it will not necessarily be a merger of stock markets , but an effort of the various securities exchanges to create a platform where shares in one region can be traded in the various member countries .

@@4136237 <h> Get a coach , get a life <p> I was working as the editor of an upscale glossy lifestyle magazine in San Francisco about 10 years ago when a freelancer suggested she write a story on life coaching . I had never heard of it . She said that while very different from therapy , many regarded it as the new " therapy alternative " - and it was changing lives . For her story , she would speak to coaches , to clients who had benefited from coaching , and she would try some coaching herself . <p> When her story came in , I read about people attributing significant life changes to working with a coach . A business owner , for example , said she had started taking holidays and doubled the size of her income within six months of hiring a coach . A man said he had developed self-confidence , lost weight and found love since he started working with a coach . <p> The stories varied , but there was a common theme that had to do with making better choices and living more fulfilled , successful and satisfying lives . <p> I learned , too , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while it was n't yet regulated , there were bodies attempting to set standards and accredited schools where you could train and certify .

Working with two fabulous therapists had convinced me of the value of therapy . And I 'd been a Zen student long enough to understand the wisdom of the bumper sticker that reads : " Do n't believe all that you think " . What grabbed me about coaching was that it sounded so pragmatic . Everything I read suggested it was less about introspection ; more about living effectively in the world . For starters , as the writer explained , coaching for the most part was done by phone ( these days Skype ) , which made it easy to fit into busy lives . <p> By the time I finished editing the freelancer 's story and doing a bit of additional research , I was committed to both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coach myself . <p> Coaching or therapy ? <p> Judging from a column in the March 13 issue of my magazine , by Daryl Ilbury , there are people who think they know what coaching is - but do n't have a clue . <p> Many , it seems , are under the impression that people go to coaches for advice on how to run their lives . Or equate coaching with therapy , which it is not ; although in the US many therapists are training as coaches to give themselves additional skills . <p> In brief , a coach is neither adviser nor consultant . Any challenge issued , request made or accountability structure set up , comes from the client 's agenda . If you saw The King 's Speech , you will have seen a coach in action .

" We think there are probably about 2 000 dabbling outside of that , " says Davies , who adds that if you want to hire a coach , expect to pay between R300 and R2 000 ( executive coach level ) an hour ( there is no benchmark ) and you shoud do your homework first . " Did they do a three-day course or did they train for a year ? And what is their experience in the area you want to focus on in coaching ?

Apart from the re-establishment of Medunsa , a new medical school will be established on the University of Limpopo 's Polokwane campus , becoming the country 's ninth such institution . <p> Other than that , Nzimande 's brief excursion into the tertiary landscape was dramatic more for the sights the minister said he still wanted to take in , rather than those he already had . <p> He would establish an advisory panel on African languages because he was " particularly concerned about the glaring weakness in that area of the humanities " , he said . <p> That was in the context of reminding Parliament that he was expecting a report , in three months , on how to " strengthen the humanities and social sciences " because their " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Other tertiary sights which Nzimande looked forward to seeing were the reports in July on how to establish new universities in the only two provinces that have none ( Mpumalanga and the Northern Cape ) ; and one next year from businessman Cyril Ramaphosa , who is leading a review of university funding . <p> But , like Gordhan before him , it was to the present realities of an enormous expansion in skills development that the minister devoted his real passion on Thursday . <p> Of the R37.4-billion the finance minister had given him to play with , R9-billion goes to Setas and the National Skills Fund , R4.3-billion to FET colleges and R4-billion to the National Student Financial Aid Scheme ( NSFAS ) -- some of the latter being earmarked specifically to expand enrolments at the colleges . <p> NSFAS also funds university students , so the doubling of its disbursements this financial year over 2010/11 will benefit the tertiary sector too .

Because for both men and women , the sources of a deeper , whole-body orgasm are not where you 'd think they should be . <p> In the case of women , the spot that 's considered the font of the female orgasm , the clitoris , is completely mislocated . Most women probably lament at least twice a week that the clitoris is not placed just inside the vagina . The same goes for the G-spot ( or urethral sponge ) , which is in a tricky spot inside the vagina just beyond the curve of the pubic bone - and the penis typically misses it altogether . <p> So it is that the prostate gland ( aka his P-spot ) , a highly sensitive organ akin to the woman 's G-spot , is reached through the anus . While the function of the prostate gland is to produce ejaculatory fluid , it is also a source of sexual pleasure for many guys because it is located on the nerve pathways between the brain and penis .

And when the prostate is stimulated at the same time as the penis , the sensation is doubly pleasurable because the prostate nestles at the base of the penis . Playing with both sites means that the two ends of the penis are receiving stimulation , which is more intense . What 's more , the anus itself is an erogenous zone because the anal cavity is rich in sensitive nerve endings , so stimulating the cavity can be exquisitely pleasurable . <p> Yet , just as some women are n't moved if their G-spot is massaged or find the sensation positively irritating , not all men enjoy having their prostate stimulated . We are all unique . However , what many couples discover after years of the same bedroom routine is that playing with a wider range of stimuli can broaden the sexual experience .

Since his unceremonious departure from Kruger Park , which he used to call " my park " ( in Afrikaans ) , Joubert 's behaviour and comments have invariably insinuated that no park director has ever been good enough to administer Kruger Park . <p> All his successors - Harold Braack , David Mabunda , Bandile Mkhize and now Abe Sibiya - have been targets of his irrational contempt and criticism . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they have majestically moved on to prove him wrong through their unquestionable qualifications for the job , passion for nature and their consistent success in their management of the park . <p> Joubert is yet to explain to us all just what is wrong in building facilities in Kruger Park , to cater for various markets , especially overseas tourists , who prefer hotel-type accommodation they are used to in their countries . <p> I am equally at a loss how the lodge , built at almost the same roof height as the existing rondavels in the camps , will interfere with the biodiversity and overall environmental management of the park . <p> Besides what Joubert and his critical alliances say and do , the truth is that Kruger Park has always been a major subject of racism and no attempt should be made to deny this historical fact . <p> For at least six decades , Kruger Park was the symbol of white domination and black exclusion . <p> This has been the experience of the people living on the borders of Kruger National Park and black South @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go into the park except as labour to the exclusively white management . <p> The few blacks who eventually managed to make it into the national park - diplomats of neighbouring countries and the apartheid-created black homelands - were only accommodated in what today should be correctly named " shame " camps . <p> These were poorly fenced enclaves that were kept apart from the other main camps . That none of these black tourists was devoured by predators remains a mystery . <p> Some blacks who truly enjoyed going to these parks , despite the humiliation and degradation visited upon them , would go as far as to appropriate white surnames for the purposes of making a reservation , which would lead to great discomfort for park management and the possible embarrassment of being turned away for the nature lover . <p> Another undeniable piece of history is that of one of the key by-products of the apartheid system , the systematic and government-sponsored impoverishment of blacks . This exclusion from economic activity is what led the new democratic government to introduce key policies like black economic empowerment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ failed , these policies have fortunately created hubs of opportunities for black people as well as encouraged the emergence of the black middle class . <p> These are people who are now ready with their expendable cash to go on holiday within or outside of the country . <p> The systematic exclusion of blacks from the beautiful landscapes of South Africa and economic activity meant that black South Africans developed different patterns of holidaying to those of their fellow white citizens . The favourite holiday pastime for most blacks ( to this day ) is to either visit beaches during holiday times or go to visit relatives in rural farm community villages . <p> For those who can afford overseas holidays and luxury hotels , the popular beach spots are most convenient and preferred . <p> Whereas white South Africans had got used to taking their children to national parks and nature reserves for holidays exhorting the ideals of " communing with nature " , blacks were already communing with nature in their villages . <p> The ideal nature holiday for an average white nature lover is not an ideal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that one would often hear being mentioned flippantly , but which holds very true when we look at this issue , is that for your average black South African , camping or sleeping in a sparsely decorated thatched rondavel or a tented chalet does not hold the same allure because it just spells poverty . <p> Your average black South African does not find anything to be excited about in such accommodation facilities . <p> After all , most of them were forced to live in such surroundings during the apartheid days . <p> To these days , others are still confined to such . However , this should never be read to mean that this person finds no excitement in the beauty of nature . <p> This is someone who gets as much thrill from seeing the big five as being told about the trees , grass , plants and landscape as much as anyone else . <p> But these are people who would very much like to retire to a comfortable bed at the end of the day . <p> Less than 10 years ago , black visitors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the park visitors , despite the black population comprising at least 75 to 80percent of the overall South African population . <p> The numbers have increased substantially since . <p> This was obviously an important product of the apartheid system and a serious indictment on our government . I fail to understand what could be such a bad thing when Kruger Park decided to rise to the challenge of meeting the needs of the average local and overseas visitors , by providing accommodation slightly different and more upmarket , as preferred by some visitors . <p> It is quite clear though that this debate is not necessarily about the hotel itself or the over-exhausted cries of loss of biodiversity because the reassurances from SANParks have been convincing enough . <p> The real crux of the debate is about loss of " ownership " to something that in actual fact is owned by no particular person . <p> There are families that have been going to Kruger National Park for many decades . <p> These are some of the people who are comfortable in the way things were . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know , and are used to since time immemorial . <p> They are equally uncomfortable at the introduction of a predominantly black management at Kruger Park and other national parks . <p> Shiburi is a journalist , a trustee at Ian Player 's Wilderness Foundation and former public relations and communications manager at SANParks <p> I can not believe that after 17 years of rule and freedom in this country that we still have this racialistic issue . It is absolutely appalling . Every time someone goes against an idea that is put forward , or disagrees with an issue , as long as the person is anything other than black , he or she is labeled as a " Racist " . This is a pathetic argument and a crutch as far as I am concerned . <p> Black people say they can not be racists , but everyone else is ? Come on people , when are you going to let go of your stupid crtuches and the past and move on ? Racism is racism . You can not use it to suit yourselves by claiming it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole hotel development in Kruger national park is a hot debate . Anyone opposed to this , please feel free to contact me and sign a petition I have going to block this . <p> This is an environmental issue , not a race issue . The author is clearly obsessed with racialising every debate , and has therefore failed in any attempt at journalistic integrity . <p> I wish readers could " report abuse " on the article as well as on the comments people leave , for this surely qualifies : abuse to those who oppose the ( clearly unnecessary ) Radisson Blu scheme by labeling them as racists for their environmental concern , abuse of journalistic principles ( and I do n't even mention the incredibly weak arguments used beyond the race card ) , and just plain common racism in the ' them and us ' tone of the piece . <p> Are you basing your argument for a construction as significant as this on the fact that you feel that Black people prefer luxury accommodation because the rondavels remind them of their " apartheid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not see the reverse racism and condescension towards your own people in your comments ! <p> I travel to the park several times a year . It is not my park ; it is South Africa 's park , and a jewel for all that visit irrespective of race , or country of origin . The single , unifying thing about the park is a deep respect for nature and an appreciation for our abundant natural resource gives us as a country . That appreciation is generally displayed by most people I meet in the park , irrespective of their race , and generally irrespective of their country of origin . <p> The real issue here is not race ; the real issue is protecting a national asset that belongs to all of us , and not allowing it to be exploited beyond its capacity . If a hotel is a necessity , then the trade-off should be an addition to the landmass of the park - the park should grow its boundaries by a carrying capacity equivalent to the impact of the hotel . <p> Get over yourself , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rest of us . <p> As an international visitor , 8 times to SA and 3 times to Kruger NP I am devastated that a decision to build HOTELS in such a beautiful piece of herritage has been taken . I hoped to believe that Kruger was for the animals and that humans , whatever colour , all came second to preserving this wilderness . As for a specific type of person wanting HOTEL style accomodation when they goto the beach , so do I , when I goto the beach , as I also wouldnt want to stay in a small hut or camp in the middle of Cape Town . Just because people stay in types of accomodation in one place does nt make it the right accomodation somewhere else . I hope someone puts an end to this development before it is too late and a place of beauty is changed for the worse . If people want to be in the wilderness they should be prepared to make a few sacrifices . You should be embarressed and ashamed that the race card has been raised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with interest news on construction of a hotel in Kruger Park . To date I , as a non-South African , have distanced myself from the inevitable debate which I have followed as much as possible on the SanParks forums . However I can not , in good conscience , ignore some of the remarks in this article . The statement " cater for ......... ocerseas tourists , who prefer hotel-type accommodation they are used to in their countries " is a ridiculous inaccuracy . Although in my senior years I have travelled widely since retirement , met and conversed with thousands of tourists . Not one preferred hotel style accommodation . In fact most abhorred the idea , preferring instead to travel and be accommodated in basic accommodation where they can meet friendly , like-minded travellers . I am appalled by the vitriolic attack on those who oppose the development , To accuse oppononents of racism is so wrong and you inevitably attack many who work to overcome the decades of oppression . Dare I say " Apartheid , horrific as it was , has gone . History is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and move on ! " You do not glean any sympathy by pulling the race card whenever it suits . <p> I really enjoyed working with Fanyana at Parks Board HQ , in a harmonious multiracial setup . Nobody mentions he left the " cause " there to make money as a soccer administrator , which was a great disappointment to us . <p> Please provide PROOF as to why those opposed to overcrowding and overdevelopment in Kruger Park are racist ? <p> So what is this Radsisson Blu hotel then ? It is obviously NOT a Sanparks-operated camp ( which would see 100% of the profits paid directly to Sanparks ) . Is it another private lodge like the above ? If so , the argument that the park needs it because all other accommodation is too basic falls flat . <p> Also , am I right in thinking that the chairman of Sanparks , Kuseni Dlamini , is a director of Mvelaphanda Group , which is part owned by Mvelaphanda Holdings . For those who do nt know , Mvelaphanda Holdings manages all of Rezidor 's hotels in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( the massive Swiss hotel group ) are the developers of this new hotel ! <p> I am just wondering whether pulling out the racism card may well be a convenient smokescreen for something a lot more shady ? After all , while we all sit here arguing about which race can hate the other more , the natural heritage that belongs to every citizen of South Africa is being pimped out to the highest bidder . <p> It also annoys me intensely that the developments planned for Kruger park are made to sound as benign as drinking a glass of purified water while the environmental impact is going to be far worse than this . The south of the reserve ( National Park ) is already over crowded and placing another 1500 people in the reserve is going to aggravate this situation dramatically . Consider that there will also be additonal staff members needed to be ferried to and from work in transport opperated by drivers who pay scant regard for the rules of any road , let alone the speed limits imposed by SANPARKS which in my opinion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the additional deliver vehicles which will need to bring in all the additional food necessary to feed the additonal staff and guests . <p> And if this is not enough , there are existing hotels in the surrounding towns that are struggling to survive and will most likely not survive the additional competition or that the hotels being built may suffer the same fate . So the tax payers money may very well be wasted on a plan that might after all , turn to complete disaster . Surely we that tax paying public have a right to fight against this since there is a great chance that our tax will be wasted . <p> Personally , I think the whole idea is a monumental mistake . If the hotels bring in the planned numbers of " black diamonds " ( I believe was the term used to describe the clientelle to be attracted ) it will be disasterous for the wildlife and the increased carbon footprint spells serious danger to the animals that are the reason why people from all over the world flock to KNP to come and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will result from the increased traffic . <p> And if they fail , then the tax payers will have lost millions of their hard earned money . This outcome is highly desired from a conservation perspective in my opinion . <p> Why spend all this money when existing infrastructures are not being maitained ? Why spend all this when service delivery had dropped to levels that I find pathetic and finally , what is being done to address some of the staffing issues where staff members are downright rude and clearly uninterested in their jobs , far less conservation ? <p> Personally I think that someone is suffering from delusions of grandeur . <p> While this is a very intriguing article , with very interesting historical facts , there are two things that REALLY irritated and infuriated me : 1 ) " I am equally at a loss how the lodge , built at almost the same roof height as the existing rondavels in the camps , will interfere with the biodiversity and overall environmental management of the park . " - if an author does not see how how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ camp or tented camp ) interferes with biodiversity and management of a park , especially when built on a river like the Crocodile River then they should not be reporting on such issues . It is a disgrace that someone with a parks background can make such a ridiculous comment . - the height of a lodge has very little to do with its impact on the environment , um , what about water use , removal of natural vegetation , waste management , height .... really .... ? ? <p> 2 ) The use of " us " and " them " and stating peoples opinions without a study ! How do you know that the majority of people want A rather than B if no one has done a comprehensive study to find out ? ? An example of a them/us , statement with no backing : " They are equally uncomfortable at the introduction of a predominantly black management at Kruger Park and other national parks . " - so all families who have been going to KNP for years and are opposed to more development have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do with the environmental impacts but the race of the people making the decisions ? ? What a pathetic assumption ! <p> I am a scientist so when it comes to large scale decision making , like development in a national park , one of our countries most important conservation areas , I want facts . If you have done a PLA study with the surrounding community and the results indicate that they feel that the reason that they do not visit KNP is because the current lodges are too rustic , then so be it . If you have done a study on the wants and needs of international visitors and the results indicate that there is a significant gap in the market which warrents an " inbetween style " lodge , fine ! If the environmental impact assessment , done by a independent source , indicates that there will not be a significant impact on a ) water quantity , b ) water quality , c ) endagered or threatened species ( like the Pel 's Fishing Owl ) , d ) biodiversity due to new roads and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the new camp . But do n't start making ridiculous statements if you do n't have the figures to back them up , these kinds of assumptions are turning something which should be a clean cut scientific and management decision into a nasty and unnecessary racial disaster ! <p> National parks have to pay for themselves Regardless of what has been written in this or any newspaper ( they have to sell their " stock " ) I fail to see why there is such an outcry over these two developments . When those other Luxury lodges were developed ( very few RSA citizens can afford them ) I can not remember this level of debate and acrimony . If these developments ensure that the Kruger stays affordable to South African Nature Lovers then it is a good thing

It 's not just the landscape , which is typical Sandveld , with low bossies and restios that add to the sense of remoteness I love so much . It 's also the historical legacy , for eight generations of the Melck family have farmed here since 1770 , and have added to and maintained the Kersefontein manor house and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ era . <p> The farm 's gabled manor is in pristine condition and reflects the growth of the family over the past two centuries -- full of character and filled with antiques . A dirt road runs past the homestead , lined on either side by historical outbuildings -- stables for the racehorses that were once kept here -- but now modified for accommodation . Guests ' children squealed in protest when mom and dad packed up to return to the city on Sunday morning , cries of " I do n't want to go ! " ringing out over the misty fields . <p> Here prize Herefords graze verdant , oxalis-studded grass . Geese have the run of the yard , eyeing visitors with somewhat dubious sentiment as they waddle along . Feral pigs root about , a somewhat unusual sight . These are not your average pink piggy-wigs you 'd expect in the farm yard , and resemble more the wild boar of Asterix and Obelix fame , complete with tusks . <p> Melck explains that he has habituated the feral pigs by putting down feed for them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feature on the Kersefontein menu . On both occasions I 've visited , we 've driven into mist , which renders an ethereal landscape that slowly reveals its secrets , be it a distant grain silo or skeletal trees reaching out with their dead limbs . But it 's the sheer tranquillity of Kersefontein that is the main attraction , and the fact that this can be found in under two hours ' drive from Cape Town . <p> Obviously during flower season , Kersefontein sees a lot of visitors , but in my mind it 's the promise of a mid-week retreat to get away from the madness that would draw me here all year round . And while there is fantastic cellphone reception , none of the rooms have televisions to act as flickering blue nannies . Children have the run of the farm while adults can kick back and relax with a good book and a glass of wine . " The only thing I tell parents is that all animals bite and kick , " Julian tells me . For children , who probably do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have a generation or so ago , I can see where the attraction lies . <p> There is space to run -- and really run -- all over the 6 000- hectare property . Julian also remarks on how the farm children make firm friends with the visitors ' youngsters , often taking them on exploratory jaunts into the veld . What more could parents ask for , really ? Apart from just getting away from it all , Kersefontein offers numerous attractions . <p> Avid twitchers will have more than enough species to tick off on their lists . Some wildlife can be spotted , from shy duikers and grysbok , to springbok and porcupine and , if you 're lucky , porcupine , caracal or bat-eared fox . Walks into the veld should also appeal and , with prior arrangement , supervised horseback riding is an option that occasionally results in impromptu cattle drives .

For those wanting a conference away from the city , the breakfast room can be converted and offers a cosy space for a bosberaad . <p> The farm itself is often in high demand with film crews but by equal measure is often a preferred destination for private individuals looking for a midweek breakaway . The work is still ongoing at Kersefontein . <p> Melck intends to convert an old outbuilding into a chapel -- complete with an organ . His great love for this instrument and music has led him all over the country to many small towns in order to perform or just sample particular sounds .

This season we decided to use the same design for both the home and away jerseys , " says Kevin Jooste , the football category manager at Adidas South Africa . <p> Bucs ' marketing director Nkosana Khoza was also on hand to express the club 's delight at the new kit . <p> " Orlando Pirates has a great tradition of pushing the envelope in jersey design and I believe we have done that yet again this year . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Orlando Pirates faithful will embrace the new jersey and wear it with pride , " he said . <p> According to Jooste , there are three key features that make the new Orlando Pirates jersey unique . <p> " There is the collar detail using hidden buttons and the Orlando Pirates wording print on the back . More importantly , the base layer material used is lighter than the fabric used on previous jerseys and the jersey design is completed with contrast three-stripe stitching as well as skull and crossbones embossing on the back -- which brings out the finer detail , " says Jooste . <p> Climacool works by considering how and where the body produces heat and sweat , focussing on specific fabric and garment features in those zones . The effect is that athletes stay dry , comfortable and perform at their peak in even the most heated competitions . <p> The replica jersey -- which is locally produced -- will retail at a recommended retail price of R599 and will be available in retail shops from today . <p> Can all of you Chibuku fans close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chansa will look in this ugly kit ? <p> Real Champ T'zozo <p> posted : 09:52 pm <p> THis kit reminds me of workers of a certain funeral undertaker in Limpopo ..

The side intakes are lower down , making the car look like it 's hugging the road , and the lines follow through under the headlight to meld into the sides . <p> New headlight clusters and bonnet also emphasise the centre V of the front treatment , while the bonnet , front wings and door modules are now aluminium to reduce weight . <p> At the rear , the light-catching contours of the rear bumper slope up towards the outside , to emphasise the width of the body and flow into the sides , and each tail-light unit now has a continuous covering lens with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the red upper and lower light bands . <p> Inside , there 's an all-new dashboard , with more finely detailed control elements and a stepped extension to the instrument cluster to accommodate the central display .

The 1.6 matches the 92kW output of the 1.8 it replaces , only falling slightly short on torque at 159Nm , and the 2.0 's power is up from 107kW to 125kW ( torque increasing from 185Nm to 202Nm ) largely thanks to direct fuel injection .

@@4237232 <h> The little airport that 's going nowhere <p> There has been a temporary reprieve for Durban 's Virginia Airport , with city officials this week confirming that leases at the city 's only general aviation facility will be extended . <p> And while airport operators welcomed the news , they were desperate for a long-term decision to be taken about their futures . <p> Lease agreements were due over the course of next year -- by August at the latest -- and there was talk at one stage that the airport might be closed down . But this no longer seems to be on the cards and the airport looks set to stay . <p> Head of the eThekwini Municipality economic development unit , Shunnen Tulsiram , confirmed this week that it " is not in anybody 's interest " for the leases not to be extended . <p> However , he said a long-term decision was still pending . <p> Daryl Mann , managing director of Comair Natal , lashed out at the city , saying it was " ridiculous " that operators still had n't been told what was happening with the airport . <p> " We were led to believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be told what our future would be . That time has come and gone . We need to know today -- yesterday , in fact -- what is happening . We have been trying to get answers for months . <p> " Being told six months before the lease expires just is n't good enough . Business is bad without having this grey cloud hanging over our heads . " <p> Part of the frustration is that the matter has been under discussion since 2007 . Four years ago , on July 19 , the city 's economic planning and development committee was given a report from Tulsiram 's team on the future of Virginia . <p> In that report , six options for the airport were considered , namely : <p> l The airport remain as it is . <p> l It remains as it is with an extended runway . <p> l It moves to King Shaka International Airport . <p> l It moves to the Durban International Airport site after King Shaka International 's opening . <p> l It moves to a new facility at Cato Ridge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aviation airport in eThekwini . <p> In the report , the latter two options were emphatically ruled out because it was clear operators would not consider the move to Cato Ridge , nor would they consider closing the facility . Economically , closing the airport did not make sense , the report said . <p> It added that the move to King Shaka would be " difficult " because there was a lot of competition for space there . <p> The possibility of extending the runway was also taken off the cards because the R7.5 million required for that was " not viable " compared to its economic benefit . <p> Given the plans around the development of the Durban International site and its conversion to a dug-out port , the idea of moving general aviation operations there was also not considered . <p> This left keeping the facility as it is as the best option -- and this is the option that will be presented to councillors in the next few months . <p> " Over the past few months the city has been reviewing the ... 2007 report @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regard to Virginia Airport . <p> " This is due for discussion within the city in July and it is intended that the matter will be brought before the economic development and planning committee by September at the latest , " Tulsiram said . <p> One thing that was clear , he said , was that the city needed a general aviation facility . <p> " Fundamental to the future of the airport is the understanding that general aviation is considered to play an important economic role within the city and supports the role that the city is playing as an important logistics centre for the country and in Africa . In principle , the council did endorse that general aviation should remain in eThekwini . <p> " It is also acknowledged that due to the significant capital investments in these businesses , it 's not in anybody 's interest to not renew leases in 2012 . The question is more around the period of extension and what the long-term plan is , " he said . <p> Aviation companies welcomed the announcement . <p> Virginia Flight School CEO Sheralee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time for us ; it 's been tumultuous for some time . This is good news and it 's positive for the growth that we need . It 's a pity , though , that it 's not a long-term decision . We want that decision made as soon as possible . " <p> East Coast Airways owner John Dyer expressed similar sentiments . <p> " We welcome the news , but we all want long-term leases . There are companies that have invested a lot in this airport and they need to know what 's happening over the long term . This is not just about the companies that operate here ; it 's about the additional business Virginia brings to the city . <p> " Cities need general aviation airports and Durban needs Virginia Airport . It is perfectly positioned for a businessman to fly into Durban , do his business in town and then get back to his charter flight or private aircraft and head home . There is no other space for Virginia Airport , " he said . - Sunday Tribune @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @

@@4237234 <h> Skullcandy Aviators : classy cans <p> Skullcandy has traditionally prized fashion over function with its headphones , but with the Aviator range of cans , the company is hoping to prove its mettle as a manufacturer of high-quality audio devices . We put a pair through its paces to see if they live up to their sizeable price tag . <p> The Aviator range is a collaborative effort between Skullcandy and hip-hop mogul Jay-Z 's Roc Nation . With the decline of record sales , musicians are increasingly looking to grow their revenues by lending their names to audio hardware , seen by many as the last of the music industry 's untapped frontiers . <p> Skullcandy pioneered the trend with its Snoop Dogg-endorsed Skullcrushers three years ago , though the most successful of these " collaborations " is Dr Dre 's Beats range of audiophile-friendly headphones that offer excellent performance , albeit for a hefty price . Beats have become the de facto headphones for hip-hop heads the world over , arguably as much because of their perceived coolness and easy recognisable design as their quality output . <p> Skullcandy Aviators come in white , black and brown-gold <p> Priced at around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than a pair of high-end Beats , but remains in the price range of offerings from the likes of Sennheiser , meaning they really have to offer excellent sound quality if they are to encourage audiophiles to buy them instead of competitors ' offerings . <p> Thankfully , the Aviators do sound good . However , they do n't handle bass as well as some of their competitors , which might pose a problem for hip-hop and dance music fans , but is less of a problem if they 're primarily going to be used for folk , rock , pop and light electronic music . <p> For the casual user looking for good-looking cans with above-average performance , the Aviators are ideal . But serious audiophiles will find the high-end wanting in the detail department , and the low-end lacking clout . That is perhaps the biggest problem with the Aviators -- they 're a little too expensive given the wealth of options in the same price range . <p> Another potential problem with the Aviators is their lack of ambient noise cancellation . <p> Nevertheless , there 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looks , they include some handy additions . Firstly , the nylon-clad cord is less liable to tangling than the conventional rubberised variety , although at only 1,3m it 's no good for watching TV from across the room . Secondly , Skullcandy has realised that many people now use headphones to listen to music on a cellular phone , and made appropriate design decisions accordingly . <p> About 15cm beneath the left ear cup Skullcandy has included an in-line remote control with volume controls and a centre button that can be used to play or pause music with a single click , skip forward a track with a double-click , and skip back a track with a triple-click . Moreover , it can also be used to answer and end calls as the remote also includes a microphone . <p> Like most Skullcandy over-the-ear headphones , the Aviators are very comfortable , whether they 're over your ears or slung around your neck . Clearly , much of the cost of making each pair has gone the styling with their suede-lined headband , faux leather ear cups , stainless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cord complete with a gold-plated 3,5mm plug . <p> The name of this particular range stems from the egg-shaped ear cups that Skullcandy says were inspired by the iconic glasses of the same name . The Aviators are certainly some of the most discreetly styled headphones we 've seen from Skullcandy -- thankfully , they 're devoid of the garish colours and oversized logos that normally adorn the brand 's products . <p> Another area in which Skullcandy shines is packaging . Each pair of Aviators comes in a transparent , tube-like container with a matching soft-lined leather travel case and microfibre cleaning cloth for removing fingerprints from the high-gloss bodywork . <p> As a first serious foray into the world of high-end audio , Skullcandy have done admirably in terms of design and features .

Dim motorists who dutifully drove their cars into rivers because they did n't have the gumption to take the instructions with a pinch of salt . <p> If you 're wondering , women are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , according to a survey published recently by Swinton Insurance - although it 's not clear whether that makes them more susceptible to extreme " prat-nav " error . <p> Overall , though , satnav has been an overwhelming plus for drivers - and it 's constantly been getting better . As recently as 2005 , car manufacturers such as BMW were still charging more than R11 500 for factory-fitted units that did n't even have a map display , but relied instead on arrow prompts and voice instructions . <p> Owners of expensive cars sometimes found they had to make a choice between using their satnav or listening to their favourite music , because their dash-mounted DVD drives could handle either a music CD or a disc containing navigation data , but not both at the same time . <p> Some of the clunkier built-in systems were rapidly swept away as satnav specialists such as TomTom , Garmin and Navman piled in with devices that cost a fraction of the price , for those who do n't mind sucker marks sullying their windscreens and cables cluttering dashboards . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so for a few years , satnavs sold in huge numbers as every feature imaginable was added in order to fuel demand . Bluetooth and the ability to play MP3 files , live updates of traffic conditions and " points of interest " databases allowing you to find , say , your nearest supermarket or restaurant , were just a few examples . <p> Then market saturation and a weakening economy finally brought an end to the party . In the first quarter of 2009 , TomTom sold 29 percent fewer units than it had in the first three months of 2008 , a stunning reversal when set against the strong growth that had preceded it . <p> But it was n't just the market that turned against the specialised satnav makers - it was technology as well . It 's no coincidence that satnav burst onto the scene at about the same time as affordable mobile phones and the web . All were helped by common factors such as the advent of cheap computing power and the opening up to the civilian market of technology that had previously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several years computers , satnavs and cellphones lived separate lives - but then things started to change . First the dividing line between cellphones and internet-based computing blurred with smartphones . Then the boundaries between satnav and the rest started to crumble , a development that posed a challenge for the navigation companies . <p> Mobile handsets already contained a lot of computing power and location technology , so navigation aids were an obvious add-on . Take the cellphone makers ' huge economies of scale and experience of designing desirable consumer electronics products as well , and you have a potent threat to TomTom and the rest . <p> The navigation companies have tried to blunt that threat by themselves offering to provide the relevant technology on mobile handsets . Go to Apple 's App Store and you can download iPhone apps from Garmin , TomTom or Navigon providing nationwide coverage for R450-R550 , prices that compare favourably with even the cheapest stand-alone satnavs . <p> The bigger threat though , is from cheaper or free alternatives such as Google Maps Navigation for Android-based devices - although the cost of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ area , too . <p> That leaves customers with a wide of choice of excellent navigation options - built-in systems , stand-alone aftermarket devices and phone-based solutions - all at much lower prices than the less capable equivalents of a few years ago . <p> And we 're not finished yet ; car manufacturers and satnav makers are finally getting together to combine the best features of easy-to-use but expensive and inflexible built-in satnav and the cheap , feature-rich but untidy , cable-trailing aftermarket units . <p> The solution lies in well-designed dash-top brackets that allow drivers to use standard units without windscreen suckers and unsightly cables - Seat and Renault have led the way here . Mercedes has gone a step further by providing for Becker Traffic Pro sat-navs , which are considerably cheaper than the company 's own full-blown in-built systems , to use its cars ' large in-dash displays to show navigation maps . <p> But , good as today 's systems are , there 's the prospect of something very much better . What if the satnav of the future , instead of directing you from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buildings and natural landmarks you see along the way , identify the wild flowers on the roadside verges , or recommend the best restaurants you will pass between midday and 2pm , so that you know where to stop for lunch ? <p> If the technology that 's already starting to go into our cars - location technology , computing power , internet access and so on - can be combined in a sensible way , it 's all within our grasp . - The Independent

@@4374232 <h> How the ANC lost its cause <h> AS THE ANC approaches 100 years of existence and , more significantly , 18 years of running the country , one question looms large : " Has the post-1994 ANC been delivering on its original mandates ? " <p> In answering this question let us move away from liberal and politically correct jargon . Let us rather understand why the ANC was founded and then explore whether the present ANC has delivered on its original mandate . <p> In 1911 the great Dr Pixley ka Seme gave one of the reasons for founding the South African Native National Congress or what is now the African National Congress . <p> He stated that Zulus , Tswanas , Xhosas and Sothos needed to " forget all the past differences among Africans and unite in one national organisation " . <p> This call to unite all African people under one umbrella was so that they could " re-attain " their political independence and economic wellbeing . <p> I use the term " re-attain " because the British and subsequently Afrikaner National Party had taught the African majority that they were a nonpeople without a history or system of governance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as Sol Plaatje and John Langalibalele Dube . <p> The ANC was thus created for the Africans to begin to see themselves as having a shared destiny beyond ethnic ties and to unite for a larger goal - the return of their land and their humanity . <p> One leader who encapsulated this early ANC vision was Dr AB Xuma , who revived a floundering ANC in the 1940s . <p> Though much maligned he fully understood the ANC 's original mandate of 1912 , this much is evident in one of his greatest speeches that can be argued to stem from his understanding of the mandate of 1912 . <p> He stated : " We Africans have all the attributes of great people , but we do n't recognise our own potentialities and we have not yet realised that our strength and even our salvation and freedom lie in ourselves . " <p> And , now ? <p> The African and black persons socioeconomic narrative is remarkably different in the year 2011 compared to the period of 1852 ( colonialism beginnings ) or 1948 ( introduction of apartheid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ANC , by utilising tools like RDP houses , grants , BBBEE has tried to undo some of the damage caused by colonialism and apartheid . However , when one judges it in accordance with its original mandate , the ANC is failing .

I managed to get a few photos before he scrambled off among the flowers of the veld . <p> The park has now grown to 146 000ha , and every piece of land was offered to the organisation by farmers who have moved away from the area , realising the futility of intensive livestock grazing . <p> Now tourism is the main source of income @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> It seems as if nature has finally had its own way in the Tankwa Karoo .

@@4440231 <h> Peugeot SA <p> Working hard on shorter pit stops <p> Article 25 November , 2011 - 11:36 <p> Jeff Daniels looks at what Peugeot in South Africa is doing to change perceptions and win a greater share of the market . <p> In South Africa , the perception of all things French is positive but pricey . Think of such iconic representations of France as food , wine , perfume and fashion and nobody disputes their quality . It 's just that they are often thought of as being in a price bracket that is more gift than everyday commodity . <p> For brands such as Chanel and Dom P ? rignon , being considered aspirational is probably no bad thing ; but it 's not an image that sits too well when competing in the mass market for cars . <p> Such is the situation that the marketing , PR and sales , and dealer network teams at Peugeot South Africa are contending with . But having a clear and unambiguous target is not all bad . If the only thing that is holding the brand back is a perception of being expensive , then let 's prove to the nation that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ French cars are expensive actually comes not so much from the purchase price but from servicing costs ; and it has to be admitted that there was some truth in the perception . But despite not having a manufacturing base in the country -- which undoubtedly helps to keep down costs when locally made products can be sourced -- Peugeot is taking the challenge to be seen as competitive by the scruff of the neck . <p> There are a number of issues related to servicing costs , of which by far the most important are the charges themselves and the speed at which parts can be obtained . In the case of the latter , not only has Peugeot matched the market but it has taken a giant step ahead . <p> At the heart of the new improved servicing arrangements is the company 's Linbro Park parts warehouse , home to about R35 million of parts . Here is to be found the same sort of totally integrated storage , identification and picking system as is found in Peugeot France -- a system which allows for the rapid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in and around Gauteng can now get an unprecedented four deliveries of parts a day . Not only does this improve productivity at the dealership by reducing turnaround times and throughput ; but it puts a big smile on customers ' faces when they get their cars back from routine maintenance or repairs with minimal delay . <p> This happy state of affairs has been made possible by the strong working relationship Peugeot has built up with its delivery partner , UTI Distribution . By manning a ' satellite ' UTI office within the Linbro Park warehouse , the handover of spares to be rushed out to dealers is executed with minimal red tape and associated delays . <p> The performance is impressive . Dealers who get their order into Peugeot by 4pm will have a visit during the night and the parts on order will be put into a secure drop box so they are ready and waiting for the mechanics when they get to work the next morning . If they happen to miss the 4pm deadline , orders will be processed when the Peugeot parts warehouse office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the dealer will then receive the spares just a few hours later on the day 's first delivery run -- which means by 10 am . Time the order just right , and it is not inconceivable that dealers could receive a part within 90 minutes of placing an order . <p> Of course , not every replacement part will be held at Linbro Park all the time . But customers do n't need to feel stranded : Peugeot has made a commitment to provide owners with a loan vehicle if the local parts infrastructure is unable to provide certain items ( excluding service and maintenance parts , and also accessories ) , requiring them to be ordered directly from France . <p> The second weapon in the armoury might not be unique to Peugeot but by introducing fixed price servicing , it does help to negate the notion that Peugeot is pricey . For example , the Peugeot 206 ( the most popular vehicle in the line-up until the 207 replaced the 206 range ) is now backed by a fixed price service covering new oil and oil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engines ) and sump gasket . It also includes the inspection of all fluid levels plus a bumper-to-bumper safety check and a complementary car wash . <p> Naturally , by only installing genuine replacement parts in its already competitive price , Peugeot believes it is offering exceptional value for money . But there is also the side benefit of having a Peugeot-trained technician who can accurately assess the vehicle in other areas as well as having the necessary skills and equipment to carry out remedial work should it be necessary . <p> Purchasing something as expensive as a car involves lots of different strands of thought -- many practical but some purely emotional . For certain market segments , value is important but so is the right kind of image . French cars have always been considered stylish and racy , so demonstrating that capability on the track is a major part of the promotional mix . But unlike some mass market manufacturers , Peugeot has stayed well away from the bottomless pit that is Formula 1 and instead has gone for endurance races as a way of demonstrating performance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 12 Hours of Sebring and a one-two at the 1,000 kilometres of Spa Francorchamps , Peugeot came within 14 seconds of winning the most charismatic of them all -- the 24-hour Le Mans . Despite missing out on the top spot , Team Peugeot Total nevertheless made a huge impression on enthusiasts by having its three cars in second , third and fourth positions , thereby demonstrating beyond doubt the reliability of its machines . <p> The company 's profile has also been raised by a partnership with the Orlando Pirates that will see the Orlando Pirates make use of Peugeot 's array of vehicles . The line-up includes the Peugeot Boxer Panel Van , the Peugeot Boxer 19-Seater , the Peugeot Expert Tepee Leisure people carrier , the Peugeot 3008 crossover MPV and the Peugeot 308 Access . <p> " Orlando Pirates and Peugeot are two powerful brands renowned for being stylish yet resilient and reliable , " commented Dr Irvin Khoza , chairman of Orlando Pirates Football Club . " In Peugeot we have a partner whose roots are in the origins of style and imagery . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ director , added : " Peugeot South Africa is proud to be associated with the legendary Orlando Pirates . Both brands have a heritage of success , and attract a loyal supporter base . <p> " Peugeot is committed to the South African market , with an expanding range of latest-generation models offering local buyers the latest in automotive design , technology and safety . This sponsorship is just one of the ways the brand is reaching out to its SA customer base thanks to prominent exposure we will have at the club 's home ground , " he concluded . <p> In addition , the Orlando Pirates 2011/12 Player of the Year will drive Peugeot 's highly desirable RCZ sports coup ? -- an incentive that is sure to inspire the Orlando Pirates stars to new heights . <p> Peugeot SA also subscribes to the philosophy that trading in the country is not just about importing cars and creating a dealer network -- long term viability requires making a material contribution to society , it believes . <p> One of the schools Peugeot SA is assisting is Olievenhoutbos Primary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learners and teachers alike in terms of practical knowledge . This takes the form of creating and maintaining a permaculture school garden capable of providing healthy vegetables -- the theory being that the garden must become part of the school 's heartbeat , supplying its soup kitchen on a daily basis .

CEO Warren Hewitt explains to Gay Sutton how this has been achieved . <p> For most logistics companies operating in the retail sector , the economic downturn of last few years has been more than a little challenging . For Laser Logistics , this period has been one of transformation through an innovative two-pronged development strategy . Moving to a more aggressive expansion strategy , the company has been working to diversify its service offering and customer base . But the real differentiator has been to create seamless access to the capabilities of all operating divisions within the Laser Group , which has resulted in a much wider service offering and stimulated growth across all three businesses . <p> Headquartered in Cape Town , South Africa , Laser Logistics operates in a competitive market , providing warehousing and distribution services primarily for the middle to higher end market clients in the retail sector . With a network of warehouses located in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Cape Town , a new 20,000 square metre facility in Johannesburg and 2,500 square metres of space in Durban , and a fleet of more than 140 vehicles -- 65 of which are refrigerated -- the company counts many well-known household names among its clients including Bosch , AEG , Electrolux Floor Care , Kelvinator , Siemens and County Fair Foods . <p> " I 've been with the company for three years , " explains CEO Warren Hewitt , who has driven this remarkable change , " and when I first arrived it was noticeable that the industry here in South Africa seemed ' silo ' driven and was not leveraging off the specialised service offerings available . We quite quickly recognised a tremendous opportunity to cross-utilise the specialised services provided by the operating divisions within the Laser Group . " <p> The logic was impeccable . Most competitors in Laser 's marketplace were insular , dealing in specialised elements of logistics . " As a result , customers had to deal with four or five different companies to obtain the range of services they required . Our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a single point of contact and administration , yet maintain fulfilment visibility by bringing together the capabilities of all our specialised divisions within the group . And if we do n't have the required capabilities within the group then we will develop a subcontract network that can be accessed through a seamless interface . " <p> Alongside Laser Logistics , the group includes two other well established operating businesses . Express delivery and collection services company DPD Laser is by far the largest subsidiary in the group and accounts for some 70 per cent of group activity . This division represents a successful joint venture with La Poste ( the French Post Office ) utilising its leading European brand DPD , and incorporates two highly successful divisions that are already market leaders in their fields -- Dawn Wing and Time Freight . The second subsidiary within the group is international freight clearing and forwarding company GAC Laser International , which is 50 per cent owned by the Dubai-based ships agency company , Gulf Agency Company Ltd . If these capabilities are combined , the group could offer anything from world-class @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ export services . <p> " Integrating these services into a single offering has required substantial investments in IT across the group , and we have had complete group management backing for this , " says Hewitt . The investment began with a new group-wide warehouse management system , which is now operational . To complement this , the high level transport management system that had already been developed for Dawn Wing -- South Africa 's second largest courier delivery service -- is currently being rolled out across the group . " So rather than reinventing the wheel , we 're taking established best practice from within the group and incorporating it into all our divisions , " he explains . <p> " To complete the IT infrastructure we are currently implementing a high-powered ERP system across the group to overlay all the other IT applications , " he continues .

" To begin with , it was not easy to convince our sister companies of the opportunity this presents , " Hewitt says . " But as we 've evolved the concept , the buy-in has become easier and easier . And as that happens we will get more financial participation and expansion opportunities from their sides as well . " <p> Strategically , Laser is spearheading a strong marketing drive not only to take the full outsourced logistics service to existing but also to potential customers . With a marketplace keen to improve efficiency and reduce costs , the concept is being well received , and has already resulted in major contract wins . Hewitt was initially cautious about the speed at which this would happen , as outsourcing contracts are built on trust -- and relationship building at this level takes both time and dedication . However he expects Laser Logistics to play an increasingly important role in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the future , I certainly see significant opportunities for growth , " he comments . " In fact , we anticipate that within 12 to 24 months we will be , by a large margin , the biggest customer of our other divisions . " <p> To support this strategic expansion into full outsourced logistics , the company is up-skilling the workforce and bringing a higher level theoretical knowledge into the company through the recruitment of logistics graduates . As that knowledge flows through the organisation he believes it will complement and boost the existing skills and experience . " For me , the key differentiator in terms of performance , customer service and reliability is our drivers and crew , " he says . " They 're working in a tough environment , seldom getting thanks for being on time yet always getting negative comments if they 're not .

@@4440239 <h> Barrick Gold : Granny Smith <p> Barrick Gold 's Granny Smith mine in Western Australia has already been in operation for 21 years . General manager Julie Shuttleworth talks to Gay Sutton about the enormous potential for expansion . <p> Located on the western edge of Australia 's Great Victoria Desert , the Granny Smith Gold Mine is all that you would imagine an Australian mining community to be . Set in a hot and arid landscape of reddish brown soil and sparse scrub , it is roughly 950 kilometres inland from the state capital Perth , and 23 kilometres from the mining town of Laverton , a community that has grown up to support the mines of the region . The magic of the area is that for a few weeks every spring this semi-desert landscape bursts into stunning colour when the spring rains bring a variety of wild spring flowers into bloom . <p> Established some 21 years ago , Granny Smith is a mature mining facility that has produced over six million ounces of gold -- yet it has the potential to produce a great deal more . " We have mined a total of 12 open pits in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ underground , " explains general manager Julie Shuttleworth . " This underground deposit is very large , and we 're still expanding it both in width and at depth . " <p> The long term strategy for Granny Smith is to continue expanding the life of the mine through ongoing exploration -- both underground and above ground -- and ironically , this is being aided by the difficult global economic situation . Over the past five years gold prices have been rising continuously , so it has become economically viable for the company to revisit some of the old worked-out pits and examine the feasibility of extracting the lower lying ore that simply had n't been a viable proposition previously . <p> A new project to expand the old pits has entered the feasibility study stage , and if it proves viable it will extend the overall mine life of Granny Smith . Mining could begin in just two years and yield over one million ounces of gold . <p> Today , Granny Smith is owned and operated by the world 's largest gold mining company , Barrick Gold . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Granny Smith is part of the Australia Pacific unit and directly employs 350 staff . The mine also employs around 300 contractors for non-core services such as catering and accommodation management , and for highly specialised trades such as exploration drilling and shotcreting the mine walls for stability . <p> In common with most mining operations in Australia , the sheer isolation of the site means that staff work on a fly-in fly-out roster , working for eight days and then returning home for six days . The accommodation blocks at the mine include 760 bedrooms along with kitchen , dining , social and recreational facilities such as a bar , wireless internet , gym , squash courts , swimming pool and tennis courts . And the provision of these is essential to staff health and wellbeing . <p> " Even though you 'd think people would want to study geology and mining engineering , we have a big shortage of mining industry people here in Australia , " Shuttleworth says . " Our turnover rate is approximately 22 per cent , and that 's not unusual for Western @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company works hard to create a distinct Barrick identity for its workforce . Graduates take part in a professional development programme which includes ongoing training and the opportunity for secondment to other Barrick mines around the world . " One of our senior geologists is currently on secondment to a mine in Papua New Guinea , and has been there for six months . " <p> Staff are well cared for , and the usual health package not only covers employees but also their families and dependents . There are competitive financial rewards too . A superannuation scheme and two incentive schemes are in operation : a quarterly scheme for the majority of the workforce , and an annual bonus scheme for senior managers . <p> Shuttleworth and her colleagues do their part in promoting mining as a career . They regularly visit communities and colleges in Western Australia to encourage people to enter the industry . " I was in Perth yesterday giving a presentation to 300 women and hopefully inspiring them , " she says . " There are a lot of great career opportunities for women , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per cent women at site . " <p> From a gender balance perspective , Granny Smith is doing better than average with a female workforce of around 10 per cent . Shuttleworth is proud of the inclusive and positive attitude on-site . " This is not down to the fact I 'm the general manager : it was like that before I arrived , " she asserts . " In general I think there are a lot of good positive energies here at Granny Smith , because people can see a long-term future for the mine . " <p> The past history of the mine is already etched into the surrounding countryside in the form of 12 open pit mines , which are spread over a considerable area . The Granny Smith processing plant , tailings dam and 25 MW power generation facility , for example , lie close to the mine 's first open pit , but 16 kilometres from the underground mine site . Capable of treating 3.5 million tonnes of ore a year , the plant currently processes 1.2 million tonnes produced by the underground mine , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ utilise the plant to capacity . " In the future , though , when the open pit expansion goes ahead we will have sufficient ore at Granny Smith to fill our plant to capacity with our own ore . " <p> Understandably , safety is of paramount importance at Granny Smith , and one of the priorities of day-to-day mine management is to maintain safety performance at a high level and to retain the good track record . Management and supervisors have commitments to spend regular time in the field demonstrating visible felt leadership . The site has a strong group of safety representatives , a high standard of emergency response training and regularly competes in state emergency response competitions . An interesting initiative is that the site has teamed up with Perth-based Austin Engineering to develop and trial a robust and practical low profile tyre handler . Changing tyres on most underground mobile equipment is difficult due to space limitations in the wheel arches . The trials have been a success , other sites are very interested in the tyre handler and there is significant potential to reduce tyre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traction . <p> Meanwhile , Granny Smith aims to have a positive impact on the local area . Not only does the company support local children , communities and services such as the Flying Doctor and the fire and emergency services , it also works hard to protect the environment , even running a cattle station with 200 cattle and a stationmaster to maintain the equilibrium of the land . <p> All the usual routine monitoring and environmental compliance is performed , including compliance with the voluntary international cyanide code , but environmental concerns are not limited to those that may emanate from the mine . " We have an initiative underway at the moment to track , capture and dispose of feral cats , which have been damaging the native fauna , " Shuttleworth explains . And since the launch of the initiative , the monitoring programme has confirmed birds are returning to the village and wildlife is increasing in the area . The site also has an Energy Management Committee which is tasked with implementing projects to save five per cent of energy each year , through projects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and more efficient use of key electrical equipment . <p> For employees at Granny Smith , there is a great deal to look forward to . " We have the exploration budget , and we 're doing it step-by-step . Of course geologists will always get very excited , " Shuttleworth admits , " but our exploration shows mineralisation could extend our ore body for quite a long way -- so there 's certainly a great deal of potential here .

@@4440240 : KMC <p> Khnaiguiyah Mining Company ( KMC ) , a joint venture between United Arabian Mining Company and Alara Resources , is one of the most exciting projects in Saudi Arabia 's newly established mining industry . Chief operating officer Sohan Singh Rathore talks to Jane Alverca . <p> Saudi Arabia may be best known for its oil and petrochemical industries , but the Arabian Shield in Saudi Arabia is one of the richest geological territories in the world . It is a vast treasure chest containing gold , silver , copper , zinc , chromium , titanium , nickel and iron ore , often in unequalled concentrations and grades . Moreover , exploitation of these resources has barely begun . <p> Not until 2004 did the Saudi government give permission for private investors to begin mapping and extracting the country 's mineral wealth . In the same year , the United Arabian Mining Company ( Manajem ) was formed to act as the lead developer of a new mining sector within the country . To date , Manajem has obtained 10 licences which are typically developed through joint ventures with established mining experts . <p> One of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a 30-year mining licence issued by the Ministry of Petroleum and Minerals Resources to explore develop and exploit the most extensive zinc and copper deposits yet discovered in the Arabian Shield -- a project known as Al Khnaiguiyah . <p> This task has been entrusted to Khnaiguiyah Mining Company ( KMC ) . It is a joint venture company registered in Saudi Arabia and held on a 50/50 basis by Alara Resources Limited and Manajem . Alara is a publicly listed company in Australia with global interests and was chosen as a partner for its technical expertise and financial strength . <p> " We believe this project will yield 1.5 million tonnes per annum of zinc-copper ore when the mine comes into full production , " states Sohan Singh Rathore , chief operating officer of KMC . " There are bigger projects than Khnaiguiyah globally , but these are the first combined zinc and copper mines in Saudi Arabia and a landmark project in the emerging mining industry . " <p> Work on the definitive feasibility study is being managed by the Australian firm Ausenco Minerals and Metals -- the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DFS results should be ready for release in March 2012 . A 5,000 metre , 40 drill hole programme began earlier in Q2 this year to re-validate the historical knowledge already held on the mineral inventory . <p> A survey completed almost 20 years ago by BRGM , the French Office of Geological and Mining Research , showed in-place minable reserves of 10.23 million tonnes containing 7.46 per cent zinc and 0.80 per cent copper ( source : BRGM Geoscientists 1993 , Khnaiguiyah Zinc-Copper deposit -- prefeasibility study 1 , 2 and 3 , Saudi Arabian Directorate General of Minerals Resources Technical Report BRGM TR 13-4 , 651p , 209 figs , 171 tables , 78 appendices and 23 photo plates ) . Earlier surveys also showed the presence of gold and silver , but subsequent exploration has proved that these traces are too small to make commercial extraction worthwhile -- so the focus is on zinc and copper . <p> Exploration to the south-east of the major mineralised Zone 3 of the project has already extended the mineralisation beyond historically outlined parameters and has found an exceptionally high thickness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just 45 to 50 metres below the surface . Geological mapping of major mineralised Zone 2 , which lies approximately one kilometre from the main area has indicated that the mineralisation there extends by at least 600 metres further to the north than was originally known before it disappears beneath recent sediments . <p> The biggest challenge facing Rathore in completing the definitive feasibility study and then bringing the mine to production is obtaining permits for the use of land and water . " As everyone knows , water is a scarce and highly valued resource in Saudi Arabia , but we are very lucky to have the Saq Sand Stone aquifer within 25 kilometres which will give us sufficient water by digging wells in adjacent land . Getting the permission to draw water is time-consuming , but we do not believe this will ultimately be a barrier , " he comments . <p> Infrastructure is not a problem as the mine is located next to the Riyadh -- Makkah main highway . Fuel is extremely cheap , costing just 15 cents per litre , meaning that the cost of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very low . Beneficiation will take place on site and there are no plans for additional smelting facilities at the moment . <p> However , the availability of skilled labour is an issue , particularly as Saudi Arabia has no significant mining heritage of the type to draw upon . " The mining operation will require highly skilled manpower and our thinking at the moment is that we will probably outsource this operation . The other area where we will need skilled labour , although to a lesser extent , is in the beneficiation plant , " he says , adding that KMC will simultaneously use this initial phase of the mine 's life as an opportunity to train indigenous talent with a view to making much wider use of local labour in the long-term . <p> Funding is unlikely to be an issue and Rathore expects it to be in place by June or July of 2012 . " During extraction , we anticipate certain technical challenges , but these are not new to mining and we already have the technical solutions available . It will be a traditional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ geological disturbances causing numerous fault and joint planes but also silicification and thus hardening of the host rock . There are zones of weak and friable rock . This means we will be paying special attention to the design of bench slopes and the safety of personnel working in the area . " <p> With the Khnaiguiyah project progressing according to expectations , Rathore will turn his attention to the Marjan Project , another joint venture with Alara . This consists of three other smaller projects spanning an area of 260 square kilometres in the same locality which are currently in the exploratory pipeline . He sees great future potential for economies of scale as these will be able to make use of existing beneficiation facilities at Khnaiguiyah . <p> " In the longer term , we are delighted to be contributing to the establishment of a new industrial sector which will help to diversify the Saudi Arabian economy . The establishment of a new metals industry will generate new revenues for the government in taxes and royalties and also create many employment opportunities for the people of Saudi Arabia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you might like <p> When the Canadian/Australian minerals company Equinox Minerals Limited ventured into Saudi Arabia , it knew little about the region .

Rev. Zondi certainly is a capable leader whom I have been mentoring for years . He is not the only one I have mentored , but somehow he caught the eye of the media pundits . <p> For 32 years , almost since Inkatha 's inception , Rev. Zondi has served our Party . Today , he sits in the hot seat as our Secretary-General and National Spokesperson . Over the years , we have entrusted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His character is such that he brings a serene atmosphere to discussions , no matter how controversial . <p> Through his position in the IFP , Rev.

He served in Cabinet as Deputy Minister of Public Works , and continues to serve in our national Parliament , where his wisdom and sense of justice benefit both portfolio committees and the National Assembly . <p> His contribution to the IFP , and to our country , has been outstanding , and has often been performed in very trying circumstances . When our Party endured the ructions caused by our former National Chairperson , Rev. Zondi did not shy away from making his position known . He announced then that he would not stand for the Presidency of the IFP at our next elective conference . <p> He did this to clear the waters that were intentionally being muddied by our opponents , who were determined to portray the ructions as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Zondi .

Unfortunately , our country has a legacy of removing leaders through violence , intimidation and assassination . When the ANC became embroiled in the Cold War dynamics , weapons and money were channeled to young ANC leaders to topple established community leaders in South Africa , in order to secure political hegemony . <p> It is therefore not surprising that Rev.

For those within our Party , there is nothing to gain by targeting him now . The only logical conclusion is that this agenda arises from outside the IFP . <p> When Rev. Zondi first informed me that he would not make himself available to stand for any position at our next Conference , I received the news with great sadness .

It is not comfortable or comforting . It gives one sleepless nights and demands many difficult decisions .

I have also heard that the other aim is to aleniate me from both my family and my Church that once such stories have been published , they would find it too embarrassing to associate with me . <p> I have been told about some people in the Party who have approached certain characters in the media such as Mandla Zulu who now reports for the Zulu Edition of the Sunday Times to write such stories about me . I have also heard that certain women in the Party have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individuals in the Party some with promises of money and promotion to better paying jobs if only they would agree to give statements to the media . <p> According to this information Mandla Zulu was asked to rehash even the story that was sometimes ago published by Nathi Oliphant of the Independent Newspapers about my alleged love affair with a certain colleague of mine who is married to somebody else . I was also told that Mr Zulu was asked to further spice it that , that colleague of mine is right now heavily pregnant with my child . <p> The plot was to have this article published last Sunday but for some reasons it was not and it may yet be published in this coming Sunday 's Zulu edition of the Sunday Times or whenever just before my stepping down . <p> I confronted Mandla Zulu about the story he was asked to write about me .

I said I did not know except that I suspected that as we draw closer to the elective Conference some people may be tempted to throw mud at those they think might be their competitors as they jostle for positions . <p> I said that I did not know why even this could be the case when it came to me as I had made it very clear to all structures of the Party that I was not interested to stand for any position at the elective Conference .

I have been made to understand that these plans would be carried out if for whatever reasons the Sunday Times or any other newspaper is unable to publish the fabricated story it was commissioned to publish . <p> I have candidly shared with the leadership of the Party the reasons of my decision not to avail myself for any positions at the next elective Conference of the Party .
