@@50322236 <h> What to look forward to in 2019 <p> Last year on 1st January , I published " What to look forward to in 2018 " . I listed a couple of things including : cheaper , more powerful smartphones , under-the-display fingerprint scanners , and cheaper data prices . <p> We saw the data wars last year that gave us really cheap bundles , we saw OnePlus , Vivo , Huawei give us under-the-display scanners , and we saw cheaper , more powerful smartphones with exciting features , at exciting prices ( think Poco F1 ) . <p> I listed a couple of other things that did n't really happen : Google 's Project Treble for instance did n't really stand out as I 'd hoped , and nothing really exciting happened with the e-commerce space in Kenya . <p> The big movies I was looking forward to did n't disappoint . Both Black Panther , and Avengers : Infinity War received remarkable reviews and were tremendous successes . Black Panther made $ 1 Billion in 26 days while Infinity War did the same in 11 days . They were the biggest releases of 2018 . <p> So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's article -- I would like to write about some stuff I am excited for in 2019 . <h> VoLTE in Kenya <p> Faiba4G in 2018 was my main internet provider . Obviously because of their very cheap data prices . Though many handsets did n't support the network at launch , with a couple supporting data only , slowly we saw companies launch devices that supported Faiba VoLTE , the most exciting offer being TECNO Camon 11 that costs 14k . <p> In 2019 , I am looking forward to more companies joining the VoLTE race . I do n't know if this will happen , but since all current providers , Airtel included , have 4G networks , I hope this will be the case . Also , remember BusinessDaily.com reported , in March of 2018 , that there are 10 companies who launched bids for 4G licenses . <p> I do n't expect we 'll see much of 5G in Kenya as yet . 5G requires so much with very little gains , it is practically still a waste of resources for local companies . <h> Xiaomi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ locally still do n't know this " weirdly " named company . Away from our online bubble , that 's the reply I get whenever I recommend their devices . But 2019 will change that if the company gets serious . They have so many products that the Kenyan market only needs a little pushing to buy . From their smartphones , to their laptops , TVs etc . If they fail to eat up a large market share this year , that 's because they wo n't have tried hard enough . <h> Computational Photography <p> This year , the smartphone camera will further push the limits of what these tiny lenses can do . The Pixel 3 despite having one lens has been able to do so much from Super Res Zoom , to the very very impressive -- almost magical -- Night Sight . <p> The good thing with tech is an idea grows and becomes better over time . Whatever Google has been doing will surely be emulated by other manufacturers who will test out more stuff with more lenses and with better implementation . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ photographers -- will see no need for huge cameras when smartphones can do the job . <h> Little Shuttle <p> Safaricom backed Little Cabs will be launching a bus service of sorts . The 33+ seater vehicles will the first of their kind in Kenya even as Uber plans on doing the same later on . From businessdaily.com , the cost of a normal ride will be higher than on a matatu as the company will be targeting people who normally get around by driving . <p> However this will work , I do n't have a clue . But it will be something to look forward to nonetheless . Will it help ease congestion ? How will people get on the bus ? How will it affect matatu businesses ? 2019 will bring the answers . <h> Messaging and Money : <p> In 2019 , Safaricom 's Bonga may finally go live . I am looking forward to see how Kenyans will receive it . Will it really take off ? Check out the linked article for more on that . <p> We may also see WhatsApp push Payments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet to see how successful it is in the Indian market where some people already have access to the new feature . <p> Linking your WhatsApp account to a bank account seems kind of cool in some way , but will it be possible locally ? Will banks be willing to get in ? And if this happens , how will M-Pesa be affected ? <h> Data Prices : <p> I do n't see data being more cheaper than 2018 . I feel like things will remain the same for a while . We 've already gone so low that for some companies , going lower would n't make sense as they probably wo n't make any profits . We will however see more ' offers ' . <p> Airtel Kenya will have a tougher year than ever -- I just feel it . They seem so clueless . Telkom Kenya on the other hand continues to build up their market share , and if they can find a spark of some sorts , they may have more of us on-board . <h> Notches : <p> Arghh . <h> Avengers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in cinema history . And we all ca n't wait . Disney is set to have their biggest year yet with so many movies being planned for the year . What I ca n't wait to see is how they roll out Disney+ and how it 'll affect Netflix and other similar platforms . <p> So , there you go . What are some things you 're looking forward to do , see or interact with in 2019 ? Share and let 's have a discussion . <p> By the way , what do you think Apple will call their next smartphone ? iPhone XI , or iPhone 11 ? iPhone XR 11 ? <h> 2 COMMENTS <p> Very good thoughts indeed . It is so hard to foretell in fact what these providers will bring , but looking into the general tech space , there 'll be surprise innovations for sure .

The common perception is that generic drugs are of inferior quality and decreased effectiveness compared to the original or brand-name medications . However , this is not so . In fact , in many countries , including developed countries , generic medicines are encouraged and widely used in their healthcare systems as part of promoting more cost-effective health care treatments . <p> The process of drug discovery and development is a complex and tedious process and takes over 15 years .

FILE PHOTO NMG <p> The current discussions between the Kenya Bureau of Standards ( Kebs ) and motor vehicle industry players on the contentious issue of age limit on imported second-hand vehicles is healthy , but should be handled with sobriety . <p> The business of used vehicles is a lucrative venture worldwide worth about $70 billion . In Africa , close to 45 million @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> According to UN Environment Africa Used Vehicle report of 2018 , the continent imports four times more automotive products than it exports .

Although most of the accidents may be attributed to human error , the big question is whether we are prepared in terms of capacity and infrastructure to handle the pressure of influx of vehicles . <p> On the other hand , imported used motor vehicle industry affords low-to-middle-income consumers the opportunity to purchase affordable vehicles since the cost of a new car is about four times higher than the average of imported used one and therefore prohibitive to these groups . <p> Any controls including using a prescribed age or an emission standard would effectively impose restrictions on the maximum age of vehicles entering the region , resulting in the potential for a higher average price of imported vehicles , reduced numbers of cars entering a country , increased value of those already in the market and longer lives for existing vehicles to offset reductions in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of imported used vehicles , the communities at greatest risk are the small and medium sized enterprises who have invested in this sector . <p> However , this must also be balanced with negative impacts of influx of used motor vehicles which include traffic congestion leading to a substantial loss of productivity in the economy , high fuel consumption , low air quality and safety issues .

Joseph took over in 2001 when Laurent was assassinated . If Tshisekedi 's victory is confirmed in the next 10 days by the constitutional court , he will become the first leader to take power at the ballot box since Prime Minister Patrice Lumumba , who was toppled in a coup less than three months after independence in 1960 and killed four months later .

He made no rejoinder , " writes Awori . <p> The former VP notes that Mr Moi had never encountered such political revolt in his presidency and must have known that there was no point in further discussion . <p> Ten years later , the victim of this development , Mr Kenyatta , was again a subject of discussion at State House under the Mwai Kibaki presidency . <p> ENDORSEMENT <p> Mr Kenyatta was summoned by the President who , through a team of strategists , including Mr Kibaki 's private secretary Nick Wanjohi , reportedly asked the then-Deputy Prime Minister to let go his presidential ambitions on two grounds . <p> He was told his presidency ( if he won ) would complicate Kenya 's relations with the international community considering he was facing charges at the International Criminal Court at the moment and that Kenyans were not receptive to the idea of another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Jomo ) and Kibaki . <p> Unlike Prof Saitoti and Mr Musyoka who exhibited open defiance , Mr Kenyatta left State House quietly promising to comply . <p> He even entered into a memorandum of understanding with fellow Deputy Prime Minister Musalia Mudavadi , with whom he had been advised to " back for presidency " as a presidential candidate of his coalition , alongside Mr Ruto . <p> REALIGNMENT <p> But a couple of days later , Mr Kenyatta quietly defied President Kibaki by bolting out of the deal with Mr Mudavadi , stating he had been misguided by " mashetani " ( devils ) . <p> Now the shoe is on the other foot and it is time for President Kenyatta to taste his own medicine . <p> Second term blues for sitting presidents are ordinarily aggravated by rebelling allies , keen on realigning themselves with incoming powerhouses .

Read this first.Things to consider when getting a tattoo ( Courtesy ) <p> Listen and listen very carefully . If you 're gon na get a tattoo , you better get it right the first time because it 's not only painful but also expensive and time consuming , to get it removed . I mean , tattoos are cool , for some people and for others , they 're a no no . I 'm all for people doing what they feel like cause life is too short , still , I always say , take your brain with you though ! That being said , before you get your first tattoo to look or appear cool or for whatever other reasons , please read these tips : <p> 1 . The very first step is to think it through ! <p> Think about the tattoo you want to get , take your time , think about the placement , where you want it to be , research if you must . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be embarrassed about in future . Will your parents , future spouse and kids approve ? If yes , then that 's fine . In fact , some people say that you should hang a picture of the tattoo you want to get on your bedroom wall and see if you get bored of it after a month and if you do , well , you might wan na rethink your decision to get that tattoo as you will wake up with it for the rest of your life . But hey , point is , take your time to think about the design you 're keen on . <p> Tattoo mistakes to avoid . <p> 2 . Research on the right tattoo artiste . <p> Now that you have figured out what tattoo to get and where you want it . You have to research on the right artist . Cheap is expensive . You do n't wan na go to a tattoo artist that will misspell a word or use tools that are not well disinfected or worse still , end up with a joke of a tattoo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see a friend with a really great tattoo , you could ask them where they got it done . Try and get an artist who specializes in the actual tattoo you want because different artists specialize in different tattoos . You could find an artiste that 's great at small detailed tattoos but not good at Japanese writings for instance . You could also check Instagram and social media and see their work before deciding on one artist . <p> 3 . Consult with the tattoo artiste and trust his professional opinion . <p> Now , it 's okay to go with the idea you have in mind , but it 's very important to hear their professional opinion . Reach out to the artist and hear if they want and are able to take on the project . If they advise you against the design or area , you might maybe wan na listen instead of insisting that you want what you want ... again , this is a professional and his opinion is very important . <p> Things to consider before getting tattooed ( Courtesy ) <p> 4 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a specific set of rules to take care of your tattoo . Getting a tattoo is only half of it , the other half is the post care . You do n't want your tattoo to scar , fade , or even heal badly . Listen to the specific after care of your artist because different styles of tattoos have different after care instructions . Do n't Google and do your own things . Simply follow what your artist told you . <p> 5 . Do n't get a tattoo while under the influence . <p> Sounds pretty basic right ? But you 'd be surprised at just how many people go to get tattooed while boozed up or high . This is discouraged because when under the influence of drugs or alcohol , your judgement is impaired and you 're not really thinking straight . Alcohol also thins your blood and this could cause your tattoo to bleed or heal badly . If you 're worried about the pain , you could take over the counter pills that help numb the pain . Or simply , just relax , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bring a friend ( one , not more as they could distract the artist ) to keep you company , or bring your earphones , enjoy some music or some Netflix . <p> That 's right . You need to eat a good meal beforehand as this will prevent you from getting light headed and passing out as well as give you strength and energy and this will in turn , help reduce the pain .

But does it really mean that once the law is passed , it will affect how society elects representatives to any public office ? Will it mean that in any social organisation where women make up more than two thirds , the other third should be left to men ? Will this create new unforeseen complications generally ? <p> Article 81 of the Constitution calls on the government to develop policies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elective or appointive bodies shall be of the same sex . It applies to both men and women . Article 81 ( b ) requires that " not more than two thirds " of members of elective and appointive public bodies shall be of the same gender . In this spirit what happens to bodies predominantly women-led like Maendeleo ya Wanawake ? What about public bodies very much dominated by men ? <p> At first , l laughed when popular radio presenter Maina Kageni joked that he would run for Nairobi woman representative in the 2017 general election . Now I wonder , if we implement the gender rule , will society be destroying the achievements of women in the last 30 years of demanding equal opportunities as men or will it strengthen affirmative action ? It will mean that women will not have a women 's only group nor will men a men 's only group without a good balance of either gender . <p> What are its implications in the Church ?

The average population density is 400 inhabitants per square kilometre . Immediately after the genocide , the population of Rwanda was estimated to be approximately 70 per cent female . Now , some 14 years later , over 56 per cent of the adult population is female . <p> Women heads of household comprise 34 per cent of the population and the country has an annual growth rate of 2.9 per cent .

It is estimated that between 400,000 and 500,000 children were fostered or adopted by households headed by women . <p> After the destructive genocide of 1994 Rwandese women in different leadership positions played critical roles in mobilising fellow women to live together and to find common solutions to their own problems and their country 's . For this reason it is fair and just that women representation should be higher than men . <p> Ethiopia has followed suit , though from a different lens , by picking women for key positions such as president and chief justice . But the key question is whether appointment by selection and competitiveness justifies gender equality in political leadership ? In some studies the question has not been about equality but equity . <p> People are not opposed to embracing gender law , but the insincerity of the political class and executive on the appointive posts for public office .

And the key to its success is that many have come to believe that even if you live an exemplary life of no smoking , very moderate drinking , and plenty of exercise , still you will somehow end up with all kinds of " toxins " in your body -- hence the urgent need to " detoxify " . <p> Well , in my opinion , there is only one really important process of detoxification required in this country , and I am glad to see that the process is well underway . By this , I mean that we have over the years come to have extremely toxic presidential elections . And if the work of the Building @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formerly implacable rival , former Prime Minister Raila Odinga , delivers on its promise , then we will hopefully detoxify the Kenyan presidency once and for all . <p> I suppose it was inevitable that Kenya would end up with such a toxic imperial presidency . The late Nobel Prize winning Trinidadian author , VS Naipaul wrote that " the commonest political ambition is to evict and supplant " those already in power . And so it proved to be in Kenya at the dawn of Independence . <p> Did we have the image of Queen Elizabeth on our currency before Independence ? Well , then of course we had to have the image of our new president on all our currency . Had various institutions been named after members of the British royal family ? Well , we then had to have Kenyatta National Hospital ; Kenyatta University and Jomo Kenyatta International Airport , not to mention Kenyatta primary and Kenyatta secondary schools all over the country , and Kenyatta Avenues in every major town . <p> Throughout recorded history , it has always been the case that having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nation 's affairs is but a recipe for dictatorship -- even if it be a heroic figure like Jomo Kenyatta who had struggled for decades in the cause of Kenya 's independence and suffered greatly at the hands of the colonial establishment . <p> No matter how noble that man may be , he will be swiftly surrounded by courtiers whose only objective is to flatter the president as a means of obtaining some lucrative favour from His Excellency . <p> In any event , the progress of a nation depends more on the creation of strong institutions -- ideally independent or quasi-independent institutions -- which can guarantee that the country will be governed by laws , rather than the arbitrary whims of men . <p> But that was never the case in Kenya : We learned very early after Independence the virtues of clientelism and that the path to obtaining any benefits from the state lay in " leading a delegation to pledge loyalty to the president " and thereafter more or less kneeling before the imperial president to beg for this favour or that . <p> Thus we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ persuaded to spare a generous word for either Jomo Kenyatta or his successor , our retired President Daniel Moi . They write of both men as betrayers of the expectations of ordinary Kenyans : Traitors who when in power , were obsessed with " primitive accumulation " and were profoundly indifferent to the widespread destitution within our borders . <p> I think a case can be made that both men were -- in fact -- victims of a highly toxic political system which gave them powers that would have corrupted just about any man . Powers that any politician who had once tasted them would thereafter ruthlessly fight to retain . <p> And this is the imperial presidential system that Uhuru and Raila are now out to detoxify . <p> Moi , for example , when he ascended to the presidency as Jomo Kenyatta 's long-serving Vice- President , was famous for his modesty and restraint . <p> He left the presidency 24 years later widely reviled as the living definition of the " African Big Man Syndrome " ; generally believed to be the richest man in all of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political detentions marking his final decade .

" He growled contemptuously , looking at my elbows protruding through the holes of my cotton jacket , the jacket worn especially to meet him . <p> I had difficulty in understanding his brash English but with the scowl on his face and not-too-gentle a tap on my knuckles , I surmised what he said and quickly complied . <p> NOMINATE <p> When the colonel finally came to the subject I had gone to see him about , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will nominate one of his loyal subjects to the reserved seat in Grant Medical College .

" <p> That meeting put pain to my plans to gain admission to GMC for I was not the donkey the colonel had in mind ; the Nawab had already nominated one of his henchmen 's son on the recommendation of the colonel . <p> But light shone at the end of the tunnel from another direction .

My father has a business here ; I have come to stay with him for a few months and since I was a student at this school , I am here to pay my respects to Dr Reddy , " I told him . <p> " Ah , " beamed the Goan gentleman .

I am frustrated and worried about the future . <p> Hi , <p> This is completely understandable , particularly if you are planning to have children . There are a couple of ways you can deal with this . <p> One , tell him how he spends his money is really worrying you , and you feel like he needs to get more serious before the babies come , or the babies should n't be coming . <p> Two , you can suggest a fund @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him some hospital print outs that show exactly how much having a baby costs . <p> Three , you can stop paying for the things that he should be helping you pay for .

Unlike women , men have a way of embracing their targets and ensuring they are met . They rarely get derailed . On this day , I appreciated the fact that they took their eyes off their goals for a moment so they could fix them on us . Men , you deserve a round of applause for celebrating women .

Fathers are hit left right and centre on the streets of social media and the hardest hit are the deadbeats ; there 's really nothing this lot does n't hear on such days . One might be mistaken to think its Men Bashing Day instead . <p> As much as some of these men hurt us , I would love to urge us women to stay focused when dealing with certain issues . We are always accused of dragging our emotions with us even to battles that need them not . Father 's Day is one of those battle grounds we should avoid when our mission is to bust these men . <p> Did you see how the men placed us all in one basket and celebrated us ? That 's what we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them into subgroups and bashing them .

You can bash him all you want , but could you please select another day for that ? Like his birthday ? Or just any other random day , it really does n't matter . <p> I know the current generation is full of disappointing fathers and heartbroken mothers . I am not saying women are angels -- all I am saying is that men know how to oversee our faults when it 's time to celebrate us .

You ca n't carry a hornbill into an eagles meeting and start venting about how much of a nuisance it is ! Wait for the hornbills meeting , carry it there and give it , not a piece , but the whole of your mind if you wish . <p> Let the love that filled the air on International Women 's Day be the same experienced on any day that men will be celebrated .

Celebrating someone does n't necessarily mean that you want to be with them . It only shows that you are proud of them for something they are or did . Life is too short to wake up throwing missiles every morning . After all , were we not created to coexist ? If Planet Earth suffocates you , just hold up a little bit as we find a way of evacuating you to another one . There 's a variety -- nine to be precise -- the choice is yours .

They found five shampoo bottles filled with cocaine . Chinese police arrested Nazrawit on drug trafficking charges , which carry severe penalties in China . <p> Abby told VOA the bottles did not belong to Nazrawit , and that her sister had agreed to bring them as a favor to a friend from elementary school who had planned to accompany Nazrawit . <p> When the friend 's father died shortly before the trip , she allegedly asked Nazrawit to bring the bottles on her behalf . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Abby . <p> Abby said what followed has been a nightmare for the family .

What we know and what we have heard is whatever happens will be based on Chinese laws , " Abby told VOA by phone in Amharic . " So our guess is that , based on Chinese laws , there is a possibility that she could be facing the death penalty . She is getting ready to appear in court . All of the family is counting every single second and is stressed . " <p> Under Chinese law , drug smuggling can result in punishments ranging from 15 years in prison to the death penalty . <p> In a March 26 statement in state-owned media , the Ethiopian Foreign Ministry said it was closely monitoring the situation and cautioned the public against jumping to conclusions , saying Nazrawit had not yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Human Rights Watch , said cases like Nazrawit 's can result in dire outcomes .

Despite claims that had a mental illness , Chinese authorities denied him a psychiatric evaluation , convicted him and executed him by lethal injection . <p> " The government does not really live up to international standards on fair trial rights and the death penalty , " Richardson said .

Estimates on how many people are executed annually range widely , from 1,000 to 10,000 , she said . <p> " We know they execute a lot . But we do n't know the quantities .

Budget smartphones are now coming with decent build quality , commendable performance , amazing cameras and ample screen resolutions . In this comparison review , I am going to put the Huawei Y6 Prime 2019 against the Tecno Spark 3 and parse which one packs more punch for its price . <h> Design <p> Both phones come with interesting designs . The Huawei Y6 Prime 2019 comes in a faux leather plastic panel at the back while the Tecno Spark 3 comes with a black back that has tiny green sparkles that shine under light . You can see it here .

The 720p screens on both have great viewing angles , especially under sunlight . You enjoy spending your time watching videos , scrolling through social media or just generally browsing the web . <p> Another thing the Huawei packs is HUAWEI Supersound to give you a relatively higher speaker volume and that 's an added advantage for enjoying multimedia content .

Each has its own quirks . <p> On the Huawei Y6 Prime 2019 , EMUI 9.0 has a lot of customisation features you can play around more than you can do on the Tecno Spark 3 . I 'm a huge fan of small fonts and sadly the Tecno Spark 3 does n't let you change the font or reduce it to your preference . <p> One weird thing , the Tecno Spark 3 does n't come with Digital Wellbeing feature Android Pie packs . Huawei has its own version of Digital Wellbeing which they call Digital Balance . <p> Other than that , you get a new multitasking menu where the recent apps are shown in a horizontal card format .

Both phones run Helio A22 processors with 2GB of RAM and 32GB of onboard storage with the option of adding external storage . In terms of performance , the Huawei Y6 Prime 2019 slugs when compared to the Tecno Spark 3 . Huawei had a hard time maintaining apps in the background . Recent apps had to reload when you went back to them . <p> If you are a huge multitasker , you 'll have to skip the Huawei Y6 Prime 2019 . The Tecno Spark 3 wins it for me performance-wise . <h> Camera <p> In the optics department , the Tecno Spark 3 packs dual 13MP and 2MP rear cameras and 8MP selfie shooter while the Huawei Y6 Prime 2019 rocks a single 13MP primary camera and an 8MP front-facing camera .

In Kisii , Waititu was categorical that Mt . Kenya will stand with Ruto . " We see Ruto not only as a leader but a hard worker . We do not just want leaders , who give stories . It is very unfortunate that a section of leaders is ready to do anything possible to prevent the Deputy President from becoming the president , " said Waititu . In Kakamega , Waititu said that no one should cheat Kenyans that Ruto will not receive support from Mt . Kenya region .

We are taking Raila as the angel now . Surely , who does not know the history of this man ? " he said . Other key protestors from Kiambu have included Gatundu South MP Moses Kuria , the parliamentary representative for Kenyattas and Kikuyu MP Kimani Ichunga . Some leaders have however , chosen to fence sit to watch over how the politics unfold before choosing , which side to openly support .

We promised in 2013 that we will support President Kenyatta for 10 years and Ruto for another 10 years . Our agreement still stands , " he said . The protest is replicated in many other counties across Mt . Kenya , based on observations and discussions within opinion leaders , raising questions of why Uhuru is not realising the effects of his political maneuvers , which may also slow realisation of his Big 4 Agenda .

Legacy at stake if the protests persist , and pro-Ruto leaders , most of whom are elected , succeed in swaying the public opinion , Uhuru 's political and economic legacy may be seriously dented , ending up being seen as a lame duck president . Uhuru is already facing serious perception issues in Mt . Kenya over his ability to steer the economy . It is that irony for a region whose political interests are driven by economic considerations , the president from the same region is being seen as sabotaging those same interests .

Strangely , however , while the prices of raw milk have dropped , those of processed milk have remained higher and rising , handing over a huge advantage to the processors , where Uhuru 's family has a controlling national market . Bungled process The increasingly , now bungled succession process , is also seen as Uhuru 's self-sabotage gamble because it has taken away some attention from the Big 4 Agenda .

@@50586238 <h> Opinion : The New A Series is Samsung Bowing to Chinese Phone Makers ' Pressure <p> By now , mobile phone enthusiasts who follow OEMs and their marketing tactics have noticed that Samsung has a new series of phones that have been splashed across media outlets for the last two or three days . Dubbed the new A series , the phones are budget devices for the most part but have offerings whose asking price punches above what your ordinary OEM can ask for . That aside , the announcement of the A was preceded by the axing of the J series of smart handhelds that the South Korean technology corporation has been selling to a budget demographic . The reasons for the discontinuation are as good as mine , but we can go over them in a couple of sentences . <p> The rise of Chinese phone makers <p> Samsung has grown its smartphone business tremendously . Back in the day when it dipped its toes in Android , the manufacturer was not the most original OEM owing to the design choices for the phones it churned out to a market that was transitioning from feature phones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ iPhones ) . At that time , Samsung , among other key players , realized that there was so much it could do to meet demands by taking an approach that deviated from what the likes of Apple were doing : make phones for every buyer out there -- high end , mid-tier , and budget . The high-end segment is , to date , being served by the S and Note series , whereas the mid-range and budget segments have evolved so much to even track their journey comprehensively . <p> The primary reason Samsung continues to change its playbook in terms of how it markets its not-a-flagship phones is , well ; it no longer is the only OEM that is making Android phones out here . Truth be told , Samsung took advantage of its popularity to charge a premium for phones that did not deserve a high price tag based on their offerings . It did so for so long to see the rise of Chinese phone makers that had one goal : offer exceptional devices at a low price and flip Samsung 's script -- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are several local examples to support this argument . Transsion Holdings , the Chinese company that owns TECNO , iTel , and Infinix , started its business in the Kenyan market more than a decade ago , although , at that time , it was mostly selling feature phones . By 2012 , Tecno , for instance , started manufacturing smartphones . While they were not compelling at that time , they managed to serve a market need that Samsung appeared to ignore . Transsion pushed its phones and to date , they have improved their hardware and software , receive intermittent updates , and offers several options for a KES 10,000-25,000 budget . <p> You can say the same thing about Infinix , OPPO , iTel , and Xiaomi , to mention a few . These companies understood what customers in developing nations needed , and offered just that . At the time they were growing , Samsung stuck to its guns by asking a little too much where the competition charged so much less . One would also argue that the Samsung brand was already too big to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expected , that hubris was accompanied with a high price : sales dropped for low-end phones amidst soaring growth for the mentioned Chinese competitors . <p> At one time , it appeared that Samsung was spinning its local business to selling the S and Note line of phones because the mid- and low-end segment did not command sufficient marketing that the former received . Of course , high-end phones rake in more profits , but let 's not forget that Kenyans , among other customers in developing economies can not afford those devices ( that continue to get dangerously expensive , but that is a story for another day ) . Thus , by blatantly ignoring the importance of a budget customer , Samsung lost its once glorified name in very short years . <p> Really , a young Kenyan who has just left high school and in need of a phone is not going to walk to a store and splash 20 thousand shillings for a Galaxy J7 when he or she can get a better deal for half the price . It is was a misstep that Samsung @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The launch of the new A Series <p> As mentioned , you will no longer see the J-series phones in store shelves . Their place will be taken by the A-series , whose new members include the A10 , A20 , A30 , A40 , 450 , A70 and A80 , most of which are already available locally . <p> The cheapest of the group the A10 starts at KES 12,000 . The rest of the pricing is as follows : <p> Perhaps the most appealing aspect of these devices is that they pack some pretty good specifications for their price : they all have great cameras , Super AMOLED screens ( that are so much better than their LCD rivals ) , sufficient storage and RAM , great designs with very minimal bezels and big batteries . They also ship with Android 9 Pie on top of the already excellent One UI in a market where some phones are launching with Android 8.1 Oreo . I mean , there is little to cry foul of with the new offerings -- and for the first time , buyers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sans being shortchanged by the manufacturer as it has been the case in the past . <p> While I have not played with any of these smart toys , I 'm confident their offerings are above par and will challenge their Chinese rivals . The A80 , for instance , has a cool revolving and sliding mechanism that flips its triple cameras for your selfie-needs and I can not wait to get hold of one . <p> Samsung knew it was not going to conquer its once excellent mid-range and low-end market by continuing to pull antiquated tactics that were no longer working . The market , while growing , has also matured . People know what they want in a phone because they are more informed . They understand the freedom of choice , and will unlikely pay more money for a device just because its brand name is solid . Those days are gone , and deep down , Samsung knew this , hence , the launch of the new , better and well-priced series of devices . <p> Will the new phones make a name for themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Samsung to make its way back to the drawing table to reestablish its dominance , at least in the Kenyan market .

The issue is that the US long ago warned that it would never allow the ICC to investigate or try any American soldier for war crimes . <p> Two years ago , Ms Bensouda requested the ICC judges to authorise an investigation .

No other countries have waged as many wars as the two in the recent past , and in such circumstances , self-interest is quite understandable . <p> The trouble is , no other country is willing to follow the dictates of the Rome Statute for similar reasons -- misplaced nationalism . <p> The ICC does not have its own army or police force , and it can only be effective with the compliance of member states . <p> HYPOCRISY <p> This is rarely forthcoming , which is why Sudan 's beleaguered Omar al-Bashir , an indicted war criminal , has been roaming the world without fear of being arrested and handed over to the ICC . <p> Of course , by the time this article is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think about , like saving his own life . <p> There is an element of hypocrisy in the whole issue .

@@50597230 <p> The fall of Sudanese dictator Omar Hassan al-Bashir should send a powerful message to all the leaders in Africa who think they have a divine right to brutalise their own people and to rule for life .

FILE PHOTO NMG <p> The recent move by the Central Bank of Kenya ( CBK ) to enforce its directive requiring banks and other financial institutions to report cash transactions has met with considerable opposition in financial , political and business circles . <p> The Banking Circular No 1 of 2016 ( Additional guidelines on Large Cash Transactions ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has even been accused in some circles of overstepping its mandate . <p> It requires banks to obtain certain information regarding cash transactions ( both deposits and withdrawals ) over $10,000 or Sh1 million , including beneficiary information , and the source of funds . <p> Under the Anti-money Laundering and Counter Financing of Terrorism ( AML/CFT ) law , the reporting of cash transactions is a key control in the detection and prevention of money laundering and terrorist financing activity and facilitates the determination of the legitimacy of the source of funds . Other controls are customer due diligence , transactions monitoring , suspicious activity reporting , sanctions screening to detect terrorist activity and record keeping . <p> Money laundering enables criminals to hide the proceeds generated from economic crimes or predicate offences , such as grand corruption in public office , embezzlement , drug trafficking , human trafficking , counterfeiting , and piracy . If undetected or unchecked , money laundering encourages the proliferation of such criminal activities , as well as terrorist financing . This is because criminals can easily access the proceeds of their crimes even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> According to statistics from the United Nations Office on Drugs and Organised Crime ( UNDOC ) , between $800 billion and $2 trillion is laundered per year , which translates to 2-5 per cent of global GDP . In Africa , the main predicate offences --which have led to billions of dollars being laundered each year -- are corruption , illicit wildlife trafficking , and drug trafficking . <p> Due to the far-reaching and negative impact of money laundering to the financial system and of terrorism globally , the offences of money laundering and terrorist financing have been criminalised through international protocols and guidelines such as the Financial Action Task Force ( FATF ) recommendations and UN conventions . <p> These have been replicated in national AML/CFT legislation across the globe and comprise various mandatory guidelines to prevent money laundering and terrorist financing with the key objective of ensuring that offenders are not allowed to derive a financial benefit from the proceeds of their crimes . <p> These guidelines and legislation recognise the central banks of each country as playing a critical role in the enforcement , since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this regard , the CBK has played a pivotal role in the implementation of AML/CFT compliance in Kenya , and in recent months this role has assumed critical importance , given the rampant grand corruption scandals involving public institutions such as the National Youth Service ( NYS ) and the National Cereals and Produce Board ( NCPB ) , and the National Hospital Insurance Fund ( NHIF ) , to name a few , in which billions of shillings have been lost . <p> Under the Proceeds of Crime and Antimoney Laundering Act 2009 ( POCAMLA ) and regulations issued thereunder , the CBK is designated as a supervisory body and has oversight authority over banks and other financial institutions referred to as Reporting Institutions ( RI 's ) to ensure they are compliant with the law . This includes a statutory obligation to report suspicious activity to the Financial Crime Reporting Centre ( FRC ) . Such suspicious activity would normally arise from transactions , including cash emanating from or dealings with RI 's subject to its supervision . <p> The CBK and other supervisory bodies listed in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Authority ( IRA ) , the Capital Markets Authority ( CMA ) and the Retirement Benefits Authority ( RBA ) , also have a statutory power to issue guidelines to RI 's on any matter regarding compliance , including setting maximum limits for cash transactions . <p> In exercise of this statutory power , various guidelines have been issued by the CBK , and the other bodies to enforce AML/CFT compliance by RI 's in the respective sectors . It is worthy of note , however , that even before the enactment of POCAMLA , the CBK , acting within its mandate under the CBK Act and the Banking Act , had proactively issued CBK Prudential guideline No 8 , which provides for compliance by banks and other financial service providers ( including micro finance institutions , forex bureaux , and electronic payments providers ) . <p> Following the enactment of the POCAMLA regulations , the CBK has since issued additional guidelines in fulfilment of its mandate ; dealing with suspicious transaction reporting , sanctions screening and risk assessment , amongst others . <p> The guidelines on large cash transactions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regulations for banks to report transactions over $10,000 . <p> From the foregoing , it is manifestly clear that the CBK has both a statutory and international obligation to enforce compliance with the AML Legislation . It does this through the provision of supervisory oversight over the operations of RI 's and through the issuing of relevant guidelines from time to time on various aspects of the Act . <p> This statutory obligation to issue such guidelines under POCAMLA is separate from the corresponding obligation under the CBK Act and the Banking Act and can not be fettered or diluted without impacting on the spirit of POCAMLA . It should also be noted that the enforcement provisions under the POCAMLA supersede those in other Acts dealing with criminal or predicate offences which generate financial proceeds such as drug trafficking , poaching , and corruption laws . <p> The primary and universal objective of AML law is to ensure that criminals can not access the proceeds of their crimes even after serving prison sentences for predicate offences under related criminal legislation . In this regard , the AML and related legislation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the provisions of the law covering surprise inspections , investigations and evidence taking , arrest and prosecution , tracing , seizure and confiscation of property and other proceeds of crime . <p> There is no need to prove the commission of an actual offence ; reasonable suspicion that an offence has been committed is enough . It is on this principle that the CBK guidelines relating to suspicious transaction and cash reporting are founded and accordingly any attempt to fetter the central bank 's statutory obligation in this regard must fail in the face of the law . <p> Additionally , given the commitment by the Executive to rein in corruption in public office and in light of the ongoing investigations and enforcement actions currently being undertaken by the law enforcement agencies to deal with suspects and preserve criminally acquired assets in cases such as the NYS scandal ; it is imperative that the CBK , as the primary financial services regulator , should be allowed to continue with its key task of ensuring the integrity of the financial system unhindered .

@@50637239 <p> Victor Majid has become the latest Kenyan to move to the Zambian Super League in the recently concluded mid-season transfer window . <p> His move to Prison Leopards could easily pass as an ordinary transfer of a Kenyan footballer to the ZSL . However , a closer look at this transfer tells a different story . <p> It does not tell the tale of a footballer heading for greener pastures like David Owino or Jesse Were who left Gor Mahia and Tusker respectively for Zambian giants Zesco United . Neither is it a case of a player seeking a different challenge like Duncan Otieno who left AFC Leopards in search of silverware at Nkana . <p> " Majid is a top player but the priority here is to help the club avoid relegation , " his agent Alukwe Mutanda was quoted as saying in sections of the media following the move . <p> Majid 's move lends credence to the fact that the Kenyan Premier League ( KPL ) is slowly losing its allure . That Majid , whose immediate former club Leopards is one of the best financed teams in the local topflight , fancied a move @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ volumes on how the quality of the KPL has plummeted in recent times . Kenya is no longer the dream destination for East African footballers and by extension top talents in Africa . <p> As recent as June 2014 , Sofapaka acquired the services of Fiston Abdulrazak . Gor Mahia had also roped in Ugandan duo of Godfrey Walusimbi and Godfrey Kizito January the same year . <p> A year later , K'Ogalo signed up Rwandese international Meddie Kagere and their nemesis Leopards snapped up Nigerian Austin Ikenna . All these players have since left and local clubs have continued to struggle to retain their best players . <p> Go-slows , unpaid salaries and bonuses have become the order of the day in Kenyan football . <p> Gone are the days when Kagere 's back-heel goal ( against Nakuru AllStars ) or Were 's hatrick of hatricks ( in 2015 ) could make headlines across the continent . But where did the rain start beating us ? <p> The current situation can be blamed on a raft of changes in composition and organisation of the top-tier football league since 2017 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stakeholders in the country would quickly want to forget . After riding on a wind of change , Nick Mwendwa took over the leadership of the Football Kenya Federation ( FKF ) in February 2016 . <p> He inherited a federation that had signed a Memorandum of Understanding ( MoU ) with the KPL over the composition of the league in September the previous year . Still new in office , FKF chose to shelve plans for expansion of the KPL until end of the 2016 campaign . <p> The tussle for control of the top-tier league began in late 2016 and continued into the new year , with FKF pushing for an 18-team league while KPL maintained that the number of teams should remain at 16 . <p> After a series of Joint Executive Committee ( JEC ) meetings , the infamous club licensing and court hearings , KPL bulged on the premise that FKF would cater for the additional costs of the expanded league as stipulated in the Sports Disputes Tribunal ( SDT ) ruling . <p> SuperSport withdrew in a huff <p> The development did not go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contract with KPL in April 2017 . <p> The South Africa-based pay TV company , in a statement , questioned the autonomy of the KPL in as far as management of the top-tier league was concerned and took off citing blatant breach of the improved five-year deal they had signed in 2014 . <p> " You warranted to us contractually , that KPL is the only body recognised by Fifa to run , administer , and be responsible for the administration of professional club football in Kenya , which warranty is directly contradicted by the relevant SDT ruling and the views of Fifa , " the statement , signed by SuperSport 's legal advisor Philip Seleke , read in part . <p> The departure of SuperSport meant that clubs would no longer benefit from a combined annual grant of Sh9.6 million from the broadcaster as well as title sponsors SportPesa . <p> " Kenyan football is poorer today . The legal and sporting consequences are grave.Mwendwa should take the blame for all this , he is the one who pushed us to have 18 teams in the league this season @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " KPL chairman Ambrose Rachier , who doubles up as Gor Mahia chairman , said at the time . <p> On December 31 , SportPesa made good its threat to withdraw from all local sports sponsorships in protest at increased taxation on gaming , thus leaving KPL clubs in a limbo . <p> With many clubs grappling with financial issues , KPL threw a spanner in the works by entering into a three-year deal with MediaPro for production of its matches on free to air TV in March last year . <p> Interestingly , the MediaPro deal was preferred ahead of a lucrative five-year deal from Radio Africa worth an average of Sh189 million annually that was to run until the 2022 season . <p> The league matches continued without a title sponsor and clubs operated on tight budgets since the deal with MediaPro did not yield any grants . <p> A reprieve came in April when SportPesa rescinded its decision to cut sponsorships and returned as title sponsors in a deal worth Sh80 million per year , Sh13million less than the initial deal . <p> That translates to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than 60 per cent less than what clubs got when SuperSport were on board . <p> Just as KPL clubs had begun mustering how to make do with the reduced grants , another bombshell was dropped . FKF ordered that the league had to end in October in preparation for a transitional season that was to start in December . <p> This was after Confederation of African Football ( Caf ) decided to change the periodicity of its inter-club competitions from 2019 onwards . <p> FKF failed to consider the welfare of KPL clubs and players when changing the plan for a transition to the Fifa calendar from six years to only six months . <p> This abrupt change of plan has had a strong and negative impact on KPL club budgets and players as it increased their matches and costs in 2019 by 50 per cent . Instead of 34 KPL matches in a normal season , KPL clubs must now play 34 KPL matches in only six months ( December-May ) in the 2018/19 season plus 17 more KPL matches in the first half of the new 2019/20 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Caf 's directive by March . We had worked on something that was comfortable for the clubs the previous year . We wrote to FKF who said it was not possible ( to adopt the six-year plan ) so we had no option but to oblige , " KPL CEO Jack Oguda told Nation Sport . <p> " Caf issued a directive that they needed to know the league champion and the cup winner by end of May for them to participate in their club competitions so we told KPL to come up with a solution . <p> KPL decided to introduce midweek fixtures so as to end the season within six months . On our side , we decided to start the cup competition from Round 32 as opposed to Round 64 , " said FKF Communication Manager Barry Otieno in a quick rejoinder . <p> Clubs are now bearing the brunt of that decision that has forced them to walk the tight rope that is paying salaries on time or catering for logistics that comes with honouring matches . <p> Community clubs have been the biggest victims . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ six months without pay and recently issued a walkover to Gor Mahia . <p> Players feel cheated <p> " We have been taken for a ride . Ever since coach ( Melis ) Medo came back he has sidelined the chairman and other senior team officials and is always in communication with the patron ( Gatundu South MP Moses Kuria ) . <p> Before matches , he always threatens that he will chase us and normally urges us to play in order to market ourselves . We are often given Sh1,000 after games . How can you market yourself in such conditions yet you are not even given fare to attend training ? " a Mount Kenya United player , who sought anonymity , told Nation Sport . <p> " After every game we are always told our salary will be paid before our next match . So we have decided enough is enough . It 's been six months without salary and for players who were here last season it 's now 10 months , " he added . <p> " Recently ( on April 3 ) when we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , we were kicked out of our hotel . We had to hang around town before kick-off . After the match , we boarded the bus and only got to Nairobi the next day at 6am . Every player was given Sh100 as fare to go home . During the whole journey , we had no stoppages to buy food , " the player said of his experience at the club formerly known as Nakumatt . <p> Institutional clubs have not been spared either . They have been forced to stretch their budgets into the next financial year with recurrent expenses now at an all-time high . <p> " In the past we used to budget for three-day training allowances but now we have to budget for seven days since the players are always in training . Lack of stadiums in Nairobi also means that we are paying more per diem this season . On average , we spend close to Sh400,000 for any game we play outside Nairobi . It could even be higher , we are just lucky that we have a team bus that caters for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " It 's terrible since most clubs have been forced to dig deeper into their pockets to meet the cost of featuring in the league . The frequency of expenses is higher than that of cash flows to the mother company . This leaves the club in a tricky situation and affects the performance of the team . We have tried to talk to the players to make them understand , " said Sony Sugar CEO Boniface Odhiambo . <p> While local clubs struggle with a punishing schedule that has drained their accounts to the last coin , their counterparts in other transitioning leagues , notably Zambia and Nigeria , are enjoying a smooth transition with a more reasonable schedule of matches . <p> In Nigeria , the Professional Football league was divided into two groups of 12 clubs each -- Group A and Group B. At the end of the season , the top three sides from the two groups will face off in the Super Six play-off that will be played on round-robin format . <p> The winning team will be crowned the league champion and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will also play in the Champions League while the third-placed team will join the winner of the domestic cup in the Confederation Cup . <p> In Zambia , the 20-team ZSL was split into two streams with 10 clubs each - Stream ' A ' and Stream ' B ' . At the end of the season , winners from the two streams will not only qualify for next season 's Champions League but will also contend for the league title in a play-off . <p> The runners-up in both streams will automatically qualify for the Confederations Cup . <p> As Rachier remarked two years ago , Kenyan football is indeed poorer . The consequences of the FKF vs KPL tussle over control of the top-tier league have been more than grave . <p> The once lucrative KPL is on its knees , the lower tiers of Kenyan football are in deplorable state .

Kenya has an abundance of renewable energy and the world at large is moving away from coal , meaning there 's more demand for renewable energy . Coupled with the fact that it is now way cheaper to generate power through renewable energy , especially because of regulations on carbon pricing and air pollution , is n't it a wonder then to see any investor put their money in a coal power plant in 2019 . Especially when there 's an alternative ? <p> Unless of course offering value for money was never the intention to begin with , which takes me back to tenderpreneurship . I think it 's time Kenyans stopped whistling in amazement at the numerous economic scandals and refuse the idea that it 's okay to lose a third of our budget to corruption and dubious deals .

@@50648231 <p> Kenyans in the Diaspora play a pivotal role in the growth of Kenya 's economy . According to statistics from Central Bank of Kenya , the Diaspora sent home through inter-bank transfers $209 million ( Sh20.94 billion ) and $245 million ( Sh24.55 billion ) in January 2018 and January 2019 respectively . <p> These figures could be even higher if remittances through MoneyGram , Wave , and Western Union are included in these estimates . These contributions by Diaspora surpass earnings from tea and coffee . <p> Despite their significant contributions to the Kenyan economy , present , and past governments have n't taken this key constituency seriously . The question , therefore , is : why is the Diaspora given a raw deal in Kenya 's governance systems and processes ? <p> Unlike Kenya , many African countries are tapping their Diaspora for nation-building . The Diaspora feel they are not appreciated by Kenya 's government and embassies abroad but only used as cash cows .

They have better benefits and security than what the Kenyan doctors demanded when they were imprisoned . <p> Kenyan professionals serving abroad should be encouraged to come home . They should be offered better terms of service , which is the major reason they are domiciled abroad . What is Dr Shem Ochuodho and Dr Matunda Nyanchama doing in South Sudan and Canada respectively , when the two are the finest in technology ? <p> In fact , Dr Nyanchama has been featured in the Canadian Who 's Who which publishes some of the best biographies selected on merit alone .

He told me that the number of certified psychiatrists in Kenya , a country of almost 50 million is about 100 , the majority of whom practice in Nairobi . <p> While Western Countries like the US and Canada are aggressive at admitting skilled immigrants , Kenya is not keen at incentivising its professionals . The influx of Kenyan medics in the Western Hemisphere for greener pastures is alarming . Brain drain is killing Kenya . <p> President Trump says the US will not be a dumping ground for unskilled people . He wants the country 's immigration to root for the best . Other developed nations are also poaching professionals because they know how expensive it is to train professionals . <p> Frankline Onchiri , a Kenyan doctor working at one of the top Children 's research institute in the US , had this to comment on the government 's treatment of its most skilled : <p> ' ' We love our country and would want to apply our knowledge and skills to serve our people .

The government can pay our teachers , lecturers , engineers , doctors , and nurses decent salaries were it not for corruption . <p> A notable turn-off to Kenyan professionals at home and abroad is when they see people with dubious academic degrees holding leadership positions in our richest counties- Kiambu and Nairobi just under the aegis of democracy ! <p> There is no denying that one can be a great leader without superior education , but formulating impactful policies requires good knowledge . <p> It 's imperative for the government to conduct a vigorous campaign to bring our professionals home .

Ahmed Hassan , the former Chairperson of the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission ( IEBC ) made extensive tours in the diaspora promising to register Kenyans to vote but this did n't happen . <p> His successor Wafula Chebukati followed with similar false promises . It 's unfortunate that the government no longer talks about Diaspora .

@@50648233 <p> The criticism he has subsequently received shows just how much the footballing landscape has changed since the likes of Edwin van der Sar and Oliver Kahn all enjoyed extremely long , and illustrious , careers at the very top level -- appreciated throughout . <p> But that 's not to say De Gea 's critics are a result of a harsher sport , but more so harsher criteria against which stoppers are judged . <p> " Soon , there wo n't be any goalkeepers at all , " Italy icon Gianluigi Buffon told FourFourTwo . " The way football is going right now , I may be one of the last ! " <p> He may be right .

" He 'll probably take stitches , but you 've got to be brave . <p> " He has to take everything , but he turns his head away from it and it goes past him and trickles into the net . " <p> Mistakes are a consequence of the fact goalkeepers expected to be shot-stoppers , sweepers and outfield players , while social media allows every error to be replayed and relayed around the world . <p> It 's that which makes a goalkeeper such as De Gea go from being called the world 's best one week , to a player in a crisis the next .

If it was not , why are there no indications on the fate of the loan now that the government has opted to rehabilitate the old railway ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does this say on the larger Chinese project outlook in Africa ? <p> OFFICIAL SCRIPT <p> The latest spin by the Transport ministry and State House officials , that the Naivasha-Kisumu SGR was not part of the Beijing talks , contradicts the well-known official script . <p> As late as yesterday , the Kenya Railways website had outlined the SGR project in five phases . The now-controversial phase 2B is listed as **35;94;TOOLONG and is tied to the " new Kisumu Port " . <p> The final phase , which is the 107km Kisumu -Yala-Malaba route , is listed as Phase 2C . <p> Government documents since the inception of the SGR project , up to the budget policy statement , show that Kisumu was central to the plans and no mention has ever been made about the metre gauge railway , apart from plans to sell its assets to fund the construction of the SGR . <p> " Already , 85 per cent of Phase 2A has been done .

But , as it turns out , the SGR deal was not part of the " priority " agenda in China -- according to Foreign Affairs Cabinet Secretary Monica Juma . <p> Transport CS James Macharia , who seemed to be giving conflicting statements last week , left more unanswered questions on whether the railway to be revived will be the one to Kisumu or the one to Eldoret-Malaba . <p> " We have MGR going all the way to Malaba-Kampala , which is still active .

I was very ill at birth , and my father , who was a road engineer , travelled a lot . When things became critical , my grandparents took me to a nearby mission hospital , Thessalia Mission . This is where I met the person who became my Norwegian mother , " he says . Norbert later lost his father when he was 8 years old . After he sat his KCPE exams at Thessalia Mission Primary in Muhoroni , Kisumu County , he left Kenya for Norway . " I went on to study shipping and started my career at Nor-cargo AS ( today Bring Cargo ) . When I came back home for a visit in 1999 , I was appalled at the state of my childhood home , Thessalia Mission . I decided to do something about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Travelhouse , a tour company , in 2000 . Its aim was to promote cultural tourism in Norbert 's hometown and improve the lives of the community . Two years later , Nobert partnered with Kenya-based tour operator Mark Sang , and together they 've built Jambo Travelhouse into a tours and travel behemoth . Tell us about Jambo Travelhouse . We handle safaris across the East African region . Most of our clientele comes from Europe , particularly Norway , where I live . We also hire out our vehicles to other tour companies , institutions and individual customers . Why did you pick tourism as the vehicle you 'd use to help your community ? I left Muhoroni when I was 14 . When I got to Norway , I tried very hard to forget about my past because I had come from a place that had a lot of sadness and difficulty . Norway was an escape , a new beginning . When I was 23 , my girlfriend at the time insisted that I come back home and see my people . When I did , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Thessalia Mission . I wanted to give back . The most obvious gift this place had was its natural beauty , which was undeniable despite the hardship and poverty that surrounded it . I thought to myself , ' People should come here and experience the contrasts of life ' . Was there infrastructure to support tourism in the area ? I was n't interested in doing hotel-based safaris . I wanted people to come and see life through the eyes of the locals . It was n't something that was being done and I felt the Kenya we sold did not reflect on the true experiences of a majority of the population . I had grown up in a missionary compound and had childhood memories of a sparkling place . That compound , though derelict , still existed . I spoke with the mission 's management and the national board of the Free Pentecostal Fellowship of Kenya , and they allowed me to renovate the previous Norwegian boarding school to give guests a place to stay . These renovations cost Sh600,000 , which I raised from my savings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my very first group of tourists -- three of my Norwegian friends . What were you charging ? The cost for staying at Thessalia Guesthouse was Sh3,000 per person per night and Sh2,000 to participate in cultural events in the nearby communities of Koguta and Kapchebwai . My guests were enthralled by the scenery , culture and traditions of the Luo and Kalenjin , and the warmth and hospitality of the locals , many of whom had very little but had n't give up hope for a better life . In 2001 , one of the guests who 'd taken the trip wrote about it in a Norwegian newspaper . We got excellent publicity from this . For the next five years , we organised five trips a year to Muhoroni . Each trip had approximately 15 to 20 guests and lasted 14 to 17 days . What was the full itinerary ? We did Nairobi -- Naivasha -- Nakuru -- Muhoroni -- Maasai Mara -- Mombasa . A different itinerary also included Mount Kenya . We still do these packages to date . Most people who want to travel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficult is it to convince them to take trips to Muhoroni ? You 'd be surprised at how many people would rather see something different . Kenya is more than the Maasai Mara . Whenever we do these trips , we take a survey at the end , and over 95 per cent of the guests say Muhoroni was the best part of their safari . There is something magical about interacting with real people living their real lives . We explore the villages , go to marketplaces , learn how to cook local meals ; we eat , dance , drink and share stories around camp fires under starlit skies . You ca n't substitute that with a luxury hotel visit . Do n't get me wrong , those are incredible , but this experience is completely unique because Muhoroni is completely unique . You started the trips to give back to the community , how do you do this ? As the business grew , we saw the need to establish our own CSR organisation , Compassion Africa . Through this organisation , so far we 've dug @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orphans , given scholarships for primary and high school , and initiated programmes to empower women . There 's still a lot more to do . The tourism sector takes a hit whenever there 's instability around politics or security . How do you deal with this ? Our biggest strength has come from diversification . We realised , for instance , that we could n't survive on the Muhoroni trips alone , so we introduced tours all over East Africa . We also acknowledged that because tourism is seasonal , we needed an extra avenue to take us through the downtimes , so we introduced transport services for weddings , funerals , school trips , conferences and so on . When other tour companies were off-loading their vehicles because of the liability of maintaining large fleets , we made a purposeful decision to increase ours . Now , we have 30 vehicles , which include mini-vans , 28-seater buses and Land Cruisers . Our next big thing is to go eco-friendly . We want to transform some of our vehicles from running on fuel to running on electricity . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cost of Sh160 and cover 410 kilometres . A similar petrol car will cost Sh3,000 to fill up and cover 300 kilometres . The math speaks for itself . Any company that makes it in this industry must stay ahead of the game . Innovation is everything . With the stiff competition in Kenya , is tourism still a viable business ? It takes hard work like anything else , but yes . Our turnover in year one was $30,000 ( Sh300,000 ) . We stabilised in 2005 with a turnover of $250,000 ( Sh25 million ) . In 2012 , one of our best years , we hit a turnover of $900,000 ( Sh90 million ) . There 's money , for sure . What 's the secret to building a successful company in a sector that 's seen many others fail ? Partnerships are essential . I made the right decision partnering with Mark . We started off with just one car in a tiny office off Kirichwa Road in Milimani . At the time , I knew very little about tourism because I came from a shipping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until 2016 when I resigned from my job . It was a big and scary step and my peers thought I was insane to walk away from a seven-figure salary , but I felt I had reached my peak . I think the secret to success is to have a strong reason for doing what you 're doing , the courage to be different , the guts to step off the ledge , and a solid plan to see your idea through . My mantra is if you 're not living on the edge , you 're taking up too much space . I am always diversifying , looking for new things to try . Apart from Jambo Travelhouse , I run a real estate company in Norway and still offer consultancies in the oil and gas industry . In Kenya , I co-own a club , Number 7 , with TV producer Eugene Mbugua . It 's a project we 're very proud of . In my life , there 's no time to be idle . It 's important to do things that keep your drive alive . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has a flawed or incomplete image of Kenya or Africa as a whole . There are hardships on this continent , but that 's not what defines us as a people . I want to be a part of the changing rhetoric , to show we are proud , hardworking , willing and capable of impacting positive change in our own lives .

But thats because youre cutting out every other food except for protein . Research shows that eating 25 to 30 grams of protein can help you fill up faster during a meal and feel full for longer after youve finished it .

Some have adapted to eat high-meat diets , such as the Inuit , Maasai , or Mongolian people . But most do nt tolerate it . There is , after all , a huge chasm between low-carb and nothing but meat . <p> To suggest that humans somehow evolved while eating only ( or even primarily ) meat would be anthropologically inaccurate .

Sv3riges channel also spouts flat-earth conspiracies . <p> Various carnivores suspect that the movement has been infiltrated by Russian disinformation bots . The idea that many of the more extreme carnivore-diet posts are fake isnt so far-fetched : Russian trolls were discovered to have been spreading antivaccination theories in the lead-up to the 2016 presidential election .

This tense relationship started when President Charles de Gaulle of France turned down the United Kingdom 's application to join the European Economic Community ( EEC ) , which was European Union 's predecessor , in 1963 . The president 's negation was primarily because he despised the idea of the English language having dominance in Europe over French . Nevertheless , UK eventually joined the union in 1973 but almost made an exit within two years after the entry . <p> Image : pixabay.comSource : UGC <p> The first referendum on whether the UK should remain in the European Union was held in 1975 . The tension between the two sides reached a climax in 1884 when Margaret Thatcher ; the UK 's conservative Prime Minister , demanded to reduce the payments in support of EEC budget . So much for that brief history of why Brexit happened . Here is a concise highlight of the Brexit consequences for UK , EU @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full ? <p> Before even looking at the effects of Brexit , few people actually know what it means and what it stands for . Brexit is a combination of the terms " Britain " and " exit " and is a shorthand for the split of Britain from the EU to change its relationship on migration , trade , and security . Europe is a leading export market of Britain and her largest foreign investment source . Hence , the membership in the Union has contributed to London 's rapid growth as a global trade center .

Desire to retain funds <p> The Britons who voted for the exit did not want their taxes to be channeled to the European Union . They reasoned that a small percentage of that money went back to the UK as subsidies to support sectors like agriculture and education yet the monarchy is the second largest contributor to the Union . The supporting percentage also said they did not want to continue backing up the European Commission ; EU 's wing that proposes new regulations and laws . <p> Moreover , the Britons claimed that the EU wanted to harmonize VAT rate and the commodities it is imposed on . For instance , VAT is expected to be 15 percent but can be reduced to 5 percent on some specific goods . With the EU 's regulation , however , its consent is required in case of any changes . <h> 2 .

Seeing the euro as a catastrophe <p> Image : pixabay.comSource : UGC <p> Britain has had several skeptics concerning the euro from the time it signed in to the EU . This heightened in 2008 during the global recession that was severe in the countries that had embraced the common currency in Europe . As a result , the rate of unemployment increased in countries like Spain and Greece to over 20 percent causing a massive debt challenge .

It must also be approved by the parliaments and leaders of each individual member of state . The five identified candidate countries are Montenegro , Turkey , Albania , Macedonia , and Serbia . Both sides are committed to Turkey 's entry although several European politicians have argued that the state will never qualify especially with the possible effects of Brexit that may slow down the Union 's progress . <p> Furthermore , the issue of immigration has been highly politicized in the UK just like it is in the United States and other anti-immigration countries .

How does Brexit affect the EU ? Well , the consequences of Brexit on the EU include economic , social , institutional and political shifts within the Union . <h> EU budget adjustment <p> To help fill the financial gap left by Brexit , the EU has reduced regional spending by about 30 percent . This is a big concern on the side of the poorer member states depending largely on regional funds . <h> Ideological shift <p> Brexit will affect ideological stability within the EU because Britain makes up about 12 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ population size , the UK is a key player in the Council of the European Union and the European Parliament .

It has notable intelligence capabilities , far-reaching diplomatic network and soft power . The United States considered the UK as an easy bridge between Europe and the US . <h> What are the Brexit consequences for Africa ? <p> Image : pixabay.comSource : UGC <p> Africa is not spared when it comes to why Brexit happened and the ensuing consequences since the waves will affect all the global markets , those in Africa included .

Without the contribution of Britain , the European Development Fund ( EDF ) will be affected . All hope is not lost for Africa , however , since Britain could continue funding projects in Africa through its aid programs . <h> What does Brexit mean for the United States ? <p> While Brexit is seen to be a purely European affair , it could have massive global consequences and the United States would feel the pain in various ways . <p> To begin with , US companies will find it more expensive and harder to transport goods between the UK and other parts of Europe , with more paperwork , delays , and tariffs .

This may change as visas become more costly and British Airlines having to renegotiate the Open Skies Agreement between the EU and US as well the access to the European airports . <p> Shopping will suffer the consequences of Brexit as the supply chains for every item from energy to food will disintegrate . <p> Migration crisis rises since the UK could be lost yet it has always served as an advocate in Europe for African issues .

American Express offers the Bonvoy Brilliant premium card and , for businesses , the Bonvoy Business card . Chase , meanwhile , offers the Bonvoy Boundless Visa for consumers . <p> Although it is a very unusual arrangement in the credit card industry , Chase and American Express cooperate to ensure that you can not simultaneously have cards or receive welcome bonuses from both issuers .

In this deal , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and efficient plant . <p> The report has used data from the October 2016 Lahmeyer International report ; the Development of a Power Generation and Transmission Master Plan , Kenya , 2015-2035 ; and Kenya 's Updated 2017-2037 Least Cost Power Development Plan ( LCPDP ) , released in June 2018 by the Energy and Petroleum Regulatory Authority . <p> Mr Schlissel said the assumptions used by the coal plant 's developers no longer hold true , and that building the facility would burden consumers with costly power for years to come . <p> " Amu Power 's claims for the cost of Lamu-generated electricity are unrealistically low , based on outdated costs for imported coal , and on overly optimistic assumptions about how much electricity the plant will generate , " Mr Schlissel said . " Using more realistic assumptions about future Lamu generation and coal costs , electricity from the plant could cost as much as $75 cents ( Sh75 ) per kilowatt-hour ( KWh ) , on average , during the years 2024 to 2037 , more than 10 times what the plant 's proponents have claimed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ costs for the Lamu port upgrades that would be required to bring coal to the plant nor construction of the transmission infrastructure needed to distribute the power . The costs of these projects would add significantly to Lamu 's overall impact on electricity consumers and taxpayers . <p> " Kenya 's own analysis demonstrates that , when using the most likely demand growth scenarios , its abundant renewable resources render no new coal generation necessary in the country until 2029 , at the earliest , " Mr Schlissel said . <p> In its application to build Lamu , Amu Power had said electricity from the plant would costs just $7.2 cents ( Sh70 ) per KWh , and this has been a major selling point for the facility , but the economic and financial analysis by the US-based agency on the Amu data shows it to be highly optimistic . <p> The Lamu PPA includes a take-or-pay clause requiring that annual capacity charges , which start at Sh36 billion , be paid to the plant 's owners , regardless of whether the plant is actually dispatched , as long as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ portion of this annual capacity charge is scalable , as it is linked to the US consumer price index ( CPI ) and will increase over time as the CPI rises . <p> Currently , the CPI is already eight per cent higher than it was in 2014 , and is expected to climb another 10 per cent by 2024 , when the plant is scheduled to come online . Further increases would likely occur after the plant enters into commercial service . <p> In its application , Amu Power projected that coal for the plant could be imported for Sh5,000 per metric tonne ( mt ) . In contrast , Kenya 's own estimates expect imported coal costs to average Sh10,000/mt next year , and rise to Sh10,800/mt in 2040 . <p> TAKE-OR-PAY CLAUSE <p> " In other words , Lamu 's fuel costs will be double what the company estimated in its 2014 proposal . Finally , the company 's electricity price estimate depends on the plant operating at extremely high capacity factors , levels that the plant is unlikely to reach , " Mr Schlissel said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which came online at the end of September 2018 , has displaced , at lower cost , a significant amount of generation that had previously been produced by thermal units ; and the ageing and expensive diesel generation , which also puts the viability of the Lamu coal plant to test . Kenya also has transmission interconnections with Ethiopia and Uganda , which are developing their own renewable resources that might be available for import . <p> " Kenya Power already has a 25-year PPA with Ethiopian Electric Power through which it will receive 400MW of firm power with related energy at a cost of $7 cents ( Sh7 ) per KWh . As this PPA also has a take-or-pay clause , Kenya Power will have to pay for this power , even if it is displaced by electricity from Lamu , " the report said . <p> Efforts to get a comment from the Energy ministry proved futile as calls placed to the Principal Secretary , Mr Joseph Njoroge , went unanswered . Amu Power , on the other hand , told the Nation this new report 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ argued that , according to the 2017-2037 Least Cost Power Development Plan , Kenya expects an energy demand of between 1,754MW and 9,790MW . <p> " We anticipate that the coal power plant will have utilisation rate of around 95 per cent , meaning Kenyans will only pay for energy consumed and no capacity charge will be accrued , " Amu Power chief operating officer Cyrus Kirima said . <p> " We also wish to clarify that the coal power will retail at a cost of tariff of $0.7.8/kWh ( Sh78 ) which was locked during the signing of the power purchase agreement . " <p> Amu Power argues that the Lamu coal power plant will provide baseload capacity at the second cheapest non-subsidised tariff in the country after hydro , at $0.5/kWh ( Sh50 ) . <p> " This plant will have the flexibility to profile the generation according to the daily demand pattern compared to other power production technologies that are inflexible ; reducing generation costs by between 12 per cent and 36 per cent , " Mr Kirima said .

FILE PHOTO NMG <p> Well , the running commentaries on the recently read budget will keep us busy for the next few weeks . I will say one thing : it is very aggressive . For aggressive expenditure to occur , there has to be , commensurately , an aggressive revenue collection . Directors of private and public companies need to be alive to the fact that it is not only the Companies Act 2015 that provides strict liability for individual directors for statutory breaches . The taxman has always been waiting in the wings , ready to hold directors liable for tax evasion . <p> Originally Section 116 of the Income Tax Act , Cap 470 , provided that where an offence under the Act had been committed by a corporate body of persons , every person who at the time of the commission of the offence was a director , general , manager , secretary , or other similar officer of the body corporate , or was acting or purporting to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the offence unless he proves that the offence was committed without his consent or knowledge and he exercised all the diligence to prevent the commission of the offence that he ought to have exercised having regard to the nature of his functions in that capacity and in all the circumstances . <p> Whoa ! What a mouthful of a sentence ! All those words to simply say : " Boss , if you 're a director or senior officer of a company and that company commits a tax offence , you are also personally guilty of the offence unless you can demonstrate that you were blissfully ignorant and that you were smart enough to try and stop the offence from taking place if your position warranted you knowing that it was going on . " <p> Someone woke up and realised this was a fairly easy pill to swallow so they designed an amendment to kick the heat up a notch . Particularly in light of the fact that Kenyans love to form companies for all manner of businesses and appoint their friends as directors or proxies . So section @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Section 18 within Act 29 that deals with liability for tax payable by a company . <p> Because misery loves company and karma is a five letter word related to a female dog , Section 18 brings the company 's shareholders into the tax offence garden party . Section 18(1) states that subject to subsection ( 2 ) where an arrangement has been entered into by any director , general manager , company secretary see what they did there ? They clarified the word secretary by narrowing it down to the company secretary or other senior officer or controlling member of the company with the intention or effect of rendering a company unable to satisfy a current or future tax liability under a tax law , every person who was a director or controlling member of the company when the arrangement was entered into shall be jointly and severally liable for the tax liability of the company . <p> Hold my glass for a minute . Apart from clarifying that it 's not just ANY secretary on the hook here , the law now provides that it is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that prevent both current and future tax liabilities being met . A controlling shareholder is regarded as one who beneficially holds directly or indirectly , either alone or together with a related person or persons , 50 per cent or more of the voting rights , rights to the capital or rights to the dividend . So what happens in subsection ( 2 ) ? This is where an escape hatch from personal liability is provided . The above mentioned persons shall not be liable if they did not derive a financial or other benefit from the arrangement to evade tax . Well that should be easy to prove , right ? Do n't get too excited yet . Abovementioned persons also have to have notified both the company and Kenya Revenue Authority ( KRA ) that they were opposed to the arrangement once they became aware of it . <p> I think by now you 're getting the gist of KRA 's mandate over you as a non-executive director , executive director , general manager or company secretary of a Kenyan company . Previously you were allowed to plead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't entertain your ignorance of the offences , rather it places on you the dual responsibility of showing that you not only did n't benefit financially , but that you also went out of your way to send something more formal than a Whatsapp message to that recalcitrant CEO saying that you were NOT trying to be part of the tax evasion scam . With a copy to KRA stat ! <p> Mull on that this week , as you watch our friends at Times Tower go on overdrive this year .

The hard economic reality of fashioning a plan that lives up to the promises Trump has made would invariably involve trade-offs unpopular with many voters . <p> " Obamacare has been a disaster , " Trump told ABC News in an interview aired Sunday evening . His own plan , he insisted , would lower costs . " You 'll see that in a month when we introduce it . We 're going to have a plan . That 's subject to winning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll win all three . We 'll have phenomenal health care . " <p> The president 's renewed interest in health care comes as he plans an elaborate rally in Orlando , Florida , on Tuesday to open a reelection campaign that is already struggling to find its bearings . After last week 's leak of a series of dismal internal poll results from March showing him trailing in multiple battleground states , Trump first denied that the surveys even existed , only to have his campaign later confirm that they in fact were real . <p> By Sunday , the episode had led to a purge as the Trump campaign indicated that it would cut ties with three of its five pollsters , a sign of internal discord in an operation seeking to be far more organized and professional than the slapdash , one-man show Trump ran out of Trump Tower in New York four years ago . <p> Democratic leaders have argued that they won control of the House in last year 's midterm elections in large part on the health care issue , and they have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 140 House Democrats , more than half the party 's caucus , held events or online town halls to talk about health care , their largest coordinated action in districts since winning the majority . <p> In particular , Democrats hammered the Trump administration for asking a court in March to overturn the entire Affordable Care Act , which among other things would eliminate protections for patients with preexisting conditions . Trump has repeatedly said he favors such protections but has not explained how he would achieve them if the Obama-era law were invalidated . <p> " The Trump administration is currently suing to eliminate the law that guarantees health care coverage for Americans with preexisting conditions , " said Rep. Ted Lieu of California , a leader of the Democratic committee that organized the weekend activities . " That action speaks for itself . If Trump wants to be serious about health care , he needs to stop the lawsuit and his other actions that seek to sabotage the ACA . " <p> While House Democrats advance incremental measures on health care , some prominent liberals , including @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proposed a single-payer government-run health care plan that they call " Medicare for All , " hoping to capitalize on the popularity of the program for the elderly by expanding it to the population at large . <p> Trump and other Republicans see that as an opening for them on the campaign trail by characterizing it as socialism . Such a huge shift in how health care is run in the United States would not only put the government in charge , they say , but also cost enormous amounts of taxpayer money and force Americans to give up private insurance coverage they might like . <p> Sanders was pressed on those criticisms during an appearance on " Fox News Sunday " and argued that the current system was unsustainable , implicitly offering his own criticisms of the program erected by Obama from the left . <p> " You have a dysfunctional health care system , " he said . " You 've got 70 million Americans who either have no health insurance or they are underinsured with high deductibles and copayments . We are paying twice as much as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we need . We spend far more per capita on health care as do the people of any other country . " <p> Democrats enjoy a strong edge with voters on health care , with 40% trusting them on the issue , compared with 23% who trust Republicans more , according to an April poll by The Associated Press and the NORC Center for Public Affairs Research . <p> Forty-two percent of Americans in that survey favored a single-payer system along the lines of what Sanders is proposing , while 31% opposed it and 25% did not take a position . Views of the Affordable Care Act are split right down the middle , with 50% approving of it and 48% disapproving of it in an April poll by Gallup . <p> Given the Democratic advantage , many Republicans say they should not focus their energy on health care but instead emphasize immigration and other issues where they are stronger . But the president and his team counter that even if they can not win on health care , it would be ridiculous to simply cede the territory if they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feels compelled to have something specific to counter Medicare for All . Still , people close to Trump suggested that if he did release something within a month or two , it might not be a comprehensive plan but a series of smaller proposals that would potentially help , such as ideas for bringing down prescription drug costs , for giving states more flexibility on Medicaid expansion and for promoting more access in the marketplace . <p> Among those who are said to be influencing the discussion within the administration are Alex Azar , the secretary of health and human services ; Seema Verma , head of the agency that runs Medicare and Medicaid ; and Joe Grogan , director of the White House Domestic Policy Council . <p> " The president has repeatedly promised something better than the ACA but has never come up with a plan himself , and the congressional plans he endorsed were definitely not better for everyone , " said Larry Levitt , a senior vice president at the Kaiser Family Foundation . <p> " There 's always a tension for presidents around whether to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ process play out , " Levitt added . " When it comes to health care , the challenge has been that the president has not only avoided proposing a specific plan , but has made promises that no plan could ever fulfill . " <p> When they were in the majority , House Republicans voted dozens of times to repeal the Affordable Care Act , also known as Obamacare , only to see their legislation die in the Senate . On one occasion , Trump summoned House Republicans to the White House for a grand ceremony only to see that momentum quickly fade away . <p> Trump often laments the failure by blaming Sen. John McCain , R-Ariz. , who voted against one repeal effort in summer 2017 . Even if McCain had voted for the bill , however , full repeal of the Affordable Care Act would not have been assured . <p> That version would have eliminated the individual and employers ' mandate but left intact the health care law 's Medicaid expansion and insurance regulations . And it would still have required passage in the House or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> When Trump pushed the idea of voting to repeal the law again recently , he was quickly dissuaded by Sen. Mitch McConnell , R-Ky. , the Senate majority leader , who argued that comprehensive health care legislation would go nowhere in Congress . The president then insisted it was never his intention to vote on a bill before the 2020 election . <p> Even as Trump has delayed producing a plan , he has continued to criticize the existing health care law , repeatedly claiming that it had become unaffordable because of average deductibles exceeding $7,000 or $8,000 . This was an exaggeration . <p> Deductibles vary greatly by the type of plan and the enrollee . While deductibles for some plans can top $7,000 , they average $4,375 for silver-tier plans , the most common choice for consumers . And those who receive cost-sharing reductions have lower deductibles still . Also left unsaid was his own administration 's role in causing higher deductibles , as the federal government sets caps on out-of-pocket costs and has increased the limit this year . <p> Midway through his third year in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plan he is promising to unveil in a month or two . <p> " He ca n't deliver the impossible , " said Len M.

@@50799232 <h> Parliament has a duty to serve citizens well <p> MPs during a parliamentary session . Courtesy Out of a budget of Sh3 trillion , Parliament has , for weeks , been unable to agree on whether to give counties an extra Sh11 billion or not . I may not be a genius in mathematics , but it seems absurd to me that a Parliament that boasts of less than 1,000 employees ( including parliamentary staff ) easily gobbles up Sh40 billion and then has the temerity to argue whether counties , which have millions of Kenyans each to serve , should each receive a paltry Sh7 billion on average . <p> We must be mad as a nation to distribute Sh40 billion to Parliament and not realise that county governments are hardly scraping by with Nairobi receiving only Sh14 billion . Which means we assign Sh4,666 to every Nairobian , but assign Sh40 million per head in Parliament . The scales are heavily tipped in favour of waheshimiwa while they pretend to care about us and haggle over Sh11 billion . If indeed parliamentarians cared , there are a few things they would have done by now that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over Sh11 billion , Parliament should apply itself to transformative agendas . MPs should pick issues that change the lives of Kenyans forever . One of those things would be to invest more in devolution . Yes , our counties need more money even if it will be stolen . It is important to note that we can not keep the people from the consequences of their democratic choices by use of budgets . If a governor is corrupt , no matter how little we give him , he will steal it . Let the people who chose him or her live with the consequences of that choice . We should , instead , make sure each county has enough resources to transform itself . <p> The tenant The value of devolution is not just in development , it is also in the reality that county residents will soon be aware there is a big difference made by who sits in the governor 's mansion . Let them see other counties that made the right choices prosper and it will soon dawn on them choices have consequences . Only then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We must , therefore , allow devolution to thrive and let the people 's choices be empowered to deliver to , or disappoint them . It is this process that will open the eyes of the people to the fact that the vote has consequences we can not run away from . Speaking of the vote , we must also turn the lens on Parliament and ask it to begin to act on issues that affect this country , its economy and our well being . Parliament should , for example , take on the issues around housing . It is not enough that rents are sky high , it is also that to rent a unit one needs to pay 2 months deposit . Which not only makes access to housing difficult , but also ensures large sums of money are locked up by landlords for years for no reason . My query on deposits for houses has always been the same : a house is a permanent and immovable asset . The tenant can not carry away your house and run away with it , so what is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need repainting and repairs after tenancy is a nonsensical argument . <p> Because even if you left the house empty for two years , it would still need to be repaired . That is the nature of things . Therefore the best solution is for landlords to keep part of the rent as money for repairs . Just like when one hires a car , he is not told that he will also repair the car if it is damaged . The risk of damage is covered in the price of hire , as it should be in housing as well . Slowly abandoned By passing a law that abolishes these deposits , Kenya would suddenly free up billions of shillings to the market , which would boost the economy overnight . We , however , do n't need to stop there . There are two paths that Parliament should take on housing ; number one , Parliament should make it compulsory for government to build a certain quota of low cost housing every year .

The fruit would be easy to reap ; Kenyans from all walks of life would soon be living in decent housing , the ghettos we know will be slowly abandoned , and all of us would have more money in our pockets to spend on our dreams and ventures . The landlord would not lose out either , because the only thing that would change is how long it takes them to recoup the money they spent on building . This will also force landlords to build with cheaper technologies and look at their investments as long term investments . By enacting such laws , parliament would have added billions into the economy while alleviating the suffering of many a city dweller . <p> My message to parliament is clear ; stop arguing on whether to fund devolution more or not . The answer is always the same , that more funds should be given to the counties . Second , stop wasting our time on useless platitudes around 2022 .

Mose Sammy , Standard Former Nyeri Governor Wahome Gakuru looked disturbed a week before he was killed in an accident , an inquest heard yesterday . <p> Gakuru died in a road accident on the Nyeri - Nairobi Highway on November 7 , 2017 . The governor was being driven to Nairobi for a talk show on Inooro TV , accompanied by his personal assistant and bodyguard , all who were seriously injured in the crash . The driver also survived . Josphat Mwangi Maina , the former private assistant to the late governor , told the court in Nyeri yesterday that his boss had fallen out with his key political campaigners and advisors after the 2017 election .

Inquest testimony Maina was testifying before Nyeri Chief Magistrate Wendy Kagendo in an inquest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Gakuru had expressed concern after his former allies started turning against him . Maina said the governor became more concerned when his erstwhile allies , led by Kinywa Kimuri , organised a goat-eating ceremony on November 5 to " celebrate the fallout .

He said the county boss interpreted the move by his former allies as one aimed at tarnishing his name and derailing his vision and development agenda for the county . Church visit To counter the motives of his allies-turned-foes , Maina told the court , Gakuru decided to visit a church in Karatina town on November 5 , where he accused some people of moving around the county tarnishing his name and distracting him from his duties .

Earlier , the inquest heard that besides the change in the time of travel , Gakuru made a spur of the moment decision to swap the vehicle he was using . " He had planned to use a Pajero only to settle on a Mercedes Benz in the morning . He said the former was slow yet he was late for the interview , " Maina said .

@@50799234 <h> Yes , limit state officials and legislators to public hospitals <p> Kenya 's public healthcare system has been run down by mismanagement . Devolving healthcare to counties following the advent of devolution has not made matters any better . If anything , industrial action involving doctors and nurses is so common , it does not surprise anyone anymore . <p> In 2015 the government launched a Sh38 billion medical equipment programme that was expected to serve as a turning point for medical services in Kenya . Under a deal dubbed ' The Managed Equipment Services ( MES ) ' the national government sought to fully equip two hospitals in each of the 47 counties with dialysis and cancer detection machines . In addition , ultra-modern machines for Intensive Care Units and heart disease diagnostic centres were to be established . Prior to this , all cancers cases across the country were referred to the Kenyatta National Hospital ( KNH ) . This resulted in such a long waiting list that many patients died long before their time to be attended to came . The relief that the launch of MES offered was immense . Unfortunately , the scheme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ despite that failure , elected leaders and the government have done little , if anything , to improve the healthcare system .

Wanjiku , who barely makes ends meet , if ever , is left to the mercy of God when serious ailments like cancer come calling . It is a sad state of affairs that calls for immediate attention . <p> What better place to start than the welcome proposal by Kiambu Woman Representative Gathoni wa Muchomba that elected leaders and top government officials be given medical covers limited to local public hospitals ? By limiting what options leaders enjoy when it comes to healthcare , they will have no option but to pay more attention to our erratic , dysfunctional public healthcare system . Those of goodwill among MPs should support Wamuchomba 's proposal by drafting , tabling a motion and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ served by the representatives they elected to champion their causes . Rising cases of cancer among Kenya 's poor population are causing great concern , not because cancer is incurable , but because the cost factor is prohibitive . Added to that , is the lack of capacity in public hospitals . Most of the diagnostic machines supplied to designated hospitals within counties are said to have broken down and their spares are unavailable . In some cases , there is lack of trained personnel to manage the sophisticated medical equipment . It is not better at KNH , East and Central Africa 's premier referral hospital where machine breakdowns have crippled services . This is compounded by the lack of medical stores , poor staffing and working conditions , theft of drugs and professional negligence across all the 47 counties . Managing cancer cases should be prioritised . Cancer is one of the leading killers in the country . In 2016 alone , an estimated 15762 succumbed to cancer . Conservative estimate show that from an annual cancer infection rate of 40000 cases , at least 25000 succumb annually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Four legacy agenda . The president is committed to attain the Universal Healthcare Goals and has already launched pilot project in four counties . These deliberate efforts need the support of all leaders , starting from the grassroots all the way to the top , to succeed . Thus , Wamuchomba 's proposal is timely and , if implemented , could go a long way in improving our healthcare system to standards recommended by , especially , the World Health Organisation . The success of this programme , besides political goodwill , depends on the government not only employing more doctors and nurses to meet WHO recommendations of 1 doctor for every 1000 patients , but also good remuneration commensurate with the good but tedious work medical personnel do . Budgetary allocations to health ought to be increased . No rocket science is needed to understand that a heathy nation is a working nation . The wheels of the economy will turn ever so sluggishly if workers spend all their time and resources in hospitals .

@@50808240 <h> The gerrymandering ruling and the risk of a monopoly on power <p> Yesterday at 3:19 PM <p> Tell your friends <p> It 's even possible to imagine a future in which Republicans could effectively claim a monopoly on federal power despite continued weakness in the national vote.The gerrymandering ruling and the risk of a monopoly on power <h> ( The Upshot ) : At some point or another over the last decade , Democrats have won the most votes but lost national elections for the presidency , the House and the Senate . <p> Partisan gerrymandering is just one of the reasons the Democrats are at such a disadvantage . But the Supreme Court 's decision on gerrymandering Thursday came as long-term political and demographic trends threaten to put Democrats at an even greater disadvantage in the Senate and perhaps also the presidency . <p> It 's even possible to imagine a future in which Republicans could effectively claim a monopoly on federal power despite continued weakness in the national vote . <p> Sustained minority rule -- within the bounds of the Constitution -- is not an imminent peril . After all , Democrats recaptured the House in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and even if it does not materialize it might strain American democracy . <p> So on one hand , the ruling -- which said federal courts ca n't bar partisan gerrymandering -- merely preserves the status quo . But it also closes off one way , arguably the easiest way , that the risk of minority rule might have been reduced . <p> Over the last few decades , American politics has become increasingly polarized along geographic lines . Cities now overwhelmingly back Democrats ; the countryside increasingly backs Republicans , although by less lopsided margins . This kind of polarization strains representative democracies with winner-take-all voting systems , since even modest alternations in district or state lines can produce very different results . <p> These biases can be unintentional . Democrats , for instance , lost the 2016 election by the margin of the Florida Panhandle and Michigan 's Upper Peninsula , and the 2000 election by the margin of the Panhandle . It 's an accident of 19th-century history that these regions did not end up being part of Alabama and Wisconsin instead . <p> But even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ district lines for partisan gain . <p> Either party can benefit from partisan gerrymandering . But Republicans generally have an easier time of it than Democrats , who waste millions of votes by winning lopsided margins in urban districts that pad their popular vote tallies without yielding additional seats . The GOP , in contrast , wastes fewer votes in the countryside , where Republicans generally win by smaller margins . <p> There is no guarantee that this bias will persist . If Republicans keep gaining in rural areas and Democrats keep gaining in the suburbs , Republicans might find themselves at an underlying disadvantage in the House . <p> And Democrats have one advantage of their own , in translating their votes to seats in the House : their ability to win districts with relatively few voters , often in heavily Latino areas with low citizenship rates , high numbers of children and low turnout . This advantage seems likelier to endure after the Supreme Court ruled against the Trump administration on adding a citizenship question to the census , which might have allowed states to draw districts based @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ population . ( The administration has not given up in this effort , with President Donald Trump saying the census may be delayed . ) <p> But for now the overall bias benefits Republicans , and partisan gerrymandering often increases this effect . In blue-leaning states , it is easy enough for Republican governments to draw heavily Democratic districts , anchored in cities , then divvy up the rest of a state to their advantage , as they did in Pennsylvania or Michigan . In red-leaning states , they can break up cities into multiple Republican-leaning districts , as they have in Utah or Ohio . Overall , gerrymandering probably gives the Republicans about 10 more seats than they would have otherwise . <p> In an era of growing geographic polarization , these gerrymanders can be quite durable and can even become more effective over time . In 2018 , Republican state legislative maps easily survived a Democratic wave election in states like Michigan and Wisconsin . <p> Large states ' disadvantage <p> At the same time , the American electoral system disadvantages the party of populous states through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ College . Every state gets two senators , regardless of population . <p> That has wound up disadvantaging Democrats as American electoral politics have polarized along geographic lines , since they tend to excel in the relatively populous states with big cities . <p> The Republican Senate advantage is similar to the Republican edge in the U.S. House , even though there 's no gerrymandering involved . The Democrats failed to take the Senate in 2018 despite favorable political conditions in part for this reason . <p> The Democratic Electoral College disadvantage is more a product of bad luck than geography . In a decade or two , perhaps the oddities of state lines might wind up working to Democrats ' advantage . If Texas turns blue , for instance , they 'll benefit from the fact that it did n't decide to divide itself into five states . But just because it 's bad luck for the Democrats does n't mean it 's not a real disadvantage . <p> Let 's suppose that Hillary Clinton had won the presidency in 2016 . With the typical midterm headwinds for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it 's possible that Republicans could have won a filibuster-proof majority in the Senate in 2018 by reaching 60 seats . <p> In that kind of political environment , they would have also most likely controlled the redistricting process in the crucial states again in 2020 and probably held full control of state government in nearly two-thirds of states , placing them close to what they would have needed to unilaterally amend the Constitution , had they then won the presidency in 2020 . They could have even probably succeeded in awarding electoral votes by congressional district , as was common fairly early in the country 's history and as some Republicans proposed doing after President Barack Obama 's 2012 victory . <p> Republicans could gain an even greater edge in the Senate and the Electoral College than exists today . All it would take is a continuation of current trends , with the Rust Belt turning Republican before the Sun Belt turns blue . Total Republican control of government -- say , all three branches with a filibuster-proof majority in the Senate -- would n't be hard to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could find themselves locked out of the Senate for prolonged periods and perhaps take only fleeting control of the House in midterm election years . <p> It would be hard for partisan gerrymandering to completely lock Democrats out of control of the House of Representatives , but you could n't rule it out . In terms of gerrymandering , there are certainly states where Republicans could go even further than they do today . <p> Trends can end <p> Democrats have incentive to broaden their appeal and break the cycle of partisan polarization , as they did in the 2018 midterm election . Perhaps they will do so , or maybe something else will change the balance . <p> The long-predicted " emerging Democratic majority " may never actually materialize , but the same trends could be enough to break an inexorable slide toward a large Republican structural advantage , whether it 's a breakthrough in Texas or even a blue Montana and blue Alaska brimming with West Coast expatriates by 2040 . Stranger things have happened . <p> But it is also possible that partisan and racial polarization deepen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the party 's growing diversity and level of educational attainment , make it harder for them to reach out to white , conservative working-class voters . The demographic pressures facing Republicans could push them to take more extreme steps to preserve power , like even harsher gerrymanders . <p> As Chief Justice John Roberts wrote in his majority opinion , Democrats have alternative , potential remedies to partisan gerrymandering , whether through referendums or state courts . This has already happened , to some extent , in a number of states , like California , Pennsylvania and Florida . It is likely to happen in even more states in the coming years , but it might not always be a realistic short-term option for reformers , depending on state laws and courts . <p> Partisan gerrymandering is far from the only thing that drives the risk of persistent structural imbalances in American elections . You could even make the case that it 's the least important factor . But it is one factor , and it was the factor that was easiest to imagine disappearing , until Thursday 's ruling @ @ @ @ @ @ @

Prostitution is still stigmatized in Kenya , and yet , it is not unusual for an independent upper-class woman to become one . Here are some of the prostitutes you will encounter in Nairobi : <p> 1 . Escort Agency Prostitutes Like independent call girls , employees of escort agencies work in private locations or offices and charge relatively high prices . You 'll mostly find them in high-end locations outside town such as Valley Arcade , Hurlingham and Westlands . They are considered safer because getting tested is a requirement for them before they join in . <p> 2 . House help Prostitutes This form of prostitution has suddenly emerged . Bachelors hire a yummy mama fua who does the cleaning and just after she gets paid for an extra service of sex . Married men are the majority of their customers . The most common ones are the ones from burros because a certain fee goes to the owner of the burro and she gets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an extra fee for sex , they jump in fast ! That is why there are many cases of children born of married men and their housegirls . Inaanzanga tu hivyo . <p> 3 . River Road Prostitutes These women are located in downtown Nairobi in shady brothels that are dedicated locations where guys pay for sex . The prices they charge are " moderate , " . These riveroad prostitutes also endure " moderate exploitation " since they have to give part of their earnings to the brothel owners or the pimp mama in charge . Yes , these women have a bonafide pimp who set the rules , controls their actions , and takes their earnings . Most of them are usually bleached what they call skin lightening . <p> 4 . Bar maids <p> These guys are paid pennies so why not make some extra coins . When men in the club get drunk he is very generous and hor*y . These sex workers make initial contact with men while at work then make arrangements to have sex with them at separate locations <p> 5 . Streetwalker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relatively little money and are vulnerable to exploitation . Not surprisingly , they report less job satisfaction and get paid less than " indoor prostitutes " ( bar workers , brothel workers , or call girls ) . Streetwalking is also notoriously dangerous . Some get beaten by clients or get exploited by police officers , Their services are mostly performed in the client 's car or at a cheap lodging in town . <p> 6 . Estate Prostitutes Estate prostitutes work for themselves in their houses , charge relatively fair prices , and stay away from the public eye . They likely advertise their services online , with a list of do 's and don't 's and they also get to keep their profits since they 're self-employed . Ngara is famously known for such services . They also have other jobs . They are interested in a fair and even exchange as agreed upon by themselves and the customer . Do n't be surprised to find out that the hot accountant in your accompany also doubles as a whore . <p> 7 . Socialites Vera Sidika , Huddah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confessed to being paid for sex but we know there are more . They all sell their cookie for the dollar . Socialites record greater job satisfaction since they are free from the arbitrary regulations inflicted on their lower-class sisters . They are high class glorified prostitutes .

Sponsor babes The numbers in this category are increasing by the day . College girls and young ladies who are in their first jobs are constantly looking for rich men to finance their lifestyles in exchange for sex . Even ladies that are in serious relationships are secretly seeing rich men on the side . It has become a lifestyle for these girls . <p> 9 .

When you go for a genuine massage , the girls ' touch touch ' you in all the right places then when your thirst levels are up , they inform you about other ' special packages ' . The temptation is high so you just go ahead . <p> 10 . Stripper dancer Prostitutes <p> Strippers were hard to touch back in the day . For you to touch her you needed to pay some extra cash . These days all they want is a tip so touch if you can just pay for it . We have heard of many financially stable man settling and marrying a stripper . These ladies do n't joke when it comes to sexual antics and the fact that they 're open to inviting their colleagues for threesomes and sexual experiments et al with a " date " that they have grown to " like " puts them on a level of their own . <p> 11 . Male prostitutes <p> Just in case the women have been complaining , we also have male prostitutes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there are men too whose life goals are ' kulishwa na wanawake ' in exchange for sex . I do n't know how they do it . Some even have no homes . They just jump from one woman 's house to the next .

The other group we have not added are also those who accept drinks in the club for sexual gains . They have just refused to accept the title .

@@61187232 <h> Living with the curse of elephantiasis <h> Patients can not work to earn a living and are ostracised by the society <p> For a perpetual hypochondriac , my father was very apprehensive when I joined medical school . I grew up morbidly scared of hospitals . At one time , he was admitted in hospital for six weeks and I only visited him once . I was seven years old and my childhood brain , fuelled by my mother 's reinforcement on sanitation and hygiene , was conditioned to believe that germs crawled on every hospital surface.The visit to hospital drained me . I would n't touch any surface for fear of picking up germs . It was , therefore , understandable that my father called me every Friday in my first year of medical school to ensure I was still in the programme.Like everyone else who has not been through medical school , dad asked if I had been to the morgue and touched a cadaver . He figured if I survived that then I would survive the course . People do n't realise medical students are more scared of living patients than cadavers . With the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I questioned whether I was destined to be a doctor was the most unexpected . On a random day after a laboratory session in the second year , a bunch of us were walking back to the hostels through the hospital corridors . We ran into a gentleman pushing a wheelbarrow . It took a moment to register that he was carrying his entire scrotum on the wheelbarrow . It looked like it weighed no less than 20kg.My immediate reaction was to run . I could not fathom how a living human being could possibly bear such affliction . This was my reaction as a medical student . I could not imagine what the non-medical public thought . I felt embarrassed . This is not what was expected of the conduct of a future doctor . <p> CAUSE SWELLINGEvery time I am reminded of neglected tropical diseases , this is the image that comes to mind . Elephantiasis is caused by a variety of roundworms ( filarial worms to be precise ) , which include Wucherereria bancrofti which causes almost 90 per cent of cases while Brugia malayi accounts for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other rarer species that wreak havoc on the lymphatic system.The human body has a circulatory system made up of arteries , veins and capillaries through which blood flows . It has a lymphatic system through which lymph ( a yellowish fluid containing white blood cells derived from body tissues ) flows . The lymphatic system has lymph nodes at strategic places along its channels , which produce immune cells that fight disease . These swell when you have an infection of cancer as they work in overdrive to try and contain the problem.In elephantiasis ( scientifically referred to as lymphatic filariasis ) , the adult filarial worms enter the lymphatic system where they live for their entire lifespan of about six years . They reproduce and their larva forms are released into the blood stream and taken up by mosquitoes . In the mosquito , they mature and are spread to the next person through a mosquito bite and the cycle continues . The adult worm can only survive in humans.The worm causes blockage of lymphatic channels , causing the lymph to accumulate and cause swelling of the body parts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the scrotum in men . However , in less common cases , it affects the arms and the breasts in women.The swelling is accompanied by inflammation of the skin , hardening and disfiguring it . So you can imagine what this means for the delicate , almost translucent skin of the scrotum . There is so much deposition of fibrous tissue in the scrotum , causing total disfigurement and destruction of the function of the testes , and can result in extreme enlargement of over 30kg.When the worm dies , it triggers an immune reaction that causes the patient extreme discomfort . The blocked nodes can get infected resulting in pain and ill health . The inflamed skin can break down in ulcers that are difficult to heal . <p> ENLARGED LEGSThe distress the disease causes is unimaginable . The patients can not work to earn a living , are ostracised in society and are unable to carry out normal activities due to the burden of the enlarged organs . The enlarged scrotum literally swallows up the penis , making passage of urine a difficult affair . Sexual engagement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficult.Elephantiasis is a disease mostly acquired in childhood . The symptoms build up with the passage of time . Many patients remain asymptomatic , but a considerable 30 per cent will live with its lifelong effects . The good news is eradication is possible by implementation of the World Health Organisation preventive treatment protocols . The bad news is that once the worm has established itself in the body , there is no drug that can destroy it and it must live out its lifespan . The preventive treatment protects one from being able to spread the disease.Patients with scrotal elephantiasis , like the one I met , benefit from surgery . The other types of elephantiasis require lifelong care during episodes of acute inflammation or infection , but surgery has no role in their care.The Health ministry has a dedicated department of Neglected Tropical Diseases headed by one passionate Dr Sultani Matendechero . His team launched the preventive treatment programme in 2018 and have dedicated their energies to ensuring elephantiasis is eradicated in Kenya by 2020 .

The app provides a waste management system that encourages the use of modern technology to facilitate the proper disposal of waste . <p> Having established multiple waste collection stations referred to as Taka Banks for consumers to deposit their waste , the application calculates the volume of waste from each depositor and rewards them accordingly . <p> This is a demonstration of the potential that lies in Africa to develop mutually beneficial social-economic inventions for different stakeholders within the waste recycling value chain , which will play a key role in curbing environmental pollution . For instance , in Nigeria , Organisations African Clean-Up Initiative and WeCyclers are working with Morit International School in Ajegunle , Lagos on a Recycle Pay project . BBC reports that the project allows parents to use plastic waste to pay their children 's school fees . <p> The process involves parents providing plastics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the weight converted into monetary value , which is then deducted from the school fees . <p> The plastic waste is then collected by a recycling company . <p> Globally , Norway can be described as the champion of driving an incentivised waste management scheme . <p> The Guardian has reported that the Norwegian Deposit Refund System , also known as Infinitum , was established in 1999 and is owned by Norwegian bottlers and retailers . <p> It champions the depositing and recycling of plastic bottles and beverage cans . Through this scheme , Norway has been able to recycle about 97 percent of its plastic bottles with less than one percent ending up in the environment . <p> In fact , according to the Infinitum Annual Report ( 2018 ) , only one in eight bottles washed ashore the Norwegian coastline comes from Norway .

The empty bottles and cans are then returned for recycling . <p> The success of this scheme has also been attributed to investments in various collection systems , all of which benefit from the deposit refund revenue . <p> In these examples , it is clear that we need to establish effectively managed statutory schemes that will encourage more people , organisations and NGOs to play a significant role in efficient waste management . <p> If the success of Norway is anything to go by , adding value to waste at different levels of the recycling value chain , particularly on collection is the sure way of reducing the waste in our environment . <p> Phyllis Wakiaga CEO of Kenya Association of Manufacturers and the UN Global Compact Representative for Kenya .

FILE PHOTO NMG <p> It is no use to blame the looking glass if your face is awry . -Nikolai Gogol <p> These words , written by the Ukrainian-born Russian writer more than two centuries ago , are still relevant today . <p> Organisations are retrenching and we are fallaciously blaming technology . Although Kenya is nowhere near the top on the intensity of technology use , use of technology has given Kenya a good image . Technology has enabled greater productivity and contributed to economic development . <p> However , it is not the cause of job losses in Kenya today . The experience from countries that have fully automated is such that unemployment in such a situation is temporary . Technology disrupts and shifts jobs around rather than eliminates them . <p> If there is any technology-engineered unemployment , economists often say that job losses are offset by other compensating factors . These include impact of new investment , the effect of the new technology ( operations and maintenance ) , extent of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greater efficiency . <p> The first factor is explained by increment in investments . Until the local banks put up additional investment in Information , Communication Technologies ( ICTs ) that enabled branchless banking , payment to customers especially through cheques used to take more than three weeks . The resultant efficiencies led to higher bank profits hence the motivation to expand and create more jobs . <p> The second factor can be explained by the way the technology is deployed and used . For example , when Mobile money technology was introduced , the fears were that Post Offices would lay off workers . <p> Instead , the new technology became a net creator of employments through agencies in order to operationalise the technology . As at the end 2018 , there were more than 200,000 telco agencies spread across the country . <p> The third compensating factor relates to the second one and can be explained as a possibility of new technology creating a new industry altogether . Mobile technologies have created the social media industry that never existed before . <p> This industry has created a plethora @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , blogger , app developer , hacker just to name a few . In the next few years , there will be many more jobs whose titles we do n't know today . <p> The fourth compensatory factor is the possibility of increasing the efficiency of individual workers , thus transforming the workers into useful assets in the organisation . Often , the salaries of such employees increase . <p> Salary increases boost aggregate demand and therefore greater economic output , resulting in economic growth . In the early 19th century , an oath-based organisation of English textile workers known as the Luddites , opposed the introduction of machinery , fearing that machines would replace their role in the textile industry . The Oxford English Dictionary today explains the term Luddites as " one opposed to industrialisation , automation , computerisation , or new technologies in general .

The world has become such a small village that one can easily lose competitive advantage . <p> No employer will enjoy laying off staff that they have trained for many years . Sometimes circumstances like economic slowdown and rigid unions do indeed force employee layoffs but rarely does technology cause unemployment in developing countries that have not even automated . <p> It is too early to associate emerging technologies like Artificial Intelligence to job losses . <p> What is certain is that we must continuously improve our skills in order to be relevant in future work . We must seek to be agents of economic growth and for that to happen , we must improve on productivity . Technology as I have explained above drives productivity .

@@61205234 <h> Couples ought to consistently and regularly attempt conception over a period of time to be successful <p> In the majority of cultures , having children is seen as fulfilment of a social contract and the obligation of the couple is to meet this expectation . No definition for how long the wait should be is socially enacted , and often ignores personal circumstances such as career aspirations and financial stability . Couples will often make the assumption that insofar as they are sexually intimate , fertility is guaranteed except where a conscious decision to use contraception is made . <p> Fertility is dependent on four important parameters namely , regular ovulation with patent ( open ) fallopian tubes in the female partner and normal sperm parameters in the male partner . In addition , there must be regular intercourse to allow the egg and sperm to meet and fertilise . What is often not understood is the chance of conception in one fertile ovulatory cycle , medically known as fecundity . This is the probability that a female partner will conceive in every month of being fertile when they try to . Generally , fecundity stands at about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundred fertile females only about five will conceive during each month of trying . <p> It , therefore , implies that couples ought to consistently and regularly attempt conception over a period of time to be successful .

Often , there is a tendency that to enhance conception , the attempt is made at specific times of the month , typically at around ovulation . <p> This is , however , an erroneous assumption because the outward signs of ovulation become apparent after the egg has been released . The female egg , has a very short lifespan typically about 24 hours and quickly becomes dehydrated and desiccates but the sperm cell remains viable for several days in the female genital tract .

Couples may feel frustrated , angry and could tend to want to blame certain situations in their own life experiences . Relationship strain may also occur . This is the moment where the health care team should be very supportive and also engage counselling services . <p> Options for fertility treatment should then be discussed sensitively paying attention to the individual couple circumstances and offering information based on current best evidence .

@@61211234 <h> 7 times we questioned Ringtone Apoko 's sanity <p> His name is Alex Apoko , but many know him as Ringtone . The man is a certified serial attention seeker who can go way out of line to feel relevant . As a musician , he is quite talented with many hits that have made him one of the most successful gospel artistes in the country . He is also successful in courting controversy and all its relatives . Media attention is his opium and his hunger to make headlines has led to stunts that did not impress the majority of Kenyans . Ringtone Apoko 's wealth has always been a subject of public inquiry with many Kenyans feeling that the story does not add up , but other controversies have always taken center stage when his name is mentioned . It , therefore , should not come as a surprise when Kenyan 's question Ringtone Apoko 's sanity . <p> Image : nation.co.keSource : UGC <p> Ringtone Apoko 's scandals aside , he is one of the most inspirational gospel singers in the country . The story of Ringtone is a touching and captivating one . Coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to feel touched and accept him as a testimony of how God can make something out of nothing . Apoko was abandoned by his parents at a very young age and left at the care of his grandmother . Life was unbearable , thus prompting the young Apoko to opt for life in the streets . <p> Life was not easy walk being a street boy . Perhaps it is this background that has made Ringtone accustomed to controversies and not conforming to societal expectations . While the hardships are a thing of the past , his decisions have often been questioned by mainstream media . <h> 1 . Ringtone Says Willy Paul not fit for gospel industry <p> In the past Ringtone has publicly come out denouncing fellow gospel musician as not being fit for the gospel industry . According to the controversial Ringtone , there is a certain standard that gospel musicians have to uphold , and he seems to be the one to determine that standard . Going by what he claims to be , Ringtone should , therefore , be at the forefront of promoting peace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems not to be walking the talk . He has set himself apart , making almost everything ' him against them ' . Somehow Ringtone is the caretaker of the secrets of many musicians . He claims that Nandy aborted Willy Paul 's baby . What 's more , Ringtone claimed that the story originated from Willy Paul but then why would he post it on his Instagram ? The story could only bring hate between Willy Paul and Nandy . <p> The real question here is how did Ringtone get wind of all that information ? The two artists involved in the allegations were wise enough to keep quiet about the news , thus not giving Apoko more room to advance his conspiracies . Kenyans , on the other hand , were not amused by Ringtone 's conduct . Many were of the view that the musician ought to seek mental help because he is mad . <h> 2 . A brand new Range Rover for Zari <p> For the longest time Ringtone has been hunting for a wife . Whether that is true remains to be seen . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on many fronts , not being able to find a wife . Usually , one would expect a person such as Ringtone to be spoilt for choice when it comes to selecting a wife . The gospel singer claims the opposite of that . <p> When Zari broke up with Diamond , the Kenyan musicians could not let the opportunity slip by him . Just as headlines of the Diamond- Zari split were hot , Ringtone was already in the media professing his love for the South Africa based Ugandan socialite . Ringtone was convinced or made people believe that God had shown him that Zari is the one . Ringtone did not stop at that , he went as far as saying that he would lead Zari to God . <p> About that time , Zari happened to be visiting Kenya . Ringtone claimed to have bought a brand new range rover for Zari as a sign if his love . The problem is that Ringtone and Zari had never met before , and as such , he could n't claim to have loved her . Furthermore , Zari @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rover would n't do the trick if Ringtone was serious about wanting to impress her . <h> 3 . Chairman of gospel musicians <p> Apparently , there is a chairman of the Gospel musicians of Kenya and it is none other than Ringtone Apoko himself . That would be nice if he was elected to such a post , but that did not happen . In fact , neither was he nominated nor endorsed for such a position . <p> The musician imposed the title on himself , and other gospel musicians knew better not to give the attention he was seeking . He first came out with the story of him being chairman while addressing the beef between Mr. Seed and Bahati . As usual , Ringtone saw an opportunity for attention , and he jumped on it . It was a nasty exchange between Mr. Seed and Bahati that ended with Mr. Seed parting ways with his boss . <p> As the ' chairman of gospel musicians ' Ringtone should have been the mediator and try to reconcile the two . On the contrary , Ringtone went from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gratitude to pioneers in the industry such as himself . When questioned on who appointed him as the chairman of gospel artists , he responded that he only assumed the position since one was there . <h> 4 . A herder in Karen <p> Naturally , one would not expect to a herd of 40 cows grazing by the roadside in Karen . It is a quiet estate where some of the wealthiest people in Kenya live . Having one or two cows in a zero-grazing unit is sensible , but rearing 40 of them is a different story altogether . That is why Kenyans could not believe when Ringtone claimed that he had 40 cows in his Karen residence . <p> Ringtone shared a letter on social media , claiming that the Karen Resident 's Association would take legal action against him for keeping the cows in the estate . The letter alleges that several residents had complained hence he had to act swiftly . Amid the warning letter , the association found time to express their joy in having a celebrity living amongst them . <p> Somehow , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ music-making a section of Kenyans to doubt the authenticity of the letter . It would emerge that the letter was fake . There is no Karen Residents Association . Instead , there is a Karen Lang'ata District Association . Such are the lengths the musician can go in an attempt to remain relevant . <h> 5 . Quest to find love <p> The Ringtone Apoko looking for a wife story has been around for a while . Apoko announcing his love on the radio , did not start with Zari . Years before , Apoko had announced that he wanted to marry Tanzanian musician Ray C. Ray C was also hunting for a partner at the time , but she rejected Ringtone 's offer . <p> In an attempt to shove his humiliation , Apoko claimed that he was not interested in marrying that Tanzanian hitmaker . It has , however , become a trend where Apoko claims to want to marry a woman saying that he is inspired by God to do so . Now , the singer has taken his search for a wife to another level . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the media . He has since taken to the streets with a placard asking women to marry him . <p> A section of media claims that Ringtone was recently arrested outside Co-operative University while looking for a wife . The reports claimed that he was arrested for causing confusion and promoting prostitution . He claims to be looking for a God-fearing , prayerful , hardworking and humble woman for a wife but Kenyans have been quick to write him off as an attention seeker . <h> 6 . A priest and a spiritual husband <p> After failing to woo Zari and make her his wife , Ringtone pulled another stunt claiming that he had opted to be a priest . His energy was focused on becoming a priest something even he knew that many would not believe . He even posted photos on Instagram of himself dressed as a priest , but it would later come to light that he was only shooting a video for a song . <p> Fast forward and Apoko ca n't seem to stop his quest for a wife . Once again he claimed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was Tanzania 's , Jacqueline Wolper . According to the singer , Wolper is his wife spiritually . He was hopeful that his friendship with the top actress from Tanzania will end in marriage . <p> As is the case with his stunts , it emerged that he was doing all this in preparation for his song titled Natafuta Bibi . Jacqueline Wolper is a video vixen in the song 's video , and the claim was only a way of marketing the song . <h> 7 . Shutting the door on Stevo Simple Boy <p> Self-righteousness is not the best trait for someone who claims to be born again . It is because such a person is expected to be humble and respect all people regardless of who they are . It seems Apoko has passed judgment on who is worthy of being a gospel singer and who is not . He made headlines recently for condemning Willy Paul after the former decided to shift from gospel to secular music . <p> Apoko did not take this lightly , making it known that he was opposed to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Apoko has come under heavy criticism for his outbursts towards Stevo Simple Boy . Stevo Simple Boy is an upcoming artist who was also on the receiving end after Apoko labeled him a ' Mihadarati Singer ' and not a gospel singer . <p> Apoko issued a stern warning that Stevo Simple Boy should stick to secular music after the new musician released a gospel song . He claimed that before doing any gospel music , Stevo Simple Boy should declare to be a born again Christian and make it known where he goes to church . The gospel industry has no shortage of musicians according to Ringtone , and therefore , newcomers have to be vetted . <p> Whenever Ringtone Apoko opens his mouth to speak or posts on social media , he tends to leave people with many questions than answers . If it is not about his source of wealth , it would be about his quest to find a wife or an attempt to intervene on some trending subject .

@@61216231 <h> Police handling of Tangatanga Jubilee wing raises eyebrows <p> The shameful confrontation between nominated MP Maina Kamanda and Kiharu lawmaker Ndindi Nyoro during a church service in the latter 's backyard has once again exposed the deep fissure that has divided Jubilee Party in Mount Kenya region . <p> It all started after the two fought over the microphone after Mr Ndindi felt spited when he found Mr Kamanda acting as the master of ceremonies during a harambee at Gitui Catholic Church in Kiharu . Ndindi insisted that , as the local MP , he was the one supposed to act as the host and not Kamanda . Without doubt , the standoff was disgraceful and the two ought to apologise to the church for desecrating the holy place . Had one of them restrained himself , the ugly scene would not have unfolded . In fact , it is such crude behaviour that has made some priests to ban politicians from ever speaking in their churches . But ugly as it was , the standoff underscored the obvious ; that the political class in Central , that is used to speaking in one voice , is split @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tangatanga teams will build bridges any time soon . For the record , Tangatanga supports Ruto and his 2022 presidential ambition while Kieleweke comprises politicians who are determined to ensure Ruto will not be elected president . Deputy President WIlliam Ruto with Kirinyanya Woman Rep Purity Ngirici , Kiharu MP Ndindi Nyoro and other leaders at a past church service in Murang'a County . DPPS <p> We can not begrudge the two camps of their positions . Whether to support a political candidate or not is a personal choice and a democratic right . Freedom of speech and association are key pillars of our democracy . No one should be vilified or crucified for exercising these freedoms . Sadly , Tangatanga , which Ndindi is a member , claim they are being targeted for supporting the deputy president . In fact , speaking on Inooro TV , a Kikuyu vernacular station , after Sunday 's altercation , Ndindi claimed even before he attended the church service , he had been warned that he would be arrested that very day . And that is not all . The MP and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death threats , and reported to the police , from unknown people for being members of the group . If this , if true , it is most chilling . These allegations should be taken with the seriousness they deserve . There is need to establish whether someone has indeed threatened the MPs ' lives . <p> In addition , there is need to pay special attention to the MPs claims that police are targeting them , for indeed they have shown bias against the Tangatanga . While they were justified to seek the immediate arrest of Ndindi -- even laying siege outside the TV station -- it boggles the mind why they drag their feet when it comes to dealing with those who engage in similar impropriety on the Kieleweke side . <p> A case in point is Nyeri Town MP Ngunjiri Wambugu . Last month , the MP was captured on video leading a group of youths who disrupted pro-Ruto 's Inua Mama group in Nyeri . That appears to have escaped the glare of the police as Ngunjiri has never been questioned . In June , Mr @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Secretary Mwangi Kiunjuri 's development meeting in Nyeri . Kiunjuri is perceived to be on the Tangatanga side . Again , police appear to have missed this daylight breach of the peace as there is no evidence the MP or the youths were ever taken to task . These two incidents give credence to the Tangatanga members ' claim that they are being targeted unfairly . There seems to be double standards in the police treatment of suspected errant members of Tangatanga and Kieleweke teams . This should not be the case . The law should be applied equally to all Kenyans , and it should never be seen to favour a section of people , more so for their political inclinations . The Tanganga group has a good reason to cry foul . Police should shun strongly any effort to use them as pawns in political wars . It has happened before and they have always been left carrying the monkey on their backs . They must always show fidelity to the Constitution by doing what is right and just . They must remain impartial and true to their @ @ @ @

Right , Nominated MP Maina Kamanda after last Sunday 's clash with Kiharu MP Ndindi Nyoro in Murang'a . File , Standard Political and religious leaders in the Mt Kenya region have condemned the upsurge of political chaos in the region as President Uhuru Kenyatta succession talk gathers momentum . <p> The spectre of violence looms large , as the race to succeed Uhuru starts to shape up and the erstwhile calm region becomes a political hotbed . A number of chaotic scenes have been witnessed as two political factions contest for supremacy . Yesterday , leaders traded accusations over an altercation between Kiharu MP Ndindi Nyoro and nominated MP Maina Kamanda . The incident at Gitui Catholic Church in Kiharu Constituency on Sunday prompted Murang'a Catholic Bishop James Maria Wainaina to cancel all events in the church where politicians have been invited . " I am hurting over what happened , " said the prelate . Bishop Wainaina has demanded an apology from politicians over the incident @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Murang'a and will be arraigned today . County CID boss Julius Rutere confirmed Nyoro was arrested by a team of GSU personnel at an event he was presiding over . Despite being nearly three years to the next election , Uhuru 's succession politics has thrust his Mt Kenya backyard into the limelight , with high octane politics . For the past three months the region has seen an upsurge confrontations associated with the factional Jubilee wars pitting Uhuru supporters against those of his Deputy William Ruto . Members of the ruling Jubilee Party are divided between Tangatanga and Kieleweke political groupings , with each faction accusing the other of politicking at the expense of development . In a region where violence has not been a hallmark of local politics , the recent incidences involving disruption of functions has sparked concern , with some religious and political leaders calling for cessation of hostilities . Sunday was the third time a public meeting was ending in acrimony in less than two months . Last month , two similar functions were disrupted . Agriculture CS Agriculture Cabinet Secretary Mwangi Kiunjuri 's function @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nyeri Town MP Ngunjiri Wambugu , a follower of Kieleweke team , stormed the venue with his supporters . Mr Wambugu accused the conveners of the meeting of " bringing politics in a development function . " Two weeks later , Ngunjiri was at it again , storming a meeting convened by a group of women leaders under the Inua Mama Initiative , and accusing them of " politicking instead of supporting the President to achieve the Big Four agenda . " Earlier yesterday , while attending his first public function in his constituency after the Sunday 's tiff , Nyoro said he was being threatened with arrest because of his close links with Dr Ruto . " It should be noted that my mistake is failure to heed to Kamanda 's request that I support Raila 's political mission , " said the Kiharu MP . He accused Interior and National Coordination Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang'i and Principal Secretary Karanja Kibicho of being behind the plot to have him arrested . Murang'a County police commander Josphat Kinyua said the MP was wanted for creating disturbance , assaulting a policeman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , said Nyoro was not invited to the fundraiser . He said detectives were looking for the MP to charge him . Rutere confirmed that his officers had been trailing the MP . " He should be advised to report to any police station before we go for him , " said Rutere . But Nyoro argues that plans to arrest him have nothing to do with the Sunday incident . " Plans to arrest me were not hatched at Gitui Catholic Church on Sunday , but in a private residence in Murang'a , " claimed Nyoro . He said he spent the rest of last Sunday in hiding after a contingent of police trailed him to a TV station in Nairobi . Gatundu South MP Moses Kuria criticised the Sunday 's public spat , saying it painted Mt Kenya region in bad light . " Jubilee Kieleweke and Jubilee Tangatanga desecrated the House of God in Murang'a , " said Mr Kuria . " With more than 1,000 days to go before the next elections , the rest of the country is calm . One can be forgiven for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kenya only , " he said . Ngunjiri claims there is a larger plot to undermine Uhuru in his Central Kenya backyard by Ruto and his supporters . " There is a political leader who has dedicated his intellect , political prowess and money to not only split the Mt Kenya region into different political camps , but to also make sure that one camp is more loyal directly to him than it is to President Uhuru Kenyatta , " said Ngunjiri . Frustrating MPs Kandara MP Alice Wahome said there was a plot to frustrate MPs from Central Kenya that were associated with Ruto . " I am aware that there was a meeting that took place a week ago in Murang'a in the home of a senior businessman , where there were discussions to cut us down to size , " said Ms Wahome .

The study has been accepted for publication in Journalism , a major international peer-reviewed journal . Dr Kiambi collected data from Kenyan journalists and used a mixed-method approach in his " Journalists ' Level of Knowledge on Empirical Research and Opinion Polling " study . He surveyed 71 political reporters from the print and broadcast media houses on their levels of knowledge on aspects of empirical research and opinion polling in his first part . He later conducted one-on-one interviews with nine editors who were familiar with the reporting skills of political reporters . The survey study measured the knowledge of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ types of sampling participants -- probability and non-probability sampling -- sampling frame , margin of error , and the different types of probability and non-probability sampling techniques among others issue of survey research . <p> Results from one of the questions on the types of sampling showed that 63.4 per cent of the Kenyan journalists who participated in the study did not know that findings from a non-random or non-probability sample can not be generalized to the population .

" Because a close presidential election triggers claims of rigging by opposing political camps thus leading to inter-ethnic fighting , skilled journalistic reporting on concepts such as margin of error could help put the poll results into perspective for the public thus lessening the perpetual claims of election rigging and inter-ethnic fighting that characterizes Kenyan elections " Dr Kiambi writes in his sole-authored publication .

@@61232238 <h> In the age of social media , parents need to be more alert <p> Over the past few days , many conversations on social media have revolved around a video posted by a teenager on his Instagram account . The video has raised many questions including how much access children should have to the Internet . Gone are the days when parents could leave their children alone for days with caregivers who were more in charge of their upkeep ( hygiene , nutrition and safety ) than their intellectual and emotional growth . The parents of 2019 and beyond will need to be emotionally and intellectually available for their children . Whether they do this by being physically or remotely present is something every parent will have to figure out individually . <p> By remotely present , I mean that parents will have to understand and connect with their children even when they are away from home . The best option would be to be there physically but , with the demands of providing for the family , it is almost impossible to ask working parents to always be home whenever their children are . So how do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from home ? Unless a family has telepathic abilities , the answer most obviously points to technology . <p> Many parents have resorted to buying their children cellphones complete with communication applications such as Skype , WhatsApp and Messenger and ensuring there is even a reliable internet connection -- to allow their children to communicate with them whenever they are away . The problem though is that by opening these communication channels to their children , they have also opened a window ( or even a door ) for other people to reach their children . In the best scenario , these people are their schoolmates next door who need to borrow a textbook or their teacher who needs to communicate some changes on an assignment . <p> But there are other scenarios too . Parents can expose their children to people they would n't want their children to come into contact with ; from the wrong crowd and cyberbullies to ill-intentioned predators such as paedophiles and identity fraudsters . Monitoring social media accounts and limiting exposure to internet may not be enough any more . Children are coming up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teenagers have multiple accounts -- one to fool their parents into thinking they are posting " innocent " things . They call this the " finsta " or " fake Instagram " account . Then there 's the other account where they post the things their parents or teachers would n't approve of , where they can take on another persona without being noticed , basically a " burner account " that is not related to their real identity . Protecting your children online might not be as easy as withdrawing their gadgets either . Children will always find a way to get what they feel they need .

Honestly , children still need guidance with a lot of things . Yes , digitally , they seem to be the ones teaching us things but we should never ever confuse that with them being emotionally and intellectually capable of handling what 's in the digital world . Being on social media allows people to communicate more indirectly and gives them the courage to say and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be anything from flirting with a stranger to confronting a person over an issue . <p> Most adults are able to handle the feelings that come from these interactions but children are ill-equipped to do so .

@@61304233 <p> An enduring challenge experienced by the taxman is persistent below target revenue collections .

The doctors who examined her were troubled when they could not feel a heartbeat . With her history of losing past pregnancies just before delivery , the doctors were determined to ensure that this time round , the pregnancy came to fruition . <p> " I woke up from the theatre and when I asked for my baby , l could not believe what the doctors were telling me ! That my child had died !

The doctors sadly explained to her that the baby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pain she was experiencing was an attempt by her body to eject the foetus . <p> Mia suffered from intra-uterine foetal death -- where babies die in the uterus before they are born . This can usually happen during the last half of the pregnancy or during labour and birth , when such a death is considered an intrapartum death . When the baby who has died during labour and birth is born , this is known as a stillbirth . A baby who is born alive but dies in the first four weeks of life is recorded as a neonatal death . <p> " I can not believe that this is the third child I am losing ! I do n't understand why this is happening ! Or is my body not ready to carry the babies ? " Mia said in anguish . <p> WHY IT 'S SO BAFFLING <p> According to 2018 Unicef statistics , every year , an estimated 2.6 million babies are stillborn , yet half of them are alive at the start of labour . <p> World Health Organisation notes that early foetal death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per cent of pregnancies in the developed world . <p> Mia , like many others , have lost their unborn children without knowing exactly what happened .

Fifty-six percent of infant deaths in Kenya occur during the first month of life . <p> As I talk to Mia , I meet Mercy Kerubo , who narrates her own tragic story . She lost her baby while three months pregnant . <p> " Before going to see a doctor the previous week , I had a sharp pain in my stomach . It took 10 to 15 minutes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friend of mine , who said the pain was normal but that I should go for a check-up immediately , which I did , " she said . <p> Mercy told the Star that when she arrived at the hospital , she met pregnant women who were also waiting for the gynaecologist appointment . <p> " Before the doctor could attend to me , a woman came out of the doctor 's office , dazed and crying .

There was no heartbeat , " Mercy recalls in tears . <p> She and Mia are yet to come to terms with the loss of their babies . Both are still angry with their doctors because none of them told them the cause of death . <p> Mia and Mercy are just among the many women who lose their babies every day in Kenya . The failure by the medical personnel to give proper explanations or educate women on what causes these deaths mean that many would-be mothers go through life blaming themselves , their ' blood ' and even ' curses ' for the loss of their babies before term . <p> WHAT CAUSES IT <p> Early pregnancy losses are those that occur during the first trimester of the pregnancy . A trimester is usually about 12-13 weeks . <p> More than 80 per cent of newborn deaths are a result of premature birth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sepsis , meningitis and pneumonia . <p> Similar causes , particularly complications during labour , also account for a large share of stillbirths . <p> Speaking to the Star , Kenyatta National Hospital gynaecologist Grace Wanjiku said the commonest cause of the deaths is ' genetic abnormalities ' . <p> " These are inherent ' mistakes ' in the genetic codes carried by the egg and the sperm . These are inherited down generations and some are unique to the individual parents . They account for a very big percentage of the spontaneous abortions , " she said . <p> Wanjiku said structural problems , such as congenital ( inborn ) abnormalities of the uterus in the mother 's womb , could also cause the deaths . <p> " There are also acquired abnormalities , such as fibroids or adhesion in the uterus due to previous treatments that involve instrumentation of the uterus .

Diabetes tends to kill babies just before they are due for birth , and it 's usually sudden death . This again is if the diabetes is not controlled , " she said . <p> KEEPING THE BABY ALIVE <p> One way is through preconcept ( pre-pregnancy ) care , whereby the prospective mother visits an ob-gyn and gets evaluated and advised on her suitability for pregnancy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> She notes that slightly more than half ( 58 per cent ) of pregnant women made four or more antenatal care visits during their pregnancy , an increase from 47 per cent since the 2008-09 KDHS . <p> Women should also start antenatal clinic as early as possible . <p> Frequent visits provide a critical opportunity for health providers to deliver care , support and information to pregnant women , and identify and prevent adverse pregnancy outcomes . <p> Regular and consistent visits to the hospital as advised by the doctor can also avert stillbirths . This helps to pick any problem ( for example , high blood pressure or blood sugar ) early on and intervene appropriately . <p> One should ensure delivery in a hospital or a facility that can offer skilled delivery services .

@@61321234 <h> What does the future of mass transit look like ? <p> Firstly , climate change will no longer be ignored by the United States of America . Secondly , the idea of car ownership and human drivers could go away . As we speak , Google is already fiddling with the possibility of having driverless cars , something that would have a great impact on the transport industry . The last thing that could happen , or is already at the centre stage , is the usage of technology to solve the challenges our public transport system faces . Kenya is a market with a need for a stable solution to its perennial traffic snarl ups . Since 1974 , public transport patronage has increased substantially in Kenya and has supported and benefitted many commuters who use it in their day to day activities . Consequently , the capacity of public transport has suffered an underwhelming sufficiency to meet the public demand during peak hours . As a result , it has created overcrowding at different stations and long waiting times at bus stops by commuters . The lack of modernisation of our transport system has also led @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day on our roads . Despite the challenges faced , there has been a breath of fresh air in our public transport system . Tech wizards and dreamers are re-inventing mobility and championing the ease of movement in the country . The experience provided to users , in terms of comfort , reliability , safety and above all convenience , is critical in determining demand for transport services . <p> It is no longer a vision of utopia but a doable reality as we are witnessing . Bus rides summoned with apps such as SWVL are providing commuters with convenience and efficiency- something that has not been enjoyed by the current public commuter generation . When transport is therefore combined with technology , it creates enormous efficiencies . Whereas private transport is rapidly growing in Kenya , owing to exponential population growth and the growing middle class , it is however key to note its high environmental impact . Imagine not having to use your car and instead , taking that time to get some extra work done or start a side hustle , rather than sitting in traffic that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Choosing to use public transport also creates room for physical activity . For instance , for you to take a shuttle to your place of work , you may need to take a walk from home to your transit point , thus giving you the opportunity to have the brisk walk you have been postponing . The bus-hailing apps have enormous potential to reduce congestion , pollution and energy consumption . Though the public transport system has been viewed dismally , bus-hailing apps are injecting speed , flexibility and reliability into the ecosystem . All you have to do is sign up and get your ride at the touch of a button . Millions of Kenyans still rely on the public transport system to get them from one place to another , and not many can afford owning private transport or parting with , what is comparatively , a fortune to take a taxi home . Bus-hailing apps have the opportunity to shift the mindset of consumers , and other stakeholders alike . The Government is clearly willing to find a solution and has been looking to crack the bus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bus-hailing has striking similarities to BRT and therefore its successes can be replicated in government-run mass transit . The 2009 national census declared Nairobi 's population at just over 3.1 million people . With the increased rural urban migration , that number has steeply increased and current estimates put the population in the capital city at double that . This means that there are about 4 million people that commute to and from work on a daily basis , leading to the clog up at rush hour . One solution can not solve the problem , so there is need for a multi-pronged approach to it . Tech-based companies are constantly collecting data that is relevant to the mass transit and commuter sectors . We should also look to create an avenue through which this data can be shared with relevant government agencies to help them in urban development .

These are Botswana , Ethiopia , Rwanda , Seychelles , Uganda , Tanzania , Senegal , Malawi , Zambia and Zimbabwe . <p> Head of Vaccines and Immunisation Programme in the country Collins Tabu has attributed this to global supply issues rather than local challenges . <p> WHY LAUNCH WAS DELAYED <p> The rollout was scheduled after two successful pilot projects in Kitui county schools in four years demonstrated acceptability and effectiveness . <p> The objective of the pilot was to identify the best approaches for HPV vaccination in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was not by design that we had to keep shifting . One of the considerations before you start introducing a vaccine as a country and as a rule into the immunisation schedule , you must be assured of the continuous uninterrupted availability of that particular vaccine across all levels all through , " Tabu said . <p> " Once you start vaccinating against a disease , you do not stop unless one of two things happens : unless you have totally eradicated the disease against which you are vaccinating , or Jesus comes , whichever happens first . " <p> It will be supplemented with school outreaches and community outreaches targeting girls who might be out of school , to ensure no girl misses out on the vaccine . <p> " Before you start , you must be consciously aware that you have mapped out your needs going forward . Remember Kenya is not introducing this vaccine in a silo .

The government will be evaluating the information as it goes along with the vaccine introduction . <p> " But when you realise that if you have a condition that lowers the protection of the vaccine , then this is more the reason you have to ensure that a more potent and effective vaccine has been delivered to these particular girls , " he said . <p> " And maybe even consider an extra dose , like could be recommended to HIV positive individuals , who are recommended to get an extra dose , like a third dose .

We are coming in on the lower half . It 's a bit embarrassing , " Tabu said . <p> Women 4 Cancer co-founder Benda Kithaka said , " Cervical cancer is not a death sentence . It can be prevented through the vaccine . Way before the girl is introduced to HPV virus , we can help her build her immunity . The vaccine has been proven worthy and effective . " <p> It is probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if the girls are disease-free , we then have the benefits extended to the boys as well <p> National Vaccines head Collins Tabu <p> WHY GIRLS NOT BOYS <p> Statistics from the ministry show that nine women die every day due to cervical cancer , about 3,000 a year . <p> In 2018 , there were 5,250 cases of cervical cancer and 3,286 deaths in Kenya , according to the Ministry of Health . This equates to nine deaths per day , with the number of cases on the rise . <p> Globally , it is the fourth most frequent cancer in women . At the same time , 10.3 million women aged 15 years and above are at risk of developing the disease . <p> The World Health Organisation recommends vaccination of all girls and screening at least once every year for older women to reduce cancer risk , and that the vaccine is most effective when administered between the ages of nine and 14 . <p> The government , as part of the rollout plan , will support the training of school nurses on HPV vaccination and support @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The HPV vaccine also prevents other types of cancers like anal warts and cancer and vulvar cancer . <p> But Tabu said boys will wait longer before they can also receive the human papillomavirus vaccine that prevents some cancers . <p> The Public Health official said it was more effective to target girls because 99 per cent of cancers caused by HPV affect women . <p> " Remember we are introducing the vaccine to protect our girls from cervical cancer . We do know that the vaccine might be able to protect against other conditions , such as genital warts , anal cancer and even oesophagal cancer , " he said . <p> Like any virus , there is no cure for HPV , but it is preventable through vaccination . <p> Studies show that because HPV is mostly sexually transmitted , so vaccinating boys and men also helps protect women . <p> " While it might be looked at from that perspective , we may need to consider that it is probably most cost-effective to target the girls and by extension , if the girls are disease-free , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Tabu told the Star . <p> The virus is spread sexually and women tend to be infected with it at one time or another in their lives , especially during their sexual debut . <p> Whereas in most women , the immune system clears away HPV naturally , for a small percentage , the virus persists in the cervix.

Fast forward to 1980s when Kenya Railways Corporation was hit with financial crisis and the estate lost its glory , turning into a slum . This week marks the end of pre-colonial structures sitting on a 23-acre land sandwiched between the Kisumu-Kakamega road on the east and Obote Road on the west , as the county government replaces the space with a market . <p> The area has 886 units and the demolitions will affect over 10,000 residents , according to the Secretary of the Estates Residents Association Chrispine Obara . <p> Rendered homeless <p> " We have 880 official units built by Kenya Railways and over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having between 5 and 10 people , approximately 10,000 people will be rendered homeless , " he said .

Following the collapse of the corporation , many of its premises which previously hosted its workers have been turned to commercial and residential premises . In Kisumu , some of these premises include Kibos Railways , Nyalenda Railways , Milimani Railways , Lower Railways and Upper Railways . Upper Railways was built in early 1900 when the Uganda Railways reached Kisumu . After the completion of the railways , the houses which housed construction workers were issued to middle and low cadre employees while senior employees and managers were hosted at Nyalenda Railways and Milimani Railways .

The repossessions have seen over 10,000 traders displaced as the famous Lwang'ni Beach , Akamba Business Centre and Winmat Market were brought down . And now , the shocker has fallen on Upper Railways Estate , which has about 880 housing units , but has hosted over 1,200 families following development of extensions . <p> Evictions stopped <p> " For the sake of the many lives which will be affected by the demolitions , we are working towards filing a petition in court to have the evictions stopped as we discuss our fate , " said Mr Obara .

We are not opposed to leaving , but we needed time to get another place . Many people have lived here all their lives and will need some time to get out , probably three-month notice would do , " he said . According to Obara , the area hosts over 200 candidates who are sitting their Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education ( KCPE ) examinations in various day schools around the area .

@@61399234 <h> Pros and cons of lead independent director <p> I remembered this during a recent discussion with an old friend about the merits and demerits of having a lead independent director ( LID ) on a board . The role of the lead independent director evolved in the United States corporate governance practice due to the fact that the role of the chairperson and CEO were typically held by one person resulting in a lack of independent leadership of critical board functions . It is now a recommended board governance practice regardless of whether the chairperson is independent of management or not . <p> If you have sat on a board or observed board engagements you will know that boards are made up of humans and , subsequently , are prone to the vagaries of human dynamics . <p> Human dynamics are replete with positive , neutral and negative engagements which burnish the surface of the board 's interrelationships . The positive engagements enhance the board 's own interactions with management , providing rich insights and constructive challenge to management 's performance . <p> The negative engagements should technically be the building blocks of board maturity as members learn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between themselves and management . But they can be very draining and destructive if the board chairperson makes no attempts to quickly draw everyone back together and move forward back into a positive or neutral territory . Consequently whether a board is functional or dysfunctional is corollary to a board chairperson 's personality and leadership ability . <h> Also Read <p> The South African King III Corporate Governance guidelines recognized this and recommend that boards should appoint a LID in situations where the independence of the chair was in question . Since the King Code is an iterative document that takes into account the dynamism and fluidity of corporate governance situations , King IV goes ahead to recommend that the role of the LID should be a permanent role regardless of whether the chair is independent or not . What 's the thinking behind this ? <p> Marion Plouhinec , in a Harvard Law Forum article titled The Role of the Lead Director , describes the LID as a highly versatile intermediary between the chair , the board and the board 's stakeholders . She says that in normal times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ board , but in periods of stress the LID is expected to assist in facilitating the resolution of any situation . <p> The LID is an alternative communication channel for board members , which can be especially useful when they have concerns which they believe have not been properly considered by the chair or board as a whole . Marion opines further on why a LID is necessary , writing that the LID must keep a keen eye on whether the chair is still performing their role to the board 's satisfaction without losing objectivity or independence . <p> They monitor the relationship between the chair and the CEO and ensures that it is a well-functioning working relationship without becoming too close or powerful . The LID also has the key responsibility to lead the performance evaluation of the chair , taking into account even the views of the executive directors . <p> Back to the earlier conversation with my old friend on the merits and demerits of having a LID on a board . We both agreed that the clear and present danger of having a LID on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( perceived and actual ) on the board . <p> The de jure or legal leadership power is vested in the board chairperson . Creation of a LID role provides an opportunity for the perception of an alternative power to whom independent board members or even executive directors may choose to align to . It would take a supremely confident chairperson to be comfortable with such a potential power dynamic emerging . <p> My friend then shared that in his experience , they have circumvented this tension by requiring the audit or risk committee of the board to be charged with overseeing and resolving conflicts that may emerge . <p> The advantage of this approach has been that the role of conflict management is decentralised to a committee , rather than an individual . <p> While the committee may be chaired by an individual , this individual has the comfort of stating that it was the committee that made a recommendation that might not be popular with the chairperson . The decentralization also allows the committee to take on a stronger role in ensuring governance is effectively applied where the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Managing the human dynamic on any board is challenging and a role that requires massive interpersonal skills on the part of the chair .

Despite the lower share , they remain a high-risk population . <p> Experts say the much higher , incorrect figure could only be reached by effectively double counting . <h> Verdict : New HIV infections in adolescents accounted for 16per cent , not 49per cent of the national total <p> Nearly half of new HIV infections in Kenya are among adolescents , a major drugmaker claimed during an international conference focused on the wellbeing of girls and young women . " In Kenya , 49per cent of new #HIV infections occur among adolescents , " tweetedJohnson &amp; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conference , held in Vancouver , Canada . Is this claim accurate ? We checked . The statistic is a publicly available ' estimate ' The claims were direct quotes from a session on maternal and child survival , Nicole Araujo , a Johnson &amp; Johnson spokesperson , told Africa Check . They were said by Dr Violet Oramisi of Kenya 's health ministry , Araujo said . <p> Oramisi is with the National AIDS and STI 's Control Programme ( Nascop ) , a state agency tasked with the country 's response to HIV and Aids . Oramisi told Africa Check that these were " our estimates and they are publicly available for your reference " . She added that the data was also in " recently released HIV estimates " from 2018 . New infections in adolescents much lower Launched in November 2018 , the Kenya HIV estimates report 2018 was prepared by the National Aids Control Council ( NACC ) , another state agency involved in the national response to HIV and Aids . It shows that in 2017 there were 8,177 new infections nationally among adolescents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 19 . New infections could have been as low as 2,400 or as high as 15,900 . ( Note : Estimates are given as a range to reflect the quality of underlying data and the assumptions made when calculating them . ) These adolescent infections accounted for 15.48per cent of the country 's total new HIV infections , which were estimated at 52,800 . These could have been as low as 33,400 or as high as 77,500 . How are new infections counted ? The 2018 estimates report said it used modelling tools developed by UNAids to estimate new infections . " Modelled estimates are required because it is impossible to count the exact number of people living with HIV , people who are newly infected with HIV or people who have died from Aids-related illnesses in any country , " the UN agency said . " Doing so would require regularly testing every person for HIV and investigating all deaths , which is logistically impossible and ethically problematic . " In its most recent global data , UNAids also gave 53,000 as the total new HIV infections in Kenya @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dr Vernon Mochache told Africa Check . He is an HIV/Aids researcher with the Institute of Human Virology , a University of Maryland programme which works in Kenya and former head of research at NACC . Where does 49 per cent statistic come from ? Dr Joshua Kimani is a senior researcher at the Sub Saharan African Network for TB/HIV Research Excellence , which is mainly located at the Nelson R. Mandela School of Medicine in South Africa 's University of KwaZulu-Natal . He told Africa Check that the 49per cent figure could refer to a combination of both adolescents and young adults , known as young people . This was also echoed by the University of Maryland 's Mochache . UNAids notes that the term " young people " is accepted by UN agencies to mean " persons between ages 10 and 24 " . Using this approach , we looked at the statistics from the estimates report . What do the numbers show ? <p> Kenya annual new HIV infections , 2017 <p> Age group <p> Age <p> New infections <p> Share of total new infections <p> Children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> 8,200 <p> 15.5 <p> Young adults ( male ) <p> 15-24 <p> 5,200 <p> 9.8 <p> Young adults ( female ) <p> 15-24 <p> 12,500 <p> 23.7 <p> Adults ( 15 and older ) <p> 15+ <p> 44,800 <p> 84.5 <p> All ages <p> 52,800 <p> 100 <p> Combining the new infections in adolescents ( 10-19 ) and young adults ( 15-24 ) resulted in a total of 25,900 -- or 49per cent of the 52,800 new infections as Johnson &amp; Johnson tweeted . However , this approach includes the 15 to 19 age band twice , as there is an overlap between adolescents ( ages 10 to 19 ) and young adults ( ages 15 to 24 ) . We asked Nascop for clarification on how they had come up with their figure . Unclear where numbers for 10-24 years age gap originate In March 2018 , Nascop issued a major report on how prepared health facilities in Kenya were to offer antiretroviral drugs to prevent HIV infection . This report noted that " the country still experiences a large number of new infections estimated at 52,800 in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young persons aged between 10 and 24 years . " The statistic was attributed to a " Kenya HIV estimates report 2018 " . The report of the same name was however only published seven months later , in October 2018 . A statistician with the NACC , Kipkoech Mutai , told Africa Check that the agency only generates data for 10 to 19 years and 15 to 24 years and not the 10 to 24 years bracket as claimed . Double counting caused inflated statistic Franklyn Songok , who contributed to the Nascop report , told Africa Check that the 49per cent figure was indeed derived from totalling new infections for adolescents aged 10 to 19 and those of young adults aged 15 to 24 . " That should not be the case . There is an overlap of years 15 to 19 , " Songok said . Oramisi is also listed as a contributor to this report . Dr Charles Wheelan , an economist and statistician at Dartmouth College in New Hampshire , USA , who reviewed the figures , told Africa Check it was likely there had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell , they have double counted . I can not think of another way to get to the 49per cent figure , " Wheelan told Africa Check . Claim incorrect , but youth still at risk . In the absence of any data showing adolescent new infections higher than 16per cent of all new infections , we rate this claim as incorrect . Despite this , adolescents are still at high risk . Kimani , from the Sub Saharan African Network for TB/HIV Research Excellence , said there are many reasons why adolescents and young women are particularly vulnerable to HIV infection . " They feel indestructible ... They do n't perceive themselves to be at risk and the problem is , in our setting in Kenya , there is intergenerational sex , " he said . This meant they were having more sexual experiences , including with older people for economic reasons , and using protection inconsistently .

@@61412233 <h> Raila Odinga wants MPs locked out of BBI <p> Prime Minister Raila Odinga at Bomas of Kenya during the launch of Building Bridges Initiative report ( Photo : Stafford Ondego ) Reality of the bumpy road ahead for political reforms in the country is finally dawning even before the ink dries on the Building Bridges Initiative Report unveiled on Wednesday . <p> Among the pointers to a precarious journey ahead are demands by Opposition leader Raila Odinga that MPs be locked out of the process . This is likely to open a new battle front with allies of Deputy President William Ruto who are pushing for Parliament to take the lead in the reforms . The battle revolves , among other issues , the creation of a Prime Minister 's post , a key pillar of the report . Yesterday , Raila said recommendations in the report should be subjected to a referendum and MPs kept away from the document . Speaking during the opening of his new party offices in Lavington , Raila said : " The process must be people owned , it must not be taken to Parliament . It is the people to own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than 25 MPs drawn from from Jubilee , Orange Democratic Movement ( ODM ) , Wiper , Amani National Congress , Kanu and Economic Freedom Party .

This committee will flag the relevant issues that need amendment , so that Kenyans can start organising themselves on how to make the decisions that need to be made on each issue , " said the MPs in a statement read by Homa Bay Woman Rep Gladys Wanga . <p> At the heart of the matter are fears of a plot by allies of the DP to hijack and even kill the process in Parliament .

" We do not need a referendum , however , there are those hell-bent on the same . They want the referendum for the sake of having it . They want to take Kenyan to early elections . Why should we spend Sh30 billion on referendum when we have other pressing issues to be discussed ? " asked Senate Majority leader Kipchumba Murkomen . Gatundu South MP Moses Kuria said he supports a parliamentary reform process citing the 2016 reforms in the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission that removed the Issak Hassan led team . <p> " Mr President , the people of Kenya have spoken .

Yet the quality of speakers and stories has attracted interest from people wanting to get public speaking instruction . This prompted Agatha and Donald to start the Engage Masterclass programme , a communication coaching programme held every month . <p> Engage Kenya 's winning formula has also brought international attention . In September 2019 Agatha and Donald were invited to Cornell University , a top American institution , to run Storytelling for Science session . <p> This is a one-week storytelling master class for one of Cornell 's fellowship programmes .

It is of etchings and watercolours -- and what an interesting debut it is . <p> But first Cartoon -- and life in the villages that surround the Kenyan capital . <p> Of his 21 brightly coloured oils on canvas , the majority portray everyday village life with the family at its heart.And at the heart of the family is the mother . <h> Also Read <p> Cartoon 's paintings focus on the large families in small villages , thriving essentially through the mothers ' overarching care and a selfless sharing of resources . <p> This glowing view of family life is promoted in painting after painting in canvases so richly coloured and intricately designed they could almost be mistaken for tapestries . <p> Patterns on steroids for sure . <p> Typical is The Nature of People in Our Village , a giant at 180 x 163cm , ( pictured above ) , in which his motif of a hand thrust into the neck of an earthenware pot can be seen in the centre . <p> Also typical of his output is the way Cartoon continues to segment the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regional painters including , notably , James Mbuthia -- in an attempt to show that Kenyans are of many tribes yet can all live together in harmony . <p> After the rowdy , complex canvases of Cartoon Joseph , the cool simplicity of Patrick Imanjama 's work comes as a welcome foil . <p> Almost inevitably , with his connection to Dar , Imanjama 's 17 etchings and 12 watercolours bear echoes of Tingatinga mannerisms , with their flattened perspectives , clear colours , stylised animals and emphasis on design . <p> This artist has sufficient skill to bend the style to suit , producing subtle works yet with a comforting resonance and for those who want it , a highly developed accomplishment in etching itself , with its fellow traveller of deep bite marks in thick , luscious paper . <p> If you like that sort of thing ( and I certainly do ) then Imanjama 's etchings are to die for ; a celebration both of the wildlife that forms the majority of his subject matter and of the etching process . <p> The artist developed his etching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the lessons were well taken . <p> The closest I can get to a comparison with other regional painters , apart from the Tingatinga school of Oyster Bay ( should it help us all to get our bearings ) is with Kivuthi Mbuno , whose hunters and animals are locked in perpetual struggle against gaudy backgrounds of make believe mountains . <p> Interestingly , both Mbuno and Imanjama have artist sons -- Titus in Mbuno 's case and Raymond in Imanjama 's -- who produce work almost indistinguishable from their fathers ' . ( One or two of Raymond 's works can be seen in a folder included in this show . ) <p> However , if Imanjama has created his own world , it is not of fantasy ( unless you are an authoritarian zoologist ) but of a more factual landscape populated with creatures we immediately recognise . <p> True the zebras feature a sort of snub-nosed sneer -- but in life they do , do n't they ? -- and the elephants have faintly human expressions and , yes , the big cats verge toward the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the scenes have been taken down verbatim . <p> This artist controls his colours well .

D for divorce details in Linturi/Keittany The Kenyan public was treated to raunchy details of the love-gone-awry between Senator Mithika Linturi and ex-Deputy President aide Maryanne Keitany .

I for interest rates Three years after capping commercial lending rates at not more than 4 percent above Central bank of Kenya benchmark rate , the government reversed the decision in 2019 . Borrowers were then left once again at the mercy of commercial banks as MPs failed to reverse the move . J for the stalled judicial appointments Judicial Service Commission spent considerable time interviewing and selecting judges only to realize that its word may not have been final . The President dithered in issuing the formal appointments leading to an ongoing court case . In the meantime , Court of Appeal judges continued to shrink as judges retired , were promoted or died . K for Kipchoge the great Eliud Kipchoge proved himself worthy of the title " Greatest of all time " marathoner after he successfully completed the INEOS challenge of running a marathon in under two hours .

The matter dissipated in thin air . M for mercury purportedly found in sugar Thousands of tonnes of rice , sugar and fertilizer were confiscated in government renewed war against contraband goods in first quarter of 2019 .

Later , the government banned popular maize flours claiming their contained aflatoxin . N for NIS men who took charge In 2019 , President Uhuru Kenyatta completed his vision of key institutions being run by National Intelligence Service ( NIS ) luminaries .

Outside Kenya , Robert Mugabe the former Zimbabwean independence hero and President passed away this year . Q for quotes of the year The year presented opportunities for memorable quotes that earned their place in Kenyan 's psyche . Among them is Eliud Kipchoge 's " No human is limited " . R for referendum drives The year 2019 was characterized with persistent calls for referendum .

S for Seventh Day Adventist Church wrangles The sight of Flying Squad head Muga Nyale storming St Maxwell SDA Church in Nairobi shocked many Kenyans .

T for tax purges In the year 2019 , Kenya Revenue Authority pulled a shocker , coming down hard on businessmen and women it claimed owed them taxes . Notable targets in the purge included Keroche Breweries boss Tabitha Karanja and businessman Humprey Kariuki . U for uniting of the Kakamega twins It was perhaps one of the outstanding stories of 2019 when twins- Sharon Mathias and Melon Lutenyo were reunited . Born on the same day in August 1999 to same mother Rosemary Onyango , the pair had grown up in separate homes following a mix up in the delivery room only to be reunited this year . V for victory against terror Despite starting the year on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in defeat of terror and its sponsors . The response in Dusit is said to have been more coordinated , leading to more rescues and extermination of the terrorists . Over and above that , and despite sporadic bus attacks and kidnappings in Mandera , Kenya made significant steps in taming terror . W for wash-wash and the Dubai gold scam It is the year that the thriving fake dollar money syndicate was busted in Kenya . Multiple raids in Nairobi suburbs netted millions of fake money and boxes of fake gold bars . The country 's top politicians were also caught up in a Dubai gold scam which allegedly involved a member of a royal family . X for x-rating of Kenyan politicians In the year , Kenyan politicians , assisted by Apostle James Ng'ang'a , continued to stretch their expletives limits . From MP Charles Njagua threatening to flush out Tanzanians off Gikomba to Cate Waruguru coming down hard on Anne Waiguru , it became quite a task to watch live proceedings of rallies with inquisitive toddlers on the side .

@@61487236 <h> How students can ensure decent , fulfilling tour of duty in high school <p> This is an epistle to the young Kenyans who wrote their national examinations at the end of Primary School in 2019 . My dear children , congratulations on completion of that stretch of your journey . Let me assure you that have done well to get there . This is regardless of the grade they have given you in the recently released results . <p> As a parent , I know just how important it is to have a child you can hold a decent conversation with . School is meant to prepare you for that . Sometimes it is not the grade A that counts . It is often the individual that the school has shaped you into . I look forward to meeting you a few years hence . I hope you will tell me that you read this epistle and that it made a difference in your life . Yet , allow me first to speak to those who excelled in the exams . You deserve to be lauded for doing exceptionally well . If you are preparing to go to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is the start of yet a fresh challenge , as you will find out soon . Perhaps it is a little patronising to tell you not to rest on your laurels . Nonetheless I must tell you so , as a matter of duty . In my long and rich life , I have seen people arrive in High School with superb grades , only for them to leave empty handed . But that is just part of the story . Some leave in a vegetative state . For , they never recover from the initial euphoria of encounter with success . The thing goes to their head . They imagine that they know everything . They are even better than their teachers , they think -- especially if they come from affluent homes . In the end , they are a liability to everyone . Do not become one of those . And remember just what a short period your four years in High School is . It will pass away like the wind . Yet it may very well shape the rest of your life . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have seen some of your parents lamenting that you have not been selected to join the school of your choice . I have watched some of you on TV , in utter disbelief . Your parents joined you in mourning how you had been " frustrated " by being placed in " inferior schools . " Really ? Take this from me , my child , there are no such things as " inferior schools . " I should have told you a little story about my first encounter with High School . It was a sorry story . But I leave it for some other day . Just understand that in the end it is about you and your focus . If you go to Form One throwing up tantrums and sulking that you are in the wrong school , then the super grades that you got mean nothing . You did not learn anything in Primary School . Your father , who is encouraging you to think that you are going to " an inferior " school , is a burden to you and to your country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what you are going to do with your time in that school . In the end , you should come out a sober and solid individual , who can make a contribution to your country . But I run ahead of myself . <p> Let me turn briefly to you who did not excel . Your country has not treated you well . While we have been running around and lifting your excellent colleagues on our broad shoulders , we have forgotten you . Forgive us for writing you off . Year after year , we have treated a majority of our children the same way . We forget that you are the majority . Where do we want you to go ? Mercifully , this time round , they have said you will all go to High School . Let nobody lie to you . You are not useless . Let nobody write you off . Your bulb could still blow into full light in High School . If you should find me in a quiet place , I should give you a personal testimony . I have walked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called " useless , good for nothing . " <p> I know what it means to see teachers pampering their favourite grade A students . But I also know what it takes to jump from the bottom to the very top of the class . Believe you me , my child . I went through it many years ago . You can still excel . So , do not get there feeling inferior to anybody . Focus , focus , focus . And it does not matter what kind of school you will find yourself in . Provided that you find yourself in school , focus , focus , focus . Do not bother about " being transferred to a better school . " Only one thing counts , focus , focus , focus . Finally , your focus should not just be on grade A. That is very important , of course . Regrettably , they no longer teach about common decency . Focus on it anyway . They no longer teach manners and about attitude and comportment . Focus on them anyway . They no longer lay emphasis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in total . This sounds like a sermon from the Stone Age . Focus on it all the same . For , it will make all the difference on whom you shape up into and the role you will play in the future . My child , I have looked at the challenges in our country . I have concluded that they boil down to absence of values and manners . I have sometimes thought that , maybe , we should just abolish everything they are teaching in school and just focus on training people in decorum and common decency . But -- oh well ? Let me wish you a Happy New Year and a decent and fulfilling tour of duty in High School . May God bless you . The writer is a strategic public communications adviser . www.barrackmuluka.co.ke

Deputy Governor John Mwaniki said the Ushanga which will be held every Wednesday is aimed to market bead products made by women and to promote culture .

Since that time , ornaments and other symbols have been central to the way we express our identities and signal our relationships .

Although beads are found at many African archaeological sites , they tend to be overlooked in research .

Topics like migration and the economy dominate today 's new cycle . Yet ancient peoples also faced issues like climate change , cultural contact and economic shifts . The things that people made and used , like ostrich eggshell beads , can help us understand the impacts of these changes on their lives . <p> Three decades ago , the archaeologist Leon Jacobson noticed a pattern in ostrich eggshell beads from Namibia .

We , therefore , decided to test this with a much larger dataset , and in other places like eastern Africa where herding also spread some 3,000 years earlier . <p> Long-standing traditions <p> At the southern African sites , we also found that larger beads appeared after 2,000 years ago . However , contrary to previous studies , our data shows that these larger beads did not replace long-standing bead traditions .
