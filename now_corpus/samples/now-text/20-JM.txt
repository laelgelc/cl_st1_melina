Since this year , the general insurer acquired another 10 per cent of Motor One , bringing its stake to 65 per cent , and announced receipt of an insurance licence to operate in Barbados , where it is looking to add to its growth through partnership with BCDL Holdings Limited . <p> The General Accident Barbados subsidiary is 80 per cent owned by General Accident and 20 per cent by BCDL Holdings . <p> General Accident 's Chief Operating Officer , Greg Foster , told the Financial Gleaner that the two Motor One transactions amounted to $348 million @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four months ago from the Dome Mall in St Michaels , and is manned by a staff of three . <p> The team there has been making " very good progress , so far , in writing business since the early-May 2020 opening , " Foster said on Friday . <p> The previous day at the General Accident virtual annual general meeting , the COO credited the company 's regional push for last year 's income gains . <p> " This strong performance resulted in a more than doubling of underwriting profit , where we ended the year with $442 million , " Foster told the company 's shareholders at their annual general meeting on Thursday . <p> " We also saw an improvement in our investment income of 30 per cent even against the background of depressed yield on investment .

@@62504235 <h> Enterprise computing : The right culture needed <p> We hear it over and over : people are our most important asset , the people on the team are to be credited with the success of the project . But a critical part of the formula is the culture -- the " how we do things around here " way . <p> Space does not allow us to delve into all the intricacies of culture , so our focus in this short piece will be on a crucial feature of culture necessary for the success of any exercise in digital transformation . <p> ? <p> Culture underpins digital transformation <p> Much is said on the fundamental importance of organisation culture , but in terms of any transformation process , culture is a crucial enabler . The key feature of this transformation 's success is how " the business " relates to the " IT department " . Depending on the size of the organisation , it may be a department of one , or it might be a small team , or the IT department could be outsourced . <p> In the previous article , we raised the issue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vs the IT department " divide . In many organisations , some IT folks talk down to the people in their company . This does not engender solid relationships and sows some level of discord at times . On the flip side , we know of some situations where the various departments in the business " throw " projects over the fence into the IT department , expecting a miraculously smooth implementation when the IT team was not involved in the development of the solution . This is not a recipe for success . As you may have recognised by now , the IT-business relationship is massively essential . <p> ? <p> Comfortable with being uncomfortable <p> If any change or transformation is to be successful , the leadership of the organisation must be the catalyst for building a strong IT-business relationship .

Leadership needs to remind both sides that , ultimately , these transformation efforts should make it easier , faster , more seamless for customers to engage with your company . If the technology is implemented correctly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way the people in the organisation operate this new technology that will indicate the success of any transformation . Mistakes will be made , and the culture has to be comfortable with being uncomfortable as the march towards a new way of doing business evolves . <p> ? <p> Issues in larger companies <p> For larger companies that have gone through mergers and acquisitions , the legacy systems and processes , including the people who guard this ' way of life ' , will pose considerable challenges to the transformation processes . Again , leadership must intervene , repeatedly share the vision , and get these teams accustomed to the mindset associated with " the new normal " . It is not an easy task , but it is an essential one . Leadership must also be aware of the risk associated with staff loss as some of the teams related to the legacy systems and processes might not make it . <p> ? <p> Next week we look at process and governance . <p> ? <p> Trevor Forrest is Founder and CEO of 876 Technology Solutions .

It has also hit jobs . <p> The unemployment rate across the 27-nation EU is forecast to rise from 6.7 percent last year to 9 percent in 2020 but then fall to around 8 percent in 2021 , the commission said . <p> Beyond that , Gentiloni said , " we will have a massive drop in hours worked . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the deepest recession in living memory , with the International Monetary Fund forecasting a 3 percent decline this year . <p> The UN says that is expected to cause a drop in work hours equivalent to 305 million full-time jobs . <p> Inflation in Europe is also set to be significantly weaker as consumer prices fall amid a sharp weakening of demand and drop in oil prices . <p> Investment too is likely to contract , with firms expected to postpone or cancel their investment plans amid the uncertainty . <p> Exporters will not be spared , with continued disruption to movements of people , goods and services likely . <p> Italy and Spain - two of the countries hardest hit by the virus - and to a lesser extent France , are among the economies that will suffer most . <p> Greece , which largely escaped the disease but whose economy was ravaged previously by its debt crisis and which relies heavily on tourism , is also high on the economic hit list . <p> France 's economy is expected to shrink by about 8.2 percent , while Germany @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better . <p> Still , it is set to experience this year its worst recession since World War II , with exports notably hit , with a drop in output of 6.5 percent . <p> While the virus hit every member country , the extent of the damage it ultimately inflicts will depend on the evolution of the disease in each of them , the resilience of their economies and what policies they put in place to respond . <p> Gentiloni said that the depth of the recession and the strength of recovery will be uneven across the world 's biggest trading bloc . <p> Much will depend , he said , on " the speed at which lockdowns can be lifted , the importance of services like tourism in each economy and by each country 's financial resources . <p> Such divergence poses a threat to the single market and the euro area - yet it can be mitigated through decisive , joint European action .

And the communication leader 's Head of Public Relations , Elon Parkinson is using the occasion to highlight the importance of technology to all areas of daily life -- from food , to education and commerce . <p> " COVID-19 has opened up a lot of digital opportunities , not only for users of the technology but also for providers of goods and services , " Parkinson told Loop News . <p> He noted that in Jamaica , up to three months ago , ordering certain fast foods using the Internet was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tap an app , you place your order , you wait at home for about 30 or 45 minutes and the next thing you know your favourite fast food is at your door , " said Parkinson . <p> The public relations manager also noted that other institutions such as banks , insurance companies and businesses of all sizes are increasingly providing digital options to their customers and consumers at large , as they seek to " engage , attract or to inform " . <p> " This is the power of digital technology and more importantly , unleashing digital technology , " Parkinson observed . He pointed out that as more persons adopt digital technology , what it means is that the face of commerce is also changing . <p> " We 're also seeing , right before our very eyes , that the face of education is also changing , " he stated . <p> Parkinson acknowledged that digital and virtual learning protocols and platforms have existed for some time , in particular at the tertiary level and to a much lesser extent at the secondary school level @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the scale now seen , as a result of the COVID-19 crisis . Schools and teachers ' colleges have been shuttered since March 13 as part of the Government 's efforts to limit the spread of the coronavirus on the island , forcing these institutions to move their teaching platforms online overnight . <p> Parkinson ... We are people connecting people to their digital future . <p> Said Parkinson : " Now that all have to come into the virtual space , forced by the restrictions that COVID-19 has necessarily caused , we 're now seeing where people have to take a different approach towards learning . We 're seeing the benefits of it and we 're also seeing where opportunities are coming up to make it better " . <p> Parkinson mused that the current reality is a shock to the system . <p> " When you consider that persons who were quite comfortable with a particular routine of getting dressed and going to school , now find that school is merely a few feet away as you now go to your laptop , desk top computer or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> He said there are pertinent questions being raised about how , as a country , we operationalise these portals . And , he said Digicel stands ready to provide answers . <p> " As a provider of essential services , we have a duty of care to keep our network running no matter what . Indeed , at a time like this , our services could not be more vital or needed . That said , we are taking this situation very seriously , and doing everything we can to prepare our business and prepare ourselves , " he said . <p> It is to this end that Parkinson said that the Caribbean 's leading communications provider is committed to extending the technology to the most hard to reach parts of Jamaica to ensure that no one is left behind . <p> " One of the things that we have to look at is the availability of the technology because ... a lot of people are being left behind because of the digital divide . <p> " For us at Digicel , what we 've been doing over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ including the proliferation of superfast LTE ( Long Term Evolution ) , " Parkinson said . <p> He noted that while no one could have anticipated the current coronavirus situation , Digicel would have , unwittingly , been preparing itself . <p> " Because we have been on a mission to deliver 100 per cent internet penetration in Jamaica within the shortest time possible . Of course , the upshot of that mission is to bridge the digital divide , " he said , noting that Digicel has introduced LTE technology to all 14 parishes of the island . <p> " Having done so , our goal now is to get into the deeper reaches of these rural areas in particular , to build out the technology and reach our 100 per cent penetration goal , " he added . <p> The public relations head points out that Digicel 's use of LTE technology is backed up by its fast-speed fibre technology which is already available in Kingston and St Andrew and parts of St Catherine . It delivers data speed of up to 400 mbps to the home . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ future ... this is life changing technology that 's allowing persons , from the comfort of their homes , to connect to distance learning sites , to carry out ecommerce activities and to even run their own ecommerce activities from their home . <p> " This is especially needed and especially vital during this time when people have to stay close but of course remain socially distant , " said Parkinson . <p> " What we 've seen so far is as a result of the investment in LTE and the expansion that we 've been able to make , we have been able to contribute significantly to the ways in which people are able to connect through the internet and avail themselves of e-learning opportunities , virtual learning connectivity like never before and ecommerce connectivity as well " . <p> World Telecommunication Day has been celebrated annually on 17 May since 1969 .
