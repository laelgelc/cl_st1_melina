It sounds simple enough , right ? But I strongly believe that a part of the reason that Jamaica has such a high corruption index is because many of us just do n't fully understand the term , what it means and why it is so dangerous . In its simplest form , a conflict of interest exists when a public official has a private interest , which could improperly influence the performance of his or her official duties . In other words , a government official who owns a construction company , for example , allows his company to bid for a contract where he is either one of the persons making the award or has some influence over who receives it . <h> SELF-INTEREST <p> Human beings are just that , human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can undermine a person 's impartiality in the execution of his or her professional or public duties . Unless you are Mother Teresa herself or possess similarly high levels of sainthood , it is extremely difficult to objectively disregard self-interest . <p> And it 's not only in government that a conflict of interest exists , or can be problematic . Private individuals can also find themselves in situations where they have access to information that is n't in the public domain , giving them a competitive advantage over those of us who do n't . Think Martha Stewart who , before 2004 , was more famous for making bed linen and crockery than smoking weed with Snoop Dogg on their cooking show . Stewart was convicted for insider trading which allowed her to avoid a US$45,000 loss on a pharmaceutical stock that was about to tank . Stewart had ' insider information ' of internal decisions which would affect the company negatively , and so she jettisoned over 4,000 shares of the stock before the announcement was made publicly . Stewart ended up serving about 10 months in prison @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ met Snoop and the two hit it off , presumably in a West Virginia prison yard . <p> Now the keen-eyed among us will say that technically , Stewart was n't convicted of insider trading , but was actually found guilty of lying to federal officials , conspiracy and obstruction of justice , but the point remains . <p> I use this example because some people struggle to see what Stewart did wrong here . What else could she have done ? Take the high road and not act on the information that would have saved her $45,000 ? It 's a tough call . To come back home to Jamaica now , the problem is just as complicated , because the persons who know most about an industry are usually the ones best qualified to serve on government boards where their expertise is required . Those persons may also have external private interests that stand to benefit from the very decisions that the board or entity makes . <h> Headlines Delivered to Your Inbox <p> And there are many other examples of conflict of interest , as outlined on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conflict of interest may be deemed to exist where an individual engages in private activity similar to official functions , or where he exploits his status and privileges for private gain . Soliciting and/or accepting payment and/or any other consideration relating to the performance of , or neglect of , official duties may also be considered a conflict of interest , as is conducting private business during work hours and/or on government property . So too is engaging in transactions with relatives or family members , or with an organisation in which relatives or family members have an interest . And to demonstrate just how complicated this is , I 'm here thinking that I myself may have violated a few of these principles back in my day , like the time I sat and filled out an online application for my private benefit , using the Government 's computer , while on the Government 's time . That 's probably why the words ' may constitute ' are so commonly used ; because conflict of interest is n't always so clear . The OSC even ensures that it makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of interest are not exhaustive , and numerous other circumstances may also give rise to a conflict of interest . <h> A MORAL , ETHICAL , LEGAL MINEFIELD <p> So how does one navigate this moral , ethical and legal minefield ? Well , a good place to start is by first removing yourself from the situation altogether . Even if someone is not attempting to benefit from a possible conflict of interest situation , it is equally important that a conflict of interest does not appear to exist . The very presence of the individual in the room or at the decision-making table may raise doubts about the authenticity and objectivity of the process . In such a case , the individual is morally , ethically and sometimes legally bound to recuse himself or herself from the process and declaring that they have a self-serving material interest in the matter at hand . Another option may be to avoid the situation entirely by declining the position in the first place , especially if the conflict is clearly going to reoccur repeatedly in the future . Or one may take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conflicting private interests by either resigning from the private position , selling its shares and/or resigning from the board . I ca n't tell you how many lucrative offers I 've had to walk away from simply because of conflict of interest , and because it 's the right thing to do . Some of those decisions were agonising , especially when you consider that everybody else seems to be fine doing it . But it was the right thing to do then , and still is now . Conflict of interest is one of the greyest areas of human interaction , with the line between right and wrong being increasingly blurred each day . A third , and possibly the most important , way to help avoid conflict of interest is through education and awareness . Most persons genuinely can not distinguish a conflict of interest , or see how dangerous or problematic it can be .

Also we just left the Caribbean Military Technical Training Institute that will participate in the training of unskilled persons , " Mr. Warmington outlined . <p> " This is a first for us and it is something we plan to do . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to involve the local people in training , so when the contractors leave , they will leave trained , skilled persons behind to carry on , " he added . <p> Mr. Warmington further pointed out that work is also to be carried out on the drainage network in and around Montego Bay , including North Gully , to alleviate the city 's flooding issues . <p> He stated that the rehabilitation of the city 's drainage is to run concurrently with the perimeter road project . <p> " The truth is , we ca n't expect to spend approximately US$275 million to do the perimeter road and then we leave these issues behind . So , to spend that massive sum , we have to look at the other end and correct it also , " Mr. Warmington explained <p> " Recommendation first was to cover it . We do n't know if that is best , so we 've asked the technical team from the Ministry to be out here next week and give me a recommendation , " he added . <p> For his part , Minister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Hon.

@@89389236 <p> The second and final part of The Desmond Allen Interviews looking at the life of veteran journalist , broadcaster and playwright Barbara Gloudon published in the Jamaica Observer on May 16 , 2004 . <p> Party Line by Stella <p> All the time , Gloudon 's career at The Gleaner was pumping up . In the 1970s , she was promoted to features editor . After covering nearly every beat , she was writing substantially on the arts where a great deal was happening . She recalled that when Edna Manley sculpted the Paul Bogle statue mounted in Morant Bay , the St Thomas capital , people cursed it and said " it was too black , Paul Bogle never black so ! " Ken Allen came up with the brilliant idea for a social column to be written by her . And so began one of the most widely read columns of the time -- Party Line by Stella . The logo carried a drawing of the back of Gloudon 's head done by the famed cartoonist Urban Leandro . <p> She recalls the embarrassment of having to return money to people who were desperate to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Gleaner insisted on . She still carries that chip on her shoulder today , frequently saying thanks-but-no-thanks to media appreciation invitations . She has memories of how she inadvertently caused a policeman to be court-marshalled when she wrote that she had seen a cop riding a horse in such a way that it fell and was injured . The police commissioner , Gordon Langdon at the time , had a fancy for horses and caused the policeman to be tried . Gloudon was summoned to testify at the hearing , at the end of which the cop was demoted to foot patrol . <p> The birds come alive in a scene from the 2015 Pantomime Runeesha and the Birds , written by Barbara Gloudon . <p> ' God protects fools and small children <p> Gloudon , by now a fast-rising reporter , editor and columnist , was interviewing and rubbing shoulders with some of Jamaica and the world 's biggest names : Sir Alexander Bustamante ; NW Manley ; Marilyn Monroe and Joan Crawford , the Hollywood megastars ; Eric Gairy of Grenada ; Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and Greek Prime Minister Ferdinand Makarios , among them , the latter four having come to Jamaica for the 1975 Commonwealth Heads of Government Conference . <p> She bought her first car , an Anglia , from Hector Lodge , a co-worker with whom she became great friends . " I got this crazy idea to have readers of the Stella column name the car . Many people sent in names and I decided on the name " Angie " ... It was a simple time . I did not have money but I got an education at the university of The Gleaner , " Gloudon says in retrospection . She did not keep any clipping of her work , not wanting to feel self-important and remembering that a mentor had said " today 's headline story will be wrapping fish tomorrow " . <p> She travelled to the United States on a US State Department four-month fellowship that she and John Maxwell had received . She was assigned to the Troy Daily News in a little town 25 miles west of Dayton , Ohio . The trip was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an ice hockey game , learnt to walk several blocks in thick snow and get to work at 5:00 am , no matter how bad the weather was . At the end of the fellowship , she was moved by the gifts she was given by children from the schools she had covered while in Troy . She also received a grant to tour several US cities , including Chicago , Detroit , Denver , Los Angeles , San Francisco , which she fell in love with ; and finally through Arizona to New York . Often Gloudon was the only black or woman on a plane in a violently racist America . " Truly , it is said that God protects fools and small children . " <p> Barbara Gloudon , OJ <p> Inevitably , the nation began to take notice of Gloudon . For her coverage of the 1975 Commonwealth Heads of Government Conference , the Government awarded her the Order of Distinction ( OD ) Officer Class . That would be surpassed many years later with the Order of Jamaica ( OJ ) , the country 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accepting the OD at the time . Frank Hill , a great journalist for whom she had much respect , told her : " Girl , do n't be a fool . You deserve it . " Hill was chairman of the Institute of Jamaica at the time when Gloudon later received the Bronze Musgrave Medal and the institute 's Centenary Medal . <p> Beginning of the end <p> Barbara Gloudon and John Maxwell in the United States on a US State Department four-month fellowship . <p> Before Sealy retired from The Gleaner , he put Gloudon in charge of The Star -- the racy tabloid stablemate of the more conservative broadsheet . He could not know , of course , that in that promotion was the seed of her demise . The Star had a staple of sensational crime stories which made the crime reporter , George Daley , famous ; gory details of nasty divorce cases ; and pictures of bare-breasted white women supplied from England . Prior to Gloudon 's tenure , there was a memorable headline on one of the most famous divorce cases -- that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ education at the time : " The Minister of State used to come home late , " it screamed . By now , Wynter had become the editor-in-chief of The Gleaner and , ironically , Gloudon 's boss . <p> Gloudon had a vision of the paper as a community paper . This was the unforgettable 70s when the two main political parties fought a bitter electoral war . Overseas , the country was regarded as the pits . In her thinking , someone had to speak for the people and the country . It would be The Star , the people paper , Gloudon determined . She dropped the girlie pin-ups from the newspaper , saying that they were an unnecessary drain on the country 's fast dwindling foreign exchange reserves anyway , edited out the ugly details of divorce cases , on grounds that it was hurting children of the divorced parents , and ran human interest stories of community heroism . " The circulation rose sharply after that , " Gloudon claims . " People who used to stay away because of the naked ladies came back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boardroom on The Gleaner 's fifth floor , it was a different story . There were claims that the paper had lost its excitement and sales were dropping fast , as readers tuned out . Instructions came down that the semi-nudes must return and the divorce cases spiced up again . Gloudon resisted . " I had reached a place in my life where I could no longer do it , " she explains . The upshot : Gloudon was removed as editor of The Star and " demoted laterally " with the title of " Associate editor " and no job description . " I was given a desk of one -- me ! " <p> Gleaner career over <p> This was 1978 . Word got out and the Gloudon " firing " from The Star became a cause celebre . The women 's movement took it up . So did the PAJ . Demonstrations were staged in her name . Two Gleaner reporter/columnists who had written in support of Gloudon had their pieces rejected and resigned their weekly columns in protest . In the midst of it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She put the matter in the hands of her lawyers and waited . But the pain of it all was overwhelming . She had joined The Gleaner as a mere child and her entire world had been built around ' the grand Old Lady of North Street ' . <p> Her nights were sleepless and she lost a lot of weight . In her heart , she knew that the end had come . There was no way she could remain at The Gleaner after what she regarded as a betrayal of her years of commitment to the venerable institution . After the legal wranglings , the parties reached a settlement . The paper would pay her off for her over 25 years of service . <p> " To this day I do not know how much money I got . I did not even look at the cheque , although I remember giving some of the money to my church and buying gifts for some people who had helped me during the ordeal . " <p> Power cuts and gunshots <p> Her family sent her to a friend in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . On her return , she got a telephone call from Desmond Henry , the director of tourism . Henry sent her to Jack Stephenson , the minister of tourism , who offered her the job as deputy director of tourism in charge of communication . She was to spend three tough years in the job , recalling that " the JLP and PNP were at ' war ' and the US was against Jamaica " . One night , as she worked alone in the building , the power suddenly went and gunshots rang out . " The divisiveness was awful . I know people who died in this stupid ' war ' . The night of the Eventide fire , I cried on my way home . " <p> Gloudon would be remembered in tourism circles for the catchy slogan -- " We 're more than a beach , we 're a country " -- that she and the team , including Henry and Hartley Neita , came up with . " We went on the road with very little money . But we started things like Reggae @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the governing PNP was routed . The following year , under the new JLP Government , her job was terminated . She recalls the shabby treatment received by Peter Martin and Associates , the overseas public relations firm for the tourist board , when the contract was being terminated . Carmen Tipling worked for Peter Martin in New York at the time . Martin , she said , was a decent American and did not deserve such treatment . <p> Hugh Shearer to the rescue <p> It was again crunch time for Gloudon . She decided it was time to launch out on her own and started a communication consultancy . In this new phase , she would develop great respect for Hugh Lawson Shearer , a former prime minister and head of the JLP-affiliated Bustamante Industrial Trade Union ( BITU ) . The unions had just formed the Joint Trades Union Research Development Centre ( JTURDC ) and she made a bid for the PR contract . Somebody brought it up that she had worked under the PNP Government . But Shearer insisted that as long as she could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> In the years that she worked for the JTURDC , she came to understand how trade unions worked and regularly met big name unionists like Hopeton Caven , Dwight Nelson , E Lloyd Taylor and Roy Thompson , among others . She later got a contract from The UWI 's Trade Union Education Institute on a project for the development of Caribbean women and went with the team down the islands doing the communication component . <p> More contracts came later , though Gloudon points out that the money was not big but was enough to pay the bills . " I ca n't bring myself to do things I do n't believe in . " At one time , she shared office space with her great friend Maurice Garrison , founder of the now-defunct Twin City Sun newspaper , and his partner George McKonnen , as well as Monica Campbell , director of Communication Services , the PR and advertising firm . <p> The Hotline was not hot enough <p> As Gloudon sat in the office one day , going through some paperwork , the phone rang . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and popularly known as Dotty Dean . LaCroix said the Hotline radio talk show was not hot enough and she wanted someone to " mix it up a bit " . Was she interested ? Gloudon grabbed the offer , starting off slowly but gradually coming into her own . <p> Hotline has the largest listenership of all talk shows on Jamaican radio , according to Don Anderson 's all-media surveys . She is on three days a week now , alternating with Keith Smith , the lawyer who succeeded Antoinette Haughton . Gloudon says the programme has evolved into an avenue for community assistance . To give voice to tomorrow 's leaders , she regularly hosts youth forums , and outside broadcasts from communities are a standard feature of the show . " We deal with the issues and we go after the solutions . I do n't allow people to tear down others on the show , " she says with determination . <p> A gift of laughter <p> Over the years , Gloudon has honed her skills as a playwright . On the invitation of Greta and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she tried her hand at writing pantomimes . The first was Moonshine Anansi in 1969 . It was a hit and many others followed . The most successful was Johnny Reggae in 1978 , the year of her Gleaner ordeal . The latest is Combolo , which is currently showing and whose closing scenes were recently photographed for National Geographic Traveler magazine . <p> Her Pirate Princess had a short run in London 's westend where it got BBC coverage . The pantomime has also played Toronto and Miami , targeting , of course , the large West Indian communities overseas . The LTM is now part of world theatre history and is featured on the world theatre website . Eastern Connecticut State University keeps a collection of pantomime scripts in its drama library . <p> In Jamaica , schools and entire villages charter buses to travel to Kingston to see the pantomime . Gloudon , unable to mask the feeling of satisfaction , praises Louise Bennett-Coverley , the cultural icon and her former neighbour in Gordon Town , and the late Ranny Williams " for giving us the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Gloudon can write . There 's a slew of articles for top-class magazines and the Weekend Observer that proves it . But she also has the gift of the gab , for which she is in high demand here and abroad . She recently created history for Jamaica by being appointed for an unprecedented third term as the rapporteur for the world conference of the International Programme for Development of Communication ( IPDC ) , a key agency of UNESCO which meets every two years in Paris . <p> Gloudon says she is passionate about Jamaica and the Jamaican people because " they are the best " . She cherishes friends like Rex Nettleford , who pushes her to bring out the best in her ; former Anglican Lord Bishop Neville deSouza , her spiritual guide ; and " lovely neighbour " Lois Kelly Miller , the former actress . <p> Her mother and father have passed but she " still speaks " with them , thanking them all the time for being such great parents . " The greatest gift a child can get is great parents . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to an abrupt end to the interview . Once again , it is clear that there are those whose journey is so rich and abundant in their achievements that we must learn to savour bite-size morsels at a time .

It 's complicated . Unless you spend time in it , it 's hard to understand the direction in which it 's going . <p> The talk shows buzz with calls for change . This is because people still think that the failure to return to where we were pre-1993 , or even pre-1974 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charge . <p> This is ridiculous . No one person can achieve that . It 's not how it is because of decisions made by two men over five years . <p> We are where we are because of many decisions made by many people over the last 40-odd years . <p> This is not a controlled society where , by a proclamation , you can just imprison all you choose . Thankfully , or many of us would be in jail because we are a vocal people -- and what begins with crime control has the potential to become political control . <p> The over-50 in our population remember the 1976 election and the reality of the Opposition going to the polls with three candidates in custody . <p> No wonder we shot ourselves in the foot by making the Government weaker in fighting gang terrorism . <p> It 's because we saw the impact of a Government unshackled . <p> No specific individual who holds the position of either minister of national security or commissioner of police can solve the problem . They can improve it , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was when both men took on the job . Solving it ? That 's a little different . It 's not Hogwarths , so wands wo n't help . <p> Most of the decisions that tie the hands of the police were made many years ago by people who genuinely believed they where doing the right thing . <p> We would have to look at the decisions then that hurt us now and try to reverse them -- which , to a very large degree , is impossible . <p> Let 's look on a few . <p> The decision by God knows who in the 90s that made a district constable bound to a 40-hour workweek , no more , no less , essentially barred any suitable candidate from joining the police auxiliary in a reserve capacity ( which is what auxiliary means ) , and condemned all who joined it to poverty , as it barred the previously allowed overtime . <p> When a decision was made to become a signature to the Charter of Fundamental Rights and Freedoms it was intended to ensure that the Government would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state of public emergency . <p> But , it did n't intend that it would make the Government impotent in respect of truly being able to act in a crisis over a long period of time .

Because no Government wants to say those words . <p> They try other methods that wo n't make us international pariahs , and the result of their efforts is a reduction of 10 per cent in homicides , and the reduction of all major crimes over five years . <p> With this in mind , the Government has to ignore the public and their perceptions because they ca n't give them what they want . <p> That 's why we elect leaders -- to lead , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , takes strength and focus .

@@90303232 <h> Still scratching my head about UK 's Rwanda asylum deal <p> It was probably for the best that Rwandan President Paul Kagame was in the middle of a three-day visit to Jamaica when news broke of the extraordinary asylum deal Rwanda had struck with the United Kingdom ( UK ) . <p> With no opportunity to grill the Rwandan leader , commentators had to fill in the blanks as to why this East African country , still bearing the scars from its recent history as the scene of one of the most devastating genocides in modern memory , would be a part of Britain 's new asylum strategy . <p> We might have found 120 million ones . Coincidentally , the value in pounds of the sweetener UK Home Secretary Priti Patel has offered for Rwanda to take Britain 's ' undesirables ' . These would be initially single men arriving on English shores via the Channel . Patel wants us to believe this move will break up the smuggling rings that are responsible for transporting many of the thousands who attempt the journey from the Middle East , Africa and elsewhere via French camps each year . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no sense . For example , Rwanda will ultimately have to take responsibility for these failed asylum seekers and after being guests of Kigali ( for the five years in which the successful claimants are supported ) , what is to stop them from making their way back to Europe in some capacity ? <h> CONTROVERSIAL <p> And let 's not even spend too much time thinking about the impact that this may have on the citizens of Rwanda and African refugees who have fled neighbouring conflicts in the hopes of finding some kind of safety . We 're already hearing stories of Rwandan genocide orphans being told to vacate properties in readiness of the arrival of UK-funded asylum seekers . <h> Headlines Delivered to Your Inbox <p> Home Office ministers and advisers were said to have warned the Home Secretary that this deal was neither cost-effective nor showed any tangible benefits that the minister herself had to take personal responsibility for this controversial initiative . <p> It 's not just bleeding hearts and do-gooders like myself who could clearly see not just the ethical and logistical issues with this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Church of England called the move ' unchristian ' , with the UN 's Refugee Agency saying Patel was outsourcing Britain 's global obligations , and that the move could be unlawful . <p> Patel is just the latest in a long line of Conservative home secretaries who have fostered the ' hostile environment ' policy on the UK , essentially making life as difficult as possible for those either seeking refuge , asylum or a better life . The ultimate goal is to make life so unbearable , people simply go elsewhere . <p> I wo n't bore you with the chronological turning of the immigration screws in the United Kingdom , but outsourcing a portion of its global responsibilities for those who may have risked their lives to seek sanctuary in the United Kingdom to Rwanda is simply another deterrent , as far as this administration is concerned , and the ? 120m price tag simply the cost of doing business . <p> Juxtapose the treatment being meted out to those who will be sent for processing in Rwanda versus the diplomatic red carpet that was laid out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government initiated an actual ' Home for Ukraine ' scheme , where it advertised for those who are in a position to host a family or a single individual from the country , and , wait for it ... the government would pay YOU ? 350 per month to do so . <p> A number of parliamentarians have already publicly signed up to host Ukrainians . Some are sitting on the same front bench as their colleagues advocating for asylum seekers to be given a one-way ticket to East Africa . Apparently the appetite for charity decreases with the melanin of the person in need . <p> The public are not fooled by the stark difference . Bombs dropping on San'a must be as painful as those falling on Kyiv , but do n't ask the country 's current home secretary to make that distinction . As has been widely mentioned , it seems the UK did n't have a resource or refugee problem , it has a racism one . <p> President Kagame 's trip to Jamaica should 've resulted in positive headlines about the ever-growing links that are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Instead , most of the coverage focussed on this new asylum deal , and it 's clear to see why . <p> I have been told by many who have had the opportunity to visit Rwanda that despite its troubled history , it 's a beautiful , rapidly developing nation with enormous potential for growth . This critique of Britain outsourcing its immigration issues should not feel like a slight on the East African country , and , in fact , my hope is that those who may have ended up in Rwanda - after initially trying to get settled in the UK - will find a way of creating a new chapter for themselves and their loved ones . <p> This story is another painful reminder that at the very heart of this conversation , it 's about Britain making a political mess and somewhere , somebody in the global South gets tasked with cleaning it up . <p> Amina Taylor is a journalist and broadcaster .

I have been a dedicated and hard-working teacher for almost all my adult life , but I am tired of the misery and stress of being in the classroom . I find it almost physically painful to go to work each day because the students are difficult to deal with , and it is harder to teach in such a hostile environment where many students lack interest in learning .

The good news is that a shuttle service for students could be a very promising business idea if you are able to plan and execute properly . <p> Start-up businesses in Jamaica traditionally have a very high rate of failure , with most failing five years after opening . Two main reasons businesses fail are because : <h> Headlines Delivered to Your Inbox <p> ? Entrepreneurs tend to pursue necessity-driven enterprise rather than opportunity-driven enterprise , so they start business because there is a personal need to be their own boss and make money rather than a viable opportunity in the market ; and <p> ? They are unprepared for the challenges of running a business , which requires business knowledge , access to finance , building the right team , systems , and access to the right networks . <p> You can reduce the risk of failure by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There are several criteria typically used to evaluate whether an opportunity or business idea is worth pursuing , which I will outline below so you can review and make your own informed decision . <p> Profit potential : Profits are important for sustainability and future growth . Therefore , as you prepare and validate your financial projections in relation to this start-up , the pricing model , break-even analysis , estimated profit and loss or income statement , and projected cash flows should weigh heavily in your decision making . <p> Ready demand or need for the service : Once you can establish that this is a service that is needed by your target market , and that there is urgency in that demand , they are promising signs that the business idea is viable . <p> The ability of the target market to pay : It is not enough that your target market has a need for the service . It is equally important that they have the ability to pay . For example , there are many Jamaicans currently in need of housing solutions , however , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need . It would be great to canvas your potential customers ( perhaps from your existing school and with help from colleagues in other schools ) so that you start with an extensive database of prospective customers . <p> Viable market size : There have to be enough prospective customers who need the service and have the ability to pay to justify your entry into the market . <p> Price elasticity of demand : Given the current volatilities in the global oil market , one of the most critical success factors for a school shuttle service will be price elasticity of demand . In simple terms , you want to ensure that your target customers are willing to pay more for your service amid rapid and drastic increases in gas prices . <p> Favourable landscape analysis : A favourable landscape analysis means that when you have done a comprehensive review of the current competitive landscape for this service , the data will indicate that there is an opportunity for new players in the market . Also that there is a trend towards growing rather than declining demand for the service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the barriers to entry that exist within the transportation industry . At this time , the barriers to entry are relatively low , which is not necessarily a good thing because competitors can easily enter and exit the space . This usually results in a competitive landscape that is unregulated and where many players try to compete on price rather than value . <p> The upside is that you can easily differentiate yourself by adding great value with technology for better scheduling , safety , and enhanced communication with students and parents . If you add to that consistent on-time service , well-trained staff , and exceptional customer experience , you 'll be a cut above the rest . <p> High customer lifetime value : Having customers with what is typically referred to as a high customer lifetime value is essential in this industry . This means that your business model will lean firmly towards contracts for service that span at least a year for each customer rather than having a fickle customer base that uses your service on occasion . <p> My recommendation here would be getting customers who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and preferably morning pick-up and evening drop-off . If you are able to secure profitable contracts with the schools as institutional customers , that would give you a considerable advantage . <p> Scalability : The ability to expand is paramount . Scalability would include the size of the sales universe , or the value of the entirety of the market opportunity available currently , access to financing for this type of business , and the ease of recruiting qualified human resources to staff the business . <p> Also the ease of acquiring the assets required to execute the business model , which in this case , would likely be the vehicles in the short term and several locations in the longer term , particularly if you are looking at big-picture expansion . <p> Now that you understand some of the main factors used in evaluating a business idea , you can determine whether the shuttle service meets , and hopefully , exceeds the threshold for launch .

@@91587236 <h> Editorial Get a move on renewables plan <p> The turmoil in the world 's oil markets , triggered by Russia 's invasion of Ukraine , Jamaica 's energy minister , Daryl Vaz , observed recently , is causing many countries , including his own , to consider the fast-tracking efforts to expand their use of renewable energy . The aim is to , as much as possible , wean themselves off fossil fuels . <p> That makes a lot of sense . This newspaper is , therefore , surprised at the seeming lack of urgency by Mr Vaz 's ministry in developing , and promulgating , a clear roadmap for the island 's next phase of investment in renewables . Indeed , the minister glossed over the matter when he reported on subjects in his portfolio in Parliament last month . <p> It did n't require the Russia/Ukraine conflict to establish the logic of Jamaica 's push for renewable , although events since February , including a sharp spiral in oil prices , has amplified its justification . For instance , oil , which the island does n't produce , accounts for upwards of 80 per cent of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barrels of the stuff annually , of which between a fifth to a quarter goes to electricity generation . <p> When the finance minister , Nigel Clarke , crafted his budget for the current fiscal year , he projected that oil would average US$67.50 per barrel . It is now expected to be closer to US$100 per barrel . This means the country could add up to US$650 million more on its oil bill this year , helping to fuel inflation as well as place new pressures on the current accounts . <h> CUSHION AGAINST VOLATILITY <p> It was in part to cushion against this volatility in oil markets -- the contribution of carbon emissions to global warming and climate change are also drivers -- that Jamaica has been adding renewables ( wind and solar in particular ) to its fuel mix for power generation . Around 17 per cent of the island 's electricity is now generated from renewables . The Government 's long-standing commitment was to increase that to 30 per cent by 2030 . Over the past year , the administration has talked of having at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> Headlines Delivered to Your Inbox <p> " ... Even before this very unfortunate occurrence ( the Russia-Ukraine war and Western sanctions against Russia that have impacted the price of oil ) , Jamaica 's energy transition , diversity , and ultimate energy security was high on the list of national priorities for this ministry , " Mr Vaz told Parliament . <p> Investment decisions on renewables , or other generating capacity , are n't made in a vacuum . Requests for proposals ( RFPs ) for new power plants/facilities are expected to be informed by a so-called Integrated Resource Plan ( IRP ) for the electricity sector . This document is supposed to outline things such as the Government 's expectation of power demand over a specific period ; the cost at which electricity is produced , and therefore delivered to consumers ; and the fuel mix and generating systems ; taking into account the need for reliability as well as the sector 's carbon footprint . <p> There are several reasons why this policy document is important , not least being the need for clarity and transparency in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capacity is acquired -- and , in specific instances , who gets to provide it . One potentially fraught matter in this respect relates to Jamaica Public Service Company ( JPS ) , the monopoly electricity transmission and distribution company , which is also the largest generator of power . <h> FIRST RIGHT OF REFUSAL <p> Under existing laws , JPS has first right of refusal with respect to the replacement of its own power generators whose operating lives have ended . By our estimate , around 180 megawatts ( MW ) of JPS 's generating capacity falls into that category . If JPS exercises its option , it has to be determined on what basis it proceeds , including the fuel mix and technology it employs , the cost at which it replaces generators and , ultimately , the price consumers have to pay for electricity . The Government might determine that JPS can continue to operate the obsolete plants , and what effect that might have on price and reliability . <p> It is n't only JPS that to which this issue will apply in the near term @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its private power suppliers , Wigton Wind Farm , will come to an end for 24 megawatts of power , or approximately 38 per cent of Wigton 's capacity . In the normal course of things , it would be expected that the IRP would provide guidance on how this portion of Wigton 's capacity should be treated in any new agreement with JPS , assuming there is a rolling over of the arrangement . <p> Further , the Office of Utilities Regulation ( OUR ) is expected in 2023 to begin tariff review for JPS for the next five-year cycle . The age and efficiency of generators , and the technologies used in renewables -- including whether the systems have battery storage systems so as to lessen the need for standby fossil fuels generators and the fixed costs therewith -- will be important to the OUR 's analysis . <p> Obviously , the OUR has models it can use , and has used , in its determinations in the absence of an IRP . Similarly , there are formulae available to determine the competitiveness of renewables , compared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indicated in Parliament , the Government is taking a broader policy sweep on the electricity sector to ensure relative energy security . That implies a deeper thrust into solar and wind . The policy context in which this is approached is , however , crucial . It is urgent , therefore , that Mr Vaz thinks through the issues and makes available the necessary information to allow stakeholders to assess the basis of decisions on this matter .

@@91587238 <p> " If the only tool you have is a hammer , it is tempting to treat everything as if it were a nail " <p> -- Abraham Maslow <p> The Gleaner 's June 14 editorial sometimes argues with itself . On other occasions it creates and then attacks the proverbial straw man . And every now and then it forms conclusions without having -- or addressing -- all the relevant facts . However , even on these occasions , I have not had reason to doubt its sincerity . <p> Let me be unambiguously clear . On the matter of disclosing to the public the cost of printing of banknotes , I was -- and remain -- disappointed that this specific information was not available for public consumption . I fundamentally believe that data on public expenditure should be available to all Jamaicans . In the response to my recent column in The Sunday Gleaner of June 12 , the editorial , therefore , argues with itself on this point . <h> Headlines Delivered to Your Inbox <p> In my capacity as minister of finance and the public service , I was instinctively uncomfortable with the non-disclosure of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As such , I inquired into , and carefully reviewed , the facts and reasoning behind the Bank of Jamaica 's ( BOJ ) position regarding disclosure of this information , and then wrote an OpEd which outlined my views . <p> Having been briefed on the matter , I concluded that given the confidentiality provisions of the contract regarding the banknotes , and the exemption clauses enshrined in the Access to Information Act , the BOJ 's response to The Gleaner was not only defensible , but also justified under the circumstances . <h> LAUNCH A MISSILE <p> The editorial used " the ink it buys by the drum " to launch a missile based on the conclusion of my review . That was unfortunate . It was analogous to lambasting a judge for adjudicating on a case in accordance with the facts and the applicable law . You may not like her decision but that decision does not reflect her view on the facts , except that they are facts . <p> A confidentiality clause exists . That is a fact . And she is duty bound to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Information Act provides for exemption from public disclosure on the grounds of breach of confidence . That is the law . Conflating issues and misrepresenting the judge 's decision on a case , as her justification of the facts in the case , is distortionary and therefore problematic . <p> My column last week never sought to defend the existence of the confidentiality clause . Rather , I commented on the consequences of its existence . And because of the constraint the clause imposes , I provided other information and data that I thought readers would find useful . <p> Now , let 's discuss the confidentiality clause . <p> Throughout our history of printing Jamaican banknotes , dating back to at least two decades ago , and up to and including the present time , contracts with banknote printers have always included confidentiality clauses which explicitly prohibit public dissemination of contractual terms , including pricing . <p> With respect to the confidentiality of pricing , therefore , this is not unusual and the BOJ is operating within firmly established and accepted historical norms across time . <p> In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to four international banknote printers over the last 10 years . This includes the period in 2012 when 40 per cent of banknotes ( i.e. the $50 and $100 banknotes ) were upgraded to use a new substrate and to include new security features . In all cases , across the four printers used in the last decade , the underlying contracts have had confidentiality clauses restricting public disclosure of contract terms , including pricing . <h> CONSISTENCY ACROSS PRINTERS <p> With respect to the confidentiality of pricing , therefore , there has also been consistency across printers . <p> Further , the confidentiality in the pricing of outsourced banknote printing is not unique to Jamaica . For leading global banknote printers , the confidentiality of terms including pricing is a standard feature of contracts in all countries where they supply banknotes . <p> With respect to the confidentiality of pricing , the BOJ is therefore operating within the framework of accepted international norms across countries . <p> Changing this by demanding the discontinuation of these clauses in future banknote printing contracts may not be straightforward . Jamaica simply may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ norm of the commercial banknote printing market , despite misguided views of our own self-importance . <p> Or we may " succeed " in removing the confidentiality clause , but at the expense of possibly losing the participation of the most competitive firms , or all , reputable , experienced , international firms . <p> I do n't intend to analyse why this norm exists , nor does space allow me to justify it , but I will say that banknote printing is an extremely competitive industry that involves highly sophisticated , proprietary , sensitive security technologies . <p> The editorial worries that others in the public sector will use the shield of confidentiality to prevent public disclosure . Well , shielding the contractual terms of banknote printing from public disclosure for several decades now has not led to widespread mimicry , and so we need not fear that now . <p> Besides , the concern is based on a simple world where fundamental principles do not contend with each other . That is not the real world . Globally , there are other sectors , such as defence and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confidentiality of terms and conditions in public contracting even in the most transparent of countries . We do not see a misuse of these exceptions across public sectors in those countries as a result . <p> Even in a developed country such as England , the contractual terms of banknote printing -- inclusive of price -- are not publicly disclosed . Instead , a range of the " cost per note " is published which does not violate the confidentiality clause signed with printers . <p> We can do the same here : the cost of printing Jamaica 's banknotes over the period 2017 to 2022 , inclusive of the new banknotes , has been between US five cents and US six cents per banknote . <p> However , to chastise the BOJ for what is a local norm with historical pedigree , as well as a practice across the industry , and a well-accepted international standard , without reference to context , is to seek to change goalposts while the game is in play . <h> GOALPOSTS MAY NEED TO BE SHIFTED <p> Times change , values evolve , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so , let us seek to do so transparently , acknowledging the well-developed and widely accepted norms , as well as the limits of Jamaica 's influence in a world where commercial might and considerations matter . <p> The attempt by the editorial to now castigate a norm which has long been implemented locally -- across political administrations , which prevails internationally , across respected countries and for which Jamaica 's capacity to single-handedly change is limited , and to do so without transparent and even-handed recognition and acknowledgement of these facts may ironically also serve to diminish public trust . <p> It does so by carelessly giving the impression of reflexive and instinctive bias by an important institution where , I have long believed , none exists . And that too has its costs . Given market share realities , the society is poorer if such perceptions become widespread . But then again , lack of awareness and acknowledgement of relevant facts often disguises itself as bias . This , unfortunately , is no less corrosive . <p> Taken together with my column last week , I hope that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ further information , data , and facts on the matter of banknote printing , aids public understanding . <p> I believe that these conversations are important .

Have we emerged stronger , learning valuable lessons while changing our values for the better , or was this merely a culling and massive transfer of wealth from the poor and middle class to the wealthy ? <p> As death stalked us and fear rode behind it , we should have learned what was important and what was not .

We can not quantify how many were left so far behind that it is near impossible for them to catch up with those who had the resources and support available to excel at homeschooling . The cracks in the education system have given way to a full-blown crumbling of the foundation -- early childhood education .

With the landmark ruling that the states of emergencies were unconstitutional in the single case reviewed to date , and the opposition party emboldened by the judges ' decision supporting their vehement opposition to the SOEs , we can put to rest the idea that SOEs will be the immediate crime suppression tactic while broader measures are allowed to materialise .

Many patients were lost to follow up and the waiting list for surgeries , already over two years in some instances , grew significantly . Some who were awaiting elective surgery for prolonged periods ended up having emergency surgeries as their conditions deteriorated . As with the education system , we do not have an idea of the true effects of the scaled down clinics and hospital services . Chronic diseases were suboptimally treated over the last two years and the effect of this has not started to manifest fully .

@@92309230 <h> Technology Driving Gains in Birth Registration Process <p> JIS Features <p> July 21 , 2022 <p> Written by : SHERIKA HALL <p> A picture of the RGD building located in Twickhenham Park , Spanish Town . <p> Photo : JIS File Photo <p> Technology is contributing significantly to the impressive gains made in the birth registration process at the Registrar General 's Department ( RGD ) , even though there have been many modifications over the years . <p> The compulsory registration of all birth , marriage , stillbirth and death records was introduced in Jamaica in 1878 , followed a year later by the establishment of the Registrar General 's Department ( RGD ) , Jamaica 's only repository for recording these vital events . <p> Prior to and post Jamaica 's Independence , registration was carried out primarily through a network of Local District Registrars ( LDRs ) who were responsible for manually recording births in their own districts and submitting copies of those records to the RGD . <p> To assist with the process , Parish officers would collect and deliver original registrations to the RGD that would secure them in a fireproof vault at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Duplicate records were also collected and stored in a secured vault offsite . <p> The records are kept on shelves in acid-free containers in the vaults which has temperature control , air conditioning , and a fire suppression system . The record vaults are also equipped with security cameras and are secured by combination locks which require dual access . <p> Each LDR has an alpha code that is prefixed to every registration number given at the time of birth , the numbering being sequential . Additionally , each parish was divided into registration districts , with their own Registrar . <p> The first letter of the alpha code refers to the parish , while the second letter represents a local LDR within the parish . These letters , when combined , form the LDR 's identifier . <p> Production Manager at the RGD , Desmond Davis , who has been with the entity for over two decades , says he has seen numerous changes in the registration process , one of the most significant of which is how registration is done . <p> He shares that the RGD @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parish , where persons would go to register their children . <p> Mr. Davis notes that in earlier years , " if the time came for a mother to give birth and she is not in her parish of origin , while she could visit the nearest hospital or birthing centre to have the baby , she would still have to go back to the LDR in the parish that she is originally from to receive a certificate of registry for the child . " <p> For her part , Parish Officer with responsibility for supervising LDRs in St. Catherine , Beulah Thomas , says if the baby was delivered at home by a midwife , " a notification of birth will be given to the mother to take with her to conduct the registration within her parish . " <p> Ms. Thomas notes that while there is still a small percentage of home births , " whenever they LDRs are doing those registrations , an identification card for the mother and a letter from a Justice of the Peace confirming the evidence of birth , have to be presented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LDR having previous knowledge of the birth " . <p> However , with the advancement of technology , the RGD has improved its registration process . <p> Chief Executive Officer ( CEO ) of the RGD , Charlton McFarlane , says that many of the technological innovations of today did not exist when the RGD was founded in 1879 and as such , the entity is making use of technology to enhance its service delivery . <p> Gone are the days when the entity had to photocopy , stamp and seal records for customers . Since May 2001 , the information is entered into the RGD 's birth registration system and a computer-generated certificate is issued to the customer . <p> " No longer do we issue birth certificates on paper written on with a pen ; we now issue what is called a computer-generated certificate that is printed on security paper , which minimises a person 's ability to change the information on the certificate , " Mr. McFarlane outlines . <p> He adds that the introduction of security paper into the RGD 's processes has significantly reduced its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agency also implemented its Application Tracking System in 2003 , which is used internally by staff members to track customer applications from submission to production and delivery . The tracking system , so far , has assisted the entity in becoming more efficient at what it does and can be accessed from any RGD location . <p> Citing an example , Mr. Davis indicates that if a person comes to the RGD to enquire about an application and does not have their birth entry number on hand , " we can search for the number electronically in our system , whereas in years gone by , we had what was referred to as indices ... these entry numbers were manually entered into a book , and we had to look through the index to find the numbers " . <p> " Furthermore , these books are located in one area and so someone from the RGD would have to go to the physical location to retrieve the information , but now we have a computer system that is accessible to every customer service representative , " the Production Manager explains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ programme , which facilitates the early registration of babies born within birthing centres and hospitals , was implemented to further strengthen the registration process . <p> The programme was launched to fill the gap in the registration coverage for births , which was less than 80 per cent at the time . This was due to parents leaving hospitals and raising their children without registering them . <p> Not only has there been improvements in tracking an application , registering births , and producing certificates , but the entity has also begun to digitise its records . <p> The process started in 2014 with 12 computers located in a small room at the RGD 's Portmore branch , where paper records were scanned and indexed . <p> The CEO reports that to date , the entity has digitised 3,750,000 records , approximately 35 per cent of birth records . Since its inception , the agency has amassed well over 7,000,000 records . <p> Earlier this year , a contract was signed between the National Identification System ( NIDS ) project and a private service provider , taking the digitisation process @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the remaining birth records .

The court ... <p> St Catherine Southern Member of Parliament Fitz Jackson has locked horns with Scotiabank Jamaica , filing a lawsuit in the Supreme Court challenging the legality of cheque-cashing fees imposed by the financial institution on its customers . <p> The court action , which was set in motion last Tuesday by Jackson 's attorneys , sets the stage for a landmark ruling that could rock the local banking sector and provide a road map for challenging a range of fees imposed on the public , a matter which has triggered much outrage in recent years . <p> The lawsuit is based on a May 2019 incident in which Jackson , a five-term lawmaker , claimed he was compelled to pay a $385 fee before a teller at Scotiabank 's Portmore branch would cash a $2,500 cheque in his name . <p> He is seeking a declaration from the court that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breached its obligation by failing to honour a negotiable instrument , according to court documents obtained by The Sunday Gleaner . <p> Section 73 of the Bills of Exchange Act defines a cheque as a negotiable instrument and stipulates that it must be honoured on demand without conditions , Jackson 's attorney , Anthony Williams , contended during an interview with The Sunday Gleaner yesterday . <h> Headlines Delivered to Your Inbox <p> " The moment the bank puts in conditions and says , ' You have to give me $385 in order for me to change the cheque ' ... then you are making the cheque a conditional order , " said Williams , managing partner at Usim Williams and Company , which filed the lawsuit . <p> " It is an unconditional order . It is not a request , " he said , referring to a cheque presented for encashment . <p> For several years , Jackson has been waging a battle against commercial banks for what he calls " cruel , unreasonable and heartless deductions from account holders through a range of fee penalties " . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Banking Services Act , which would address the issue of high service fees charged by commercial banks . Jackson said the bill would " offer some protection to the public . This bill would allow account holders to make transactions against their own accounts without the penalty of fees " . <p> However , the bill has not received the support of the Parliament . <p> Last month , Finance Minister Dr Nigel Clarke disclosed in Parliament that seven of the eight commercial banks he checked with acknowledged that they charge a fee to " cover administrative costs associated with processing a cheque " . <p> Last year , local deposit taking institutions ( DTIs ) saw their profitability balloon due to increased reliance on non-interest revenues or fees , the Bank of Jamaica ( BOJ ) noted in its 2021 annual report . <p> According to the report , pre-tax profits for DTIs totalled $47 billion last year , with non-interest income or fees on loans and other services accounting for nearly $23 billion , or 48 per cent . Pre-tax profits totalled $25.4 billion in 2020 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to send a message to the banks and this will also impact the ordinary man , " attorney Williams told The Sunday Gleaner , alluding to the far-reaching implications of the lawsuit . <p> " Banks are now imposing policies , they are imposing regulations , concepts and principles that are in breach of the law , " Williams charged , making reference to the Bills of Exchange Act . <h> NO COMMENT <p> Scotiabank has declined to comment on the lawsuit . <p> " As reference is being made to a pending legal matter , it would not be appropriate to comment further at this time , " Danielle Savory , manager for public affairs and communication at Scotiabank , said in an emailed response on Friday to questions submitted by The Sunday Gleaner . <p> Septimus ' Bob ' Blake , president of the Jamaica Bankers Association ( JBA ) , also declined comment , saying he was not aware of the pending litigation . <p> Blake indicated , also , that the JBA could not offer a view on whether commercial banks obtained a legal opinion that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I do n't know that we can opine on something like that , " he said during an interview yesterday . <p> " Each institution has its own business model and determines the various fees for the various services and we presume that each institution would have a basis on which to charge for its services , " reasoned Blake , who is also chief executive officer of the National Commercial Bank . <p> Jackson also had no comment on the case when contacted on Friday . <p> Finance Minister Clarke , who was responding to questions posed by Jackson in Parliament , explained that cashing a cheque involves carrying out due diligence checks to confirm the bona fides of the request and the instrument tendered and covering the administrative costs associated with providing that service . <p> " In this regard , the industry 's position is that the fee/charge is attached to the processing of the cheque and is not based on an instruction or condition of payment of the person who ordered the payment , " the finance minister said . <p> " Fundamentally , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Scotiabank manager for public affairs and communication noted , too , that customers have the option of depositing a cheque into their account at no charge or " pay a service fee for immediate encashment " . <p> Savory added that customers can also request to have payments transferred electronically instead of by cheque , noting that electronic transfers would be less expensive for the payer and would not attract a fee for the recipient . <p> However , Williams said he will be asking the court for a declaration that the practice of demanding a fee to cash a cheque is wrong . <p> " Do you know what $385 can do for a lot of people ?

I was a 13.3 seconds runner , and at the time , even though I made NCAA , I did n't make much of that because I know on the world stage , it 's a different story .

It was designed with the direct support and guidance of RMAS Instructing and Support Staff . <p> Rationale <p> Traditionally , the Jamaica Defence Force 's ( JDF ) longstanding partnerships with militaries across the world has seen its OCdts being trained in academies in the following countries : United States , England , Canada , China and India . Upon the return of OCdts to the JDF , there is a requirement for doctrine and operating procedure standardization due to the varying concepts and differing contents of the training they had undergone . This is normally done at the Unit level and later , through a Young Officers ' Course . The advent of COVID-19 added a new level of complexity to travel , thus negatively affecting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ongoing expansion and restructuring of the Force to cauterize the ballooning threats to national security has caused an increased demand for newly commissioned Second Lieutenants . <p> Due to the carefully adapted military and academic curricula , IOTP serves as the course to treat with the aforementioned considerations . The methodology used addresses each issue directly and the course , through the delivery of a bespoke training syllabus , is fit for the JDF and is also relevant to the militaries and organizations within the Caribbean region and in other parts of the world . <p> Concept <p> Having the RMAS approach to training at its core , IOTP is designed with a syllabus that sees male and female integration throughout training . The course focusses on developing military skills and command with a leadership ' golden thread ' . The course structure allows the Instructing Staff to educate , build , develop and scrutinize an OCdt 's ability to decide and communicate accurately and ethically while under pressure and or stress . The expectation is that on commissioning , an OCdt will be fully cognizant of the responsibilities and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The product of the IOTP will be an ethical and robust Officer who has the knowledge , skills , attitudes and intellectual agility to adapt their decision-making process and approach to any environment . <p> Location <p> The home of IOTP is the Caribbean Military Academy ( CMA ) Newcastle , which is located at the Newcastle Hill Station , St Andrew , Jamaica . <p> Nestled in the cool hills of upper St Andrew and amidst beautiful trees , ferns , ground orchids , delicate wild flowers and a profusion of ginger lilies , is the Newcastle <p> Training Depot founded in 1841 by Major General Sir William Maynard Gomm ( later Field Marshall ) . Gomm , a veteran of the wars against revolutionary France and Lieutenant Governor of Jamaica from 1840 to 1841 , relentlessly badgered the War Office in London to establish a mountain station for British soldiers in Jamaica soon after taking up his post . <p> The idea of the hill station was first raised by Gomm in a letter dated April 7 , 1840 to Governor Sir Charles Metcalfe . Gomm pointed out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a barracks , it was subject to the ravages of yellow fever .

According to Russell , the year 1838 was considered a ' good ' year : only 91 men died . In 1839 , 110 men perished and in the following year 121 . Initially , the British government was conservative in approving a hill station for the troops in Jamaica . They were concerned about the expense of the venture . <p> In May 1841 , London finally sanctioned Gomm 's efforts to build what is thought to be the first permanent mountain station in the British West Indies at Newcastle .

Newcastle became a training depot , training recruits from all over the West Indies as part of the <p> newly formed West Indies Federation . In 1962 when Federation was disbanded , the West India Regiment was also disbanded . Jamaica simultaneously sought her independence , which was achieved on August 6 , 1962 .

It was designed with the direct support and guidance of RMAS Instructing and Support Staff . <p> Rationale <p> Traditionally , the Jamaica Defence Force 's ( JDF ) longstanding partnerships with militaries across the world has seen its OCdts being trained in academies in the following countries : United States , England , Canada , China and India . Upon the return of OCdts to the JDF , there is a requirement for doctrine and operating procedure standardization due to the varying concepts and differing contents of the training they had undergone . This is normally done at the Unit level and later , through a Young Officers ' Course . The advent of COVID-19 added a new level of complexity to travel , thus negatively affecting the process of sending OCdts overseas . Additionally , the ongoing expansion and restructuring of the Force to cauterize the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for newly commissioned Second Lieutenants . <p> Due to the carefully adapted military and academic curricula , IOTP serves as the course to treat with the aforementioned considerations . The methodology used addresses each issue directly and the course , through the delivery of a bespoke training syllabus , is fit for the JDF and is also relevant to the militaries and organizations within the Caribbean region and in other parts of the world . <p> Concept <p> Having the RMAS approach to training at its core , IOTP is designed with a syllabus that sees male and female integration throughout training . The course focusses on developing military skills and command with a leadership ' golden thread ' . The course structure allows the Instructing Staff to educate , build , develop and scrutinize an OCdt 's ability to decide and communicate accurately and ethically while under pressure and or stress . The expectation is that on commissioning , an OCdt will be fully cognizant of the responsibilities and personal conditions that being an Officer imposes upon them . The product of the IOTP will be an ethical and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and intellectual agility to adapt their decision-making process and approach to any environment . <p> Location <p> The home of IOTP is the Caribbean Military Academy ( CMA ) Newcastle , which is located at the Newcastle Hill Station , St Andrew , Jamaica . <p> Nestled in the cool hills of upper St Andrew and amidst beautiful trees , ferns , ground orchids , delicate wild flowers and a profusion of ginger lilies , is the Newcastle <p> Training Depot founded in 1841 by Major General Sir William Maynard Gomm ( later Field Marshall ) . Gomm , a veteran of the wars against revolutionary France and Lieutenant Governor of Jamaica from 1840 to 1841 , relentlessly badgered the War Office in London to establish a mountain station for British soldiers in Jamaica soon after taking up his post . <p> The idea of the hill station was first raised by Gomm in a letter dated April 7 , 1840 to Governor Sir Charles Metcalfe . Gomm pointed out that while Up Park Camp was an ideal location for a barracks , it was subject to the ravages of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stationed on the plain at Up Park Camp , Stony Hill , Fort Augusta and Port Royal . Here , on the average , 1 soldier died every 2 ? days . According to Russell , the year 1838 was considered a ' good ' year : only 91 men died . In 1839 , 110 men perished and in the following year 121 . Initially , the British government was conservative in approving a hill station for the troops in Jamaica . They were concerned about the expense of the venture . <p> In May 1841 , London finally sanctioned Gomm 's efforts to build what is thought to be the first permanent mountain station in the British West Indies at Newcastle . The site selected was a coffee plantation protruding from the southern face of the grand ridge of the Blue Mountains . The British government paid ? 4,230 for the Newcastle site . <p> At the outbreak of World War II ( 1939-1945 ) , life at Newcastle changed a little . The British regiment was replaced by Canadian regiments which remained at Newcastle for the duration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Canadians left and once again a British battalion was stationed there . <p> In 1958 , the West Indies Federation was founded and the infantry regiments of the various Caribbean islands were disbanded and reorganized into the West India Regiment . Newcastle became a training depot , training recruits from all over the West Indies as part of the <p> newly formed West Indies Federation . In 1962 when Federation was disbanded , the West India Regiment was also disbanded . Jamaica simultaneously sought her independence , which was achieved on August 6 , 1962 . With independence , Newcastle was given to the Jamaican government as part of a general settlement of all military lands in Jamaica .

@@95741230 <h> The Christmas story 's virgin birth <h> Why early Christians would n't have found it so surprising <p> The virgin birth may seem strange to a modern audience -- and not just because it runs counter to the science of reproduction . Even in the Bible itself , the idea is rarely mentioned . <p> Every year at Christmas , Christians celebrate the birth of their religion 's founder , Jesus from Nazareth of Galilee . Part of this celebration includes the claim that Jesus was born from a virgin mother named Mary , which is fundamental to the Christian understanding that Jesus is the divine son of God . <p> The virgin birth may seem strange to a modern audience -- and not just because it runs counter to the science of reproduction . Even in the Bible itself , the idea is rarely mentioned . <p> However , Rodolfo Galvan Estrada III , assistant professor of the New Testament at the Vanguard University , argues that this story 's original audiences would not have been put off by the supposed " strangeness " of the virgin-birth story . The story would have felt much more familiar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full of tales of legendary men born of gods -- and when early Christians were paying close attention to the Hebrew Bible 's prophecies . <h> WHAT THE BIBLE DOES -- AND DOES N'T -- SAY <p> Strikingly , the New Testament is relatively silent on the virgin birth except in two places . It appears only in the gospels of Matthew and Luke , written a few decades after Jesus ' death , Estrada III pointed out . <p> The Book of Matthew explains that when Joseph was engaged to Mary , she was " found to be pregnant through the Holy Spirit " . The writer links this unexpected pregnancy to an Old Testament prophecy in Isaiah 7:14 , which states that " the virgin will conceive and give birth to a son , and she will call him Immanuel " . According to the prophet Isaiah , this child would be a sign to the Jewish people that God would protect them from powerful empires . <h> Headlines Delivered to Your Inbox <p> " Now the majority of early Christians outside of Judea and throughout the Roman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hebrew but rather a Greek translation known as the Septuagint . When the Gospel of Matthew quotes Isaiah 7:14 , it uses the Septuagint , which includes the term ' parthenos ' , commonly understood as ' virgin ' . This term differs from the Hebrew Old Testament , which uses the word ' almah ' , properly translated as ' young woman ' . The slight difference in translation between the Hebrew and the Greek may not mean much , but for early Christians who knew Greek , it provided prophetic proof for Jesus ' birth from the Virgin Mary , " he said . <p> " Was the belief in the virgin birth based on a mistranslation ? Not necessarily . Such terms were sometimes synonymous in Greek and Jewish thought . And the same Greek word , ' parthenos ' , is also found in Luke 's version of the story . Luke does not cite the prophecy in Isaiah 7:14 . Instead , this version of the Nativity story describes the angel Gabriel announcing to Mary that she will give birth even though she is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mary is told that her baby will be the ' son of God ' . " <h> HUMAN AND DIVINE ? <p> For early Christians , the idea of the virgin birth put to rest any rumors about Mary 's honour . It also contributed to their belief that Jesus was the Son of God and Mary the Mother of God . These ideas became even more important during the second century when some Christians were debating Jesus ' origins : Was he simply born a human being but became the Son of God after being baptised ? Was He a semi-divine being , not really human ? Or was He both fully divine and fully human ? <p> The last idea , symbolised by the virgin birth , was most accepted -- and is now standard Christian belief . But the relative silence about it in the first few decades of Christianity does not necessarily suggest that early Christians did not believe it . Instead , as biblical scholar Raymond Brown also noted , the virgin birth was likely not a major concern for first-century Christians . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became a human being without trying to explain exactly how this happened . <h> GRECO-ROMAN ROOTS <p> " Claiming that someone was divinely born was not a new concept during the first century when Jesus was born . Many Greco-Roman heroes had divine-birth stories . Take three famous figures : Perseus , Ion , and Alexander the Great , " said the New Testament scholar . <p> One of the oldest Greek legends affirms that Perseus , an ancient ancestor of the Greek people , was born of a virgin mother named Dana ? . The story begins with Dana ? imprisoned by her father , the king of Argos , who feared her because it was prophesied that his grandson would kill him . According to the legend , the Greek god Zeus transformed himself into golden rain and impregnated her . <p> When Dana ? gave birth to Perseus , they escaped and eventually landed on an island , where he grew up . He eventually became a famous hero who killed the snake-haired Medusa , and his great-grandson was Hercules , known for his strength and uncontrollable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fifth century B.C. , describes the story of Ion , whose father was the Greek god Apollo . Apollo raped Creusa , Ion 's mother , who abandoned him at birth . Ion grew up unaware of his divine father but eventually reconciled with his Athenian mother and became known as the founder of various Greek cities in modern-day Turkey . <p> Lastly , legends held that Zeus was the father of Alexander the Great , the Macedonian ruler who conquered his vast empire before age 33 . Alexander was supposedly conceived the night before his mother consummated her marriage with the king of Macedon when Zeus impregnated her with a lightning bolt from heaven . Philip , the king of Macedon , raised Alexander as his son but suspected that there was something different about his conception . <h> A FAMILIAR TYPE OF HERO <p> Overall , divine-conception stories were familiar in the ancient Mediterranean world . By the second century A.D. , Justin Martyr , a Christian theologian who defended Christianity , recognised this point : that virgin birth would not have been considered as " extraordinary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in an address to the Roman emperor Antoninus Pius and philosophers , Justin argued that they should tolerate Christian belief in the virgin birth just as they did belief in the stories of Perseus . <p> The idea of the divine participating in the conception of a child destined for greatness would n't have seemed so unusual to an ancient audience . Even more , early Christians ' interpretation of the prophecy in Isaiah 7:14 from the Septuagint supported their belief that Jesus ' origin was not only divine , but foretold in their prophetic scriptures .

The average per person would be about US$830 . <p> In the old days , before credit cards , consumers had few options to account for this surge in holiday spending -- beyond simply setting aside personal savings . Some banks offered so-called Christmas savings clubs in which customers could make automatic deposits throughout the year that they could use for gifts at the end . To ensure that accounts were not raided early , there were financial penalties for early withdrawals .

This means that people without any credit history like teenagers or new immigrants may be able to take advantage of these plans . It also means that people who have maxed out their credit cards can also participate .

One estimate suggests that the total market will hit US$1 trillion by 2025 . <p> A 2021 survey found that electronics are the most popular item to purchase using ' buy now , pay later ' , followed by clothing and fashion items . <p> Given that these companies charge no interest and no fees , how do they make money ? <p> Two ways : They typically charge merchants a percentage of every purchase , and customers who are unable to complete their payments on time pay late fees . <h> PAY MORE LATER ? <p> " There are several downsides to ' buy now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " One is that they can cause consumers to become overextended and spend more than they can , fundamentally , afford .

" <p> The CFPB found that about 11 per cent of borrowers were charged at least one late fee in 2021 , which suggests that they overspent . Late fees are typically around US$7 , which is about five per cent of the average loan size of US$135 . <p> " Another problem is these payment plans are not very forgiving when people get into financial trouble .

The company , a decade ago , recycled some 95 per cent of its bottles but that dipped to about 80 per cent during the pandemic , according to the FTC report . <p> " We ask for your support in encouraging all Jamaicans to support our ' Red-cycling ' efforts to create a sustainable , environmentally responsible packaging solution while ensuring that their favourite brewed products are available for the enjoyment , " added Ashton-Smith about the Red Stripe-branded recycling programme . <p> The rise in the payment has , however , led to the " resurgence of bottle police " as it has made retrieving empty bottles more lucrative , according to FTC economist Dr Kevin Harriott in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to persons who collect bottles for income from events , bars , and stores . <p> The FTC investigation of bottle returns flowed from complaints from at least one bar owner that the practice was discriminatory since it was n't applied evenly throughout the trade . <p> According to the FTC , around the time it began looking into the bottle-return complaint , Red Stripe expanded its collection drive to retailers after its investigation to incorporate the entire market , thereby removing the anti-competitive areas of concern . <p> " After we started the investigation , they subsequently changed the policy , " said FTC Executive Director David Miller in an interview with the Financial Gleaner . The FTC report makes reference to discussions with Red Stripe Jamaica dating back to November 2021 . <p> The distribution channels subjected to the initial policy were community bars , quick-service restaurants , independent supermarkets , grocery shops , mini-marts , wholesalers , and distributors . Red Stripe selected the initial channels based on the rate of bottle return as well as the volume of sales through the respective channels , according to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distribution channels such as supermarket chains , educational institutions , hotels , gas stations , and convenience stores were exempted from the policy . The policy , therefore , creates a market in which one group of retailers would find it more difficult to expand its sales relative to the other group of retailers , " said the report . <p> " There was a danger , therefore , that D&amp;G would have to shut down its brewery if the production level fell below the minimum level that would allow D&amp;G to produce bottled beverages at a competitive price . The policy allowed D&amp;G to increase its stock of empty bottles to three weeks of production and avoid shutting down , " the competition watchdog said . <p> Red Stripe Jamaica is the trading name for drinks company Desnoes &amp; Geddes Limited , producer of Red Stripe beer . <p> The policy helped Red Stripe Jamaica avoid the costly measures associated with temporarily shutting down its brewery . Immediately before the policy , the empty bottles in the brewery 's custody supported only five days of production , the report @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Red Stripe collecting over 50 per cent more bottles a month after its introduction . <p> The FTC described Red Stripe as having a dominant position in the market but stopped short of calling their actions an abuse of dominance . After all , it noted , retailers were benefiting from reduced prices .
