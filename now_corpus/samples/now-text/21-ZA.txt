It happens when an egg is not released from your ovary into the fallopian tubes during your period .

However , testosterone imbalances or increased androgens in women can cause irregular periods , acne , unwanted hair on the face and body , thinning of hair and obesity . <p> Insulin Resistance <p> Insulin is a hormone that the pancreas makes to allow cells to absorb and use blood sugar . However , when cells can not absorb blood sugar , the cells begin to store glucose which leads to the cells becoming resistant to the constant insulin . Insulin resistance occurs when a woman 's pancreas needs to pump out more insulin in response to high blood sugar levels thus the risk of prediabetes increases . <p> Obesity <p> As a result of most of the factors mentioned above , along with PCOS , women experience unexplained weight gain and often struggle to lose weight .

What started as a localised and isolated health scare , very soon spread to a global pandemic . Despite fatality numbers being relatively modest as pandemics go , the uncertainty about the disease , and its transmission and propagation , caused an extreme leadership response . <p> Drastic mobility restrictions and a number of physical lockdowns led to economic outcomes not experienced in over a century . Countries , communities , and individuals faced circumstances that severely tested the fibre of our societies . <p> INSIDERGOLD <p> Subscribe for full access to all our share and unit trust data tools , our award-winning articles , and support quality journalism in the process . <h> Choose an option : <p> You will be redirected to a checkout page .

Now we have to focus on leadership because over the next few months , our futures will be determined by the decisions made by the people in power . <p> But before we look ahead , let 's reflect on how leadership decisions have impacted us recently : <p> Pandemic leadership : <p> China was first to contract the virus ; first to establish major city lockdowns ; first to experience the economic fallout that follows such large-scale closures ; and first to " recover " as new cases and fatalities fell and economic recovery could commence . <p> Many details of sector and industry dynamics in China now serve as the blueprint for the rest of the world as to what the short-term future probably looks like . Chinese mobility statistics show a return to pre-Covid levels in some industries , but a longer lag @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the globe , but with a lag of around three months . <p> Economic growth leadership : <p> China has been the fastest growing of the largest global economies , and the major contributor to global growth , over the past 30 years . That pace of annual growth has slowly but surely declined from over 10% to around 5% . The world 's largest growth force has deflated and its relative lead over other developing economies has been neutralised . <p> Political leadership : <p> Nothing empowers political leaders like a global threat , whatever form it might take . Armed with medical statistics and models predicting global doom , leaders around the world took firm control of their constituents , rode roughshod over otherwise democratic processes and implemented draconian containment strategies . <p> In many instances these restrictions had dire social and economic consequences , but leaders were emboldened by the forecast models . Borders were closed instantaneously , leaving many people , businesses and industries in perilous situations . With global supply chains broken , international trade collapsed , forcing local buying . This de-globalisation and regionalisation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last 30 years . It is one of the major themes that may impact our medium-term horizon . <p> Central bank leadership : <p> Globally , central banks had to step up to prevent systemic market and economic meltdowns . Interest rates were drastically lowered around the world , with many economies going into negative rate regimes , while many others are now at historically low official interest rates . <p> Despite this very benign borrowing environment , economic growth remained sluggish which saw central banks going further by monetising the enormous debt created by supportive fiscal stimulus . This new experiment in massive sovereign debt escalation , magically funded by central banks , is known as Modern Monetary Theory . It is another important theme on our dashboard . <p> Currency leadership : <p> The US dollar has been the undisputed global currency leader during the past century . Not only has the US economy been the largest economy in the world during most of this period , it has also led most , if not all , multi-country global organisations . These factors have made the dollar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ability of the US to attract global savings has delivered it a huge benefit in the form of lower funding costs and ample liquidity . It also places the Federal Reserve and its monetary policy on a global leadership pedestal -- hence the saying , " As the US goes , so goes the world . " <p> This undisputed and ubiquitous status of the almighty dollar is now being eroded by the fact that the US interest rate differential has vanished , and its sovereign debt has increased way beyond the size of the economy . The future level and change in value of the US dollar against other global currencies remains one of the most important variables on our dashboard . <p> Industry and sector leadership : <p> Lockdowns and mobility restrictions had severe impacts on many industries . The aviation , tourism , entertainment and hospitality sectors immediately come to mind as the worst hit by the pandemic restrictions . The automotive , manufacturing and energy sectors were also impacted , but theirs is more about postponement , as opposed to " never going to happen " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the clear sector leadership that emerged was driven by the work-from-home ( WFH ) theme . Technology , communication and on-line retail -- although present for some time and expected to take a while longer to develop -- was fast-forwarded to the present . Suddenly everybody needed Zoom or Teams , and on-line retail became the norm rather than the exception . <p> Equity market leadership : <p> Concentration in the US equity market rose to historic levels as the technology sector went " through the roof " . The proportion of the total market represented by Apple , Alphabet , Facebook , Google , Microsoft , Netflix and Amazon is astounding . Valuations of most of these stocks are reminiscent of the late 1990s and we risk the creation of an over-valued tech bubble . Again though , we hear , " This time is different . " It seldom is ... <p> Now , as we look ahead to the last quarter of 2020 and further into the future , some other important leadership issues also come into focus : <p> US leadership : <p> The US went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next president . Never before has the world been so ambivalent towards two presidential candidates and yet the poll generated the highest number of votes ever recorded in a US presidential election . <p> US President Donald Trump 's contentious leadership through the Covid-19 crisis devolved into an equally contentious end as it became clear that Joe Biden had beaten him at the poll to become president-elect . As I write , Trump is contesting the results and refuses to concede defeat at the polls , even as Biden begins his transition process . The US is set to move from a period of chaotic , knee-jerk decision-making to an era of far greater stability , which might be constrictive for business on the back of higher proposed taxes , but offers a potentially much better outcome for US-China trade relations and global trade . <p> South African leadership : <p> President Ramaphosa has faced an uphill battle ever since he took over the presidency in February 2018 . He has to navigate the split objectives between business and society on the one hand , and party-political interests on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ style , he seems meticulous , and has thoughtfully unleashed the justice system onto corrupt practices . This cleansing is seen in a highly positive light and is just what is needed right now as South Africa 's economy suffers severely following one of the harshest lockdowns in the world . <p> Global vs local leadership : <p> South Africa has suffered disproportionately from this Covid-19 global economic slowdown as the country was already in a recession at the end of 2019 . Due to severe fiscal constraints , very limited countercyclical government stimulus spending is possible . This leaves our fortune very much in the hands of the global recovery , driven by the leadership of the US and China . <p> Leadership in the domestic equity market has been taken up by the resource stocks on the back of firm metal prices and a weak rand . Global leadership , however , has been with technology ( as mentioned earlier ) . The long-term opportunities now reside in financials and energy , but just like all value stocks , it might take a long time to catalyse . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ways .

( Photo : Shiraaz Mohamed ) <h> The government 's decision to focus on tracking , detaining and deporting migrants as they cross into South Africa ensures that their ' illegal ' status and/or failure to secure the bona fide negative Covid-19 test certificates , currently required to enter into South Africa , is focused on at the expense of the many systemic challenges faced in accessing documentation -- including Covid certificates . <p> Long associated with anti-foreigner , xenophobic and nationalistic sentiments , South Africa 's politics have -- prior to and during the Covid-19 pandemic -- driven uninformed , non-evidence-based and potentially dangerous international immigration/migration policy discussions and processes . <p> This is in spite of previous studies that have clearly demonstrated the wasted expenditure of state funds in its failed attempts to restrict movement across South Africa 's borders . As predicted , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in March 2020 did nothing more than waste money , which could have been put towards South Africa 's dismal vaccine procurement approach .

The minister 's new toys are diverting resources , and diverting attention . <p> For an infectious disease containment strategy to succeed , everyone must be included . This applies to diseases such as HIV and tuberculosis , for which South Africa has some of the highest rates in the world , and now , most urgently , to Covid-19 . Despite the fact that non-discriminatory inclusion is a basic public health and disease control principle , hard battles have had to be fought over many years to ensure that access to HIV and tuberculosis services is available to all in South Africa -- including both citizens and non-citizens alike -- and it looks like this is going to be the case once again in 2021 with Covid-19 testing , treatment and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side-lined in South Africa 's Covid-19 interventions while the government falls back on those familiar ( and unsubstantiated ) claims that foreigners are to blame for state failures with its Covid-19 response and forward-planning .

Yet this year , with a full lockdown imposed by the Zimbabwean state and the " amended " Level 3 lockdown in South Africa , it is unsurprising that many are desperate to return , fearful of being unable to resume work and education , and to get back to their lives , families and communities here .

Collectively , these processes risk producing challenges that will further stall progress towards effective management of the Covid-19 pandemic by undermining attempts to develop coordinated , cross-border , migration-aware and mobility-competent health programmes . They risk pushing migrants into irregular routes and/or deterring both regular and irregular cross-border migrants from accessing Covid-19 interventions once in South Africa . And , yet again , political opportunism is able to ignore the realities on the ground and instead continue to claim that being undocumented is a chosen act of criminality rather than the result of political and systemic failures which plague the immigration processes . <p> This chimes well with the latest false claims and hate speech of **25;3760;TOOLONG @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of violence and indicate an incredibly dangerous and often life-threatening symptom of South Africa 's unhealthy social and political environment . Whilst by no means unique to South Africa , it is this increasingly nationalistic context that the necessarily inclusive programming needed to control the Covid-19 pandemic must contend with . A consequence of South Africa 's growing nationalism is its " investment " in an increasingly restrictive and security-focused approach to the management of international migration ( whilst simultaneously claiming it can not afford the necessary vaccination plan urgently required to control Covid-19 ) . <p> The metaphor of a border -- of keeping " them " away from " us " -- often creeps into popular thinking about infectious disease control . Whilst there is some truth in this , it is not as straightforward as many would like . These borderlines , however thickly drawn and secured , do n't prevent the spread of communicable diseases , including diseases endemic to the highly mobile southern African region -- HIV , tuberculosis and malaria -- and , as of 2020 , Covid-19 . As political tools , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ migrant labour and a region shaped by the movement of people . <p> Damaging government processes include the development of the White Paper on International Migration ( July 2017 ) , amendments to the Refugee Act and Regulations ( effected in January 2020 ) and worrying clauses in the National Health Insurance White Paper ; collectively , the rights of non-citizens to preventative and curative healthcare have been increasingly eroded . This does not make public health sense . It seems that the Covid-19 pandemic is being used by the DHA and others to justify the implementation of increased security measures along borders , with a focus on the Beitbridge/Musina land crossing . <p> The latest DHA policy documents were published for public consultation on 31 December 2020 . The Draft One-Stop Border Post Policy , and the Draft Official Identity Management Policy , both illustrate significant focus on national security and the protection of South Africa 's sovereignty . Such issues and functions are not usually associated with a government department tasked with governance and administration roles in terms of the civic registration of citizens , and the management @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as well as the intensified focus on national security by the DHA and the current Covid-19 context , open up opportunities for health status ( or perceived health risk ) to be applied as an additional securitisation measure through which to further restrict movement across national borders and to justify the arrest , detention and deportation of non-nationals . At present , this takes the form of the requirement for a negative ( costly ) Covid-19 PCR test and compulsory health screening at borders . <p> For those without a valid Covid-19 negative test certificate , rapid antigen testing ( at a cost of R170 , to be borne by the traveller ) is now offered . Whilst the management of any pandemic requires appropriate disease management strategies -- including in relation to the movement of people -- they can all too easily become counterproductive .

Whilst questions around the adequacy of Covax are being asked , and realisation of the limited action taken by the state to date , there is a need to consider collective , multicountry negotiations with pharmaceutical companies . <p> Services at points of entry , and mobile healthcare services in border areas , involve well-trained , immigration-sensitive and capable healthcare workers/community-based workers who should be involved in all mobilisation campaigns and in the roll-out of the vaccination programme . Civil society networks that involve migrant populations -- such as Migrant Health Forums , including those that function across borders -- need to engage with work surrounding the vaccination plan . <p> Whilst the Covid-19 vaccine fiasco plays out in South Africa , we highlight three key considerations related to migration . Firstly , the movement of people within the country -- how will planning and roll-out approaches engage with the high levels of mobility nationally ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second dose ? What if someone has since crossed a border into or out of South Africa ? Secondly , how will inclusive access for all in South Africa be assured ( via a " one country one plan " approach ) ? And finally , given our position within a region of high population mobility , how will we support regional vaccination planning and programming ? TheInternational Health Regulations ( IHR ) recommends that states sharing borders enter bilateral/multilateral agreements for the development of a common response to a health crisis . Not only should this mean that more appropriate interventions are in place in border areas , but a regional strategy for vaccination must be considered . <p> A key question that must be engaged with relates to vaccine passports ; will these be required for Southern African Development Community ( SADC ) nationals and what will this mean in both the short and longer term ? Concerns have already been raised about the potential for a black market in vaccinations ( in addition to the black market developing in the provision of negative Covid-19 PCR test certificates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transporting the vaccine . <p> Without a transparent roll-out plan that appears reasonable , rational and accessible to all , then there may well be a security risk for the vaccine doses themselves ( including a potential black market in vaccinations and threats to the transportation of the vaccine ) , but it 's unlikely to come from migrants or migration . <p> Basic public health sense states that everyone everywhere must be included in all responses to Covid-19 . This is especially critical when thinking about vaccines , including rethinking the ways in which states finance health interventions and urgent action to address the ways in which non-citizens are treated by the state and all in South Africa . <p> Southern Africa is already behind in vaccination plans , and South Africa has the opportunity to lead the way for the region , ensuring all within the SADC are protected , not just those fortunate enough to be born south of the Limpopo River .

@@62533237 <h> Opinionista* Michael Katz * 7 January 2021 <h> Corporate governance : Employee representatives on corporate boards may be a concept whose time has come <h> Corporate employees are important stakeholders , with commitment to the wellbeing of the company and knowledge of its operations . It follows that their voices in board deliberations would be useful . This should also contribute to harmonious industrial relations . <p> The winds of change are blowing on some established concepts of corporate governance . For the purposes of this article , attention is focused on two of these concepts . <p> First , well-established thinking on shareholder primacy in the governance of companies is being replaced by stakeholder governance . There is wide recognition by experts in corporate governance , including academics and senior business leaders , that the duties of directors are not confined to advancing the interest of shareholders ; there are other stakeholders whose interests are also relevant and require recognition . These include employees , customers , suppliers , the local community and the environment , among others . <p> An excellent analysis of current developments in corporate governance is contained in the recently published book by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Business Can Save the World . Henderson draws attention to a statement released in August 2019 by the Business Roundtable , an organisation composed of the CEOs of many of the largest and most powerful American corporations . <p> Display Adverts <p> The statement redefines the purpose of the corporation : " To promote an economy that serves all Americans " -- with 181 CEOs committed to lead their companies for " the benefit of all stakeholders : customers , employees , suppliers , communities and shareholders " . <p> Of the multiplicity of stakeholders referred to as being customers , employees , suppliers , communities or shareholders , it is appropriate , in the context of the objective of this article , to comment in somewhat greater detail on the position of the employee in the life of the employer company . <p> Not only does the employee render valuable services to his/her employer , but of equal importance , the fate and wellbeing of the employee is inextricably bound up with the fate and wellbeing of the employer company . This submission is well formulated by former president @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reich , in his book Saving Capitalism -- For the Many not the Few . Reich pleads his case very convincingly as follows : <p> " Besides , shareholders are not the only parties who invest in the corporation and bear a risk that their investments will drop in value . Workers who have been with the firm for many years may have developed skills and knowledge unique to it . Others may have moved their families to take a job with the firm , buying homes in the community . The community itself may have invested in roads and other infrastructure to accommodate the corporation . " <p> Reich contrasts the position of the employee with that of the shareholder , who is often mobile , short term and an investor for speculative gain rather than having a commitment to the long-term wellbeing of the company . <p> Secondly , another pillar of corporate governance , the composition of the board of directors , is also under scrutiny . Diversity of the board 's composition is widely acclaimed by corporate governance experts and senior business leaders . Included in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skills and expertise are widely regarded as being important . <p> It is submitted that individually and collectively the factors referred to above provide a powerful argument in favour of employee representation on corporate boards . The employee cohort is an important stakeholder , with a commitment to the wellbeing of the employer company and a knowledge of its operations . It follows that its voice in board deliberations would be useful . It should also contribute to harmonious industrial relations . <p> If the philosophical threshold is crossed in favour of a mandatory requirement to have employee representation on corporate boards , a number of important issues arise regarding implementation . These are dealt with later in this article . <p> The purpose of this article is to ignite debate and promote discussion on this important topic . We have reached a milestone in the development of corporate governance . <p> Clarification of certain concepts <p> In the Anglo American approach ( which includes South Africa ) to corporate governance , the unitary board is paramount . In European countries it is common to have worker participation on corporate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ co-determination . Nothing in this article must be construed as a departure from the unitary board structure . <p> Secondly , importantly , all the proposals considered in this article are made within the well-established legal framework and principles forming part of South African company law . It is further submitted that any implementation of the submissions contained in this article must be made within the architecture and structure of the existing legislation and common law principles which regulate companies in South Africa . To do otherwise would be subversive of the existing company law regime in South Africa , with adverse consequences . <p> Thirdly , all existing legislation governing workers ' rights , collective bargaining , employment law , employment equity , among others , must remain unaffected by any of the proposals considered in this article . <p> Important questions regarding implementation <p> As stated , a mandatory requirement to have employee representative/s on corporate boards gives rise to a number of important questions surrounding the implementation of any such requirement . These include : <p> To which companies must such a requirement apply ? <p> Who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in particular , must it be an employee of that company ? <p> Must there be more than one employee representative ? <p> How will the employee representative be appointed/elected ? <p> What will be the sanction for non-compliance with the mandatory requirement ? <p> What will be the rights and duties of the employee representative ? <p> To which companies must the mandatory requirement of having an employee representative apply ? <p> It is respectfully submitted that it should not apply to family companies or to companies not really falling within the domain of public interest . <p> It would more appropriately be applicable to companies involving a public interest , such as state-owned companies , listed companies or companies having a minimum public interest score based on number of employees , liabilities , turnover and shareholders . These are the factors comprehended in Regulation 43 of the Regulations to the Companies Act No 71 of 2008 , as amended ( the " Act " ) , being the criteria for the requirement for a company to have a social and ethics committee . <p> Eligibility to serve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point of departure , any person who is suitable for appointment or election to a board should be eligible to serve as the employees ' representative . <p> Should such a person be an employee of that particular company ? <p> Ideally , that would be so , but employment by that particular company should not be an absolute requirement . <p> Must there be more than one employee representative ? <p> It is , in the dynamics of the boardroom , a lonely existence to be the sole representative of an interest group . The efficiency of that representative is greatly enhanced by including at least one more representative . Experience shows that the confidence of special interest groups ' representatives is increased by numbers . <p> How will the employee representative be appointed or elected ? <p> One of the more vexed questions is how the employee representative should be elected or appointed to the board . What process should be adopted ? <p> In this regard , it is respectfully submitted that the entire architecture of the Act should be taken into account . That would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effect that the employee representative is simply a director on the board with a particular skill base , background , knowledge or experience , and having the same rights and duties as the other directors . <p> There are a number of provisions in the Act that regulate the appointment or election of new directors , which could be used to ensure the inclusion of the employee representative . There are provisions for filling casual vacancies by requisitioning a meeting to elect new directors , as well as the election of directors at the annual general meeting . <p> The actual selection of the identity of the proposed employee representative should not be the right or responsibility of government or any other entity . The existing architecture of the Act neatly accommodates this , as does the corporate governance requirement of receiving recommendations from the nominations committee . <p> Sanction for non-compliance with mandatory requirement to have an employee representative <p> Compliance with the mandatory requirement necessitates the imposition of appropriate sanctions in the legislative matrix . Again , this is best achieved within the existing provisions and structures of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a statutory provision that , for so long as non-compliance continues , all resolutions of the board would be invalid . This is too draconian and would operate unfairly on bona fide third parties dealing with the company who would have no means to determine whether there has been compliance . <p> A more sensible sanction , apart from the strictures imposed by the marketplace , is to embody in the new legislation that non-compliance with this mandatory requirement would in itself be grounds for an application for a declaration , in terms of the relevant provisions of the Act , of delinquency of one or more members of the board , having all the consequences of being declared a delinquent director . <p> It is stressed that this would simply be grounds for such an application ; non-compliance would not automatically have the consequence of a declaration of delinquency . <p> Rights and duties of the employee representative <p> It is submitted that the employee representative on a company 's board should be subject to the same rights and duties as those applicable to all directors . Any special @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ principles of company law regulating directors . The consequences would be significant both legally and commercially . <p> The employee representative would form part of a collegiate team always acting in the best interests of the company . Clearly the company 's best interests can only realistically be achieved when due consideration is given in arriving at decisions , to the interests of its stakeholders . In this regard , the employee representative would be an important voice informing his/her colleagues of the implications to employees of proposed corporate action . It would also provide an important perspective when remuneration for senior executives is under consideration . <p> In a unitary board structure , which is our model , all directors are subject to a single regulatory regime no matter whose interest they are nominally required to represent . This will apply to every director who is included in the board 's composition for his/her special skills , background , race , gender or community . An important reminder in this regard was given by the Federal Court of Australia in a recent judgment , the relevant extract reading as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enjoys the varied wisdom , experience and expertise of persons drawn from different commercial backgrounds . Even so , a director , whatever his or her background , has a duty greater than that of simply representing a particular field of experience or expertise .

" <p> Conclusion <p> Any proposal for having a mandatory requirement for the composition of the boards of certain companies to include an employee representative is likely to ignite robust debate , particularly between business and labour . The method by which such a proposal is to be implemented and the suggested rights and duties applicable to the employee representative on the board will probably be even more heavily contested . <p> None of the above should , however , have the effect of deflecting or postponing the ventilation of this important issue in corporate governance .

We further view this kind of system as a way of reversing the already started process of transforming the South African Police Service from the culture of brutalizing the community to the one that offers safety and security and to the citizens of South Africa as a whole . <p> The military system comes with a culture that previously had become entrenched within the apartheid police leading to little action being taken against police members who had committed acts of violence and torture against members of the public . <p> The level of crime in our country is unacceptable .

One size fits all can not be working ! It is unthinkable to think our people will be threatened by rubber bullets and be afraid to raise their issues .

Thus , having a 3G is better , but if 4G with good data plans is available then it is the best option . <p> Limiting apps access to the internet running in the background or choosing data saver browsers like Opera Mini , is also a good idea for those on smaller data packs . <p> Productivity Suites <p> Megapixels can be attractive for many smartphone buyers .

Due to SASSA and the DSD 's poor planning , thousands of disability grant beneficiaries have had to queue outside of the Agency 's offices for hours , and in some cases overnight , to simply apply for these much-needed grants . <p> Just yesterday morning we received reports from outside the SASSA Johannesburg Office of long queues and applicants being turned away .

@@62577231 <h> Watershed judgment on Eskom and municipal debt - Sakeliga <p> The days of Eskom unlawfully interrupting electricity supply to paying end-users in defaulting municipalities , as a strategy to recover debt from municipal governments , should be over . <p> This is the situation after a judgment handed down in the Supreme Court of Appeal ( SCA ) on 29 December 2020 , in the appeal brought by Eskom against a judgment of the High Court Pretoria . Eskom appealed the matters of Eskom Holdings SOC Ltd v Resilient Properties ( Pty ) Ltd and Others and Eskom Holdings SOC Ltd v Sabie Chamber of Commerce and Tourism and Others . Sakeliga joined both appeals as an amicus curiae ( friend of the court ) in order to persist with what the High Court in Pretoria in 2019 called Sakeliga 's " novel " and " dispositive " arguments . <p> At stake <p> The court case -- which for shorthand I shall refer to as the Resilient case or Resilient judgment -- was important for the following reasons . <p> First , the widespread nature of Eskom 's electricity interruptions to defaulting municipalities necessitated an urgent and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to use paying end-users as leverage in its attempt to extract payment from defaulting municipalities across the country . It would cut electricity to a town 's paying and non-paying end-users equally and demand that a usually bankrupt and delinquent municipal government settle or arrange for payment of debts . The result was severe debilitation of local industry in towns across the country , creating vicious circles of local economic collapse and further inability to pay Eskom . <p> Second , several other court cases had been put on hold , awaiting judgment in the Resilient case . In a bid to reverse or prevent Eskom 's municipal debt recovery interruptions , chambers of commerce and others across the country had brought interdict after interdict and other judicial proceedings against Eskom and municipalities . In time , it became clear that the so-called Resilient case was one of the most developed and would likely deliver jurisprudence to be followed in other cases . <p> Third , the judgment is deeply favourable for both short-term and long-term solutions to the symptoms of state failure , including Eskom 's attempts to recover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elaboration , and I shall below refer only to two elements thereof . <p> The judgment <p> Two important findings in the judgment stand out . First , the court found that Eskom 's decisions to terminate electricity supply to extract payment from defaulting municipalities were irrational . Second , it properly characterised the dispute as an intergovernmental one , laying solving it at the feet of national government . <p> In his judgment , Judge Xola Petse , Deputy President of the SCA , concluded that Eskom 's decision to interrupt bulk electricity supply to the Emalahleni Municipality and the Thaba Chweu Local Municipality was used as a leverage to extract payment ... at a time when Eskom knew full well that it would not result in the financially strapped municipalities settling their debt ... . The decision to terminate was accordingly found to be irrational . <p> The SCA criticized Eskom for its failure to properly manage its snowballing municipal debtors ' book over a period of more than ten years . The SCA went further and also noted its concern against national government for its failure to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In short , the court noted a failure by government on all levels to ensure proper municipal administration . <p> The SCA upheld the earlier judgment of the High Court Pretoria which held that organs of state -- including Eskom and municipal governments -- are required to prove that they have complied with the principles of intergovernmental dispute resolution , before taking legal action against other organs of state . These principles are set out in the Intergovernmental Framework Relations Act . <p> Eskom had a duty to report its financial disputes with defaulting municipalities to the National Treasury for the latter to mediate the matter . Eskom failed to do this . Moreover , the obligation on government to intervene does not stop at a mere attempt to mediate financial disputes between organs of state . It is the duty of National Treasury and national government in general to actively intervene in cases of state failure , especially in the case of municipalities , responsible as they are for service delivery to paying customers . The SCA judgment serves as a charge against not only the municipalities who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spiraling municipal debts for more than a decade at the expense of the taxpayer , but specifically National Treasury and the national executive who have failed to ensure proper financial administration in other spheres of government . <p> Eskom has a monopoly on the supply of electricity to municipalities and paying customers . In South Africa there is no choice between service providers when it comes to electricity . The SCA in its judgment made the state 's constitutional obligations in this regard clear . If the state wants to reserve itself the sole right to supply electricity to the public , then its failure to properly administrate the matter becomes an issue for all branches of government , and not merely an issue for the residents of mismanaged municipalities . Termination and default clauses in electricity supply agreements and settlements concluded between Eskom and defaulting municipalities can not be summarily enforced in the same way as between private contracting parties . The rights of paying customers as end-users of electricity can not be ignored . Paying customers should not suffer because of governmental failures . Organs of state might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ single constitutional duty towards the public . <p> Remedies for end-users <p> Eskom 's need to recover the money owed to it by other organs of state is understandable , but this can not be achieved with irrational and improper strategies . The Resilient judgment points the way to achieve this rationally and acceptably . <p> After this judgment , Eskom simply can not proceed with a recovery strategy which focusses on placing pressure on the local economy and wellbeing of municipal residents . Any attempt to use the residents of municipalities as leverage to induce payment will , in terms of this judgment of the SCA , be deemed irrational . This in our view will include Eskom 's latest attempt to use load reduction to force payment . <p> The judgment empowers communities to continue to approach the court for an interdict against Eskom , with a simpler burden of argument . Municipal debt is an issue for National Treasury and National Government , who in terms of this judgment are required to play an active role in resolving municipal crises . Courts should no longer be content @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the municipal debt crisis requires intervention by National Government in terms of section 139 of the Constitution . <p> The case forms a building block in Sakeliga 's long-term legal strategy aimed at relieving organs of state of burdens where it is incapable of coping with them , ideally by creating scope for alternative provision from for-profit and not-for-profit private sector initiatives . We shall announce further steps in this regard in the course of 2021 . Meanwhile , the judgment offers businesses , chambers of commerce , and others in towns across the country medium-term relief against bulk electricity interruptions .

@@62595236 <h> BMW X7 : Is this the peak of our greed ? <h> ON THE ROAD <p> How far are we willing to travel down capitalism 's sordid , twisty road ? Is there a bend at which we ask to get dropped off , or do we shut our eyes and hope to arrive safely at the bottom of the hill , swallowing the sick from the surprise bumps along the way ? These sort of ruminations begin to seem important when we 're confronted with the leviathan of free enterprise that is the BMW X7 . <p> Just as the phones in our pocket keep growing bigger to swoop a new pool of customers , so too must car designers continually sketch new plans to keep the market enticed . Hence the birth of this behemoth : an astoundingly big frame soaked with ridiculous luxury . <p> BMW has been happily fiddling with its X range of late and in 2019 came out with its idea of introducing a seven-seater . A pure seven-seater , that is . It 's worth pointing out from the outset that this is no charlatan with two faux seats rising from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comfort liner . You might even say its interior space is the defining feature of the car . <p> At the very least it 's what you will immediately notice when stepping inside . Three rows of seats give the impression of entering a mini school bus or kombi . Our test model came with the added option of splitting the middle seats -- which then removes the centre armrest -- and serves to enhance the roomy feel and creates the sensation of sitting in an airplane . To access the rear a button is pushed and the backrest slides forward ( painfully ) slowly . <p> From that vantage point the car 's greatest eccentricity comes into view : three panoramic slots spread across the long expanse of the roof . It 's quite a view for those relegated to the back -- an experience that is further enhanced by the inclusion of a small triangle window on either side . Sitting there in no way feels like you 're being shoved in with the luggage , as is the risk with these sorts of auxiliary seats . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where you do n't feel pampered . Every spot has ample leg room and all the amenities -- cup holders , aircon controls , blinds -- one could hope for . There are optional screens that can be added to the back of the headrests too , so passengers have a number of options to fool around with , including the option of following the journey on their own navigation pane , just like you can do on long-haul flights . <p> Again , optimum traveller comfort is the sales pitch here . But that 's not to say that the driver has it all bad . <p> The X7 landed in South Africa in mid-2019 and the rousing M50i model , our tester , has since followed suit . It boasts a 4.4l V8 engine -- an upgrade from the standard 3.0l engine -- and is a hell of a mean block off the line . The nature of this car does inspire a more languorous ride but the power is there when needed . <p> Handling is smooth and responsive but the responsible advice would be to not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Also , do n't expect to fit into any reasonable parking space . <p> Styling-wise the verdict is a lot harder to nail down . Much of the motoring community has chastised the design for its massive , ostentatious grill . There 's no denying that it looks like an evil grater , but it 's also at home on this machine . Absolutely no one is getting one of these expecting to remain low-key , and if you 're going to do braggadocious then do it right . Otherwise the rest of the car is much of what fans of BMW SUVs might be accustomed to ; from most angles this looks like an X5 that resorted to steroids . <p> Which brings us neatly to where we started . The German manufacturer already has members in its stable that can accommodate any conceivable family whim , cars that are already top of their class .

Throughout his life 's work he has shown us the urgency with which we need to act in order to save our planet and the dire consequences on inaction . Yet , in many respects we have n't heeded the warnings , resulting in severe climate change with catastrophic consequences . <p> By the same token , businesses and their people are equally as vulnerable . The corrosion of human health , especially mental well-being and sweeping disconnection , threatens the global economy and the very social fabric of human existence . <p> If we want the world to change , we have to start uplifting the lives and wellbeing of people .

Economic growth coupled with social responsibility can raise more people out of poverty , reduce inequality , give more people access to education and healthcare , slow population growth and , ultimately , save the planet . <p> Now more than ever , leadership transcends title and jurisdiction and is defined by selfless actions .

This requires an entirely new brand of leadership . If we want something to change , we need to change first . The entire professional landscape , businesses ' teams ' needs and expectations and the overall pace of life have changed exponentially . This means that leaders need to be faster and more confident in making decisions . At the same time , leaders have to show greater adaptability and be prepared to take greater ownership , not only within their sphere of influence but also of self . The modern leader is a change agent , who is prepared to fail in pursuit of the truth , a visionary who acknowledges the need to act decisively and proactively on issues such as diversity and inclusion , health , environmental issues , personal information security as well as national challenges . <p> However , beyond the expanded role of guardian and custodian , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , successes and accomplishments invariably stem from a place of inspiration .

Let us learn from the failures in combating climate change and take a proactive stance in the protection of our people , their families , communities , businesses and livelihoods . In this way , not only will we promote greater organisational success , but also much-needed social change . <p> South Africa 's 2019 winning World Cup rugby team is the actualisation of this broader vision .

@@62610231 <h> The story of a man written brilliantly by a woman <p> 01 February 2021 - 10:35 By Kate Sidley <p> Published in the Sunday Times ( 31/01/2021 ) <p> The History of Man *****Siphiwe Gloria NdlovuPenguin Fiction , R290 <p> In her prize-winning debut novel The Theory of Flight , Siphiwe Gloria Ndlovu surprised and delighted readers and critics with her ingenious excavation of the post-colonial moment in an unnamed Zimbabwe-esque Southern African country . In The History of Man , her second novel , she turns her attention back in time to the colonial era , in the same country . While quite different in tone , more linear and less obviously touched by folklore and magic , it shares its predecessor 's intriguingly slippery relationship with history , and its author 's skilful execution . <p> This book opens with a prologue . Emil Coetzee , our protagonist , and the Head of the Organisation of Domestic Affairs , is at a basin washing blood from his hands on the day in 1979 when the ceasefire is announced . The novel tracks Emil 's life from birth , to boyhood , to boarding school , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to this bloodied moment in the dying days of the colonial project . <p> Ndlovu says that Emil , who is also a minor character in The Theory of Flight , had been in her mind for more than a decade when she started to write this book . " He is a civil servant who toed the line , did n't ask questions , had power and abused it , a bit of a womaniser- actually , all the stereotypes you would dump onto this person . I thought I would have some fun taking down this white colonial male , and say a lot of things about power and privilege . But when I started writing him , and seeing how he got to be who he was , he became a fully dimensional , more complicated , character . " <p> Emil 's coming into his full self presented his author with its own set of problems . She says : " As a black woman writing a white male character , I was writing someone very different from myself and I had to find moments of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was important to inhabit his interior world and show his complexity . But I did n't want to be too generous , or excuse his behaviour or seem to imply that colonialism was n't that bad . It was a difficult line to draw . I was quite anxious . " <p> The question of culpability is key - yes , one can understand Emil and , yes , he was a man of his time , but , as the author says : " There was an array of ways of being , he chose this one . Other people were able to question and to make different choices . " When he and his organisation are drawn increasingly into the government 's bloody business , there 's barely a glimmer of resistance . <p> One of the things that makes Ndlovu 's novels so rewarding is the way she plays with language and ideas . Take the grandiose title , The History of Man , so definitive and comprehensive . " I was making fun of the colonial narrative - ' we 've figured it out , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , and our place in it ' . I 'm poking fun at that very assured way of looking at anything . " <p> Emil himself buys into that worldview , and everything in his world affirms it - from his childhood reading of Ryder Haggard novels , to his fascination with the explorer and hunter Frederick Courteney Selous , to an adulthood where he seldom , if ever , comes up against anything or anyone who challenges his outlook . It 's hardly surprising that his affirming loop and his limited masculinity are ultimately not up to the job of creating a meaningful personal life , or facing challenges , or navigating a changing world . <p> Ndlovu is remarkably skilled at building levels of meaning through the way she constructs her narrative . With this white man at the centre of the novel , black characters are strangely elusive . Ndlovu explains her thinking : " When you go into the colonial record , all but a few voices are silenced . You have to work really hard to find what other people were thinking and feeling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know . I wanted that to be the experience for the reader . I did n't want them to have entry into these other characters . " <p> Emil is blind to them too , as he is to the women in the book . We never know what his wife , Kuki , is thinking , but then neither does Emil , because he does n't try to understand her . The fact that these are all full human beings with their own thoughts , feelings and agency is a surprise to Emil . <p> It 's brilliantly conceived - Ndlovu is , after all , an academic who holds a PhD from Stanford University - but she is careful not to let that overwhelm the story . The book is an engaging and enjoyable read that also has a lot to say about colonialism and masculinity . <p> If you feel that there 's not much novel in today 's novels , this clever , rewarding one might be just what you need . @KateSidley

@@62613238 <h> Dismissal of three executives on spurious grounds is a setback against the fight against corruption . <p> The head of the Passenger Rail Agency of SA 's ( Prasa ) legal division , Martha Ngoye , who probably saved Prasa billions , has been fired , according to a statement by the chairman of the board of control , Leonard Ramatlakane . Two other executives have also been dismissed , on what look like spurious grounds . <p> On Saturday 30 January , Ramatlakane announced that three Prasa executives had overstayed the five-year terms of their contracts and had their employment terminated . The three are Ngoye , Nkosinathi Khena and Pearl Munthali . Ngoye was group head of legal , risk , and compliance . The other two were on suspension . <p> Ramatlakane also announced that " Prasa has also resolved to institute legal proceedings against Ms Ngoye for unlawfully approving payment of R58-million to SA Fence &amp; Gate when she had no authority to do so , " and against Khena for , " financial loss it suffered due to unlawful conduct of Mr Khena " . <p> Ngoye has been the central figure at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has helped Prasa win court victories against Swifambo , Siyangena , and Siyaya . It was Ngoye 's defiance that rebuffed Judge Tintswalo Makhubele 's attempt to improperly settle with Siyaya . Further , Ngoye 's testimony at the State Capture Commission revealed the depths of former CEO Lucky Montana 's corrupt leadership of Prasa . <p> Without her interventions , Prasawould have lost many billions of rands . <p> Ramatlakane said that during a review of executive contracts , " it transpired upon analysis of employment contracts of executives that some of them ought to have left Prasa years ago . All executives at Prasa are employed for a period not exceeding five years with no expectation for extension of the employment contract . " <p> This policy , unannounced in the press at the time , was seemingly instituted in 2019 during the tenure of former Chair of the Interim Board , Khanyisile Kweyama . That board did not have a quorum at the time , and so any decisions that it made were subject to review . Further , the current board is not quorate either , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least . This means that any decisions that this board makes are subject to review and that Minister of Transport Fikile Mbalula is in contempt of a ruling of the Western Cape high court . <p> Ramatlakane also said that the executives " have been aware at all material times that their employment contracts were for a five-year period and not more " . <p> However , he said , " it appears the executives capitalised on the instability at the board level , culminating in their extended and unlawful stay at Prasa . On 29 January 2021 , Prasa has terminated the employment contracts of the following executives with immediate effect . " <p> It is open to question that it is the responsibility of the employee , and not the employer , to ensure that they are not staying on beyond the term of their contract . <p> He said Ngoye had initially been employed in 2012 as CEO of Intersite , one of Prasa 's subsidiaries . " Effective from 1 September 2015 , she was transferred to her current position . Ordinarily , Ms Ngoye 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2020 . " <p> After a hearing in September last year , in October , Prasa , led by Ngoye 's legal team , won a resounding victory in the Siyangena matter , in a judgment by a full bench of the North Gauteng high court . Siyangena is appealing the judgment , but the appeal is unlikely to succeed . Given Ngoye 's many successes as head of legal , one might reasonably expect Prasa to want to retain her services . On the contrary , Ramatlakane said , " Prasa has also resolved to institute legal proceedings against Ms Ngoye for unlawfully approving payment of R58-million to SA Fence &amp; Gate when she had no authority to do so . " <p> GroundUpreported on the SA Fence and Gate issue , in 2018 . Ngoye was not one of the key figures involved . In fact , the report from Nexus , commissioned by National Treasury following the Public Protector 's Derailed report makes no mention of Ngoye . <p> In the Werksmans Attorneys investigation , Ngoye is mentioned in regard to the extension of the contract . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this story is Palello Lebaka . According to Werksmans ' report , in January 2015 , Ngoye was acting as Group CEO while Lucky Montana was on holiday . Ngoye was presented with a recommendation report from Josephat Phungula on behalf of the Bid Advisory Committee ( BAC ) . Lebaka had been fired after his corrupt dealings were uncovered . Nevertheless , according to the BAC , Prasa still required lights that were included in the contract , and they recommended to Ngoye that an outstanding amount of R23-million be paid to complete this transaction . <p> According to the internal policy of the time , group CEOs of Prasa have the authority to sign off on contracts below the value of R100-million . The extension would have been presented to the board after Ngoye 's signature was attached , and the board would have approved this transaction . <p> In his affidavit , SA Fence and Gate executive Chris Greyling , alleged ( from page 20 of this pdf ) that his company 's troubles at Prasa were orchestrated by a competitor -- Siyangena . <p> Turning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Khena was acting group chief executive , he had reinstated the SA Fence and Gate contract " knowing of the company 's breach " and that this breach was also " brought to his attention by National Treasury in a letter dated 21 April 2016 " . <p> " An amount of R25m was paid to the said company without requisite authority and/or approval , " said Ramatlakane . " Mr Khena was at the time acting-group chief executive officer and his unlawful conduct caused Prasa to incur financial loss . " <p> Further , said Ramatlakane , " Mr Khena reinstated Ms Ngoye , who at the time was lawfully suspended by Mr Lucky Montana ( group CEO as the time ) for unlawful approval of R58-million to SA Fence and Gate " . <p> But in fact , Montana was forced to backtrack . As recounted before the State Capture Commission , in May 2015 , Ngoye 's subordinate Fani Dingiswayo had refused to sign-off on a Montana-engineered deal worth more than R80-million , with a company called Prodigy . Dingiswayo had discovered irregularities in that deal , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the spot -- illegally . <p> The next day , when Ngoye went to find out from Montana what had happened , she too was illegally fired by Montana . A week later , after the intervention by the board ( chaired at the time by Popo Molefe ) , Montana was forced to commute the terminations of their contracts into suspensions . Then , after Montana resigned in disgrace from Prasa , Ngoye and Dingiswayo were reinstated by Khena after being cleared of misconduct . <p> Ramatlakane said Prasa would " institute legal proceedings against Mr Khena for financial loss it suffered due to unlawful conduct of Mr Khena " . <p> As regards Munthali , the suspended CEO of the Prasa Foundation , who has also been fired , Ramatlakane said she " has been on suspension for alleged misconduct .

@@62613239 <h> Maverick Citizen <h> Latest spate of accidents again highlight the dangers overloaded and open trucks hold for farmworkers <p> By Vincent Cruywagen* 2 February 2021 <p> Several farm workers were injured when the truck transporting them was in an accident near Paarl on Wednesday , 27 January . ( Photo : Drakenstein Farm Watch ) <h> The Western Cape has a decades-long history of fatal accidents involving farmworkers being transported on trucks . Agricultural workers ' organisations are calling for tighter safety measures and alternative methods of transport , while provincial government wants a standing committee probe . <p> Three truck accidents involving farmworkers , that have claimed the lives of three people and left several injured , are a matter of grave concern and highlight a real threat to farmworkers in the Western Cape . <p> The accidents happened between Monday 4 January 2021 and Wednesday 27 January 2021 . Nosey Pieterse , president of the Bawsi Agricultural Workers Union of South Africa , said the spate of truck accidents involving farmworkers was not something new . <p> " We had fights with the authorities and did n't get answers from government , both national and provincial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , especially in the light of Covid-19 .

At that time , several accidents involving overloaded trucks occurred . One involved 71 farmworkers and another incident involving 103 , he said . <p> In October 2007 , traffic officials were shocked to find 103 farmworkers packed into the back of a windowless truck " like loaves of bread " without access to fresh air .

Workers were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slaughterhouse , she added . <p> According to Pekeur , several agriculture organisations , unions and non-governmental organisations had engaged with government on the need for safer transport and unions had addressed this issue in collective bargaining processes . <p> To remedy the situation , she said , " a review to tighten safety measures must be done . Alternatives such as contracts with bus companies must be looked at . Vehicles that workers are transported in must be inspected and vetted .

But if vaccines are less effective against new variants , they may need to be tweaked and people may need booster shots . <p> South Africa announced its pause after researchers from the University of Witwatersrand and the University of Oxford found that the AstraZeneca vaccine provided only minimal protection against mild or moderate infection from the B.1.351 variant , now the dominant form of the virus in that country . <p> The research is not yet peer reviewed and did not provide data on older people most likely to die or need hospitalisation .

For a benchmark , picture the entirety of The Lord of the Rings - all three books , plus The Hobbit for good measure - twice . And all of those million words , most of which previously sat in silence on the screen , are going to be read aloud in the upcoming Final Cut edition of the game . Full voice acting is coming to Disco Elysium , and - as you can probably guess - it 's been no small undertaking . <p> Wanting to know more about how this feat has been achieved , I sent a few questions to developer ZA/UM . In response , Disco Elysium 's lead writer , Helen Hindpere , sent me 1,549 words worth of answers , written in such a manner that I felt our interview had become an extension of the game itself . Words , it would seem , are as essential as breathing to the studio . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poet from the fifties , " Hindpere tells me . " Arvi Siig , a hero of mine . He said : poetry must belong to the masses . <p> " I was like : f**k yeah , Arvi ! With all my heart I agree . Disco Elysium is a wild and singular adventure , but it 's also meant for the widest possible audience . " <p> Currently , Disco Elysium 's mostly speechless original form is only available on PC and Mac . But with The Final Cut , it will arrive on PlayStation in March , and on Xbox and Switch later in 2021 . And with those extra platforms comes the potential of a much wider audience . " Games are just so much more accessible with full VO voiceover , especially RPGs , " says Hindpere . " And it 's crucial for the console experience too ... TV screens just are n't made for reading like monitors are . You need VO . " <p> Adding voice acting is n't just about making Disco Elysium accessible to more people , though . ZA/UM @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Final Cut 's script remains " 99% the same " as the original release . As such , the addition of acting brings Disco Elysium closer to its intended vision . <p> " Our intent was always to simulate how real life conversations work , " says Hindpere . " Not film conversations , or even book conversations , but real conversations . Ours are probably the most sprawling dialogue trees ever written . That 's because Disco Elysium is a conversation simulator . The VO brings us even closer to that . " <p> Of course , making those conversations come alive requires the right talent . The original version of Disco Elysium has a small amount of voice acting that 's notable for its authentic , scrappy feeling , in part generated by a " ragtag band of miscreants , friends , and friends of friends , " that ZA/UM remains thankful for . These recordings work as the blueprint for The Final Cut 's approach . <p> " We had to voice the entire character this time , not just the beginnings of the dialogues , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some rather extreme places psychologically . So we did re-casting with professional actors . Many we kept too -- from the original . Favourites like Kim Kitsuragi and Evrart Claire ( Jullian Champenois and Tariq Khan ) . It 's a mix . Hopefully we kept that colourful vibe , only now with added acting chops . " <p> Finding the right cast has been a sprawling task . " You need people from all over the world to pull this kind of project off , " says Hindpere . " One day -- a Moroccan rapper from the Canaries . The other -- a Taiwanese rapper from Taiwan . Then a Liverpudlian scouse comes in and absolutely tears it up as Cuno . The casting process has been very planetary . That 's how we 've found the right voices , I think . " <p> Finding the ideal actors for the likes of The Deserter and Paledriver has been one thing , but the biggest challenge ZA/UM faced was finding a voice to bring the whole experience together . " The narrator is the voice of Disco Elysium @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speech . This means every object , every parenthesis , and so on . Only when we miraculously stumbled upon Lenval Brown did we know : ok , we have the voice of Disco Elysium now . We can really attempt to do this . " <p> Brown , who 's voice can be heard in the above trailer , is a jazz musician when he 's not bringing video game dialogue to life . He voices around half of Disco Elysium 's script . As a reminder , that 's half a million words , the same as Tolstoy 's War and Peace . " No Lenval -- no Disco Elysium VO , " says Hindpere . " It 's that central . " <p> The role of the narrator in Disco Elysium is much more than a voice to guide the player between conversations . As well as a storyteller , Brown is also the voice of the 24 different skills , which manifest as individual ' characters ' within the protagonist 's mind . <p> " It seems like a natural choice to have each skill voiced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be awful , " says Hindpere , answering the most obvious question . " Grating , cartoonish , hyperactive . There 's something about Disco Elysium that not a lot of people realize -- it 's actually a very calm and cosy game .... It 's cosy , like watching a series of dark detective fiction -- while curled up on the couch with your SO . Or reading a book . It has that vibe to it . Taking the skills as narration , rather than a band of harpies tearing at you , was essential to keeping the experience level . " <p> " As a final note -- I 'll get pretty in-depth now , but hey ! you 're reading an interview with a Disco Elysium dev so you get what you pay for -- in our psychological system the 24 skills all reside in the same part of your character 's brain : the Posterior Neocortex , where modern science says consciousness lies , " adds Hindpere . " The casting sheet literally says : POSTERIOR NEOCORTEX . So the skills all share the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the game too : the Ancient Reptilian Brain , the Limbic System and the Spinal Cord ( all narrate your dreams ) . Those have different voices , because they are truly different parts of your character 's brain . " <p> Finding the right actors , inviting back beloved voices , and recording over a million words has taken ZA/UM around 14 months to do . The small studio has done almost all of this while the world has been suffering from the impact of what Hindpere refers to as " the microorganism " , which has meant recording sessions over Zoom and a lot of rescheduling . <p> " It 's been a whole-studio challenge , too , " Hindpere makes clear . " Everyone is on VO one way or another . We have our own in-house trio of directors working with the actors . Plus every single writer on call and doing QA . We all share the responsibility to get it right . The Final Cut really needs to be the ultimate edition of Disco Elysium . " <p> As well as being the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help deliver the truest version of ZA/UM 's world . I am guilty of waxing lyrical about the world of Revachol and its loftiness , but Hindpere reminds me that Disco Elysium is also weird and wild and wacky . <p> " Disco Elysium has as much in common with the Eurodance band Scooter and the 2006 comedy " Dude , Where 's My Car ? " as it has with ... what have we been accused of lately ? Hauntology ? Existentialism ? , " Hindpere says . " We 're about that , but we 're also about Scooter . Faster , Harder , Scooter ! " <p> And ... well , yes . It 's all in the title . Disco Elysium . Of course it 's wild . This is a game where you can have debates with your own necktie , afterall . The Apocalypse Cop route , in which you act as a prophet of the end of all things , is delivered with playful absurdity . Full voice work will bring these aspects to life in a way that will balance out the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , hopefully making for a version that conveys Disco Elysium 's full personality spectrum for the ears as well as the eyes . <p> " It feels quite luxurious , " Hindpere says , summing up VO 's impact on the game . " High production values usually do . But then it also feels more direct and personal . " <p> Disco Elysium already feels like it speaks directly to the player . But currently , the relationship is akin to an author talking to a reader . That in itself has a particular kind of intimacy , and is certainly part of why I find its story so impactful . But the promise of experiencing it all again , where that relationship is replaced with more authentic conversation , is something that has me excited for The Final Cut . And for those on console who have never played this convention-shattering RPG , Disco Elysium 's upcoming incarnation will hopefully be the best possible way to first experience it .

As we were very happy with the laptop , I told my brother to purchase the same laptop which he duly did in February 2008 . We were still happy with the laptops so when it was time to purchase a laptop for my older son 's birthday we went and purchased a third HP Pavilion in May 2008 . <p> When the first laptop failed last year at 25 months old we contacted HP and were told that it would cost +-R4500.00 to repair as you could not just replace the VGA card and you had to replace the complete motherboard . I decided that it was not worth repairing and just left it and thought that it was just bad luck that the laptop had broken as I had always believed that HP made a great product . <p> When my brothers laptop broke with the exact same problem I was rather surprised , but again just put it down to bad luck . <p> We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we bought has failed with the exact same problem . The first laptop failed at 25 months , the second at 25 months and the third at 23 months -- all with the identical problem . <p> You can not tell me that this is just coincidence . There is obviously a patent defect with the manufacture of these machines . <p> I realise that the laptops are all out of warranty , however I believe that HP is duty bound to repair these three computers at no charge . So i got hold of Hp and managed to speak to someone high up in the Hp Head Office who said they would be prepared to fix it but the guy i spoke to suddenly dissappeared and went on leave . I have tried phone him but had no response for at least four months . <p> Has anyone encountered these problems and if you did , did u managed to get it fixed ? <h> Expert Member <p> My mother-in-law has a HP dv 9000 . Cost her over R14,000 2 years ago . It overheats and shuts down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is widely reported on and complained about , if my googling is anything to go by . I opened it up and I see that the cpu and gpu share a common heatsink with a heatpipe arrangement and a piddly little fan , which ramps up to lightspeed trying to cool this stupid design before giving up and crashing dead . At this stage you can literally burn your finger if you touch that heatsink . Stupid ! @#$%&amp; design . What were HP thinking ? Where did they test this thing ? In Antarctica ? <h> Well-Known Member <p> Those HP Pavilions are junk and wo n't touch it with a stick . It is their " consumer " range , and you can see and feel the quality drop on those machine . The plastic is cheap , is I have n't heard of any of those machines that have made it past the 3 year mark . I have a " consumer " range Lenovo , and you can also feel and see that it is built cheaper .

No need to do the whole reheating thing if you still have video going to the screen . I cut up some RAM heatsinks to use in the one I fixed ... It 's a pain in the ass job though , had to pull the whole laptop apart 3 times to get the amount of copper and thermal fluid correct . <h> Honorary Master <p> My partner and I each got a R17k HP DV9293ea about 3 years ago . I had performance issues from day 1 . Sent the unit in and had the mobo , cpu and vga changed under warranty . Was fine for 2 years then the vga failed again and this time out of warranty the unit cost R7k to repair ( replaced mobo , cpu and vga ) . <p> My partner had the hinge issue with the screen , repaired under warranty , but more recently the machine reboots randomly , Waiting on a quote out of warranty to repair . <p> Not particularly found of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or Sony .. <h> Member <p> Shah33m : Do you know how i could expose them ... I am thinking sending it in to Carte Blanche or Wendy Knowler and about to post it on http : //www.hellopeter.com/ <p> This not unlucky but pure sh*t quality of HP . There one laptop has an onboard vga card and other two are nvidia vga cards . I am sick of HP and this is going futher ! Please let me know who else is having this problem ? Thanks <h> Honorary Master <p> I have an HP projector - 800x600 DLP , R14,000 at Makro , from a few years ago . Used it a bit , then kept it in storage then tried using it - no picture - bulb is ok but nothing . Returned it to HP for repairs a year ago . I call frequently They give me the run around - it 's currently in JHB . They do n't know what 's wrong or wo n't tell me - prolly lost it . I 'm prolly going to open a case of theft with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company . Avoid them . I will never buy an HP product again . Their South African support is also TERRIBLE , INCOMPETENT and possibly WORSE . Honestly , STAY AWAY from HP . HP makes junk . Their Q&amp;A process is bad and support bad too . Even Acer is better . I had an Acer fail on me - screen display - although the laptop works perfectly - just backlight of the LCD died . But that was after a longer while . <p> If buying a laptop only consider Lenovo or Sony ( overpriced ) or Mac . If you can import one - a Panasonic ( best machines in the world ) is also great . Dell may also be ok but avoid HP . Definitely stay away from their projectors.

" <p> Navalny was arrested in January after returning to Russia for the first time since being poisoned last August in Siberia with what many Western countries said was a nerve agent . The Kremlin has questioned whether he was really poisoned . <p> He was jailed on Feb. 2 after a court ruled he had violated the terms of a suspended sentence in an embezzlement case he says was trumped up . <p> The case has sparked new tensions between Russia and the West and renewed talk of sanctions .

To further entrench accountability and transparency , detailed information regarding the work of the Ombud 's office , complaints procedures , rulings and other critical information can now be accessed at https : **33;3417;TOOLONG . <p> Following her appointment , Nair said : " I believe that to make self-regulation credible , the media must step up and commit themselves to systems of good governance , transparency and a greater willingness to admit their mistakes . For self-regulation to command public trust , newspapers must be held accountable to their own editorial and ethical standards and to provide readers with an independent assessment of their observations . " <p> Nair 's statement reaffirms Independent Media 's unrelenting commitment to upholding the highest journalistic standards and ethics . In this regard , there is no compromise . <p> Since its withdrawal from the PCSA , Independent Media has been subjected to a relentless misinformation campaign premised on the scurrilous assertion that we have gone " rogue " . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the South African National Editors ' Forum ( Sanef ) have created the perception that they are the sole custodians of media credibility , accountability , media freedom and freedom of expression .

So much for telling both sides of the story . <p> Our commitment to media freedom , freedom of expression and accountability is non-negotiable . We most certainly do not need the permission or validation of the PCSA , Sanef and slew of praise singers to conduct our work without fear or favour . <p> We are also acutely aware that the co-ordinated attacks waged by our detractors is to distract us from executing our transformation agenda . <p> Since the acquisition of Independent Media by the Sekunjalo Group in 2013 , enormous strides have been made to transform the country 's largest English language media group at all levels . <p> This transformation journey has not been an easy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drummed up by our detractors , we are determined to complete this journey . <p> Our commercial partners , advertisers , readers and millions of ordinary South Africans can rest assured that Independent Media will continue to conduct its business in an ethical and accountable manner . <p> The preamble to our Press Code says : " Independent Media wants news to be reported accurately , the publication of opinions that are based on fact and honestly motivated and reportage that recognises the vulnerable of society and that upholds the laws of South Africa and the Constitution .

Marais speaks from the heart about lessons in life , limiting habits and how he reinvented himself and the business he co-founded after coming close to blowing it all . <p> Fifteen years after things almost fell apart for him personally and professionally , Marais embodies success . He co-owns one of South Africa 's greatest brand and communications groups , Joe Public United ; his second book -- mostly written during last year 's first hard lockdown -- is en route to joining the Exclusive Books ' bestsellers list ; and he has a beautiful home life , having turned wine into water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ None of it came easily .

( Photo : Christopher Furlong / Getty Images ) <h> The decriminalisation of sex work has been on the government 's doorstep for decades -- and yet it is still failing to support the human rights of sex workers . Since 2015 , national summits and committees have demanded a fast track , yet what they 've received is a go-slow . Perhaps 2021 holds the opportunity to correct this . <p> In its recently released report on South Africa , Human Rights Watch reported that the state had kept sex workers in a dangerous and precarious position , ignoring its commitments to their human rights . <p> The report states : " Criminalisation has undermined sex workers ' access to justice for crimes committed against them and exposed them to unchecked abuse and exploitation by law enforcement officials , including police officers . Although the Department @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Workers is grounded in respect for the human rights of sex workers , criminalisation hinders sex workers ' efforts to access healthcare , including HIV prevention , treatment , care and support . " <p> In South Africa , where patriarchy and sexism are normalised , police brutality is common and where sex work is criminalised , sex workers are at risk . During the 2020 Covid-19 lockdown , a sex worker died in police custody and other sex workers reported abuse by police . <p> The criminalisation of sex work in South Africa increases the vulnerability of sex workers by making it more difficult for them to report crimes committed against them , making it more difficult to get access to affirming and life-saving healthcare and treatment , and denying them their right to practise a trade of their choosing . <p> In 2020 , a flurry of gender-based violence ( GBV ) legislation was introduced , including the so-called GBV bills and the highly problematic Victim Support Services Bill . But , despite this ostensible rush to respond to what President Cyril Ramaphosa calls South Africa 's " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decriminalise sex work . <p> Yet , over two days in November 2018 , delegates at the National Summit on Gender-Based Violence worked to produce a declaration that reflected a commitment to end gender-based violence in South Africa . <p> The declaration from the summit included 17 commitments , one of which was : " Revisit and fast track all outstanding laws and bills that relate to GBV and femicide , including the decriminalisation of sex work . " <p> Delegates at the GBV summit demanded a fast track , yet what they 've received is a go-slow . <p> Of course , 2018 was not the first time that sex workers in South Africa received lip service from the government . In fact , the journey has been going on since the end of apartheid . Over recent years it has been Parliament 's Multi-Party Women 's Caucus -- the joint committee made up exclusively of female Members of Parliament -- that has heard presentations on this issue most often . <p> An overview of how decriminalisation has been raised in Parliament over the past few years can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The first is that Parliament has heard from stakeholders on the issue of decriminalisation a number of times over the past few years . There is no shortage of information for each and every MP to make their own informed decision . If members believe they have not personally been able to hear the discussions or debates , there is plentiful opportunity for them to request the minutes from their own committee meetings , or read the submissions made by tens of organisations , or reach out to a sex worker organisation themselves . <p> As a former parliamentary researcher , I am also aware that they could ask any of the research and content adviser staff that they have at their disposal to prepare a summary if they so wish ( and I 'm sure some of them already have ) . <p> The second is that MPs , at least in the caucus , are unaware of their own legislative power . In fact , they have all missed the important point that was raised in the first meeting in 2016 -- that there is no need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its mind about decriminalisation before it proposes legislation to amend the existing laws and propose decriminalisation . <p> At the 2016 roundtable , the parliamentary legal adviser made it quite clear that there were several options the committee could follow to change the law . <p> " The legislative process could warrant a Cabinet member or deputy minister , MP or Committee of the National Assembly member introducing a bill in the Assembly , in accordance with Section 73 ( 2 ) of the Constitution . The types of bills that could be passed by that process were executive bills , committee bills or private members ' bill . " <p> Each and every female Member of Parliament -- at least those who have attended the many ( many ) briefings on this issue at the Multi-Party Women 's Caucus over the past decade -- could have taken it upon herself to draft an amendment to the law and propose it as a committee bill , or introduced it as a private member 's bill . Not one of them has done so . <p> The issue for the Multi-Party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their male colleagues in other committees , is not -- as they would like to suggest -- a lack of opportunity to thoroughly debate this issue , or the delays from the side of the South African Law Reform Commission or the Department of Justice or the Department of Women , Youth and Persons with Disabilities ( in its many varied formations over the past decade ) . <p> The issue is a lack of courage in taking a decision that will support the human rights of sex workers . May 2021 see that courage restored . DM168 <p> This analysis is by Jennifer Smout , who is a feminist writer and researcher . <p> Timeline <p> The 2015 Women 's Roundtable in Parliament resolved to decriminalise sex work and to begin the process by 2016 . This issue was referred to the Portfolio Committee on Justice and Correctional Services . <p> In 2016 , the Multi-Party Women 's Caucus held a roundtable on the decriminalisation of sex work . <p> In 2017 , the Commission for Gender Equality released its investigative report into the abuse of sex workers by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This report was tabled in Parliament in 2018 . The commission also presented at the 2018 stakeholder summit ( see below ) . <p> Thanks to efforts by the women 's caucus , the South African Law Reform Commission finally released a 2009 report into sex work -- in 2017 . The women 's caucus committed to supporting legal reform , stating that the " matter needs to be addressed as a human rights issue , and not a moral issue " . <p> In August 2017 , the women 's caucus again met on the issue of decriminalising sex work , and members suggested , the report of the law reform commission be debated and discussed by the political parties . The ANC had not yet taken a position on sex work and , as a result , the minutes record the caucus as stating : " Perhaps next year the Multi-Party Women 's Caucus would be in more of a position to pronounce itself on the decriminalisation of sex work .

After the submissions , the chairperson said the caucus steering committee would meet to discuss the positions presented at the summit and would probably engage in further consultation . But she did commit the steering committee to ensuring that appropriate legislation would be drafted as soon as possible . <p> In May 2018 , the caucus again met on the issue of decriminalisation , where it was informed by its support team : " In response to its call for written submissions on decriminalisation , the committee received a total of 62 written submissions . Thirty of these stakeholders availed themselves for oral presentations on the day of the summit . Out of the 62 submissions and oral presentations , 37 ( 59.6% ) stakeholders supported full decriminalisation of sex work while 14 ( 22.5% ) stakeholders supported the current status quo of continued criminalisation , six ( 9.6% ) stakeholders supported partial criminalisation , three ( 4.8% ) organisations submitted the current status quo should be coupled with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice any preference . " The chairperson is reported as being " concerned about the length of time the process was taking ... These people had confidence in MPs , but the dilly-dallying was bad . " <p> In February 2019 , the newly elected Multi-Party Women 's Caucus was briefed on the legacy report of the previous committee , and the presentation highlighted the need to focus on the decriminalisation of sex work . <p> In July and September 2019 , as a result of the 2019 Women 's Parliament findings and the legacy report , the Multi-Party Women 's Caucus again agreed to focus on decriminalising sex work . <p> In November 2019 , the caucus removed the decriminalisation of sex work as a priority in the Sixth Parliament , with both ruling party and opposition members suggesting that they needed to hear presentations on the issue before they could make a decision . <p> In June 2020 , the Department of Women , Youth and Persons with Disabilities presented to the caucus on the National Strategic Plan on GBV and Femicide where the department indicated that " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sex workers , and engagement with the drafters of the national strategic plan and experts . This matter had been left open , heeding the advice of the Department of Justice and Constitutional Development , simply because it was a complex matter and there were no converging views on the decriminalisation of sex workers . There was a need to ensure that it was aligned to the laws of the country , but it was an issue that had to be resolved as part of responding to GBV .

A similar provision is contained in the Mine Health and Safety Act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Act , 2003 stipulates that a health service , which would include the administration of any medication or vaccination , may not be provided to a person without their consent , unless the failure to treat said person will result in a serious risk to public health . <p> The question then becomes whether an employer could , taking into account these statutes , implement a mandatory vaccination policy in the workplace . <p> An employer 's obligation to provide a safe and healthy working environment , and employees ' constitutional rights to bodily integrity , religion , culture and the like , will need to be balanced in the assessment of whether there are justifiable grounds to limit the rights . <p> In light of the seriousness of the spread of Covid-19 and the risk it poses to public health , if employees are not vaccinated they pose a danger to other ( vaccinated and unvaccinated ) employees . Vaccination is not an absolute bar to contracting the virus -- however , it is said to reduce one 's chances of infection . <p> The justifiability of the limitation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a case-by-case basis . However , conceivably , infringement of an employees ' rights may well be justified on grounds such as the employer 's operational requirements or health and safety considerations in certain circumstances . <p> There could , for instance , be an entire workforce that works remotely and , as such , there is less chance of them contracting the virus than if they worked in a densely populated environment . <p> In these circumstances , the limitation of an employee 's constitutional right to bodily integrity would likely not be justified on the basis of an employer 's health and safety obligations . <p> Aside from an employer 's health and safety obligations , could vaccination be an inherent requirement of the job in , for instance , the context of healthcare workers ? <p> The labour court has held that for a requirement to be inherent it must be so intrinsic that , if not met , an applicant would simply not qualify for the post and that the indispensable attribute must be job-related . If the job can be performed without the requirement , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inherent . <p> In addition , and in the Supreme Court of Appeal in Department of Correctional Services and another v Police and Prisons Civil Rights Union and others , it was held that a policy is not justified if it restricts a practice of religious belief and , by necessary extension , a cultural belief , that does not affect an employee 's ability to perform his duties , or jeopardise the safety of the public or other employees , or cause undue hardship to the employer in a practical sense . <p> If an employee were not to be vaccinated , it has the potential to impact on the safety of the public as well as other employees . <p> It could therefore be argued that there is a rational connection established between purported purpose of the limitation of their rights and the measure taken , being the implementation of a mandatory vaccination policy in the workplace . <p> However , the link is quite tenuous when considering what an inherent requirement of the job is in terms of the labour court 's view . Could a healthcare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is yes ( provided they do not contract the virus ) . In this instance , it would unlikely be an inherent requirement of the job . <p> However , if an international air hostess were to be precluded from entering the countries on her flight route without having had the vaccination , this would inhibit her ability to perform her duties . In these circumstances , an argument that the vaccination is an inherent requirement of her job would likely be more successful . <p> Perhaps a justification could also be sought in the employer 's broader operational requirements . <p> The question becomes : if employees refuse to be vaccinated , what next ? Can the employer discipline them ? Can the employees claim discrimination ? Is the employer obliged to accommodate those employees , and under what circumstances ?

@@62656232 <h> Medical oxygen : The fascinating journey of a life-saving gas <h> Even in ' normal ' times , a reliable supply of medical oxygen is an essential part of healthcare services , but during Covid-19 surges , the need for this life-sustaining gas has spiked to unprecedented levels . In hospitals across the country , being hooked up to an oxygen supply has for many made the difference between life and death . <p> Oxygen is abundantly available in the air around us , but for medical purposes ( for example with high-flow nasal oxygen or mechanical ventilation ) medical grade oxygen is needed . This means oxygen that is at least 95% pure and meets the SANS532 technical standard . <p> How is medical oxygen isolated ? <p> To make medical oxygen , oxygen producers take atmospheric air , filter out any dust , and make sure that it is completely desiccated ( dried ) , says Ross Hofmeyr , Associate Professor at the Department of Anaesthesia and Peri-operative Medicine at the University of Cape Town . <p> " The most common source of medical oxygen is through fractional distillation ( a process where air is separated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that our atmosphere contains just shy of 21% or about one-fifth oxygen , " he says . " The temperature of that air is decreased close to minus 200 degrees at a pressure of five to 10 atmospheres . That causes the air , mostly containing oxygen and about four-fifths nitrogen -- to liquify . And under very controlled conditions the temperature of that liquid oxygen and nitrogen mixture is raised sufficiently that the nitrogen bubbles off , leaving just the oxygen and one or two of the trace elements . " <p> Hofmeyr says that liquid oxygen is the most efficient way to store large volumes of oxygen -- with one litre of liquid oxygen equalling around 840 litres of gaseous oxygen . <p> Eventually , after being stored and transported , the liquid has to be turned back into a gas that people can breathe . <p> This is done with vaporisers , explains Mark van der Heever , deputy director of communication at the Department of Health in the Western Cape . <p> " In order to change phase between liquid and gas , the liquid needs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ additional energy which is provided by the vaporiser 's fins which absorb heat energy from the surrounding air , " he says . " The extreme cold of the oxygen liquid causes water condensate in the outside air to freeze when it comes in contact with the vaporiser 's fins or any exposed piping and over time , the ice can build up significantly if not maintained properly . The ice then acts as an insulating layer between the liquid oxygen and the outside air , reducing the capacity of the vaporiser to change liquid oxygen into oxygen gas . " <p> Van der Heever says in the Western Cape , average oxygen consumption is around 15 litres per minute per patient ( with Covid-19 ) although this can vary wildly depending on treatment type and how the treatment is applied . <p> Transported in bulk tankers , most hospitals use bulk oxygen storage in the form of liquid oxygen and with bulk tank systems , liquid oxygen is delivered and stored in a cryogenic vacuum insulated vessel which helps maintain the very low temperatures . <p> Hospitals can have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the form of an oxygen trolley which is fitted with a regulator and flow-metres to adjust the flow to the patient . " In this case , no existing infrastructure is required , and this is generally preferred at temporary facilities and at facilities which have a very low normal demand for oxygen , " explains van der Heever . <p> The piping for bulk and cylinder systems are the same and comprises a larger diameter copper pipe which gets incrementally smaller as the distance from the plant room increases . " The reticulation is often piped in the form of a ' loop ' where possible with multiple shutoff valves located throughout the facility in order to isolate sections for maintenance or repairs . The pipes are fed to individual service outlets which are used by clinical staff to plug devices into the system as needed , " explains van der Heever . <p> Keeping up the pressure <p> According to van der Heever , pressure drops can occur when the flow of oxygen exceeds the capacity of the pipes feeding the system or pressure regulating devices or when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system to maintain pressure . <p> He says a large pressure drop can occur in one of two ways . The first scenario is when both cylinder banks have almost emptied their respective cylinders and there is very little oxygen remaining in the cylinders . The other scenario is that the total demand for oxygen exceeds the capacity of the pressure regulator or the reticulation system . <p> " Oxygen is generally supplied at high pressure at the cylinder or bulk tank and then reduced to low pressure for distribution into the reticulation system . The low-pressure side is generally operated at 420 -- 550 kPa depending on the reticulation system . When the pressure drops , the amount of oxygen that is delivered to patients can fall below that which is required for the ongoing medical treatment , " explains van der Heever . <p> He adds that the department experienced minor pressure drops in one of their systems during the first wave of the Covid-19 pandemic due to the increased demand on the vaporiser and had to revert to back-up cylinders . " The problem was resolved shortly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he says . " Possible problems were identified using our data systems and mitigated by de-icing the vaporisers more frequently , referring high-flow patients to facilities with spare bulk oxygen capacity , and increasing the vaporiser size at facilities which were consistently experiencing very high consumption in comparison to their system maximum design capacity . " <p> Van der Heever says the major safety concern with oxygen is that it is highly pressurised like most compressed gasses and the cylinders , therefore , need to be securely stored and transported so it does not fall over and damage the valve on the top of the cylinder . <p> " Oxygen infrastructure is installed in a secured area away from the public , with only Afrox and trained maintenance personnel having access . There are minimum safety distances as stipulated in SANS10260-1 . The other safety concern is that oxygen does support combustion , especially in higher concentrations . Leaks directly from cylinders or bulk vessels are exceptionally rare due to the stringent regulatory inspection and testing they undergo , " he explains , adding that leaks from oxygen pipes are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , such as during construction or maintenance . <p> " When a new oxygen system is installed , it is pressure tested for 24 hours to ensure there are no leaks before the system is commissioned and this is repeated whenever a new section is added to the system . Wards and areas undergoing major maintenance are normally isolated from the oxygen reticulation system for the duration of construction . When a leak occurs , it is normally picked up while the area is still empty during the pressure testing and corrected quickly in order to complete a successful test , " says van der Heever explaining that oxygen points can also leak due to wear and tear and this is normally reported to the engineering workshops who have qualified staff and parts to service and repair any problems which do come up . <p> Who are the suppliers <p> The Western Cape government gets its medical oxygen from Africa Oxygen Ltd ( Afrox ) in terms of a contract administered by National Treasury . The relevant tender makes provision for different suppliers to supply medical oxygen in different parts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ local medical oxygen market is the company Air Liquide . <p> Afrox is a subsidiary of the Linde Group . An article recently published in The Guardian contained allegations that there is a lack of competition in the market for medical oxygen in some African countries and that the Linde Group and Air Liquide are overcharging clients on the continent . <p> When asked if there is enough competition in the market , van der Heever says there is a fair amount of competition between the two largest suppliers but even so , due to the vast distances covered and the impracticality of transporting oxygen over very long distances , the suppliers ' price fluctuates and longer distances mean higher prices . <p> " The rates depend on the delivery method but in-bulk the cost is currently R10.04/kg of condensed oxygen in the Western Cape . Deliveries and logistics are managed by the Afrox delivery team for both bulk and cylinder supply . Cylinders , as well as bulk tanks , are rented from the supplier , " he says , explaining that this is in part due to regulatory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Cylinders are delivered to site by Afrox , and they also remove the empty cylinders for refilling and redistribution . Once empty cylinders are removed , they are pressure tested if necessary , refilled and redistributed to a new facility . <p> Air Liquide says they produce medical oxygen at five plants in South Africa and that the frequency of deliveries depends on demand from hospitals . " Some hospitals we used to supply once a week are now supplied daily , " says the company . <p> An oxygen tank . ( Photo : eltpics / Flickr / Spotlight ) <p> Meeting the surge in demand <p> As Covid-19 infections and hospitalisations surged in South Africa , first in mid-2020 and then again at the end of the year , so did the need for medical oxygen . <p> The Western Cape Department of Health 's average oxygen consumption per day pre-Covid-19 was approximately 12.2 tons per day . During the peak of the first wave consumption was approximately 35 tons per day and during the peak of the second wave consumption was at 62.2 tons per day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ private sector hospitals and other industries that also use oxygen such as pharmaceuticals , clinics and emergency medical services . <p> " Our current consumption is getting lower daily and is currently already less than the first wave . In relation to our peak consumption , we therefore currently have more than 50% spare capacity . Current Covid-19-related oxygen consumption is estimated at around 17.8 ton per day , " says van der Heever . <p> As demand for medical oxygen spiked in the country , Air Liquide and Afrox both took steps to prioritise the supply of medical oxygen . Air Liquide explains that with the necessary re-allocation of their supply chain resources to prioritise hospitals , they sent their industrial clients a " Notice of Force Majeure " to inform them of a possible interruption of oxygen deliveries . <p> Van der Heever says the province experienced two major challenges as demand spiked . " The first challenge was the sheer volume of oxygen being consumed . The total volume we required in the Western Cape exceeded the total volume that the Afrox Epping plant could produce . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ facilities from the Port Elizabeth plant to avoid having to supply these facilities from the Epping plant , and this was sufficient for a few weeks . Later , during the highest demand period , there were also supplemental deliveries from other plants and three additional bulk tanker trucks which help fill the facility bulk tanks . <p> But the largest challenge van der Heever says was the high turnover of cylinders , especially at rural facilities . This was because the overall throughput was so high and the supply of empty cylinders became an issue since the Epping plant would have to stop filling cylinders and wait for new empty ones to come in , even though they had sufficient oxygen ready to go . <p> " This was mitigated by firstly monitoring the number of empty cylinders daily via the dashboard ( an internal departmental dashboard ) and directing in-house transport to collect the cylinders where there was a significant amount . Afrox has also ordered a large number of additional cylinders and converted cylinders for industrial customers for oxygen , " he says . <p> Spotlight sent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time of publication .

@@62656233 <h> The Tshisekedi-Kabila split affirms the power of incumbency at the expense of the rule of law . <p> Two years after winning the historic 2018 election , Democratic Republic of the Congo ( DRC ) President F ? lix Tshisekedi recently dismantled the governing alliance he 'd sealed with former president Joseph Kabila . But who will benefit from the new political dispensation -- the office of the president , or the rule of law in the DRC ? <p> The latest developments in the country illustrate several trends in Congolese and African politics . They show how political actors invest more resources in the conquest of power than exercising it legitimately and effectively . <p> The new power arrangements are still taking shape , butthe end of the coalition marks the failure of a turbulent experience of cohabitation between a presidency and a parliament controlled by different parties . <p> Ideally , the Front commun pour le Congo -- Cap pour le Changement ( FCC-CACH ) alliance could have resulted in productive cooperation between parliament and State House . This would have broken with the trend in most of the region 's countries whereby one party controls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind this failure is Kabila 's likely ambition to run in the next presidential polls . As a result , the FCC-dominated parliament that emerged from the 2018 elections never aimed to control government 's actions in terms of effectiveness . Rather it sought to ensure that government , particularly the prime minister , balanced Tshisekedi 's power with the help of the National Assembly . <p> Kabila did n't have any interest in seeing Tshisekedi succeed , as this could have hampered his own prospective run for president . The coalition could perhaps have worked had Kabila not nurtured such ambitions , which clashed with Tshisekedi 's . <p> The failure of the FCC-CACH alliance is symptomatic of two factors . Firstly , incumbency matters in Africa . Regardless of constitutional checks and balances , the person occupying the presidency possesses an unlimited advantage both domestically and internationally . Presidential power remains the axis from which most political dynamics in the country and beyond originate . <p> Paradoxically Kabila -- who benefited from an expansive range of presidential powers -- ended up overestimating the weight of the rule of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind the throne . <p> Second , regional recognition comes with nuances . International acceptance of the arrangement between Tshisekedi and Kabila may have led the former to overestimate his support within the region and beyond . At the African Union consultative meeting in Addis Ababa in January 2019 , most of the DRC 's neighbours opposed the arrangement . The deal was finally ' saved ' by South Africa 's recognition , which was then a minority position among the states attending the meeting . <p> Compared to other countries in Central Africa , the DRC 's constitution appears far more balanced in the devolution of powers between a directly elected president and a prime minister coming from the parliament 's majority . <p> However , as recent developments show , the presidency remains the ultimate decision-making centre . Does this perhaps aggravate existing structural flaws seen in Congolese politics over the years ? To dismantle the FFC-CACH alliance , Tshisekedi clearly took advantage of the political opportunities offered by Congolese politicians ' inclination towards what locals call ' transhumance ' . <p> Drawn from a pastoralist form of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ease with which political actors shift allegiances based on material , and not ideological , incentives . For example , Modeste Bahati Lukwebo , Kabila 's economy minister , would probably never have joined Tshisekedi 's camp had his former boss chosen him as candidate for the senate presidency . <p> Herein lies the dilemma facing Tshisekedi . He may well be able to form a new majority , but it would still mostly comprise Kabila 's former supporters . Despite numerous doubts about their credibility , the 2018 presidential election results indicated that two-thirds of the electorate voted against Kabila 's candidate , Emmanuel Ramazani Shadary . <p> Ultimately though , Kabila 's supporters will still constitute the bulk of the parliamentary majority from which the future government will be formed . This shows that the main party in the DRC happens to be neither FCC nor Tshisekedi 's Union for Democracy and Social Progress ( UDPS ) , but rather political opportunism . <p> Developments in the DRC seem to follow the entrenched regional trend of bending laws for the sake of scoring political goals . As some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appointments that sparked the rift between the two allies was questionable . Recent efforts to consolidate Tshisekedi 's power will mean nothing if they merely lead to a new phase of Big Man politics with a lame-duck parliament . <p> It remains unclear which institutional safeguards exist to ensure that the restored ' chain of command ' does n't replicate the flaws of previous administrations in the DRC . The jury is still out as to what the planned reforms , especially of the electoral commission and the judiciary , will achieve . <p> Will they ensure that citizens ' voices are heard ? Or will they merely result in the appointment of personalities close to the presidential party , in order to bend institutions and ensure electoral wins in future polls ? <p> Such doubts are understandable , given that governance under the new president does n't seem to fundamentally break with past practices . Having spent several decades in the opposition , Tshisekedi 's UDPS is struggling to adjust to a status of ruling party . <p> It maintains a base that could fuel the type of ethnic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Moreover , the management of the 100-days special projects demonstrated serious deficiencies in financial accountability , effectiveness and efficiency . <p> Getting rid of Kabila 's influence by poaching his supporters can not be the endgame for Tshisekedi and Congolese political stakeholders . Congolese citizens must ensure that the ongoing changes lay the groundwork for better public scrutiny and an accountable executive . This includes constitutional requirements for decentralising power . Otherwise , the current political reconfiguration could result in more of the same at their expense .

Under the Mnangagwa administration , cigarette smuggling has continued to thrive and the operations of the aforementioned money-men have been unhindered . The ban on the sale of cigarettes during the Covid-19 pandemic in South Africa significantly increased the market and prices for smuggled cigarettes ( ref : Chingono , N. 2020 . " South Africa tobacco ban greeted with cigarette smuggling boom " , The Guardian , June 26 ) .

This fundamental flaw in its process taints the credibility of the report . <p> I have been resident in South Africa for years and have been openly engaged on several South African media platforms in the last six months -- so it is not as if the report 's authors could not find me . <p> We demand that Maverick Citizen retract its baseless allegations as it pertains to Pacific Cigarette Company and me , and tender an apology to us . <p> Should Maverick Citizen refuse to do so , we reserve the right to pursue all the legal avenues available to us . <p> The facts of the matter are these -- which we would have gladly explained had we been approached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has a Chinese state-owned entity as a shareholder <p> The ultimate beneficial shareholders in Pacific Cigarette Company are Adam Molai , Gerrit de Jong and Christopher Sambaza through their family trusts . All three shareholders are Zimbabwean citizens . <p> Pacific Cigarette Company has a manufacturing agreement with China Tobacco Shaanxi Industrial Corporation , a subsidiary of the Chinese National Tobacco Company , to manufacture cigarettes for the Chinese diaspora in Africa . The contract was a first of its kind to have Chinese brands licensed to an African entity ; something that should be celebrated , not maligned . <p> False Claim 2 : The majority of cigarettes smuggled into South Africa are Pacific cigarettes <p> No such proof has ever been furnished and we are not and have never been the subject of any investigations . <p> Cigarette smuggling is a global phenomenon which has been in existence since the advent of the industry and long before Pacific Cigarette Company came into being to challenge the monopoly that existed . <p> Pacific Cigarette Company has never been involved in nor in any way condones cigarette smuggling .

Long before I met and married my wife , I attended the best private schools in Zimbabwe , the UK 's most expensive and only private university and one of Canada 's leading business schools , as my father was a pound sterling millionaire before the advent of Zimbabwe 's independence . <p> I have never bid for a tender anywhere in the world . My businesses were generally started from scratch , or I have taken stakes in existing enterprises . <p> Contrary to benefiting me , building brands with a Mugabe relationship has been the biggest challenge . This difficulty continues to be perpetuated by stories like Maverick Citizen 's , long after his demise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investigation for a state contract that at law was required to go to tender <p> I am not under investigation nor was this a procurement contract . <p> One of our investments , Housing Corporation Zimbabwe , approached the National Social Security Agency ( NSSA ) , as the largest Zimbabwean pension fund , for investment , not for a contract . NSSA then informed us of their off-take scheme , which they had launched with other development entities . <p> It was ventilated in court that NSSA 's procurement policy provisions clearly differentiate between off-take agreements , which are investment decisions taken differently from the procurement of services in the ordinary course of organisational operations . <p> This matter has gone to arbitration in Zimbabwe , and even to the High Court and we have a US$22-million award in our favour which is an order of the court . <p> We have also been awarded a temporary injunction from the Supreme Court of Mauritius against the assets of NSSA held in Mauritius . <p> The Zimbabwe High Court has also found that a forensic audit report on NSSA was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its report , Maverick Citizen ascribes my business success and acumen to political patronage . This is insulting and offensive . It ignores the reality that , together with the many competent , multinational professionals who make up my various teams , I have built and bought more businesses and grown our balance sheet more since President Robert Mugabe was removed from office than whilst he was in office . <p> I am incredibly proud of our collective achievements which have been the result of vision , hard work and grit . <p> I am happy to defend myself and my and Pacific Cigarette Company 's business track record in any court of law on any of these malicious allegations . <p> *** <p> Response to media statement by Adam Molai and Pacific Cigarette Company by the report 's authors <p> The aforementioned media statement does more to prove the points raised in the " Cartel Power Dynamics in Zimbabwe " report than it does to disprove the report 's findings . <p> On page 28 , the report states that Adam Molai was a member of Mugabe 's patronage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was Mugabe 's nephew-in-law . Patronage is privileged support provided by a political leader to an individual or company . As stated in the report , Mugabe publicly threatened BAT Zimbabwe for allegedly blocking Pacific cigarettes from accessing the market . This was privileged support as Mugabe did not provide such support for other companies that had equally complained about BAT Zimbabwe . <p> When a relative of the president owns a relatively young company which is awarded a contract worth US$304-million by a state-owned entity without competitive bidding , due diligence or financial appraisal done , one is persuaded to believe that this is due to the privileged support that such an individual enjoys and the institutional weakness of the state entity . <p> The report notes on page 53 that rule of law is weak in Zimbabwe . The press statement underlines this . <p> Zimbabwe 's Constitution states in Section 315 ( 1 ) that " procurement of goods and services by the State and all institutions and agencies of government at every level " must be " effected in a manner that is transparent , fair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 315 ( 2 ) the Constitution states that " contracts for the construction and operation of infrastructure and facilities " must be conducted in a manner that " ensures transparency , honesty , cost-effectiveness and competitiveness " . Likewise , the Public Procurement and Disposal of Public Assets Act ( PPDPA ) , which applies to all stages of the payment for construction works by public entities , requires competitive bidding and that bidders demonstrate " experience " needed to deliver on the contract . <p> Molai can call the contract by any name he likes , but the supreme law of the land states unequivocally that this contract should be awarded transparently after an assessment of its cost-effectiveness and after a competitive process . The press statement admits this was not the case and that the contract was awarded in an unconstitutional manner . <p> The PPDPA does not condone the awarding of such a contract to a company with limited to no experience . We call on constitutional lawyers in Zimbabwe to challenge the high court decision to award HCZ US$22-million of Zimbabweans ' pensions and the constitutionality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statement . As per the Financial Gazette , Molai and the HCZ can not deny being investigated over the NSSA contract as the Financial Gazette ( May 17 , 2018 ) reported that they sued a Zimbabwe Anti-Corruption Commission ( ZACC ) official for announcing that Molai and HCZ were under investigation ( " ZACC boss sued for $200k " , May 17 ) . <p> On page 28 , the report states that " the majority of cigarettes smuggled to South Africa are the Pacific Cigarettes and Gold Leaf Tobacco brands " and that " Pacific cigarettes are the most seized brand by South African law enforcement agencies " . <p> These are not statements that we make lightly -- these are the findings of ( i ) the Atlantic Council , a distinguished think tank ; ( ii ) the Tobacco Institute of Southern Africa and ( iii ) law enforcement agencies in neighbouring countries that have on numerous occasions intercepted Pacific cigarettes being smuggled into their countries -- as far back as 2009 , the Botswana Police Service seized 66,500 cartons of Pacific cigarettes ( The Independent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " , December 3 ) ; last April , it was reported in the media that the South Africa Police Service intercepted R900,000 worth of Pacific cigarettes ( Bulawayo24 ( 2020 ) " Zimbabwe made cigarettes smuggled into SA , trio arrested " , April 17 ) . <p> Nowhere in the report is Pacific Cigarette Company accused of smuggling its cigarettes , a false claim made in the press statement . <p> On pages 52-53 , the report describes how lack of transparency and weak enforcement of legislation drive the activities of cartels . <p> On 1 January 2020 , a new Companies and other Business Entities Act came into effect in Zimbabwe . The act , developed with support from the World Bank , has progressive clauses around transparency of beneficial ownership . The act , in section 72(1) , requires that every company " maintain an accurate and up-to-date register of the beneficial owner or owners of the company " and unequivocally states ( section 72(6) ) that this information is public information . <p> When the act was passed , companies had until this past Saturday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This law has been enforced poorly -- first the Registrar of Companies unilaterally decided that beneficial ownership information was not public information but only available to law enforcement agents , and then in October 2020 , the government postponed the deadline for companies to declare their beneficial ownership by two years to 13 February 2023 . <p> However , there is no law today that prevents Pacific Cigarette Company from publicly declaring who its beneficial owners are on its website as is done by well governed companies across the world and in the spirit of the new Companies and other Business Entities Act . That is something that will be celebrated -- not the public declaration of beneficial ownership in press statements .

@@62656235 <p> In the last book published before his death John Gardner wrote : " Uncontroversial ideas need not less but more critical scrutiny , since they generally get such an easy ride " . 1 Rarely , I imagine , has this observation been more apposite than it is today , in the world of COVID-19 . <p> Before this virus began to infect not merely our bodies but also our consciousness , one of the more common refrains by politicians and public intellectuals was that the world today is more divided than ever before . This division , we were told , takes different forms in different places , but it is constitutive of modern political and social life . Even now , they lament , in the world of COVID-19 , we can not escape these conflictual tendencies . In the midst of the crisis initiated by this virus , when humanity so desperately needs a coordinated response , we can not agree on how to act . <p> Whatever the truth and relevance of this analysis of politics pre-COVID-19 , it appears to me to get matters completely backwards as a diagnosis of our present political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has almost without exception adopted a uniform response . Speaking last Thursday , on the eve of South Africa 's own inevitable lockdown , Minister of Police , Bheki Cele , articulated the essence of this response : " Come 23:59pm tonight , life stops . " <p> Instead of the usual conflict and controversy that characterises politics , nations have acted in concert . More than this , civil society and market actors have voiced a near deafening support of the state . Of course , there have been technical disagreements -- often to do with timing or intensity -- but these must not distract us from the fact that on the questions of what to do and why to do it , we have witnessed in the last few weeks that phenomenon usually reserved for utopian dreamers : harmony . <p> " Good ! " you might say , and you might well be right . Before we reach this judgment , though , we must at least for a moment reflect critically on this extraordinary convergence of opinion and response . <p> UNDERSTANDING " WHY " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Our leaders and experts , in the main , are doing their best . What they are doing may even turn out to be best . Surely , though , we need not be reminded that this is not guaranteed . After all , the response to the virus has been striking precisely because it lacks the nuance usually thought necessary to deal effectively with social problems , be these related to health or housing , climate or crime . Why should COVID-19 be any different ? What works in London is rarely what works in Lenasia . As Alex Broadbent and Benjamin Smart put it : " Failure to recognise that one size does not fit all could have lethal consequences in this region , maybe even more lethal than those of the virus itself . " <p> Importantly , it is not only the " what " of the response ( lockdown ) but also the " why " that needs critical questioning . We must question the why not just because the reasons for what we do are as susceptible to the conformity -- and its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but because the why is prior to the what . Put otherwise , we can only know what to do when we know why we want to do anything at all . Or , to say the same thing in a third way , the reasons for our actions , the ends or ideals that we want to realise or actualise , shape the actions that we take . <p> What I want to suggest is that the uniformity of response , i.e. the near global lockdown , is informed , at least in part , by the very thing that many of our politicians and intellectuals lament as being absent : unity of purpose . This purpose is the preservation of human life , not in any substantive or meaningful sense , but life as a bare , biological fact . <p> If this is true , merely identifying this fact , which is one of the principal functions of criticism , throws into question the legitimacy , or at least the sustainability , of this response . For , we know that life in this crude or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it barely matters at all . What matters is a dignified and good life , a life worth living . When we recall this , we recognise the true significance of Minister Cele 's statement : " Come 23:59pm tonight , life stops . " <p> LIVES WORTH LIVING <p> I do not think that many of our leaders or intellectuals would , after conscious and critical reflection , in fact privilege biological life above all else . To the contrary , many would balk at this idea . That this is so , however , does not mean that their actions and policies are not informed by it . <p> Indeed , this is how I interpret the cacophony that replies to any person who for just a moment floats a response to COVID-19 other than lockdown . " How dare you " , they unite in chorus , " trade lives for money ! " Of course , nobody , or at least hardly anybody , is suggesting anything of the sort . What this response reveals is not so much the callousness of neoliberals or other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to think outside of those economic categories into which life biologically understood neatly fits . <p> Closer to home , this predominance of biological life as an ethical ideal -- the idea that mere survival of the greatest number is the ultimate measure of right and wrong -- is evident in our legal descriptions of essential goods and services , the sweeping treatment of activities or concerns that fall outside of them , and the apparent willingness , evident from our relative silence , to tolerate violence against or abuse of persons suspected of acting contrary to this ideal . <p> More explicitly , perhaps , the ideal informs this claim by Tembeka Ngcukaitobi : " Individual rights are important . But life is a paramount individual right . Keeping us alive is the most important function of government . " <p> Legally speaking , Mr Ngcukaitobi is wrong . The Constitution not only recognises , as he later points out , that rights conflict and that law or conduct that settles this conflict will often demand the sacrifice or limitation of rights . It also recognises that what we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Context is essential and differently-situated people often disagree , hence our Constitution 's embrace of a participatory , accountable form of politics . Disaster or emergency can warrant further limitations , but they can not change these legal facts . <p> Not merely keeping us alive , but acting in a way that makes possible good and dignified lives -- lives worth living -- is the most important function of government . Often , this requires doing all that we can to keep everyone alive , but , tragically , other times not . <p> ALL TOO OBVIOUS <p> These points are not just critical and legal . They matter for how we should understand our response to the threat posed by COVID-19 . <p> Because conflict and choice is the essence of politics and the origin of law , when we find ourselves , as we do now , in almost global agreement -- when parties as diverse as the ANC , DA and EFF stand shoulder to shoulder with CEOs , journalists and human rights bodies -- we should pause and ask : " Why are we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because the answer is elusive , but because it appears all too obvious . <p> Of course , many after asking this question will answer that a temporary lockdown is worth it , that our substantive lives coming to a stop is a price worth paying for the chance of saving biological lives , not merely for their own sake , but because of the substantive ones that could emerge therefrom . If you , like me , are inclined , at least for now , to offer this answer , then we must ask a second question : " For how long should substantive life come to a stop ? " <p> When we begin to answer this second question -- as we inevitably must -- the purposive unity that we have witnessed over the last few weeks will disappear . As before , we will disagree about what makes life worth living and we will disagree about what or who we choose to limit or sacrifice . When we do , we must not lament . This return of conflict , choice and sacrifice , as frustrating and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing . When matters no longer appear so obvious , this will be a sign that life has started again , that the clock has finally ticked past 23:59.

@@62661234 <h> Total transparency of IT costs is achievable <p> A leading pan-African financial services group is benefiting from complete visibility into its IT costs , dramatically reduced IT budget cycle times and detailed reporting following implementation of the MagicOrange cost transparency solution . <p> This financial services company operates in more than 20 African countries , offering asset management , investment , insurance and health products to 3.2 million people across the African continent . The organisation had embarked on a cost transparency journey and developed a good basis for allocating IT costs . The model , however , originally ran in Excel , making it inefficient , time-consuming , slow and unstable . <p> The cumbersome system could take up to an hour to update and was unable to generate reports . Retrieving information involved pulling figures together from a number of spreadsheets and this intensive number-crunching consumed valuable resources .

It has trebled its dividend since the Randgold deal and has realised $1.5-billion from the sale of noncore assets . <p> " We have no net debt and we 've got huge liquidity to be able to take on any opportunities . It 's a prudent conservative way of managing a balance sheet . But that 's what you have to do if you 're near the top of a cyclical investment , particularly on the revenue side , because that 's what the gold mining industry miscued on last time , when it went and blew all the money it was making and then the gold price went down .

A confluence of events including the global pandemic , the rise of work from home models , and a growing number of sophisticated cyber threats have sparked a movement of sorts ; one that keeps privacy at the fore . <p> Now , people all over the world are increasingly aware that they need to batten down the digital hatches and keep their data and sensitive information private and safe . There is a definite link between privacy and cybersecurity ; if your activity and data are both hidden , then you are less likely to become an attacker 's target . <p> With that in mind , here we go over the tools you need to ensure your online protection in 2021 and beyond . <h> Best tools to guard privacy online <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is designed to create distance between a user and their online activity . You can think of a proxy server as an intermediary between the web as a whole and the end-user , such as yourself . The benefits of using a proxy include increased cybersecurity , privacy , and even improved performance . <p> As a gatekeeper of sorts , proxy servers are both firewalls and web filters rolled into one . In regards to the latter , businesses can use proxies to limit employee access to certain parts of the internet and individual users can use proxies to stop children from seeing certain types of content , for example . <p> Virtual Private Networks , or VPNs for short , have some similar qualities to proxy servers . For example , with a VPN switched on , your real IP address is hidden , your internet activity is carried out on a private network , and the VPN acts as an intermediary between the user and the internet . On top of that , VPNs encrypt all your web traffic and data transmissions for security . A VPN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known as tunnelling . <p> When you 're choosing a VPN for better security and privacy , always choose a high-quality , paid subscription as free versions are notorious for selling your data to third parties . <p> Encrypted email providers <p> It might be one of the world 's most popular email providers , but Google 's Gmail leaves a lot to be desired when it comes to privacy . Ever had an appointment miraculously appear in your calendar without your input ? That 's because Google 's platform can view the content of your emails . Convenient perhaps , but it 's a real privacy no-go . <p> Instead , switch to a full encrypted email provider so your private emails stay private . One top choice is ProtonMail , which offers full end-to-end encryption , making your emails near-impossible to hack or decode . <p> To boost your digital security , and keep your online activities private ( as they should be ) start making use of the three top tools detailed above . <p> Hypertext creates relevant business and consumer technology content for our readers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mobile , 3D printing and more , where the greatest ideas of today inspire the innovations of tomorrow . <h> NEWSLETTER <p> Please leave this field empty <h> BE THE FIRST TO KNOW <p> Select the newsletter you would like to receive : Daily Newsletter SME Newsletter Channel Newsletter <p> Check your inbox or spam folder to confirm your subscription . <p> Hypertext is one of South Africa 's leading technology news and reviews sites , catering for consumers , small and medium businesses and the technology channel .

The municipality owed tax and was not making employees ' pension fund and medical aid payments . <p> This led to the Province invoking its constitutional mandate to intervene , and a financial recovery plan was developed and imposed in March 2017 , with the municipal council in charge of overseeing the plan . <p> By December 2018 it was apparent the municipality was not implementing the plan , and the provincial executive invoked provisions in the Municipal Finance Management Act to take over implementation , appointing an administrator . <p> The administrator introduced cost savings including freezing of salary increases for councilors and officials and of bonuses for senior management . <p> But in November last year , with executive mayor Magdalena Barry ill due to Covid-19 and municipal manager Reynold Stevens suspended , the remaining six-member council took a number of decisions which the Province believes are unlawful . <p> The council also decided to change the organisational structure imposed by a resolution of 31 May last year , to create five new posts in the Speaker 's office and another in the mayor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who had previously been dismissed , and to distribute R204,902 in bonuses to two employees who had already been awarded R581,000 and R306,000 respectively . <p> Additionally , Bredell states , a R136,000 " prestige bonus " was given to the former Municipal Manager , Morne Hoogbaard , who had left the municipality in 2016 and had subsequently been charged by the NPA . <p> Bredell argues all these decisions are unlawful as they are not in accordance with the financial management plan which the Province has imposed as part of their constitutionally mandated obligation and in line with the Municipal Finance Management Act ( MFMA ) . <p> Further , he says in his affidavit , the Inovasure deal does not comply with Municipal Supply Chain Management regulations , the MFMA , or the National Treasury 's regulations , and there is no evidence that the required consultation with the national energy regulator has taken place . Bredell included letters to the municipality from both National and Provincial Treasuries . <h> Kannaland 's argument <p> The Kannaland municipality accepts that the Province had to intervene , but say its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the functional and institutional integrity of local government " . <p> The municipality argues that the Province 's administrator , who has been in office for three years , has no legal standing as council was not dissolved . <p> Kannaland also says the MFMA states the National Treasury has to develop the recovery plan , not Province . <p> The councillors also argue that the intervention of the Province was politically motivated , as other municipalities plagued with chronic underpayment for services have not been targets for the same " maximally intrusive intervention " , especially not any of the Western Cape 's DA-led municipalities . ( Kannaland has a mix of Icosa , DA , and ANC seats in council ) . <p> The call for urgent interim action against Kannaland to prevent the Inovasure deal and further staff appointments is baseless , argues acting municipal manager Roland Butler , as Inovasure is far from a done deal and anyway would n't place any financial risk on the municipality as all the risk is on Inovasure . As for altering the staffing plan , he says , this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Additionally , states Butler , the ( former ) Provincial administrator has stated that implementation of the financial management recovery plan is 97% complete . <p> The Province 's intervention in Kannaland should be declared unlawful , says Butler , and the national government should provide oversight . <p> The case will be considered by the High Court on 1 March . <p> This is the third and last in a series on Kannaland .

Massachussetts and Nevada also voted for recreational use . <p> California legalised marijuana for medical use back in 1996 , the first state to do so . Its approval of the more traditional use of the drug has taken a surprisingly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reputation or , if you will , its general propensity for woo-woo flakiness . <p> One possible reason for this is that those involved in the dope economies of Mendocino , Trinity and Humboldt counties -- the hilly " emerald triangle " of Northern California and the largest cannabis-producing region in the US -- actively campaigned against legalisation , fearing that it would bring an end to a lifestyle that has , if I may , flowered there since the 1960s . <p> Legalisation , it was argued , would mean state intervention , taxes and regulations : heavy sh*t from the " the man " , and what have you . There was also the fear of both Big Pharma and Big Farmer muscling out the hippie cottage industry types . <p> Imagine toking up with something called Beyond Mif ? by Monsanto ?

He told the court this week that this evidence should have been handed to him four months ago . <p> To date , all the state has done is attempt to have all evidence supporting the use of the drug by adults -- annexures in the form of scientific reports , academic literature or expert testimony -- thrown out of court . <p> In fact , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Life , Christian botherers who are supporting the state in this matter , has claimed that some of these annexures were too long to read anyway . <p> Being something of a backchatting smartypants , Mahon told the court that , seeing as he 's had them for ten months now , Willis has had plenty of time to go through the documents . Besides , it 's what advocates do , trawl through documents . <p> Of course , with the inconvenient evidence to the contrary out of the way , the state will then , with expert testimony from Doctors for Life Without Science , be able to convince the court and , indeed , the world at large , of the evils of dagga . <p> And there are many . For a start , it will prevent patients from appreciating the full force of their God-given cancers by reducing their pain , combatting nausea and stimulating their appetites .

Essentially , there is a point when increasing tax rates actually reduces tax revenue . <h> Lending to SOEs <p> " Despite the Treasury 's tough talk regarding bailouts for state-owned enterprises SOEs and given the dire state of our SOEs , there is the ever present risk SOEs will require more money .

Had he buckled on this position it would have significantly weakened his position , particularly for negotiations around the next wage agreement period which kicks in soon . " <p> He says by standing firm Mboweni is allowing the court process to play out . <p> " It is possible that the court will rule against the minister and force government to honour the last year of the wage agreement , or that some kind of political compromise is reached in upcoming wage negotiations whereby a portion of the final year of the last agreement is paid and in return , the unions agree to accept lower wage increases going forward .

" He said , ' that is great , my daughter ' . " <p> Another participant , aged 21 , explained : " My dad has HIV . That 's why he pushed me . He is supporting me to do all this . " <p> However , daily PrEP pills may soon be a thing of the past , with a number of new long-acting prevention innovations in the pipeline . <p> Prof Linda-Gail Bekker , deputy director of the Desmond Tutu HIV Centre , said the HIV community is very keen to see the injectable PrEP made as widely available as possible . Image : Desmond Tutu HIV Foundation <p> Speaking at the virtual Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections ( CROI ) this week , Prof Linda-Gail Bekker , deputy director of the Desmond Tutu HIV Centre , said while oral PrEP remains robust in preventing HIV infection , it is not feasible for everyone due to poor adherence . <p> " A solution to this is less frequent dosing with alternative types of agents , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were gaining lessons from contraceptives and antipsychotic long-acting innovations that had been working effectively and had improved adherence to treatment . <p> Some of the long-acting PrEP innovations in development , which Bekker called " superheroes of prevention " , include vaginal rings , monthly injections , implants , monthly pills and passive immunisation through the infusion of broadly neutralising antibodies ( BNabs ) . <p> One of the new monthly injections , cabotegravir , is not only safe but was found to be superior to the tablet form , Truvada . <p> Prof Francois Venter , head of Ezintsha , a research group at Wits University , said as the country awaits the arrival of the new drug in the next few years , the health-care system needed to be scaled-up to ensure that it can cope and deliver the service . <p> He warned , though , that an injectable PrEP is not going to be a silver bullet in HIV prevention . <p> Operationally , delivering long-acting PrEP would be a complicated intervention , he said , and plans to use private pharmacies as injection sites were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think about injection sites , which are outside clinical environment , looking to local pharmacies and points where injections can be administered , " said Venter . <p> " I think we 've got little time to start playing with these models as registration is going to take a while before it gets to us .

This , it said , leads to victims being marginalised for reporting such cases . <p> " The consequences for perpetrators appear minimal , if at all . The lack of victim support , the lack of consequences for perpetrators , and the protection of perpetrators of sexual misconduct leads to a lack of trust , fear , a lack of reporting and impunity , and ultimately undermines the stated values of both gender equality and professionalism within the DOD .

As a Nintendo 3DS game that originally was n't planned to be released in the West , Bravely Default 's success led to the creation of a sequel and a rethinking of Square Enix 's design philosophy in subsequent years . <p> Now that we 're in 2021 , and it 's been a few years since the sequel , Bravely Second : End Layer ( Also a Nintendo 3DS title ) , Square Enix have decided to revisit the franchise and launch a brand new tale on Nintendo Switch . Bravely Default 2 has been crafted by a different development studio ( Claytechworks ) to the other two games in the franchise ( Silicon Studio ) but it still has all the core elements in place . <p> Newcomers to Bravely Default will be glad to know that Bravely Default 2 is set in an entirely different world to the other two games . Much like how each major numbered title in the Final Fantasy series is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <h> Jobs <p> Players will take on the role of Seth , a washed up sailor who is rescued from the beach and taken to a castle town known as Halcyona . He is introduced to Princess Gloria of Musa here and eventually meets up with a scholar named Elvis and a mercenary named Adelle . <p> The plot thickens after a hefty prologue and soon enough players will be adventuring throughout the world of Excillant in search of four crystals which have immense elemental power . Stating anything further ventures into spoiler territory so we 'll hold our tongues here but players are definitely in for a JRPG treat since Bravely Default 2 's characters are all well written despite having some trope-filled qualities based on their assigned core " Jobs " . <p> Players will be able to procure " Asterisks " throughout the story and these impart specific " Jobs " to characters . For example , Seth starts off as a " Freelancer " but can switch jobs to a " Black Mage " and learn magic skills that way . As you gain more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are necessary for progressing throughout the game . This is due to the skills they each allow characters to use . There are more than 20 jobs in the game and being able to equip a primary and a secondary " sub-job " adds to the complexity of the job system . <h> Strategic Gameplay <p> Gameplay in Bravely Default 2 makes use of a slightly tweaked battle system from the previous games . The " Brave " and " Default " commands are essential to winning battles and work well in combat . Using the " Brave " command , players can stack up turns and execute multiple actions in a row . <p> This , however , comes at the cost of foregoing future turns . Using the " Default " command , players can defend themselves and stack up " Brave Points " which can be used for " Brave " actions later . Essentially , this works a credit system but for turns in combat . It sounds complicated but it works extremely well in action . <p> The strategy involved with using different jobs is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ using your party 's skills to the best of their ability is something that does take some trial and error though . <p> However , once you have a system in place , you 'll be defeating enemies quite easily . Enemies in Bravely Default 2 provide enough of a challenge , but there are definitely some encounters which should be completely avoided until you are a much higher level . <p> Players who sink enough hours into the game while adventuring will encounter some battles with rare monsters which will need the party to grind out exponentially more exp . This feels very reminiscent of old school Final Fantasy games and those who enjoy classic JRPGs will certainly love Bravely Default 2 because of this . <p> If you 're averse to grinding though , Bravely Default 2 thankfully does include a fast-forward option to speed up battles quite significantly . This is an immense help in the tougher sections of the game when you need a specific job to be levelled up enough to use a useful skill or passive ability . <p> You can just visit a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through battles while racking up tonnes of experience and Job points . <p> Graphically , Bravely Default 2 looks great on Nintendo Switch . The art style used throughout the game is rather pleasant and the visual effects are top notch in battles -- Especially when using skills . Some aspects of the game such as the scenes where characters talk to each other could have used a lot more visual polish but alas , this is n't the case . <p> The soundtrack is arguably the best part of the game aside from the turn-based battle system . There are plenty of tracks which are extremely catchy and you 'll be humming the overworld tune to yourself in no time flat once you hear it . <h> Final Verdict <p> Overall , Bravely Default 2 is a solid JRPG in the Bravely Default franchise . The game has a fairly standard story but is well written and will entertain you from start to finish . <p> The battle system does involve some grindy elements to progress but this is something that happens often across the JRPG genre so ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fan of classic JRPGs with a modern twist to spice things up , Bravely Default 2 will appeal to you . <p> This game comes highly recommended from us . <h> Bravely Default 2 <p> 8Score <p> Bravely Default 2 is more of the classic JRPG formula that made Bravely Default 1 a success . <p> Sahil is a tech and gaming enthusiast that 's been a writer , reviewer , advisor and editor at multiple publications <h> NEWSLETTER <p> Please leave this field empty <h> BE THE FIRST TO KNOW <p> Select the newsletter you would like to receive : Daily Newsletter SME Newsletter Channel Newsletter <p> Check your inbox or spam folder to confirm your subscription . <p> Hypertext is one of South Africa 's leading technology news and reviews sites , catering for consumers , small and medium businesses and the technology channel .

" <p> The analysis also points to the four banks ' credit impairment charges rising relative to 2019 , as forward-looking impairment models and post-model adjustments sought to capture the scale of the crisis on loan portfolios . The dramatic increase in impairments contributed as the primary factor to the steep fall in combined headline earnings and returns , which currently compare to 2012 levels . <p> Further , PwC finds that the robust capital and liquidity positions with which the major banks entered the crisis were maintained above regulatory required levels in 2020 , providing risk capacity and supporting their ability to navigate turbulent operating conditions . <p> Meanwhile , the analysis also notes bank 's " undeniable " flight of customer to digital and mobile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

That is tax . <p> A couple of points on tax on property which will help us : <p> Rental income from property is added to your taxable income . Depending on what tax rate you fall into , this will be the tax you pay on the rental income . Also , important to note that if you show more than R30,000 a year in rental profit ( income less expenses ) this may lead to you having to register for provisional tax . <p> On rental properties , the following are allowable expenses that can be used to deduct from your income .

You can offset the interest you are paying on the bonds linked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be less and pay less tax . <p> Based on this , I would recommend that you pay any spare cash into your primary residence bond ( Property 3 ) . The sooner you pay off the bond on your primary residence the better . There are no benefits in keeping a bond in place on a primary residence . <p> By paying more into your primary bond , you will free up some cash flow that you can use for other investments or just add to the extra into your bond every month . Your primary bond has one of the higher interest rates at 8% .

You can also cut all properties bond payments in half , and be half a payment " in front " of the debit orders , in this way you always are half a payment in credit , and you save on the interest at 8 or 7% , which no bank will give you for savings .

@@62789232 <p> South Africa 's supply of weapons and training to Mozambique is under scrutiny as violence increases in Cabo Delgado and the United Nations reports targeted attacks against civilians in Palma . <p> The insurgency in Mozambique began in 2017 and since then has killed thousands and displaced more than half a million . The Mozambican authorities have turned to South African private companies to assist with security , while the United States and Portugal have agreed to provide limited training . <p> Since April 2020 , Dyck Advisory Group ( DAG ) has been assisting the Mozambican police , and using light helicopters helped rescue many people from besieged Palma over the weekend . However , Amnesty International has accused it of indiscriminate attacks against civilians and its contract with Mozambique expires on 6 April . <p> Paramount Group is supplying a number of Marauder armoured personnel carriers to Mozambique as well as refurbished Mi-17 and Mi-24 helicopters and pilot training . <p> With regard to the weapons from South Africa being authorised by the South African government and Pretoria looking the other way regarding private military contractors , according to Khadija Sharife , Senior Editor for Africa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " unless a country is flagged by way of sanctions or other issues , arms trading is a largely private affair " . <p> Sharife said that " South Africa approved over half a billion rand in weapons exports to Mozambique during 2020 . The conflict in Cabo Delgado justifies the export as it does in many other countries where a sovereign government can claim they are under duress from non-governmental armed forces " . That , in her view , is " an old trick " . <p> She is not the only one who worries about the role that arms flows are playing in what can only be described as a rapidly deteriorating situation . Amnesty International 's newest report , released in March of this year , is focused on Mozambique . The global NGO , based in London , says that its researchers have found war crimes committed by three key actors : armed groups , government forces , and private military contractors .

" <p> Castner pointed out that " Paramount is active in Mozambique , providing armoured vehicles and helicopters to the army . There may be others , but this was not an object of our research . " He added that Amnesty does n't have specific evidence of specific South African weapons systems provided to the Mozambique government . <p> According to Dewa Mavhinga , Southern Africa Director at Human Rights Watch , his organization " is aware that officially , South African authorities announced last year that they are providing weaponry to Mozambique to help end the insurgency in Cabo Delgado province .

According to Mavhinga , support to Mozambique " should consider the need to protect civilians and prevent abuses and barbaric criminal acts . " <p> The South African National Defence Force does not appear to be involved in the conflict as Mozambique appears reluctant to call in international assistance , although this month the United States began a two-month training course for Mozambican forces , and Portugal has announced it will send 60 soldiers to Mozambique .

What happened in Palma is an absolute horror inflicted on civilians by a non-State armed group , " the OCHA 's Jens Laerke said . <p> " They have done horrific things , they are still doing so , we reported continued sporadic clashes and are talking about expectations of thousands moving from the Palma district to other areas of the country and toward the Tanzanian border .

The death toll is still unknown . Many foreigners were also attacked , which has led to heightened international attention to the crisis . <p> In its recent report detailing the atrocities committed by insurgents in Cabo Delgado , Amnesty International calls on the African Union ( AU ) to involve itself and help put an end to the human rights abuses . <p> It asks the AU 's Peace and Security Council ( PSC ) to meet urgently to discuss ways ' to assist the government of Mozambique and the Southern African Development Community ( SADC ) to put a stop to the continued violations of international human rights and humanitarian law .

None of the organisation 's 16 member states has made any significant moves to help address the situation either . <p> Apart from vague statements at summit meetings , SADC has n't responded to the crisis in Mozambique . <p> The Cabo Delgado crisis has escalated dramatically since the beginning of 2020 , with over 2 500 civilians killed and close to 700 000 people internally displaced . Witnesses report grave atrocities by Islamic State-linked insurgents . <p> Amnesty International says extremists have ' deliberately killed civilians , burned villages and towns , and committed heinous acts of violence with machetes , including numerous beheadings and desecration of corpses .

The United Nations ( UN ) has urged Mozambique to investigate . <p> The crisis has led multinational companies , such as Total , investing in massive gas projects in Cabo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investment in the gas projects and adjacent onshore infrastructure , which could benefit all of Southern Africa , is on hold due to rising insecurity . At best , most of the gas projects will continue but will be moved offshore with little job creation for locals . <p> The AU and its various organs are bound by the principle of subsidiarity , which compels it to defer to the eight regional economic communities and regional mechanisms in responding to regional conflicts . While this has its advantages , it 's been a major stumbling block to resolving some conflicts with continental efforts . This is especially true when regions are hamstrung by internal dynamics or institutional paralysis . <p> The AU has in various instances offered its assistance , but continues to defer to SADC . <p> SADC has insisted on upholding subsidiarity , notably when it comes to issues such as the crises in Lesotho , Zimbabwe and currently Mozambique . The AU has in various instances offered its help but continues to defer to SADC . <p> Besides holding summit meetings of the Organ on Politics , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , SADC has refrained from taking any action . Another summit scheduled for early 2021 in South Africa was postponed indefinitely . Meanwhile , Mozambique has accepted offers from the United States ( US ) and Portugal to help train troops to fight the insurgents . <p> On 11 March the US government officially designated the group , which it calls ISIS-Mozambique , as belonging to a Foreign Terrorist Organisation . This designation , which many analysts believe distracts attention from the fact that this is largely a group born out of local grievances , could theoretically help highlight the gravity of the situation and mobilise action in the region . <p> Despite the challenges posed by subsidiarity , the AU 's hands are n't completely tied . It has various tools and frameworks , and has established elaborate mechanisms to deal with grave peace and security threats in Africa . <p> Any AU action would send a signal to the people of Cabo Delgado that they have n't been forgotten . <p> Going forward , the situation must first be tabled for discussion at the PSC level , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a council member might be an obstacle , but the issue should be put on the agenda by the rotating chair of the month , given its severity . <p> The AU chair ( currently the Democratic Republic of the Congo ) could also request such a tabling , supported by the new Commissioner for Political Affairs , Peace and Security , Bankole Adeoye . Such a PSC meeting should result in a strong statement commensurate with the gravity of the situation , with clarity on the steps to be taken by the AU Commission in managing it . <p> Second , the PSC could conduct a fact-finding mission to Mozambique . This would highlight the issue and possibly prompt reaction from AU member states . Even if SADC does n't favour such a mission , there 's a precedent since the PSC visited Lesotho in 2018 to review the situation there . <p> Third , the AU could appoint a special envoy for Mozambique or mandate the AU special envoy on women , peace and security to investigate .

As happened with Burundi in 2015 , the PSC could use the findings to justify stronger action , despite SADC 's reluctance . This could include adopting punitive measures against perpetrators and facilitators of violence against women and children . <p> Fifth , the AU could use its convening power and mandate to organise joint statements or summit meetings with partners such as the European Union ( EU ) , US and UN to highlight the urgent need to take action . This would lend credibility to humanitarian and political interventions and promote greater African agency in relevant decisions . The AU could also request Mozambique 's government through dialogue and diplomatic channels to allow humanitarian organisations greater access to victims . <p> Finally , if Mozambique and its neighbours agree on a regional military intervention , the AU could be the lead organisation to coordinate such an action with its partners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mozambique is fairly new , and there 's been hesitation to label the insurgents as terrorists , even though other actors have clearly defined them as such .

Today , offshore exploration in the Cabo Delgado area includes Africa 's three largest LNG projects . These are the Mozambique LNG Project ( involving Total and previously Anadarko ) worth $20 billion ; the Coral FLNG Project ( involving Eni and Exxon Mobil ) worth $4.7 billion ; and the Rovuma LNG Project ( involving Exxon Mobil , Eni and CNPC ) worth $30 billion . <p> Production was scheduled to start @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Afungi peninsula are now posing serious challenges to the production time lines . <p> There have been no material benefits for the people of Cabo Delgado thus far .

@@62804238 <h> A ring of empowerment : The circus that teaches young people how to win at life <h> A Zambian circus group 's social initiatives could teach us all a lesson about the undervalued importance of play . <p> Gift Chansa grew up in Chibolya , a neighbourhood in Lusaka , Zambia , known as one of the roughest parts of the city . Stereotyped as a festering hub of crime and drug culture , Chansa 's childhood backdrop came with a lot of baggage . <p> According to Chansa , " If you come from Chibolya , then no one takes you seriously . " Few people in Lusaka would hire someone from Chibolya , and at job interviews Chansa and his friends used to say that they were from somewhere else , anywhere else . <p> " Sometimes though , " said Chansa , " you do n't think about it and you say , ' I am from Chibolya ' , and then people treat you different . You 're always pushed back and reminded where you come from . " <p> It 's a vicious cycle , almost impossible to escape . No one could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were to be no boundaries pushing him back , and nothing stopping him from bringing Chibolya along for the ride . <p> It was in the streets of Chibolya , about 16 years ago , that the seeds of Chansa 's incredible journey were sown . Having learnt how to do a perfect backflip simply through playing , a nine-year-old Chansa and his childhood pals put together an informal acrobatics group , and organised street competitions and shows that other kids from the neighbourhood would come and watch . <p> During one of these competitions , Chansa was scouted by Mr Kapota -- a minor celebrity ( and major personality ) in Lusaka at the time -- to be a part of an acrobatic group of young people called the African Dance Factory , started in 2005 . It was through this that he was introduced toBarefeet Theatre in 2006 , a performance group-come-grassroots initiative for underprivileged children in Lusaka . <p> Barefeet Theatre 's programming provided Chansa with the platform that he needed to soar . He was exposed to artists and academics from around the world , introduced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and given the responsibility of facilitating his own workshops and performances . Most importantly , he was provided with a safe space in which he could learn to trust and express himself . <p> Chansa and his friends spent almost every waking hour after school practising , competing , and showing off their moves . " It was a way of life , I would say . " There was no time outside of training to get dragged into harmful activities ( such as drugs , drinking , and quick money schemes ) to which teenagers are susceptible . <p> " I think , in a way , it protected us , because we always had something to do . " <p> By 2013 , Chansa had become a junior facilitator at Barefeet . He toured the world , performing in Ireland , Zimbabwe , China and many other countries . The performance group also helped him enroll in a circus school in the Netherlands , where , during his final performance , he had a revelation . <p> " I was amazed by how many people came to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oh , people want to see me do this , they want to see me in the circus . People actually appreciate this . " <p> Drummers . Photo by Atanga Mugandi , Uncoura photography . <p> At that moment Chansa knew that he wanted to bring the circus back to Chibolya , and to put on shows in the neighbourhood itself . <p> " That way people could come into the compound and see our shows and see that not all young people from there are criminals . There are also young people who need a chance . They need help to reach their full potential . " <p> And thus was the genesis ofCircus Zambia , what Chansa refers to as " a social enterprise that equips young people with circus , life skills , education support , and job opportunities " . <p> Co-founded in 2016 with Chansa 's childhood friends , Amos Malokwa and Bernard Kaumba , as well as Charlotte Groen from the Netherlands , Circus Zambia comprises two major parts . The first is the performance company ( the guys who are professional at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bodily feats executed by this group provide a substantial amount of the funding for the latter section of Circus Zambia : The Social Circus Hub . <p> The Social Circus Hub programme is designed to support the development of children from Chibolya and other underprivileged neighbourhoods in Lusaka . Healthy living , community building , and body contortions are all a part of the holistic curriculum , which is organised into three sections : Body , Mind , and Soul . <p> The Body section of the programme is the physical training . Chansa calls it the " roadmap for young people to learn how to be performers , how to do acrobatics , how to juggle , do a handstand , a backflip " . <p> Children enroll in the " Toes " level , then progress through " Knees , " " Shoulders , " and finally " Heads . " Once you are a " Head " you are a trained circus performer . Many of the programme 's graduates stay to be a part of Circus Zambia itself , while others join circus troupes elsewhere in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Circus is all about education . Circus Zambia provides money for about 100 children a year to attend local schools . The funding , when it does n't come directly from the revenue generated by the shows put on by the performance company , comes from international grants as well as local benefactors and campaigns on gofundme . The circus also has a library programme in which children are exposed to literature and are able to borrow books at any time . <p> The final section , Soul , is the real essence of the circus . It tackles issues that young people face in local communities , issues that are difficult to tackle within traditional social structures . <p> One such issue is that of safe sex . " It 's hard to talk about sex in Zambia , " Chansa told theThomson Reuters Foundation in 2018 , " nobody talks about sex . " This is a huge problem in a country that was so devastated by theAIDS epidemic in the early 2000s . <p> Gift Chansa aka Mwansa the clown . Image courtesy of Circus Zambia <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an attempt at talking about these issues in an entertaining way . Sponsored byMTV Staying Alive Foundation , the circus puts together hilarious shows and workshops that freely address the issues of STIs , safe sex , condoms , and the origins of HIV . The clowns are usually accompanied by members of the AIDS Healthcare Foundation , who provide testing and further educational literature on the subject . <p> Another issue that was tackled by the circus 's Soul programme was that of gender equality and women empowerment . A project named Pamodzi Ya Bakazi , sponsored by Danish companyCISU , featured performances that tackled some of the issues that women face . <p> The use of " clowning , " as Chansa refers to the humorous side of the circus , is essential in getting important messages across to both the members of the company and the audience . <p> " Fun is a good way to engage people because they 're watching you and they 're amazed . They 're happy . When we perform , we want people to have an experience , a memorable experience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are actually portraying . " <p> What could be more memorable than a man riding a unicycle juggling fire sticks , and then talking about sex ? <p> Fun and laughter are also therapeutic , says Chansa . We are so assailed with dreary stories , statistics , and troubling social realities that sometimes the only way to get things across is to feel better about them , " and when you laugh it 's infectious , because the person next to you will laugh , and the next person will feel the positivity " . <p> The Soul of the circus is " all about reaching out to young people and enabling them to become change-makers . Empowering them . Providing them with skills , soft skills in a way , so that they can reach their full potential , " Chansa explained . And , according to its own estimates , Circus Zambia has reached about 5,000 Zambian children per year since its establishment . <p> It 's fascinating that Circus Zambia has been so successful in these social initiatives , being that circuses have a historical reputation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vagabonds . Colloquially , one runs away to join the circus , they do n't return home and get social benefits from it . <p> But this very fact is one of the reasons that it works so well , Chansa explains . A group of outsiders is almost always an accepting one ; Circus Zambia aims to include children from all walks of life in its community . The circus is " not competitive , you work in an ensemble , as a team . When you 're developing something , you communicate and share ideas , and those are important things to learn for yourself . You learn to trust each other through the process of training . " <p> In the dog-eat-dog , late-capitalist , Covid-riddled world of today , an accepting community to bond and create with is a magical idea to anyone . But it 's paramount to the children of Chibolya , whose lives are in danger of falling back into the vicious cycle that coming from a rough neighbourhood implies . <p> Further , " when you perform , you express your feelings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accept you . That builds you , because you can progress and change ; you do n't stay the same person . " <p> Chansa elaborated on the confidence that this type of expression affords children , and how important it is to their development and growth . He talked about teaching young kids who learn circus tricks extremely quickly . <p> " Just realising that they can pick something up , that gives young people confidence ... young people , that when they came to Circus Zambia , they would n't even speak in front of anyone because they were so shy . But now they can stand up to me and say , ' What are you saying , Gift ? ' And that fuels you . You realise that they 've really grown , and they 're confident . And it 's because they stand in front of people and they perform and they 're interacting with different people in different ways . " <p> Joining the circus also teaches another invaluable lesson , one that 's needed to succeed in life : discipline . Chansa , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm disciplined enough , I can achieve what I want through what I do , because in order for us to put up a performance we need to practise and train . What the audience sees is just the end-product that we have put so much time into creating , rehearsing , and perfecting . " <p> It 's the same sentiment that he wants to impart to the young members of Circus Zambia , " that discipline of when you drop something , you pick it up , you try again , you keep going " . It 's a trust in oneself , a confidence that through discipline and determination you can do things you thought impossible , a practice-makes-perfect mentality , that Chansa wishes to ( and does ) impart to the young members of Circus Zambia . <p> Part of growing this confidence is the acceptance of fear as an innate reality of life , but also as something that can be overcome . Children experience " the danger that goes in to performing , the fears we have before we perform . What might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that even with hours and hours of practice , things go wrong , because life is unpredictable , and that 's okay . It 's about embracing fear , regarding it as a challenge to rise up to , rather than something to run away from . <p> The realities of Covid-19 have hit Circus Zambia hard . Their year of touring around the world was put to a stop , and many of their projects that required larger gatherings of children are obviously no longer safe to carry out . <p> " We 're surviving , " Chansa responded to a question about how Circus Zambia was doing . Just as he had learnt to embrace the fear and danger of circus performance , he has accepted the challenge of this new reality . <p> " It just made me realise that , okay , we 're taking a risk , we are always taking a risk . And I think it 's what we do best . And because of this I think we will survive .

In 2015 , shop stewards led a walkout at the hospital 's monthly transformation unit meeting and accused the appellant of acting " like a dictator " , declaring that they refused to recognise him as CEO or to deal with him in any manner . <p> An invitation from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a petition calling for his removal or resignation . <p> On 25 January 2016 , staff went on an unlawful picket at the hospital . A week later , Walsh was assaulted at the hospital . The department obtained an interdict in February 2016 to stop the unions from " threatening , harassing and intimidating employees and approaching the hospital ... save for the tendering of services " . <p> More meetings and more demands for Walsh 's removal from the hospital followed . Denosa then threatened Walsh and other members of his management team with forceful removal . <p> The department then appointed an advocate to investigate the complaints and allegations against Walsh . <p> In her report , Amelia da Silva wrote : " I could not find fault with the management style at Fort England Hospital . The lack of communication between management and the labour force appears to have originated from a time when the workforce stopped attending meetings after November 2015 . The reason for the withdrawal of the workforce is that management took decisions without consultation and the workforce subsequently felt marginalised and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consulting the labour force ... It is my finding that there is no merit in the accusation from the labour force , represented by the labour unions that management failed to consult with them in respect of certain categories stipulated by the Labour Relations Act . " <p> The unions then rejected Da Silva 's report , threatening to make the hospital ungovernable and burn it down if Walsh did not leave . <p> On 18 July 2016 , 15 employees led by shop stewards entered the wards , offices and support unit armed with sticks and other instruments , intimidating staff and ordering them to leave their work stations . About 15 employees then gathered on the central sports field and marched to the main administration building . <p> Mbengashe admitted in his affidavit before the court that " it has always been at the back of my mind that the situation at Fort England hospital is unhealthy , especially the interruption of health services which compromised patient care " . <p> Eventually , Walsh was told that he had no choice but to transfer to Bhisho . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Despite a letter from 11 doctors in support of Walsh , Mbengashe then wrote to Walsh asking him to leave the hospital for three weeks " to allow the situation to return to normal " . <p> In August 2016 , a second inquiry was held into complaints against Walsh . This report too found no evidence of harassment , inconsistency and noncompliance with the leave policy ; nor evidence to substantiate the allegation that the implementation of hourly leave does not apply to members of management . The report further stated that allegations of poor management and negligence that had affected patients could not be verified . <p> The only adverse finding in the report was that Walsh did not consult managers about changes that affected their respective divisions . <p> This report further stated that Walsh 's approach was too " high-handed , autocratic and did not foster or encourage a good working relationship with staff and unions . From the interviews with the staff , it is clear that this was brought to his attention previously where he had committed to change , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so and has since lost the trust and respect of staff ... It is on the above basis and for his safety sake that our recommendation is that the department should consider an appropriate leadership development intervention and implementing an improvement plan or consider transferring the CEO to another facility " , the report added . <p> In a subsequent meeting , Walsh was then told that he could return to the hospital " with the understanding that the department is unable to guarantee his safety as there is a standoff and the union indicated they do not want the CEO back at Fort England . The CEO was also asked to guarantee that services will not be disrupted and that if such disruption occurs for more than three working days , the CEO will have to be reassigned elsewhere within the department " . <p> In November 2016 , Walsh was told that his " plan of action " had not delivered the desired effect and he should accept a transfer to the Elizabeth Donkin Hospital in Gqeberha/Port Elizabeth or a relocation to the position of health economist in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for Walsh to return to the hospital . The next month , Mbengashe said that he did not support Walsh 's return to Fort England and that " it was important for the department to take appropriate steps in the public interest to ensure that Fort England is a stable function institution that provides quality health services to the people of the Eastern Cape " . <p> Walsh declined the offers of relocation . <p> In March 2017 , he received a letter from the Department of Health stating that it had discovered that he had been " overpaid " for four years and that he had to repay them R2-million . His salary would be reduced by 40% . <p> Eventually , Walsh was told that he had no choice but to transfer to Bhisho . When he refused he was dismissed for being absent from work . <p> " When the evidence is taken as a whole , it is correct , as the department observes that there can be no suggestion that its actions were motivated by bias or malice . But if the department was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the hospital , then to allow violent , illegal conduct to trump the constitutional obligations owed by the state to patients requiring healthcare can never be conducted in the public interest . <p> " In their view , the continuation of Walsh as the CEO at the hospital would not have promoted the general welfare of the patients . But that is to allow anarchy to prevail ; so long as illegal conduct can be sustained , it must follow that thuggish behaviour that , in this case , compromised the health of vulnerable patients totally dependent on the state to vindicate their right to healthcare must triumph . <p> " The evidence indicates that at most , 50 individuals were involved in the sustained illegal conduct , and in a number of instances , there were no more than 15 employees who were the cause of the disruption . <p> " It can not be in the public interest to have preferred illegality over the obligation to provide efficient and effective health care to those in need , " Judge Davis wrote .

@@62804240 <h> Opinionista* Ismail Lagardien * 6 April 2021 <h> Memory is a weapon , but wilful forgetting is deadlier , and a greater threat to South Africa <h> Threats by the EFF-RET axis to shut down the country , the proliferation of paramilitary groups , comical and sartorially laughable as they may be , represent an absence of memory at the best of times and , at the worst of times , a case of wilful forgetting . <p> Some of my research , mainly interviews and meetings that the lockdown of last March cut short , focused on memory . I focused on the lack of memory and the wilful unremembering that define the rhetoric of the Economic Freedom Fighters ( EFF ) who , for all intents and purposes , now share ideological solidarities with the Radical Economic Transformation ( RET ) crowd . Each of the two main axis members has its respective band of corpulent cadres in ill-fitting polyester camouflage uniforms that , for now , make a greater contribution to the performance arts than they represent any serious and well-drilled military formation . Theatrical as it may seem , this RET-EFF Axis -- with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dyspepsia -- does , nonetheless , pose a great threat to South Africa , one that has to be avoided at all costs . <p> Back at the start of last year , I had already done the theoretical and ( global ) historical research , but needed to get back to the youths I had met in the Eastern Cape and Limpopo , and in archival material in Gauteng to get some firm evidence . As for most of the EFF Student Command whom I spoke to , their response to my questions about the political settlement of the 1990s was met with a shrug of the shoulders . Some of them had not been born , yet . Others were too young to remember .... <p> So , my particular focus was on the young people who supported the EFF , and their very short memories , or a complete absence of just how violent the decades before 1994 were , and how close South Africa came to descending into a bloodbath . Consistent with populist rhetoricians , the older ones , who were little nippers in 1990 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confabulation , and spinning romantic , revolutionary rhetoric yarns around higgledy-piggledy arranged nails of uninspired works of string art . They threaten to take the country back to a time of violence , and the edge of state collapse that we verged on from 1985 , from which the Mandela administration pulled us back . <p> Bloodbaths , necklaces and decapitations <p> The decade between 1985 and 1995 , that period that is either unknown or wilfully unremembered by the axis members , was marked by gruesome violence . The cause of much of the carnage that most veteran journalists covered -- I started covering it more intensely after the first State of Emergency was declared in 1985 , as a photojournalist and reporter -- was mainly between " factions " . It was a clash perceived to be between the United Democratic Front/ANC and Inkatha , with the apartheid state 's security forces ( the South African Defence Force and South African Police ) playing deadly roles in fomenting violence . <p> We are at a point now when factions in the ANC , the loose affiliation of Radical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toy soldiers ) have threatened to shut down South Africa , and somehow return to the trenches ( my interpretation ) . Briefly stated , to the extent that it 's reasonable to connect the individual world of the Umkhonto weSizwe Military Veterans Association and EFF paramilitarism to broader social structures -- in other words they are a social group rather than a military organisation -- they embody all the pathologies of a dysfunctional state hollowed out by corruption and maladministration , a ruling elite characterised by greed and avarice , and a society at odds with itself in which everyone wants to get as much out of the system as possible before it all collapses . <p> Anyway , rhetorically , and to the extent that they have a strategic plan or an objective , the axis ( and their silent supporters ) seem unhappy that white , or " non-African blacks " have any kind of presence ; that whites somehow continue to manipulate Africans , and control South Africa 's purse strings , and that the political settlement of the 1990s , and the Constitution are to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's worth , there 's a homology in there about the way that Benito Mussolini used the Italian Constitution to gain access to power , and once he came to power he effectively redrew the rules , and turned himself into a dictator . Recall that Malema used the Constitution to get rid of Jacob Zuma , but , like Mussolini , used it only to serve his own ends -- which was to gain power . <p> Malema ( on Codesa and the Constitution ) , echoes Mussolini and his fascist mate Adolf Hitler who condemned the political settlement at Versailles -- because Hitler claimed it was an insult to the German people . These were some of the early parallels I established in my original research , in the weeks before South Africa shut down last March . It is worth understanding the historic contexts , and situating the RET-EFF Axis , also , in South Africa 's immediate history . <p> Absence of memory and wilful forgetting <p> Much like the organic fascists of the 1920s , Malema has a venomous ( mis ) understanding of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ People like Ace Magashule and Carl Niehaus should remember , but they do n't . This suggests that they share a scorched-earth approach to South Africa 's future . Threats by the axis to shut the country down , the proliferation of paramilitary groups , comical and sartorially laughable as they may be at times , represent an absence of memory , at the best of times , and at the worst of times , a case of wilful forgetting . <p> Some of us who worked as journalists between 1985 and 1995 bore witness to horrific carnage . In 2017 I was diagnosed with PTSD . I was haunted by images of burning bodies -- one was of a woman being necklaced while heavy rocks were dropped on the head of her dead body -- of sliced faces and limbs . ( In Sekhukhune I came close to being necklaced myself . ) We remember , today , the violence around South Africa and in neighbouring states . <p> Every week we witnessed death and destruction of families and communities ( and individuals ) , in Soweto , Sebokeng @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and at men 's hostels in Jeppe , Mpetla , Jabulani , Nancefield , Denver , George Goch , at places like Morafe and Mzimhlope . <p> The concept of " fake news " has become commonplace today . And it is difficult , nigh impossible , to believe what any politician says , but we had to deal with misinformation and manipulation of the media during that deadly decade . One leaflet was distributed in black townships in the winter of 1990 , and later identified as part of a " classic destabilisation tactic " used by security forces at the time . The pamphlet called on Zulu people to vacate hostels in the old Transvaal , and return to Natal . The pamphlet also instructed ANC supporters to " attack Zulu-speakers and destroy their homes and property " . The appeal also cited meetings held to incite Inkatha supporters to violence against fellow hostel dwellers and township residents in hostels in and around the East Rand and Soweto . The pamphlet read : <p> " We want to destroy the Zulus . We want to drive them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We should cause conflict amongst them , so that we can take the land , while they are still fighting . We have to end their Zuluness of which they are proud about it sic . They deceive themselves as a powerfull sic nation which will take over after De Klerk . There will be no peace in S.A. as long as the Zulus are still powerfull sic . Let us destroy them all in S.A. in townships , hostels , and in the working places . Let us burn down their houses in townships and drive them out . Down with Zulus . " ( See this link ) <p> On one occasion I photographed Bishop Desmond Tutu saving a man 's life . A crowd was about to necklace the man because he was accused of being a spy . In the deadly decade of 1985 to 1995 , we had no time to look for villains . Every day we walked through pools of blood , stepping over severed limbs scattered across killing fields , with bodies piling up from Boipatong and Bisho to Crossroads and Kagiso @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SADF raids on " terrorists " . <p> The violence of the 1980s continued into the 1990s . In September 1990 armed gangs massacred 26 commuters on a train between Soweto and Johannesburg . It was considered at the time that the silence of the killers and their style of attack was " similar to that of rebels of the Mozambique National Resistance ( Renamo ) " , which led to speculation that white security officials were instrumental in the attack . <p> Violence continued after April 1994 . An estimated 1,600 people were killed in political violence in 1994 , and 837 in 1995 . Some 500,000 were displaced from their homes -- about 6% of the population of the province . <p> South Africa , and its future , were held hostage by its own people . The National Party would not relinquish control easily . The police and defence force were backing factions in the battles between the UDF/ANC and Inkatha . The ANC , the Pan Africanist Congress , Azapo all had " military wings " . The far-right AWB was threatening to take the country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be their land and their culture . All the while " the economy " was in meltdown .... <p> It was against this backdrop that decisions were made , that compromises were reached ( for what it 's worth , Malema having tea with Jacob Zuma , whom he helped depose , was a compromise ) , and a democratic order was established . The warring factions laid down their arms ( most of them , anyway ) , and the job of completing the Constitution took on an urgency . And when it was completed , and adopted by Parliament , it effectively drew a line under the cruelties of the past . To be sure , the structural injustices of the preceding era remain , and they may , for a while yet , be felt among the most marginalised of people . The Constitution is not to blame for this , much like the Constitution of Rwanda was not responsible for the genocide , nor is the Constitution of Nepal to blame for the rampant poverty in that country . <p> The young people and the adults @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not know , or refuse to accept the conditions and multiplicity of contexts that threatened to destroy South Africa during that deadly decade .

But as Sam Wilson discovers in Episode 2 , the same government that created Captain America has some skeletons in its closet , and one of them is named Isaiah Bradley ( played by Carl Lumbly ) -- a Black Captain America who also received the super soldier serum , or a version of it , as an attempt to recapture the success of Project Rebirth .

ByJessica Tennant <h> Subscribe to industry newsletters <h> The duty to report suspected fraud and the consequences thereof <p> Section 34 of the Prevention and Combating of Corrupt Activities Act , 2004 ( PRECCA ) places a duty on defined persons in a position of authority ( i.e. director , manager , chief executive officer ) to report certain offences over R100,000 . <p> In terms of section 34(1) of PRECCA , any person who holds a position of authority , who knows or ought reasonably to have known or suspected that any other person has committed an offence in terms of sections 3 to 16 or 20 to 21 of PRECCA or theft , fraud , extortion , forgery or uttering of a forged document involving an amount of R100,000 or more , must report such knowledge or suspicion or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ police official . The failure to report is an offence . We are of the view that the duty to report does not include self-incrimination , as if it did , it would violate the right to silence . <p> There is a difference in views as to whether persons who hold a position of authority have a duty to report a specified crime committed by any person or committed by a person falling within the sphere of relationship relevant to the person 's position of authority . The one view is that the section does not limit the scope as it refers to any other person . The other view is that it must be restrictively interpreted as a failure to report constitutes an offence . <p> Further , there is no general duty to report outside statutory dictates ( unless the person is a law enforcement officer ) and it makes no sense to extend such a duty to demand on a person who holds a position of authority to even report a specified offence unrelated to the holding of the position of authority . <p> The Directorate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then decide to elevate the investigation to a full criminal investigation . It is only when a decision has been taken to proceed with a criminal investigation that the National Prosecuting Authority will determine whether there is a sufficient case to prosecute premised on reasonable and probable cause to believe that a fraud has been committed . <p> Naturally of concern is that it may be found after a criminal investigation that the accused and/or the companies are innocent or the National Prosecuting Authority may elect not to prosecute the matter which may lead to the accused proceeding with a case of malicious prosecution/defamation against the reporting party . <p> Malicious prosecution consists of the wrongful and intentional setting of the law in motion . In Canelli v Canelli and Others ( 3 February 2021 ) , the Supreme Court of Appeal ( SCA ) reaffirmed the requirements for a malicious prosecution claim , being that to succeed with such a claim , a claimant must allege and prove that : <p> The defendant set the law in motion ( instigated or instituted the proceedings ) ; <p> The defendant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acted with malice ( the wrongful intention to defame or injure another 's reputation or personality ) ; and <p> The prosecution failed . <p> The laying of a criminal charge against an individual is one of the main ways to jump start South Africa 's criminal justice processes . The difficulty of this process comes in where the charge in question is made falsely and with malice . However , the duty to report in terms of section 34(1) of PRECCA is not a criminal complaint to set the law in motion but rather compliance with a statutory duty to report . <p> Accordingly , reasonable grounds to suspect that fraud has been committed must exist . The reporting statement must , as an example , not state that fraud was perpetrated but that reasonable grounds exist to suspect that fraud has been committed . Unless the allegations are frivolous and malicious with the intent to injure a person , reporting in terms of PRECCA is not a request to prosecute or to set a prosecution in motion but rather , a statutory duty to report as PRECCA places @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to report , inter alia , a reasonable suspicion of theft , fraud , extortion , forgery or uttering of a forged document involving an amount of R100,000 . <h> About the author <p> LEGAL DISCLAIMER : This Message Board accepts no liability of legal consequences that arise from the Message Boards ( e.g. defamation , slander , or other such crimes ) .

Archive photo : John Yeld <p> Last year , Caruso stepped down as executive chairperson of Mineral Commodities Ltd ( MRC ) , after being arrested on charges of aggravated home burglary and assault , but he retained his position of chief executive . <p> Caruso 's firing was announced in a short statement by MRC on 25 March . <p> On 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had his licence suspended . <p> Caruso and MRC , which is listed on the Australian Securities Exchange , are two of three plaintiffs in a R14.25m defamation case being brought in the Western Cape High Court against three environmental lawyers , two community activists and a social worker .

The third plaintiff is one of the company 's South African black empowerment partners . <p> MRC said the decision to fire Caruso was " a result of a breakdown in the relationship between the board and Mr Caruso , following commencement of enquiries into a potential related party matter " , but it gave no further details . <p> " Those enquiries are ongoing and the company is unable to provide further detail at this time .

She specialises ... <p> Last updated on Feb 17th , 2021 at 08:45 am <p> If you 're a first-time parent , caring for your baby can feel quite daunting as there are so many factors to take note of . <p> The good news is , most newborn babies whose basic needs are met , are generally healthy , and not every cry is worth worrying about . Luckily , there are only a handful of newborn health concerns that require medical care and attention . <h> Breathing changes <p> According to Stanford Children 's Health , babies breathe much faster than older children and adults , and this is completely normal . Periodic breathing , where your little one might take a few quick breathes , followed by a few slow ones , is also normal . <p> However , if your newborn is grunting often and struggling to take in air , or you notice that your baby is using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to suck in a lot of air while trying to breathe , then you should see your doctor immediately , says Ann . <h> Standford Children 's Health also outline the following breathing problems to take note of : <p> Coughing <p> Occasionally , coughing or choking may occur when a baby takes in milk too quickly during a feed . Persistent coughing or choking may indicate a breathing problem , or a problem with digestion that should be examined . <p> Continuous rapid or slow breathing <p> Rapid breathing that 's more than 60 breaths each minute is a sign of a problem . Also , breathing that stops for longer than 20 seconds , called apnoea , can be a serious issue that requires medical attention . <p> We know that babies struggle to regulate their body temperature and can lose heat rapidly if not dressed correctly -- especially after a bath .

This means it will naturally be more sensitive to climate changes or the type of washing powder you use etc . This might result in the occasional skin rash or irritation . <p> However , if you notice that your newborn 's skin ( or white of her eyes ) is looking yellow , especially after a week or so after birth , it 's important to take her to the doctor immediately .

@@62838232 <h> Investing offshore can bring benefits <p> An increasing number of South Africans have started to physically transfer some of their wealth offshore . Although investing offshore is not necessarily always a one-way bet , there are a number of good reasons as to why people should consider investing offshore . These include a wider range of investment opportunities abroad , the weakening of the rand and political instability .

@@62841234 <p> It is sometimes said that : " If you ca n't convince them , confuse them ! " . Nowhere is this more apparent than the minefield which is antenna datasheets and brochures . <p> Direction finding antennas are meant to be instrumental in accurately determining the direction of an incoming signal , that much we all agree on . One would thus think that a graph of accuracy vs frequency would be very obvious and clear measure of how well an antenna will do its job , and you would be very wrong . Welcome to the world of specmanship . <p> Specmanship is the nefarious use of data to present to the customer what he wants or expects to see , rather than what is true . It is quite possible to present antenna performance figures , like ' accuracy ' in this case , in a way that looks fantastic on paper , but will fail to live up to the customer expectations in real life applications . This blog post will attempt to delve into the world of DF antenna accuracy to explain how it should be interpreted in the context of real-world applications @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generate the accuracy plot of a DF antenna , we generate a mathematical model of the antenna , and transmit a hypothetical signal to the antenna from a specific angle of incidence . The antenna ( and its associated DF algorithm ) will then receive this signal and calculate the angle from which it believes the signal is coming . If we do this for each direction while moving around the antenna , we can calculate an average ( or RMS ) error , taking into account incoming signals from all directions . This RMS error , plotted over frequency , is the typical ' accuracy ' plot that you will find in many DF antenna datasheets . Simple enough , right ? <p> Well , not quite . The accuracy with which a DF antenna can estimate the direction of an incoming signal is dependent on a whole bunch of different factors . An accuracy plot without stating the underlying assumptions really provides very little information indeed . Let us consider a few factors that will influence the accuracy of a DF antenna . The beam-widths of antennas are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within 3dB of the maximum gain in the main lobe . It is often useful to also find the angle of the first null in the pattern . <p> Noise and signal level <p> The first , and most obvious parameter , is the signal level ( or more accurately , the strength of the electric field ) of the incoming signal . The incoming E-field needs to be large compared to the noise level , else the antenna/algorithm will have no way of extracting the signal of interest from the background noise . <p> As an analogy , suppose someone in the room is trying to get your attention at a dinner party . The person will need to shout louder than the average ' noisiness ' created by all the other people at the party in order for you to differentiate that person 's voice above the others . <p> When trying to attract someone 's attention at a rock concert , however , you will have to shout much , much louder to get the same effect . Trying to determine your friend 's location by listening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do than at a dinner party . The same principle applies in DF systems . <p> In the example above , we used a hypothetical 8-element DF antenna and calculated the DF accuracy for incoming signals with a Signal-to-Noise ratio ( SNR ) of 5dB ( loud rock concert ) and 20dB ( dinner party ) respectively . As we suspected , when our signal of interest is barely stronger than the noise floor ( SNR=5dB ) , the DF antenna/algorithm will make many estimation errors and will only be accurate to within about 20 ? or so . The very same antenna , given a nice strong signal ( SNR=20dB ) , is however capable of achieving accuracies of way better than 1 ? . <p> Antenna manufacturers will sometimes publish accuracy plots like these labeled as " large-signal accuracy " , indicating that the plot assumes zero ( or very low ) noise levels . This accuracy provides information about the array layout , size and a couple other more esoteric features of the antenna . While this information is extremely useful for the antenna engineer during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about how well the antenna will perform in the real world , mainly because of the following two factors that are cleverly ( and sneakily ) ' omitted ' . <p> The accuracy calculated from the SNR excludes the gain of the antenna elements . SNR is a measurement taken at the radio interface , assuming the signal was already received on the antenna . You can achieve a good SNR on a poor antenna by blasting it with an extremely strong signal . Likewise , and desirably , a good antenna element should be able to provide a decent SNR given a relatively weak signal . <p> The accuracy is also dependent on the algorithm used for direction finding . Certain algorithms ( like pure Watson-Watt or interferometry ) can introduce ' bias ' errors , which is caused by applying a mathematical model that assumes a perfect antenna pattern to a ' real-life ' antenna which has patterns that may deviate from the ideal . The plots above make use of a correlative algorithm which has pre-knowledge of the antenna imperfections and can compensate for these during the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ detail in part 3 of this series . Accuracy plots should thus always be interpreted in the context of the algorithm used and should explicitly declare the algorithm used to generate the plot . <p> DF Antenna Sensitivity <p> To address problem 1 from the previous section , the performance of a DF antenna can be expressed in terms of its sensitivity to electric fields . Given that a typical DF antenna , using a correlative algorithm , is capable of sub-one-degree accuracy when the SNR is high , we can choose to calculate the incoming E-field strength that will generate a given SNR , or alternatively , the E-field strength that will produce a given RMS accuracy . <p> The advantage of using a sensitivity plot as a performance metric for a DF antenna is that it includes the gain of the antenna elements , and thus provides information about how good the individual antenna elements are , in addition to the overall layout of the array . Expressing the performance of a DF antenna in terms of its sensitivity also provides a much clearer indication of how well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With all other things being equal ( same receiver system , same incoming signal ) , a DF antenna with better sensitivity will achieve better real-life accuracies than an antenna with lower sensitivity . The large-signal accuracy does not provide this straightforward equivalence to real-life performance without significant interpretation . <p> As an example , consider the calculated E-field sensitivity for the same antenna considered in the previous section . <p> This plot indicates the electric field strength required to achieve a SNR of 15dB ( blue line ) and the E-field strength required to achieve an RMS error of 2 ? or better . This plot allows the customer to directly evaluate whether this antenna is appropriate for the type of signals expected in their specific application . Notice however , that these plots also require several assumptions ( like the channel bandwidth and noise figure of the system ) , and these should be stated explicitly . <p> As is the case for large-signal accuracy , this plot is only valid for correlative algorithms and will differ significantly when used with other types of algorithms . <p> Given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ metric of DF antenna performance , most Alaris Antenna brochures will publish sensitivity plots rather than accuracy plots . <p> Part 2 of this series will consider the factors that influence the accuracy and sensitivity of DF antennas , while part 3 will delve more deeply into the nuances of characterization measurements as it applies to correlative algorithms .

@@62851240 <h> Most Read <h> Most Read <h> Are vaccines variant-proof ? <h> Speedy inoculation programmes will help in the fight against variants <p> 19 April 2021 - 18:00 Sam Fazeli <p> Picture : 123RF/CHAYATORN LAORATTANAVECH <p> Science has delivered incredible achievements in the fight against Covid-19 , not least of which is the swift development of several effective vaccines . The question is : will the shots continue to offer strong protection even as the SARS-CoV-2 virus mutates and evolves ? <p> We 've already seen virus variants sprout up , from B.1.1.7 in the UK to B.1.351 in SA and P.1 in Brazil . Now we have B.1.617 in India and two variants -- B.1.429 and B.1.232 -- in California . Some of these variants have been found to be more contagious and potentially deadlier than the original strain , and more variants are sure to arise in any country or region where the virus is left to multiply and infect people at a high rate . Even in places where the virus seems to be under control , variants are a worry . In Israel , there have been reports of " breakthrough " infections among vaccinated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big concerns . <p> But there are hopeful signs that vaccine science is staying ahead of the variants in the most important ways . <p> First , good news regarding potential booster shots . A recent study found that a new vaccine targeting the spike protein -- the rod-like structure on the surface of the virus -- of the SA variant induced a strong immune response in non-human primates that had been previously vaccinated against the older virus strain . Moderna has also noted , though not published data , that its new mRNA-1273.351 vaccine was able to boost the immune response of previously vaccinated animals to provide increased activity against the B.1.351 variant . <p> These two studies address a main concern about the risk of " original antigenic sin " -- that is , that a new vaccine against a slightly different virus variant might induce an immune reaction against the original version of the virus rather than the variant it was targeting . While we need to see data from a human study , which Moderna could have sometime in the second quarter , these results suggest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should we need one . <p> As for existing vaccines , promising new data suggests that the shot now in use from Pfizer and BioNTech is effective in protecting against variants . Results from a small SA trial of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine showed 100% efficacy against the B.1.351 variant . Though based on only a few cases , it showed that none of those who were vaccinated as part of the trial tested positive , compared with nine who contracted the virus while taking a placebo ( six of whom contracted the SA variant ) . <p> It 's possible that the vaccinated group did n't encounter the virus and a lot more cases are needed to draw a firm conclusion , but this early data suggests the efficacy against this variant is robust . This may explain why Pfizer and BioNTech have decided to use their original vaccine as a third booster , if it proves necessary , and not develop a shot using the spike protein from the B.1.351 variant . <p> But what about that news from Israel about breakthrough infections ? In a nutshell , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already knew that the vaccines ca n't stop all infections . We also knew from several studies by different groups that the B.1.351 variant is not as susceptible to the antibodies generated by the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna vaccines as the ancestral versions of the virus are . So infections in vaccinated people in areas where the variant is circulating would be more likely to be by the B.1.351 variant than not . But while people may get infected by variants despite being vaccinated , the critical point is whether they develop anything but mild symptoms . <p> What we truly care about is severe Covid-19 disease and hospitalisations . If all the infected individuals had only mild symptoms or none at all , then that actually proves the point : the vaccine is doing its job in preventing severe disease and hospitalisations . This appears to be the case . <p> This is not to suggest that we stop worrying about variants . There needs to be much more genomic sequencing across the world to ensure we are on top of any changes in the virus . But we need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at high levels . Having a fully vaccinated population significantly reduces its chances of doing that . What we do need to do is to get vaccines faster to the nations that can not afford them . <p> * Fazeli is senior pharmaceuticals analyst for Bloomberg Intelligence and director of research for EMEA.

The immediate focus for He and his team is on the company 's data centre infrastructure . To date , the company has four points of presence across Africa , with two in South Africa ( Johannesburg ) , and one each in Nigeria and Kenya . <p> " We will look to increase the number of these data centre 's as the demand for cloud services grows .

We have already seen aspects of this come to the fore , with its own mobile operating system tackling the issue of smartphones on the consumer side of things , and more recently in securing its supply chains to ensure that it can keep its global operations finely tuned . <p> " With better solutions for these issues , I believe the South African cloud market will be one of the biggest . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New technologies will be integrated into all aspects of our lives .

He specifically noted that " if Cloud fails , Huawei dies , " to emphasise the importance of this division . When we pressed him to unpack that rather salacious wording further , he explained that this was his opinion and not an official Huawei statement . <p> He added that Cloud will prove a key pillar for the company moving forward , and potentially means more to the business right now than 5G does .

@@62859230 <h> Nier Replicant ver.1.22474487139 ... - Review <h> B4 2B <p> I missed out on Nier when it first arrived in 2010 , so my experience going into Nier Replicant Ver . 1.22474487139 was a fresh one . I find myself rather thankful for that because if there 's one thing you need to know going into this new version of creative director Yoko Taro 's bold , genre-bending action-RPG , it 's that you can expect to revisit the same places , fighting the same enemies , and pushing the same godforsaken boxes around a lot . It 's one of the bigger issues with Nier , but the important thing to note is that the ways in which Nier Replicant disappoints are mostly forgivable when you consider the ways in which it astounds : Surprises await around every corner , characters are unforgettable , and the emotional story will resonate in my mind for a long , long time . <p> Ver . 1.22 ( for the sake of my own sanity , I 'm just going to round down from here on out ) is in a strange place of being more than just a remaster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looks much better when compared to the muddy original , with dramatically improved draw distances , cleaner textures , better character models , and a consistently smooth 60fps framerate . At the same time , though , it still gives off that PS3/360-era RPG vibe : environments lack detail , NPCs are stiff and just kind of stare lifelessly into the void , the world is broken up into small chunks with loading screens bridging the gaps , and there are no current-gen console enhancements for the PS5 or Xbox Series X. It certainly is n't an ugly game anymore by any standard , but it also still feels a step behind 2017 's Nier Automata . <p> However , one big change , and one of the reasons why I think it 's impossible to label this just as a remaster , is the fact that every character is now voiced . This is a huge improvement that goes a long way in bringing Nier 's otherwise-sleepy world to life . <p> Beyond the visuals and voice acting , Nier 's combat also has seen some love , smoothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nier Automata 's . One of the big things that was taken from Automata is the seamless integration of weapon combat with your skills . So where in the original you had to sit still while you charge a spell like Dark Lance , now you can pretty freely move around and charge any spell , as well as cast them while attacking . That all makes combat behave much more like a traditional action game and goes a long way in improving the actual feel of Nier 's combat . <p> That said , it is still pretty shallow and easy . You never gain new sword skills , rank and file enemies come in only a handful of types that all quickly succumb to your button-mashy attacks , and I was always swimming in health restoratives , which took almost all tension out of every fight . Eventually , the challenge became more about finding the right combination of magic and sword combat to see how quickly I could clear a room , instead of being a test of whether I could clear it at all . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certainly is flashy and fun to look at , but it did get pretty stale before I finished my 35-hour playthrough . Yes , there is a hard mode , but it mostly just makes the enemies into frustrating sword sponges that still are n't difficult but just take forever to kill , especially in the early parts when you do n't have access to stronger weapons . <p> On the plus side , there are three different weapon classes with pretty distinct fighting styles and move lists . There 's a caveat to enjoying all of them , though , in that upgrading the weapons within those classes is very expensive and requires a lot of grinding . Unless you want to spend even more hours in the Junk Heap farming robots , you 're encouraged to pick one and stick with it . <p> There 's also a small element of playstyle customization in the form of upgrades called words that you collect as you level up and defeat enemies . These words can be added to weapons , spells , and your defensive techniques to add special @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ break , magic power , and so on . While being able to tailor your character by swapping words in and out is a welcome feature , I never felt any sort of need to customize my weapons or abilities in any sort of way other than just equipping whatever words that gave me the most damage on whatever I had equipped , because the combat scenarios never challenged me in any ways that required me become more specialized . <p> What saves it from becoming outright dull are the ways in which Nier Replicant throws you into its combat encounters , which vary wildly . It masterfully plays with camera angles and perspective shifts in some truly inspired ways , and those do a great job of alleviating at least some of that feeling of repetition . <h> A Post-Apocalyptic Fantasy <p> Nier 's story starts slow , but ultimately becomes the absolute best part . It takes place in a post-apocalyptic fantasy world in which a teenager named Nier ( or whatever you choose to name him ) sets out to find a cure for his sister , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's a deeply personal story ; one about a brother 's love for his sister much more so than any sort of grander ambitions to save the world , which is one of the more intriguing aspects about it as an RPG . Nier and his companions are not " chosen heroes of light " or anything of the sort , and the actions that they take very often fall into a morally gray territory -- and sometimes they push the needle somewhere even darker . <p> It 's a credit to the strength of Nier Replicant 's writing and the performances of its cast that , regardless of how dark or grim things get , its characters are always a joy to be around . The snooty sentient floating book Grimoire Weiss is endlessly entertaining with his condescending commentary on whatever 's happening ; the scantily clad and foul-mouthed Kain ? is just an absolute badass and is hilarious in her vulgarity ; and Emil is just the purest and most kindhearted floating skeleton with a creepy head you 'll ever see . <h> The soundtrack is just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remiss to leave out the hauntingly beautiful soundtrack . Like Nier Automata 's , it 's composed by Keiichi Okabe and features the soothing vocals of Emi Evans , and it 's just an absolute joy to listen to . Whether it 's the catchy and relaxing overworld theme that plays as you 're running through the northern plains or the grand operatic music that hits when you face off against a boss , it 's all phenomenal . And as an added bonus for version 1.22 , you can even switch the soundtrack to Nier Automata 's if you so desire . <h> Sidetracked <p> But like most RPGs , Nier Replicant is made up of both main quests and side quests , and while the main quest is fantastic ( well , at least eventually ... again , it starts very slow ) , the side quests are terrible . They 're utterly mundane , with the vast majority of them turning you into an errand boy as you bounce back and forth between locations collecting ingredients , delivering items , or finding sparklies on the ground . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's no way to set a side quest as your active quest , which means that there are no waypoints on the map or minimap to guide you to your next destination . This is an area that absolutely feels like it should have been addressed as a quality of life improvement for Ver . 1.22 , but no dice . The fact that they are super unrewarding and not worth the effort actually ends up being a net positive because it means you can ignore them and go pretty much the entire game without ever letting them distract you from the main questline . <h> The End is Just the Beginning <p> One of the boldest decisions with regards to Nier Replicant is the fact that , as Yoko Taro games tend to , it demands to be played more than once . If you just did one playthrough from start to credits , you 'd be missing out on literally half the story . This may sound like a drag , and to an extent it kind of is , but that 's necessary to tell a story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ games -- and it 's a sacrifice that 's worth making . Besides , it 's not as bad as it sounds , because after you beat the campaign once , you 're able to load your save back up and replay from the beginning of the second act . So you 're not actually playing through the whole thing again , just the latter ( and better ) half of it . <p> The second playthrough of Nier Replicant is actually the best one , because even though you get all the same events as the first playthrough , albeit with a few new scenes and crucially important bits of additional dialogue , you 're going through those same events with the knowledge of what happens at the end . That which totally recontextualizes everything the entire second half and leads to some truly incredible story moments that hit me harder emotionally than a video game has in some time . <p> The third playthrough , which you must do in order to see the final three endings , is where things get a little out of hand . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you must also find all of the weapons before you challenge the final boss . Thankfully , the sidequests that are tied to the weapons are much better than the standard sidequests , but it 's still a frustratingly grindy requirement just to see the true conclusion of the story . <p> And yes , for the hardcore fans wondering if there 's a new ending added to Ver . 1.22 , without going into spoilers let me just say that yes , there is one -- and it is truly special . <h> The Verdict <p> As a " Version Up " of the original Nier , Replicant Ver . 1.22 does a respectable job of updating the graphics and combat of the 2010 cult classic to a more modern standard by dramatically improving its environments , animations , and performance , while also going the extra mile and adding excellent voice acting to every single character in its world . It definitely shows its age in its combat and quest design , however , and while the improvements to combat certainly help smooth things out it still suffers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of evolution over the course of the 35 to 40-hour adventure you 'll need to complete to see all the endings . Just push through it and get to what 's truly excellent about Nier Replicant : its story and characters , both of which are still among the strongest I 've seen in the genre . 
@@62859231 <h> SARS is targeting rental properties in South Africa -- what you should know <p> The South African Revenue Service ( SARS ) recently warnedproperty owners who receive rental income from hosting fee-paying guests against their tax obligation . <p> The tax collector emphasised that property owners who host fee-paying guests , and receive rental income , have the same obligation to declare such income to SARS , just as homeowners letting out their property . <p> Although the legal position is fairly clear , it appears that SARS may have identified the need to focus on improving taxpayer compliance in the property sector , said Ursula Diale-Ali , an associate designate at legal firm Cliffe Dekker Hofmeyr . <p> " In particular , amongst property owners who derive rental income from hosting fee-paying guests , and therefore on an ad hoc basis , rather than property owners who enter into lease agreements for longer periods of time , " she said . <p> Deductions and expenditures <p> In practice , the rental income received by the property owner should be added to any other income which that person may have received or accrued , said Diale-Ali . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rental income can be reduced by claiming a deduction in respect of certain expenses which have been incurred during the period in which that person rented out the property , provided that those expenses meet the requirements of the general deduction formula in section 11 of the Income Tax Act ( ITA ) . <p> " To this extent , private expenses or expenses of a capital nature can not be claimed as an expense and will therefore not be allowed as a deduction . " <p> Diale-Ali said that the ITA also permits the deduction of expenditure actually incurred in relation to the repairs of property which is occupied for trade purposes . <p> " At this stage , it will become crucial for the property owner to distinguish between repairs and maintenance costs , as well as costs pertaining to the improvement of the property , " she said . <p> The firm said that SARS generally regards a repair and maintenance cost as a cost relating to the upkeep of an asset , while improvement costs are generally regarded as those costs relating to the enhancement of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ordinary upkeep . <p> Based on guidance documents published by SARS , it appears that in the property rental context , the list of expenses that can be claimed as a deduction includes the following : <p> Rates and taxes ; <p> Bond interest ; <p> Advertisements ; <p> Agency fees of estate agents ; <p> Homeowner 's insurance ; <p> Garden services ; <p> Repairs in respect of the area rented out ; and <p> Security and property levies . <p> Options for non-compliant taxpayers <p> In its statement , SARS encourages property owners who to date , have not declared their rental income to regularise their affairs with immediate effect , which can be done in terms of SARS ' Voluntary Disclosure Programme ( VDP ) . <p> Failing this , non-compliant taxpayers may be selected by SARS for an audit and more stringent processes will be adopted . <p> " The potential downside of an audit is also that pursuant to its finalisation , SARS could issue additional assessments in terms of which additional tax , interest and penalties of up to 200% on the additional tax @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Under the VDP , only additional tax and interest will be imposed , if the VDP application is approved .

" <p> When considering letting out residential property , the firm said that taxpayers must be cognisant of the tax obligations arising from their trading activities , as well as the tax benefits available to them in the short and long term . <p> " As it remains to be seen how SARS will ensure compliance with tax obligations in the property sector , taxpayers are encouraged in the meantime , to take active steps and seek professional advice to regularise their tax affairs and utilise the VDP availed to them to avoid the payment of penalties .

@@62868234 <h> Taking on the struggle to save Liliesleaf , an anti-apartheid heritage site -- Nic Wolpe <p> Located in Rivonia , Liliesleaf farm was bought as a safe house for anti-apartheid activists in the 1960s . It served as the secret headquarters of not only the ANC , but the SACP and Umkhonto we Sizwe too . Nelson Mandela , posing as a domestic worker , used it as a hideout . Now almost 60 years later , despite efforts to secure funding , the site that has been turned into a museum is in danger . CEO of Liliesleaf , Nic Wolpe -- whose father was involved in the original sale of the site -- is taking on the struggle of saving this heritage site with a funding campaign . This comes amid reports that several other sites linked to the anti-apartheid movement -- including some of the homes Nelson Mandela occupied -- are falling into disrepair . Wolpe told BizNews about his campaign to raise R10 million to save Liliesleaf in the short term . -- Linda van Tilburg <p> Nic Wolpe on preserving Liliesleaf as a heritage site : <p> I think within the broader context @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whichever country we are living in , we must preserve our history . History , ultimately , is the collective knowledge of our experiences . With particular reference to South Africa , we have a rich history that goes back to the Khoisan people . But in many respects , the most important aspect of our existence has been , firstly , the three hundred years of colonial rule . <p> It has left its imprint on our society -- most of which , unfortunately , is negative -- and in particular , the apartheid era , which was very defining . Living under apartheid was a very defining period in our historical evolution . It framed a lot about who we are today , good and bad , preferably bad from the point of view of the subjugation of the majority of our population , purely because of the colour of their skin . <p> But the good part was our struggle , the uniqueness of our struggle and those unique individuals that drove our struggle . In its totality or universalism , history is fundamental . It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have much more of an appreciation of why it 's important to preserve historical sites -- particularly a site like Liliesleaf -- which played such a crucial role in our struggle for freedom , democracy and equality . <p> On the role of Liliesleaf in apartheid : <p> 1960 was a defining moment in our struggle . It redefined our struggle . It pushed the liberation movement away from passive resistance to armed struggle . In that transition , Liliesleaf was purchased in 1961 as a meeting place for the Communist Party . But it evolved into not only the high command of the newly formed military wing , but the headquarters of the ANC and the Congress alike . <p> It became the nerve centre of our liberation struggle . It became the heartbeat of our struggle . It was from there that the plans to overthrow the apartheid state operation was discussed . It became the place where they engaged about how to overthrow this insidious political system . And Nelson Mandela -- who had his last visit to Liliesleaf in 2005 -- actually said what made Liliesleaf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ideological , strategic military discourse and engagement . <p> The raid on Liliesleaf on the 11th of July , 1963 -- which led to the Rivonia trial -- push the struggle down a new trajectory . In fact , the existence of Liliesleaf redefined and repositioned the struggle . The raid and the subsequent Rivonia trial put us on the trajectory to our first democratic elections in 1994 . Despite the hammer blow setback that was suffered by the liberation movement internally following the raid on Liliesleaf , its ultimate consequence , in effect , was to push us on the road to democracy . <p> On raising funds to rescue Liliesleaf : <p> Like so many historical sites and institutions within the field of arts and culture , we 've always struggled to survive . Liliesleaf has really lived from a hand-to-mouth existence , because it needs something that has been extremely difficult to secure -- core operational funding . We need additional support , because the money that we generate is never going to be sufficient to meet , completely , our operational expenses and overheads . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're owned by the state , you are not entitled to receive funding . That 's part of the problem . It 's very pervasive within corporate South Africa , unfortunately , partly because the hands are tied , because of how the wording of the ICT charter and the BEE charter is structured . We ca n't even get project funding . The doors to funding , effectively , in South Africa are closed to independent institutions -- particularly if they do n't comply with the ICT and BEE charters -- and that is a problem . <p> We have the situation of a triple whammy now , with Covid . As hard as it is for me to say it , it is the truth . Heritage , arts and culture are marginalised . If you look , for example , at the name of the department , it 's the Department of Sports , Arts and Culture . You do n't see the word heritage . You do n't see the word history . For some unbeknownst reason -- only the government knows -- they merged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high profile , more glamorous , the focus of the department is more sports orientated . On top of that , we got hit by Covid-19 . <p> On a potential solution : <p> We are running a crowdfunding campaign to raise short-term funding . Ideally , we would like to raise R10 million , to address our immediate needs and also enable us to go forward for the next year , to the end of 2022 . Hopefully by then , we will have been able to get some more funding to take us through to the end of 2023 . Between now and then , we would like to put in place an endowment . If we had R100 hundred million , we would generate in a region of R10 million a year . That would be more than sufficient to meet our operational costs , because we would be supplementing that with income . We are working on the basis -- that R100 million and interest -- is working on the basis that we would be generating income as a fully operational entity .

The African Union Development Agency -- the New Partnership for Africa 's Development ( Auda-Nepad ) is leading the work of the African Medicines Regulatory Harmonisation initiative , a project that helps member states to coordinate their policies and regulatory practices .

Professor Jane Duncan , head of the Department of Journalism , Film and Television at the University of Johannesburg , has placed the act among " racist , ethno-nationalist developments over citizenship around the world " . It is including South Africa , she said , on the " growing list of nasty little countries that have defined themselves recently according to who they can exclude , repress and marginalise " . <p> In February 2019 , the National Action Plan to combat racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance was approved by Cabinet .

" <p> Despite this acknowledgement in the action plan , nothing further has been done by the Department of Justice , or Parliament , or indeed any other entity in government regarding the hate crimes bill . This is unacceptable . <p> On 16 July 2019 Minister of Justice Ronald Lamola stated : " The Department of Justice has a critical role in developing and sustaining our hard-earned democracy . ...

@@62870236 <h> Four days of Ramaphosa at the State Capture Commission could be crucial for SA 's future <h> By Ferial Haffajee* 27 April 2021 <h> Caption <h> Where were you and what did you do ? What did you know and when did you know it ? These are the types of questions that President Ramaphosa , who was the ANC 's and South Africa 's number two at the apogee of the State Capture , will face as he appears at the Zondo Commission of Inquiry on April 28 and 29 ; and again on May 13 and 14 . This could be the most important testimony the commission hears , for a variety of reasons . <p> President Cyril Ramaphosa is unlikely to be the gripping witness Norma Mngoma was when he appears before the Zondo Commission of Inquiry on Wednesday , 28 April , and the following day . <p> After all , he did not make a habit of going to the alternative Cabinet meeting-place at the Gupta family 's Saxonwold mansion , and there are no reports of payola being made to him in cash and spirited into the boot of his car . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bag . <p> But his testimony is likely to be the most important in terms of answering questions of political culpability during the era of State Capture . It is unlikely that former president Jacob Zuma , who was head of state through the era , will appear before the State Capture Inquiry . So , the big questions will fall to Ramaphosa . <p> He will open with a statement on Wednesday , April 28 , when he starts two days of testimony as ANC president and he is likely to treat it as a profound national moment of mea culpa for the damage that State Capture did to South Africa . <p> While the different factions of the ANC have lobbed missiles at the Zondo Commission , Ramaphosa has been steadfast in his support . He has set aside four full days to give testimony -- a sign of political seriousness and support for the process . <p> His opening statement is likely to be more contrite than the testimony of ANC Chairperson Gwede Mantashe , who told the commission that the ANC had not been captured , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Speaker Thandi Modise stepped further towards accepting some culpability when she apologised and said that Parliament could have done more than it did to stop the process from becoming ineluctable by acting earlier . <p> Ramaphosa is likely to face the questions that often surface in the public square : what did you do , what did you say , and why did n't you do more ? <p> Appointed as ANC deputy president in 2012 and South Africa 's president two years later , he was in office through the years when State Capture ran rampant through South Africa . <p> All the major damage was done from 2012 , as the graphic shows . In that year , Dudu Myeni was appointed as SAA chairperson , starting the airline 's crash and burn . A year before , a teary Fikile Mbalula ( the then sports minister ) told the ANC National Executive Committee that the Gupta family had told him of the transport minister portfolio he would get before Zuma officially informed him -- later , several deputy ministers reported similar occurrences . <p> In 2013 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Waterkloof Air Force Base . Mantashe told the commission that this was the first time the ANC realised the Guptas ' growing influence over the government . <p> From then on , South Africa notched up highwater marks of State Capture . <p> These included the Prasa trains purchase , with millions of rands diverted to the ANC ; the Transnet locomotives purchase , with billions extracted by the Gupta network ; the appointment of Tom Moyane as SA Revenue Service commissioner and the evisceration of the revenue agency and revenue collection . <p> At Denel , under chairperson Dan Mantsha ( later , one of Zuma 's lawyers ) , the defence company 's intellectual property was exported in a dodgy deal with VR Laser Asia , co-owned by Gupta lieutenant Salim Essa . <p> Former GCIS CEO Themba Maseko revealed in 2016 that he had severe pressure placed on him by Ajay Gupta to advertise in The New Age newspaper . Later , eight other ANC cadres gave evidence of this kind of pressure to Mantashe -- seven were too scared to put it in writing . Bell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ media , the banks and anybody who would n't ring the Gupta bell started in 2016 . <p> Through it all , Ramaphosa was in office . <p> The only known action he took was to lead the campaign against the appointment of Des van Rooyen as finance minister in December 2015 when Nhlanhla Nene was axed . Because of Ramaphosa 's intervention , Van Rooyen lasted only two days and became known as the " Weekend Special " . <p> Mantashe revealed under questioning by Alec Freund SC that two ministers had come forward to report corruption in their departments . He also confirmed that the ANC secretariat had received reports of the Gupta family 's growing influence . He had told ministers and senior civil servants not to comply with illegal instructions . <p> Ramaphosa could face questions about his knowledge of these reports and what action he took as media reports of State Capture grew in number and detail . <p> The commission 's brief is to ascertain if State Capture occurred and also to recommend steps to prevent it in future . The evidence leader could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ANC policy of choosing party-aligned cadres for deployment into all levers of the state ) as one of the instruments used in State Capture . He was chair of the party 's deployment committee , which should have approved the boards of state-owned enterprises . The most expensive and egregious corruption was at Transnet , Eskom and Denel through board manipulation . <p> Also , as deputy president , Ramaphosa chaired the ANC 's political committee at Parliament . The commission has repeatedly returned to the theme of how parliamentary oversight failed to nip State Capture in the bud before it harmed South Africa so severely . The president is likely to face a grilling on this aspect of his underutilised power too . <p> For his part , Ramaphosa is likely to reveal that he was not kept in the loop about Zuma 's decisions , such as the nuclear project he tried to ram through , and about Zuma 's regular Cabinet reshuffles . Instead , as Noma Gigaba has revealed , a shadow state has operated where the Guptas were making key decisions . The president could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ramaphosa will be keen to move the discussion to what can be done to prevent more State Capture .

@@62870238 <h> Opinionista* Ashley Forbes * 27 April 2021 <h> SA at the critical juncture of true freedom in our lifetime , or a dream deferred <h> The ANC is on a course of self-destruction . No opposition party or vocal critics have caused as much harm to the image of the ANC as have its own leaders and members . Voting for the ANC will , in the final analysis , give the party the long rope that it may use to hang itself . It has to get worse before it gets better . <p> On Tuesday , 27 April 2021 , we celebrated Freedom Day.It was the day , 27 years ago , when millions of South Africans exercised their basic right to vote in our first democratic elections for the leaders and political parties of their choosing . <p> We should pause a moment though , to remember , to pay homage to all those mothers and fathers , students and youth , community members , NGOs , workers , political organisations , international organisations , religious denominations , sport and cultural groups , that struggled , endured and made grave sacrifices so that today all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to vote . We will once again have the opportunity to exercise this hard-earned right to cast our ballots in the upcoming sixth local elections and the seventh national elections in 2024 . <p> On that day in 1994 , our nation was hopeful and excited to usher in a new dawn and citizens went to the polls in their millions . Since then , we have seen our dreams for a free , just and equitable society wither away before our eyes . We have lost confidence in our leaders , political parties , democracy , the rule of law , the Constitution -- and feel betrayed . <p> South Africans stand at a critical juncture in the history of our new democracy . We can stand by idly and watch our country slip into hopelessness and despair , or galvanise into action and realise our dreams for a better world for all . What are our options and what can we do ? <p> We could all use this hard-earned opportunity to vote for the ANC . " Better the devil you know than the devil you do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the new representative of the wealthy elite and has betrayed the interests of the majority of South Africans . We know what we are dealing with and there can be no more surprises . <p> The invaluable little that the Zondo Commission has powerfully and successfully exposed speaks volumes about the pervasive abuse of power . It exposes the corrupt activities of members of the governing party 's top six , the presidency and members of state-owned entities . We know about collusion between the private sector , politicians and civil servants who commit these crooked acts at every level of local , provincial and national government . Corruption in the pursuit of personal wealth at the expense of the poor is so deeply rooted , that the ANC will not , and can not , self-correct . <p> But will the people continue to vote for the ANC government , albeit in decreasing numbers and return them to power ? The ANC has become so arrogant because there are no viable opposition parties or meaningful alliances to challenge its power . It is what it is . Or is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and improve our conditions when we seem to be facing something that we can not change . <p> It may be an extreme example , but when I was detained under section 29 of the Internal Security Act and held in solitary confinement during the apartheid time , I had no control over my physical environment . The security police determined where I could sleep , when I would be taken for interrogation , what I would eat and if , or when , I would be assaulted . They may have succeeded in instilling terror and fear and they may have tried to extract valuable information from me , but they could not control my thoughts or beliefs . I accepted that they had complete control over my body , but I learnt to adapt , keep my mind strong , play the game and survive . <p> One objective of the assaults was designed to humiliate me by getting me to wet my pants when they suffocated me and took me to the verge of death . They would serve me tea throughout the day and then they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time for my assault . Under normal circumstances they would have succeeded but I learnt to play along . I would protest to go to the toilet while knowing that I had relieved myself in the inconspicuous pot plant that stood in the corner of my interrogation room when I was alone . <p> I still smile when I think how I must have confused those security policemen because I never , ever wet my pants . Through this simple defiant trick , I maintained my dignity , avoided the humiliation they wished upon me and kept my spirit intact . Every cloud has a silver lining and even if we can not see it now , opportunities will arise and there will be an end . <p> Ordinary South Africans will have to make many more sacrifices and difficult choices to secure the freedoms for which our forefathers so gallantly fought . We can no longer allow their dream of freedom for all to be deferred . <p> The ANC is on a course of self-destruction . No opposition party or vocal critics have caused as much harm to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and members . Voting for the ANC will , in the final analysis , give the party the long rope that it may use to hang itself . It has to get worse before it gets better . <p> The ANC has enjoyed 27 years of one-party dominance ; it has no viable opposition parties to contend with and is likely to maintain its position of power after the local elections this year and after the national elections in 2024 . <p> If there is anything that I have learnt about the people of South Africa , then it is that their patience is not endless . Our people have struggled against the impossible and have risen from the burning embers . We continue to endure grave hardships but remain committed to peace , justice and a better life for all . It is unfortunate that so many of our leaders believe that they can usurp the wealth of our nation for the benefit of a small , wealthy elite .

There are many more eligible voters who have chosen not to vote compared to those who have chosen to vote in the past few national elections . Who should the South African public vote for and can we blame them if they do not vote ? The ANC has committed heinous crimes against the people , and it would be a matter of principle to not vote for the ANC . <p> What makes matters worse is that the ANC can not self-correct and it is now the responsibility of the ordinary citizens of this country to not vote for the ANC . We need to self-correct . We need to pivot away from hopelessness and despair and move our country towards true freedom . <p> The sad truth is that the freedoms and basic rights for which South Africans fought so long and hard have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truth is that there is no viable political party in our country presently that serves and works selflessly and ethically in the interests of all .

The governing party fails to deliver on basic service . The ANC is at war with itself and the people on the ground have lost confidence in democracy , the rule of law and the Constitution . No spin doctor can erase the harm that was caused to our nation under the watch of the ANC and it can not be business as usual . <p> So , what do we do when there seem to be no viable options or alternatives ? <p> We do what many South Africans all over our land have slowly started to do : We reflect and accept that we are all part of the problem and have allowed this dire situation to arise . We accept that there is no challenge too big and that we must begin to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our fatigue and complacency and take control of our lives like the workers did at Marikana , like protesters continue to do each day in the widespread local service delivery protests . <p> We do as the students did in the Fees Must Fall movement , as the NPOs and NGOs do as they continue to implement programmes to feed the poor during Covid-19 . We do as those who continue each day , to act to defend our democracy and our Constitution . We do what is right even if we are not always aware of all the efforts that South Africans all over our land are making to change our current course . <p> A groundswell of change is coming as surely as day follows night . It took decades for the institutions of our government , state-owned entities and our resources to be captured and looted . This culture of impunity and criminality will not be reversed overnight . The brutal truth is that we have a long , hard road ahead of us . <p> Ordinary South Africans will have to make many more sacrifices and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so gallantly fought .

We 've seen lots of other Reits real estate investment trusts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smaller community centres , especially the township and rural areas , performing better . <p> IZAK PETERSEN : I think it 's probably a sort of longer-term story unfolding here . If you look at the amount of development that has been undertaken in South Africa over a period of time , I think there has been quite a lot of development ; large super-regional shopping centres -- but not necessarily the same amount of tenants -- are entering the market . We 've had massive business failures in the past 10 years or so , Stuttafords , your Edcons . And I think some of that space is not replaceable . We 've had international guys entering the market and not growing or rolling out stores at the pace that was anticipated . So you kind of find yourself in a situation where you 've got more space than the tenancies that are required , or demand for space from tenancies . <p> It 's very difficult to repurpose a space that was specifically built for certain tenants , and I think that problem is more prevalent in your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But if you look at how retail has now been taken to the people in the rural centres , there was massive leakage to bigger centres as the industry started rolling out properties more conveniently located closer to our communities on the rural side of things . I think there has n't been overdevelopment there , firstly , and number two , there 's quite a large informal economy that exists that is probably not captured by the Reserve Bank . That has n't changed . It 's stayed fairly stable . <p> There is some support coming from social grants into those markets . <p> Generally speaking , people have one foot in the city and one food in a rural area , and quite a bit of money is getting sent back home to where their families reside . And I think there 's a level of stability as far as that 's concerned . <p> And these centres also tend to house only essential retail rather than discretionary retail to a large degree . When it comes to urban convenience community centres , I think the lockdown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from home , and there 's no point in them travelling to a regional centre to actually go and buy the bare basics . So we see that as quite interesting support for those community-based centres . As you 've rightfully said , we were one of the few counters whose portfolio stayed stable year on year at our last reporting period . <p> There was an article recently indicating that on average the sector had fallen about 8% in terms of asset values ; our portfolio was stable , and the only reason our portfolio was stable was because we had maintained our income , our vacancies were stable , and I think that when you look at cap rates and discount rates , super-regional centres have always enjoyed quite a low discount-rate dispensation , because there 's always an assumption that they 've got better embedded growth . But I think that scenario has been reversed now , where your community-based centres , your smaller centres , are probably embedded with better growth prospects than the regional centres . <p> SUREN NAIDOO : I know your results have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but rural centres versus urban community centres -- are you still seeing growth there ? Is it continuing , considering we are in a lower lockdown period at the moment ? <p> IZAK PETERSEN : We certainly are . We are seeing sustained turnovers from our retailers . I think people eat at home moreand less frequently at restaurants . So therefore supermarkets are enjoying support from that point of view . And , as I just explained earlier on , I think this whole phenomenon of working closer to home or at home or from home is also providing great support from that point of view . <p> So our centres are trading very well at the moment . Occupancy rates are sustained . And I think we are quite fortunate from that point of view . We did indicate at our pre-close discussion with the market that our numbers were looking very similar to last year 's in spite of Covid-19 , and we are talking here about pre-Covid-19 , because we were only hit by Covid-19 in the second half of our financial year last year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ news stories or relatively good news stories still in the property market . Just on this trend , do you think it 's supported by Covid-19 , and will it really continue ? I think it sounds crazy to think post-Covid-19 , but would this trend continue post Covid-19 because , with my coverage of property over the years , the trend of development in rural and township areas has been quite topical over a number of years . So it 's not really new . <p> IZAK PETERSEN : Yes . It 's a tenanting story . When you start a new business in the retail space you are probably going to test your concept in a smaller centre or a high-street type setup , rather than a large shopping centre , because the rentals are quite steep in super-regional shopping centres . So I believe that there are a lot of new concepts being tested by great business people . There 's a huge amount of second-tier retailers coming to the market and there 's consolidation in that sector . We 've seen larger retail groups on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Yuppiechefs and so on . And we 're probably going to see a bit more of that consolidation happening in the market . <p> But , as that happens , the founders of these businesses and other guys are going to start new businesses and that 's going to go on , and I think we 'll be recipients of that . But we 've also seen the larger guys testing out smaller formats , and those smaller formats are more suited for your community-based centres , your rural centres . <p> I think people are adapting the model to also speak more to the majority LSMs in the country , which are the sort of lower LSMs , which implies that we will be recipients of that sort of trend . So I 'm very confident that our choice of the retail sector 15 years ago was the right choice and I believe that , if things return to normality , it does n't imply that we 'll take a back seat . In fact , I think that we 'll definitely shoot out the lights if that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to be the order of the day as far as our chosen market segment is concerned . <p> SUREN NAIDOO : That 's great . Just on a concluding note , I know you talked about retailers and changes in the market with big retailers taking over smaller retailers , but the second-tier retailers are almost silent players in your space . You will know their names , the shoppers will know their names , but for affluent shoppers to the super-regional mall -- what is this retailer OBC , or the other butchery chains , for example ? I 've kind of put a few names there but , as a concluding thought or comment , which retailers are benefiting most from the better performance of township and rural malls ? <p> IZAK PETERSEN : I think any retailer that has pointed and adapted product , and understands the market segments and adapts product fairly quickly , is better positioned . Some of these second-tier guys are brilliant businesspeople . They do n't sit on product if it does n't move , they replace it fairly quickly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the example of an OBC , for example , almost all the stores belong to businesspeople . It 's basically on a franchise basis . And our experience has been that your franchise stores , even the likes of Pick n Pay , tend to outperform your corporate stores because people have skin in the game and work the business a bit harder . <p> So you 're right about the guys almost operating below the radar here for perhaps the urban super-regional shopper , but those names are household names in the sectors that we play in . In fact , people sort of demand that we have some of that . <p> The other great thing that I did n't mention earlier on is that there 's been an relaxation of exclusivity clauses from some of the larger retailers , which then means that we 've now got the opportunity to take some of these exciting new concepts or existing concepts , sort of mid-tier concepts , into our centres . The customer has more choice and the larger guy also then has to up his game . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it 's great news for us to have that amount of choice in terms of who we put in these centres . <p> Moneyweb requires cookies to function properly .

@@62875235 <h> President Cyril Ramaphosa put political party front and centre at the inquiry , saying the ANC initially wanted the police and other law enforcement agencies to probe State Capture . <p> " Where you could say there was fault , it was the delay , " President Cyril Ramaphosa told State Capture Commission chairperson Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo on day two of his testimony as ANC president . <p> " Initially there was inertia . That there was not much movement , we concede . When it was clear the evidence was just accumulated , the thinking was to investigate them through the law enforcement agencies ... In the end , the parliamentary track was activated . " <p> And that presidential testimony about summed up the hiatus of governing ANC action from 2011 when Fikile Mbalula told the party 's National Executive Committee how the Guptas told him he 'd be a minister -- before he was appointed to head the sports portfolio -- to 2013 when guests at the Gupta wedding landed at the Air Force Base Waterkloof . And also the March 2016 public statement by then deputy finance minister Mcebisi Jonas about how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a R600-million bribe . <p> A shift seemed to come only after the #GuptaLeaks , a trove of thousands of emails providing proof of the influence of the Gupta family and its business associations on the government , the presidency and state-owned enterprises . <p> " That seems to be a delay that is difficult to accept , " said the deputy chief justice . " I just think 2017 was too , too far and there seems to have been enough for ANC committees and Parliament to probe . And if they had done so it may well be some of the damage may have been prevented . " <p> Ramaphosa 's reply was to emphasise he was not there to make excuses or to defend the indefensible . <p> " I am also here to explain some of the lapses . What I can say , deputy chief justice , you are absolutely right in saying the delayed reaction was not a correct way to handle matters . And I will concede that . " <p> Previous testimony , again canvassed on Thursday , outlined how ANC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ claims , including DA MP Natasha Mazzone 's request to the public enterprises committee in early 2016 and the September 2016 motion in the House by then DA MP David Maynier for a full parliamentary investigation into the impact of the Guptas on government . <p> That motion was defeated in the House where the ANC proposed an alternative motion to refer such State Capture claims to the SAPS and other law enforcement agencies -- in line with the governing party 's attitude of dismissing State Capture as " allegations " . <p> That attitude only changed amid the factional jockeying and leadership battles in the run-up to the December 2017 Nasrec national conference . Importantly , the political mood at the time fed into ANC contestation -- scores of anti-Zuma street protests , vocal critique from veterans and stalwarts and a thrashing of the ANC at the 2016 local government polls . <p> Given the centrality of political parties in South Africa 's constitutional democracy , little was done in Parliament -- where , since 1994 , the ANC has held the majority -- until the party changed its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Constitution is that of a party system ... That is our system . They MPs do n't go represent themselves and their jacket , " said Ramaphosa , who described himself as " a party person " . <p> While the Constitution had introduced " schizophrenic type of relation " by having the political party system as legislators swear individual oaths of office to uphold and respect the Constitution , according to Ramaphosa , the political party remained foundational . <p> " Political parties , by their nature , have a herd mentality . Like cattle they move together as a herd . That being the case , we do say there is always an exception for one or two or few members of the herd to hold different views . But the general rule of thumb in a party system is that you go along with the party line . " <p> If there were a need for exceptions , it would be discussed in the party . " Then in the end the party leadership would say we 'll allow it , " said the ANC president . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sweeping statements in what 's been a rather jovial atmosphere at the State Capture hearings would be sufficient , he did not count on Zondo 's committed persistence . <p> On the president 's proclaimed support of political party versus constitutional duty , including holding a president to account through a vote of no-confidence , the deputy chief justice put his question plainly : <p> " If that is so , why do we need the constitutional provisions , if everything can be dictated by the majority party outside the Parliament ? " <p> It was one of the few moments of superbly controlled optics and bonhomie that Ramaphosa found himself blethering . <p> Referencing " a collective of people " applying their minds and " checks and balances " , he argued it was important for the ANC to have taken the decision , despite the " very painful process " , to recall its presidents , Thabo Mbeki in September 2008 and Jacob Zuma in February 2018 . <p> " If it had cascaded all the way through to Parliament , it would have divided the party down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to describe Parliament as a stop-gap for party-factional politics . <p> " When the wheels have come off in the party itself , you need the check and balance in the Constitution . " <p> It did not come to that ; Zuma resigned in a late-night Valentine 's Day address to the nation . <p> But the ANC 's use of Parliament not as the constitutional tool for oversight and accountability in the interests of the people of South Africa , but a more cynical instrument in factional politics , may well leave a bitter taste . <p> For Zondo , it remains to unpick the maelstrom of parliamentary oversight , legislators ' constitutional responsibilities and party politics -- and how failures , or delays , affected State Capture . <p> " The commission would be failing in its duty if it did n't look as deep as possible what are the things that made these things happen , " as the deputy chief justice put it .

For instance , we should celebrate what the ANC has achieved since 1994 : <p> Nine out of 10 public schools are now no-fee schools ; <p> In 1994 , there was only an enrolment of 51% of learners in public schools , now 81% of learners are in school ; <p> In 1994 , there were only 347,000 students enrolled in universities , now there are more than one million students at universities ; <p> In 1994 , only 50% of learners passed matric , in 2018 , 78.2% of learners passed matric ; <p> 3.2 million free houses have been built since 1994 ; <p> In 1994 , only three million people received social grants , now 17.5 million people receive grants ; <p> In 1994 , only 36% of people had access to electricity in their homes , now over 84% have electricity in their homes ; <p> In 1994 , only 54% of South Africans could read and write , now 94.3% of people can do so ; <p> In 1994 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , now 88.6% have access ; and <p> In 1994 , only R70-million was spent on bursaries for students , R15-billion was spent on bursaries in 2018 . <p> That 's to mention a few improvements -- but there are also the bigger issues that are more than just bricks and mortar . Keeping a handle on the non-racial principle rarely gets credited to the ANC and yet one could argue that since Mandela and his reconciliation , it is the governing party that ensured our unity in diversity in all aspects of our daily lives , not allowing a race war to spill over into daily life . <p> The growth of the black middle class is another such principle that does not get mentioned and yet we have made such steady progress here too . <p> Our foreign reserves numbers suggest that we have also made good progress in this respect . In 1994 the National Party government left the country in the red , to the tune of $23-billion , which the democratic government had to pay back to both domestic and foreign lenders . Today , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bank . I 'd say that is significant progress . <p> Most white South Africans that I have engaged with always want to hold on to the belief that the black majority inherited an economically healthy country , which was simply not the case . Naturally , the international financial crisis of 2008/09 , as well as the pandemic 10 years later , have caused havoc in all markets and we were not spared , either . Coupled with nine wasted years under the Zuma presidency , it does mean we will have to redouble our efforts to realise not only our preamble , but also the pursuit of a non-racial , non-sexist , democratic and prosperous South Africa . <p> I read an opinion recently that stated that " few anti-Constitution pessimists engage with what the breakthrough from apartheid to democracy enabled politically . These critics are rightly outraged by the socioeconomic ravages most black South Africans continue to suffer . But they largely refrain from questioning the ANC 's failure to use its political dominance to shift state levers towards ending inequality . The party has pursued a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ race-based wealth gap intact , except for the upper echelons of society . " <p> Although this is true in the main , it does not also take into consideration the international markets . It 's easy to state that the ANC 's failure to use political dominance has resulted in the current inequality gap , but as we have observed , the international financial markets also dictate one 's behaviour . One only has to look at Zimbabwe to take a cue . So , it 's a bit disingenuous to simply suggest the ANC could have done much more . One only has to look at how the rating agencies play politics with the SA market . <p> Another way of looking at the past 27 years can be through the lens of Karl Marx 's base and superstructure : " Base and superstructure are two linked theoretical concepts . Base refers to the production forces , or the materials and resources , that generate the goods society needs . Superstructure describes all other aspects of society , such as the ideologies that dominate a particular era , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such things as politics , laws , morality , religion , metaphysics , etc . <p> " The mode of production of material life conditions the general process of social , political , and intellectual life . It is not the consciousness of men that determines their existence , but their social existence that determines their consciousness . At a certain stage of development , the material productive forces of society come into conflict with the existing relations of production or -- this merely expresses the same thing in legal terms -- with the property relations within the framework of which they have operated hitherto . From forms of development of the productive forces , these relations turn into their fetters . Then begins an era of social revolution . " <p> Which is where South Africa finds itself right now . <p> " The changes in the economic foundation lead , sooner or later , to the transformation of the whole , immense , superstructure . In studying such transformations , it is always necessary to distinguish between the material transformation of the economic conditions of production , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the legal , political , religious , artistic , or philosophic -- in short , ideological forms in which men become conscious of this conflict and fight it out . <p> " Just as one does not judge an individual by what he thinks about himself , so one can not judge such a period of transformation by its consciousness , but , on the contrary , this consciousness must be explained from the contradictions of material life , from the conflict existing between the social forces of production and the relations of production . " <p> It is evident that the unresolved land question , attacks on so-called " white monopoly capital " and the attacks on our Constitution and the judiciary are all manifestations of this phenomenon . Does it mean our future looks bleak ? An emphatic , No ! Civil society has begun to breathe again and has been keeping the government in check these past few years . <p> Our independent judiciary , although under constant attack , has proven its mettle over the past few years . And it seems finally , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begin the internal clean-up campaign . <p> There remains work to be done when it comes to the forces of production and the relations of production , no doubt , but we have thrived as a nation insofar as the superstructure issues are concerned .

Julius Malema should be ashamed that he has failed to show leadership to the youth of South Africa by constructively engaging issues of conflict he perceived . <p> These reports must indeed be a disappointment to the youth who look upon him as a leader of young people of this country and beyond . Julius Malema 's unfortunate action of resorting to public squabbling and accusations is not befitting the stature with which young people regard our organization , the African National Congress Youth League , and hence we will rise to defend anything we view as an unwarranted attack against it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ANC Youth League , Comrade Lamola , is attacked for saying that the ANC Youth League has no case to answer in court and therefore will not be organising any rallies for or against Julius . The African National Congress Youth League is an organization far above any individual . It is a fact that the ANC Youth League is not accused of money laundering in any court of law and the Deputy President remains correct in distancing the organization from private issues of individuals regardless of what position they may or may not hold in the organization . <p> The National Executive Committee has no resolution to support individual members of the organization who are appear before court in respect of their personal affairs , neither have we sought to stop members who want to attend in support of Julius in their personal capacity . The theory of the organization teaches us there is an organization and there are individuals ; they relate dialectically , being interrelated and interdependent but independent from each other . <p> It is when the movement abrogates upon itself challenges that are not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to build a cult of personality and find the organization entwined in messes such as The Spear saga and many we have seen in recent days . <p> We therefore call on all members and supporters of the ANC Youth League to put aside any differences they may have in pursuit of a broader and more important agenda . Our cause for Economic Freedom in our Lifetime will not be derailed by petty , territorial squabbles fuelled by the conflict-hungry media . The Deputy President of the ANC Youth League , Comrade Ronald Lamola , shall continue to lead the organization as constitutionally obligated and elected unopposed at Congress to do so . <p> The NEC as a collective has fought tirelessly for the reinstatement of expelled and suspended comrades , including Comrade Sindiso Magaqa .

The decision to call for change led by Comrade Kgalema Motlanthe and Comrade Fikile Mbalula in the ANC arises from considered deliberation by structures at all levels of the organization having understood the immense challenges facing us . This is a campaign of the ANC Youth League ; we own it as members of the League and members of the ANC . <p> We have no doubt therefore that our programme for this radical and fundamental change underpinned by organizational renewal is safe in the hands of the ANC Youth League led by the National Executive Committee with Comrade Lamola at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the organization to whims of individuals and it is an insult to the ANC Youth League that anyone would claim that the organization can be controlled based on the views and deals reached by any individual member . <p> We send a cautionary warning to members of the organization and those who still identify themselves with the organization that the campaign for decisive change in Manguang is a campaign driven and championed by young people everywhere with the hope of realizing a better future for themselves . No one must stand on rooftops and seek to divide us or derail this campaign for their own personal and selfish gains , narrow upmanship games and to advance shaky political standing . Economic Freedom in our Lifetime will be delivered by all of us , young and old , united , fighting together side by side to realize the aspirations of our people . <p> Statement issued by the African National Congress Youth League , November 28 2012

@@62897238 <h> BLEAT A RETREAT <h> No sign of promised state funding for KZN farmers really gets their goat <p> By Yves Vanderhaeghen* 6 May 2021 <p> Millions of rands promised by the KZN provincial government for an ambitious goat farming plan have not been forthcoming . ( Photo : Gallo Images / Louw Pretorius ) <h> An ambitious programme to commercialise and boost indigenous goat production across KwaZulu-Natal is in jeopardy because the provincial Department of Agriculture and Rural Development has throttled funding of millions of rands . <p> In October 2016 , the department signed a deal with two NGOs , Heifer Project South Africa ( HPSA ) and the Mdukatshani Rural Development Project , to launch a five-year plan to change the face of livestock farming . So promising is this initiative that international donors , from the EU , Germany and the US , have also committed more than R30-million to its realisation . <p> Among the objectives of this goat master plan were to : <p> Generate an extra R100-million in livestock herds in the Mzinyathi , Thukela , uThungula , Zululand and uMkhanyakude districts , where poverty and unemployment are rife ; <p> Create @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Set 7,000 farmers , particularly women , on the path to commercialising their herds ; <p> Double goat production to start meeting unquenched local demand and to export ; <p> Create a centre of excellence for goat research ; and <p> Create publications and a training curriculum . <p> The two NGOs would be responsible for the training and support of farmers and livestock associations , provide matching funds in three areas , coordinate research and collect data , initiate and promote auctions and train community animal health workers in small business development . <p> Mdukatshani , founded in 1975 to work with subsistence farmers in Msinga , has been a pioneer in boosting household goat herds and chicken flocks through improving the health of animals , and has created an extensive network of community animal health workers , equipped with basic veterinary kits , who provide regular , affordable services to farmers . <p> The Department of Agriculture and Rural Development had noted the success of this initiative and offered to put its weight behind it to boost the local economy through commercialisation . <p> Its part of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kits , establish abattoirs for farmers , provide support for auctions , provide expertise and staff to mentor community health workers , facilitate training for life skills and business management through the Agricultural Sector Education and Training Authority , and to provide goat-research bursaries . <p> The department 's financial commitment totalled R10.9-million . In 2017 , R2.8-million was paid to Mdukatshani and HPSA . Nothing has been forthcoming since then . <p> The director of Mdukatshani , Rauri Alcock , says the process has been " glued up " , and he and the CEO of HPSA , Marisia Geraci , have been trying for the past three years to find out what has caused the blockage . How is it possible , they ask , for civil servants in KwaZulu-Natal to obstruct a project that has the blessing of Minister of Agriculture , Land Reform and Rural Development Thoko Didiza , who wants to extend it on a national scale ? The pilot project " could have been great " , says Alcock . Instead , the government is driving the programme to failure and the future of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has not stopped the government from extolling the value of the plan in creating economic hubs in rural areas . In 2016 , then-MEC for Agriculture in KwaZulu-Natal , Themba Mthembu , urged young people in Msinga to get involved in the programme and asked -- ironically , given how it has been derailed -- whether the department was " doing enough for the youth and the farmworkers " . <p> In July 2020 , in his policy and budget speech , Deputy Minister of Agriculture , Land Reform and Rural Development Sidumo Dlamini promised that the objectives of the plan to commercialise goat herds by assisting 7,000 farmers and establish 700 microbusinesses , would be achieved by 2021 , as scheduled . <p> In her provincial budget speech in 2020 , MEC for Agriculture and Rural Development Bongiwe Sithole-Moloi extolled the department 's role in " developing a goat production value chain strategy to support primary production and promote the culture of business enterprise management among black rural livestock producers . This will include auctions , creating awareness and promoting the value of goat meat among the rural poor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the nine goat auctions planned from May 2019 to October 2020 , three had to be cancelled because payment from the department did not materialise . On top of that , there has been no Agri-SETA training , no graduate research , or top-ups for veterinary kits , among other things . <p> The farmers who are supposed to be reaping the benefits of this grand plan are not seeing any action . <p> Baba Mbatha , who is on the executive committee of the Msinga Livestock Association , laments that while there had been promises of two to three auctions a year , there have been none since 2018 . One was scheduled in 2019 but was called off , as was one scheduled for 2020 . Himself a farmer , Mbatha says it is difficult to change the mindset of farmers to see the commercial value of their animals and their herds as factories . Those who took the plunge to take animals to auction found value in the process and saw the potential , but the momentum has now been lost . Furthermore , revenue that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ auctions has not materialised , with the result that it has had to scale back its own operations , which include monitoring and reporting disease , security and construction of dip tanks . He says farmers do n't understand why things have ground to a halt . <p> While Alcock and Geraci have been in extensive correspondence with department officials to unblock the funds , farmers and members of livestock associations who have been waiting for more than three years to see promises realised , are asking : " Who ate the money ? " <p> The damage caused by the funding debacle goes deep . Mdukatshani project manager Gugu Mbatha said it " has ruined our relationship with farmers and they no longer trust the organisation " . Mdukathani and HPSA have wasted time chasing after the department , she said , and they have had to pay from their own financial reserves to prevent a total collapse of the programmes . As it is , she said , training of community health workers had been cut by about two thirds , and only about half the number of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of farmers . <p> Gerasi said that " for the last three years of the goat agribusiness project , we have been carrying out project activities , where possible , as agreed in the legal agreement with the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development , with the understanding we would be reimbursed . We have n't , and we 're out millions . We are a small NGO and have had to use our reserves . It 's having an impact on the organisation . Secondly , our reputation is at stake because where we have n't been able to carry out activities to the full extent , we have been accused of keeping departmental money for ourselves . Communities are upset that we ' made promises ' that we seem not to be keeping . " <p> In the absence of the promised funds or any answers about why they have not been forthcoming , Mdukatshani and HPSA issued a legal demand . <p> A letter addressed to the directorate of legal services at the KwaZulu-Natal Department of Agriculture and Rural Development requested confirmation , by the end of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ By Thursday no response had been received and lawyer Paul Misselhorn is now lodging an arbitration request with the Arbitration Foundation of South Africa . <p> A request for comment sent to provincial MEC for Agriculture and Rural Development Bongiwe Sithole-Moloi on Monday has been unsuccessful .

@@62897240 <h> As he presented his Recovery Plan to Parliament on 26 April to relaunch the Italian economy , Prime Minister Mario Draghi warned that the ' destiny of Italy ' depends on the plan 's success . <p> At stake is an audacious gamble on relaunching and redefining the European economy . Conceived after the first wave of Covid-19 , the European Recovery Fund has been hailed as a make-or-break moment for the European project of integration and " ever closer union " . <p> At its heart is the European Commission 's vast programme of borrowing more than ? 800-billion , which will then be disbursed from Brussels to member states as loans and grants , in return for those states undertaking extensive structural reforms as agreed with Brussels . The idea is to make the European economy more productive , greener , more digital and more equitable . <p> Italy is by far the largest beneficiary of the programme . It argued successfully last summer that not only was the country cruelly on the front line of the pandemic in Europe , it has also suffered from decades of European Union-imposed austerity and underinvestment . About ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ post-pandemic renaissance or about 12% of GDP . <p> The reality is that the Italian economy has been a consistent underperformer and handbrake on European economic growth for decades . Draghi writes in his introduction to the 340-page Recovery Plan that in the 20 years since the euro was adopted there has been negligible economic growth in Italy , while the economies of Germany , France and Spain have expanded 32% , 33% and 42% respectively . <p> Similar to South Africa , Italy 's economy was battling before the devastation wreaked by the pandemic . The past 13 months have threatened to be the final knockout blow . <p> Draghi 's plan is therefore to allocate unparalleled investment to areas like investing in the green economy , digitalisation of the Italian state and under-resourced areas like healthcare and education . High-speed rail links to the poorer south will be constructed , a nationwide electric car-charging network rolled out , and a countrywide high-speed 5G network built . A total of ? 4.6-billion will be allocated to new kindergartens alone . <p> But the crux of the European Union 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alongside these investments , cuts and reforms will be made in the areas that have most hindered the Italian economy . The notoriously bureaucratic public administration will be cut and simplified , Italy 's sclerotic justice system will be reformed , and the unfathomably complicated fiscal system will be streamlined . <p> The former European Central Bank governor and economics professor forecasts that the combined effect will be to raise the Italian GDP growth rate to 3.6% by 2026 . <p> But the reality is that , regardless of what happens in Rome and Italy over the next 10 years , it will have profound effects outside its borders , in Europe and the rest of the world . <p> Committed European integrationists like Draghi are gambling that if this plan plays out as forecast it would have the effect of turning the third-largest European economy from a laggard into a growth engine for the continent , and would therefore be a massively compelling argument for the establishment of a permanent European fiscal union alongside the existing monetary union . <p> However , this outcome is far from certain . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be wasted on white elephant vanity projects and corruption while the reforms are blocked by the formidable entrenched stakeholders and patronage networks , it could put a halt to the European project permanently , and could potentially put it into reverse . <p> For countries like South Africa , a strong , growing and united Europe is important . It is South Africa 's second-largest trading partner , and acts as a critical liberal democratic counterbalance and bulwark against Russia and China . <p> " I am certain that we will succeed in implementing this plan , " said Draghi . " I am sure that honesty , intelligence and a care for the future will prevail over corruption , stupidity and vested interests . This certainty is not unconsidered optimism , but trust in Italians , my people and our capacity to work together ... " <p> The rest of the world can only wish him well .

@@62917234 <h> What role should technology play in West African vaccine rollout ? <p> After more than a year of lockdowns and disruption caused by the global Covid-19 pandemic , African countries are preparing for the most ambitious vaccine rollout in human history . <p> By Titilayo Adewumi , regional sales director : West Africa at SAP <p> All eyes are now on the ability of countries to secure , import and distribute the vaccines effectively . This will require investment into local supply chains and a concerted effort by governments and health organisations to build trust with local populations to ensure every person that needs a vaccine is able to receive one . <p> In late February , Ghana became the first country in the world to receive a shipment of vaccines from the Covax initiative when 600 000 doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine arrived . Telco operator MTN Group donated a further 165 000 doses and the Indian government 50 000 more , but the country will need significantly more to adequately cover its 31-million citizens . <p> In early March , Nigeria followed when it received 3,9-million doses . The country plans to vaccinate 40% of its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the end of 2022 . An e-registration portal has been made available where all persons 18 years and older are able to register in the government 's attempt at an efficient and orderly scheduling of vaccination when more doses are available in the country . <p> However , immense challenges remain to sufficiently vaccinate the country 's more than 200-million citizens . In fact , the entire region has much work to do to build trust , enhance local and regional supply chains , effectively engage citizens and implement an effective vaccination rollout . <p> Building trust through citizen engagement , supply chain enhancements <p> Details are still scarce around how precisely the vaccine rollout will be implemented in West Africa . A recent study found high levels of hesitancy and low levels of trust in the vaccination plans of five West African countries : only 31% of respondents said they trust their government ' somewhat ' or ' a lot ' to ensure the vaccine is safe before it is offered to citizens . <p> Governments need high participation rates from citizens if their vaccine rollouts are to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by understanding citizen sentiment throughout the rollout and then quickly respond to and manage any issues that arise . <p> The scale of governments ' vaccination rollouts is unprecedented , which means that current systems and processes are too slow and inflexible to facilitate the vaccination rollout at scale . When one considers the complexities of phased rollouts , multiple doses , and reporting , it is essential that governments leverage technology to streamline data collection , transfer and analysis to speed up rollouts . <p> At a supply chain level , the distribution and administration of vaccines at the scale of COVID-19 is a monumental challenge . There is much at stake because disruptions in the supply chain can prevent the delivery of the vaccine and further impact public trust . <p> Delays are paid for with human lives and push out the prospect of herd immunity . Reacting quickly to unexpected interruptions is key and is only possible if the entire supply chain , from procurement to production and delivery , is managed end-to-end . <p> According to the World Health Organisation 's Vaccine Introduction Readiness Assessment Tool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preparedness for rolling out vaccines to their populations . <p> Bolstering the supply chain and building trust with citizens will be crucial to the effective vaccination of populations in the West Africa region . <p> How tech can support vaccine rollout in West Africa <p> Emerging , emerged and established technologies all have a role to play in the region 's efforts at vaccination . For example , trying to identify which people require vaccines with some attempt at prioritisation could leverage data , data mining , data science and patient segmentation based on various demographic , risk profiling and patient history information . <p> To track vaccine distribution across the region , a combination of technologies including blockchain , analytics , integrated scanners , location tracking tags and mobile apps could provide a framework to show relevant subsets of information to different supply chain stakeholders . <p> In terms of patient engagement , self-service appointment booking , customer experience platforms and patient feedback capture using apps and non-contact in-clinic kiosks can help to determine how well practitioners are fulfilling their duty . Similar platforms can be leveraged to focus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of frontline healthcare practitioners and reducing the risk of burnout . <p> Looking ahead , machine learning and streaming analytics could help identify irregular patterns in data that talk to issues within procurement , production , logistics or financial audits . IoT , 5G , LoRa ( Long Range networks ) and edge computing allows a vast array of use cases to be realised , where sensors can determine the conditions in which stock is being made , stored or shipped , and to allow critical response to be actioned before major incidents arise . <p> The Covid-19 pandemic has introduced unprecedented challenges to the world , and West Africa is no exception . As the region readies itself for the vital process of vaccine distribution , it is critical that there are no unwarranted delays or disruptions . This will also give citizens the confidence that the medicines they are getting are safe and efficient . Technology can play a valuable supporting role to ensure West Africa 's vaccine rollout is a success . 
@@62917235 <h> Optimising customer experience starts with the data <p> Optimising customer experience ( CX ) by leveraging emerging and new technology results in a host of positive spin-offs for businesses but it must be approached in a methodical and strategic manner . <p> Every intervention or technology application relies on how a business collects and associates data with its customers , says Inovo CEO Wynand Smit . <p> " Ultimately , customer service , and by extension , the customer 's experience , lies in the expectations that are set and how the business is measured against those expectations , " says Smit . " There are a number of ways to make this more efficient and proactive , but they rely on getting the basics right , in other words , how the data that already exists in the business is used , " he says . <p> Most businesses have data already , says Smit .

For example , imagine the system picks up that the customer has spoken to the business before and interacted with a particular call centre agent and rated them 10 out of 10 . <p> " That is valuable information that stores this customer 's preferences . By building up a repository of this type of information , the business is laying the foundation to start using predictive models driven by artificial intelligence ( AI ) , for example , " he explains . <p> However , he says that if a business can not efficiently identify a customer and associate their preferences , then it is wasting its time thinking about emerging technology .

One could develop use cases to make the customer experience quicker or more personalised to their tastes , or even develop use cases to increase collections and increase sales , he says . <p> " Assuming the basics are in place , a business could run AI models to try and predict the probability of closing sales by directing customers to certain sales agents , or even proactively mitigate the fallout from tickets that have not been resolved by proactively contacting customers . <p> " The point is that existing and emerging technology provides us with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a business , but it depends on getting the basics right in how it identifies and associates a customer with preferences and context , " he explains . <p> Technology and automation have made measuring and improving all contact channels far more efficient , he says , precisely because it can consolidate a customer 's interaction history and preferences to personalise their journey while providing a single view to the business . <p> " Detailed analytics , which is only possible with good data , can drive efficiencies throughout the business , " says Smit .

@@62920231 <p> NOMPU SIZIBA : It 's our SME special feature . Today we speak to a young entrepreneur based in Soweto , the famous Vilakazi Street to be precise . Before the Covid-19-related lockdown , he ran a bustling gin bar , but then that all changed with the restrictions and he had to think out of the box as to what next . But he 's been one of the lucky ones in that he 's benefited from the assistance of alcohol-beverages player Diageo 's support for SMEs in terms of ticking them over with stock , cash and marketing support . <p> Well , to tell us about his entrepreneurial journey so far , I 'm joined on the line by Nkululeko Maseko . He 's the founder of 88 Beach and 88 Society . Thanks very much , Nkululeko , for joining us . Before the Covid lockdown hit you were running a gin bar on Vilakazi Street . What was the setup of your business , and did you have a lot of custom at that time ? <p> NKULULEKO MASEKO : The gin bar was a really new business that we had started in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ partners we started venturing out into other businesses among ourselves . My pick was Soweto . So I went into Soweto and found a little kind of shopfront . And my deal with the landlord was to build out in front of that shop front , and do kind of a gin deck , Gin Studio type of setup . It really worked well , because it was a kind of a first for Soweto in the sense that we were offering 95% gin-based drinks , or 95% -- that 's the only thing you 'll find behind the bar.You can take like one line of beer , one line of tonic , and so forth . But essentially , at the time were carrying about 120 different gins , and I think people really took to that and they came out to see it . <p> We now have only , unfortunately , it 's just a ...... 1:55 picture ? of people outside , and obviously it was n't as established as we wanted it to be . We had not put out the composite deck aesthetically to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's what we were building towards . I think in any entrepreneurial journey , the aim is really to start , and we started . The Covid situation caught us three months in , and we had to rethink everything that we were planning at that time . <p> NOMPU SIZIBA : Yes . So when the restrictions did kick in towards the end of March 2020 , including of course the alcohol ban , what ran through your mind -- and did you have much in the way of cashflow to see you through the next while in the face of no revenue ? And how did you manage things like your staff situation ? <p> NKULULEKO MASEKO : It caught me in one of the worst spaces because I was in corporate before . I resigned in January 2020 , wanting to go fuller and kind of focus on the business because I was running another business while in corporate ; the other venue we had was in rooms called Lush Lounge . <p> Coming into 2020 , I wanted to go full on , and go into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when they said everything is closed down , I was not ready for that by any means and I took what I got from corporate and kind of sorted out things like school fees for my kids and so forth . The business was really meant to sustain itself and not sustain me . <p> It was really difficult for us to kind of sort out the staff . We lost quite a bit of staff . Some of them were from far away -- on the outskirts of Joburg and even further . Some of them had to return home within that period . There was nothing that we could guarantee , even for them . <p> NOMPU SIZIBA : So what did you do to try and bounce back and do something to get revenue coming in again once the restriction started to be eased ? And tell us about the new format of the business that you 're currently running . <p> NKULULEKO MASEKO : We ran other businesses during Covid , which were Covid-related , and that kind of gave us a little bit of cash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decontaminations ; in fact , we still have it now , and we 're pushing it with some contracts . That really helped us build a little bit of capital . <p> But then our biggest issue was that we looked at the landscape and understood that people had been indoors for all this time and they were looking for new experiences . Yes , they wanted to go out , but in order to catch the market now we had to up the game of what we are offering . <p> We came up with 88 Beach Soweto . Even the name was like a bit of a shock to people hearing it for the first time -- that there was a beach in Soweto . We made a joke about the only beach being open in the country at the time . Chuckling So we did 88 Beach Soweto . It was really the only open kind of venue , or outdoor venue on the street in Soweto . I think it 'll continue to be for quite a long time . We took the property that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ converted the space into literally a beach space . So we got authentic beach sand , we put up some cabanas and really did like a not-seen-before kind of venue within Soweto . <p> I think that changed how people related to this GT ...... ? 5:31 , changed how people related to entertainment offerings . And then we went all the way in terms of entertainment . But I think that support that we got -- at the time it was really based on reaching out to brands like Diageo and their assisting us in kind of bringing back a good flow of entertainment , and just working capital . So their support allowed us to kind of put money back into the bottom line and help . Cashflow is something that you build over time , it 's a really difficult thing . <p> NOMPU SIZIBA : Nkululeko , when and how did you connect with Diageo , the alcohol beverages firm , and what sort of assistance did they provide to you to stay afloat ? <p> NKULULEKO MASEKO : We connected with Diageo for the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Gin Studio , because they 've got a contemporary gin portfolio that they push , which was really good for the Gin Studio . But coming into Soweto , it was important to offer a wider scope of drinks . So we kind of let go of the Gin Studio idea and came into a more contemporary offering of drink occasions , and a wider range of drinks , depending on what we knew consumers wanted . Given my knowledge of the industry , I understood that cognac was a big thing , gin was a big thing , champagne was a big thing . And then I started to tailor the business . Usually you 'd keep six or seven different brands in each category , but we ca n't do that any more just because you do n't want money sitting on your back bar . <p> You want money to come in and then go to the consumer , as it comes . We had to cut down on what we stocked as well . So when we showed them the plan of the beach , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to help . And I think they really pushed us in the direction of just being confident enough to put ourselves out there , knowing that the people would come . We 'd built a really good space and people would want to flock to it . But when they got there , you had to provide an experience that was none like they would find in the rest of the area . It was tricky . <p> NOMPU SIZIBA : I was going to say , how did you manage ? In total there were three alcohol bans . How did you manage with that unpredictability ? <p> NKULULEKO MASEKO : Very difficult , because with the ban we still had like things like weather issues ; when it rains , because it 's a beach-area vibe , you ca n't really cover that . So that was also an issue . And then the bans really took away the momentum in terms of what we were doing . On the one side you 'd find yourself with no cash ; on the other side you 'd have lots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even in the third one , you 'd have lots of stock sitting in your reserves , but very little cash ; and you ca n't convert it because if you convert it you have to go into illicit trade -- and that 's an issue because you can lose your licence . So there 've been a lot of barriers as well . <p> It just puts kind of the flow of things really off . It kills the cashflow . That meant we could n't really pay out everything that we needed to pay out . I remember sitting with every single one of my staff and having to negotiate and say , okay , what do we do ? What else can we take , and how can we do it ? It was n't ideal , but it was like we understood their position . For us it was how do we get through this particular phase of our business , and hopefully on the other side of this it will be okay . <p> NOMPU SIZIBA : Even though regulations have been eased quite substantially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for now , at least -- how difficult is it for you to police things like social distancing at your venue , because people do relax , especially when they 've been drinking and so on ? <p> NKULULEKO MASEKO : In a space like ours it 's very , very hard . In a normal restaurant space , you have dining tables across the room , and then you just section off and say , do n't sit here , sit there , do n't sit here ; or you have takeaway tables and leave really big gaps . For us it 's predominantly lounges and kind of ...... 9:50 day bed ? situations . So quite different to kind of separate people . And another thing is that inherently people just want to be together , people want to be closer to each other . They want to be experiencing that mood or that vibe or that venue in groups . So we managed the whole point of getting temperatures at the gate , making sure people came with masks , documenting everyone who was in the venue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the furniture . But if you do that , you 've got an overflow of people and you ca n't seat them there , and they want to sit there . They see that there is space , but you 're not seating them there , and you 're fighting with them . And then you 're trying to explain Covid again , as if it did n't happen . <p> NOMPU SIZIBA : Very difficult . <p> NKULULEKO MASEKO : It was very , very difficult for us , I must say . <p> NOMPU SIZIBA : So where are you now in terms of the business ? Are you beginning to see steady cash flows , steady custom ? Are you optimistic about the future , barring that we face a third wave and so on ? <p> NKULULEKO MASEKO : We 've looked at everything that could possibly happen . We did this in January for one of the businesses -- we 're now talking about Soweto -- and we thought to ourselves these is a chance of a third wave , winter is coming , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ venue . We literally decided to drop the whole thing and start it over . <p> So we 're actually in a construction phase at the moment , where we are converting . We 've obtained more properties , getting more properties around , and we are now building three other venues . So there 's a final ...... <p> we 'll have on top of the Beach that we are doing with a very popular young black chef we ca n't name at the moment . We are increasing the Beach ...... into Michelin something . And then we are increasing the space within the Beach area from what the capacity was , in order to kind of make provision for things like social distancing , if that continues into the future , because that was an issue . <p> And then we have another space called Society 88 , which is our everyday workflow coffee , and we have a unique food concept that we put in there as well . <p> And then our intention on top of that fine-dining restaurants is to also have a 32-room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got such new and vibrant outlets coming up on the street . There 's a new venue like ...... 13:48 1947 , a really good , beautiful venue . That 's really changing how we offer this service to consumers . <p> And we are also on that bandwagon to say , " from what the street has been before , to what it should be now and into the future " . And if we want it to continue being a tourist destination when things get back , if you want to bring in more investment and invest in the economic growth of the ...... Kazi ? 13:01 economy especially , we have to kind of up the game in terms of the offerings . So we are spending quite a bit of money now and we 've been helped by a couple of companies to make that investment . And we believe that on the other side of this we are very confident that the only thing that will be left is where we are with Covid . <p> But otherwise we would have built a space being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distancing , how food is prepared and where it is prepared , and then kind of doing all the things that , prior to really going into the details , were n't things that we thought about within that space initially ..... 13:41 . <h> AUTHOR PROFILE <p> Nompumelelo Siziba is a business news and television anchor and reporter , with a track record spanning over 17 years .

Image : GCIS <p> Deputy President David Mabuza on Wednesday assured parliament that no corruption had occurred during the government 's process of securing and procuring the Covid-19 vaccines . <p> " From where I am sitting , I am quite confident in the process ... that we have followed all processes to ensure that there is no corruption . We have an interministerial committee that is looking at all these processes , and if we detect any sign of corruption , we follow it , " said Mabuza . <p> Answering Covid-19 questions , Mabuza said legally binding nondisclosure agreements compelled the government to share limited information with the public . <p> " I take it that in the final analysis the auditor-general will be able to see the value for money . We will be able to disclose to the AG why we paid so much instead of paying so much . But , in this case , it 's either we take it or leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prices and in certain instances . Some give you a discount and others do n't , " said the deputy president . <p> Answering a question by ACDP 's Kenneth Meshoe on the No Fault Compensation Fund , Mabuza said : " In our case as SA , it was either we accept these clauses as a country or we do not have to accept these clauses as a country , or we do not have any access to any of the vaccines . " <p> The South African government was compelled to establish the scheme -- which will protect citizens who may suffer injury , loss or death during the vaccination programme -- as part of a precondition made by vaccine manufactures Johnson &amp; Johnson and Pfizer . <p> The scheme , which is estimated to cost the taxpayer R250m in the first year , is going to be headed by retired chief justice Sandile Ngcobo . <p> " We have a responsibility to ensure that our people are protected through this scheme . Manufacturers of the Covid-19 vaccines will not make any contribution to this no-fault compensation system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ countries that acquire Covid-19 vaccines , " said Mabuza . <p> He said the government had learnt lessons from recent experiences of governments who were reporting potential cases of severe side effects among vaccinated members of their population , that such a scheme is very important . <p> " The Covid-19 injury no-fault compensation fund ( which will operate for a limited time ) will contain and minimise the effects that may arise as a response to the Covid-19 pandemic . <p> " As we take lessons from the implementation of SA 's Covid-19 response plan , we continue to forge ahead with plans for building capacity to manufacture vaccines locally though harnessing our existing manufacturing capabilities in partially state-owned Biovac Institution as well as research &amp; development capabilities with partners in Brics , " he said . <p> Mabuza said SA was encouraged by a recent announcement of an anticipated waver on intellectual property rights on Covid-19 vaccines that is proposed by SA and India and now supported by the US . <p> The proposal , he said , establishes a global solution to enhance manufacturing and boost supply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patent protection . <p> In a follow-up question , Meshoe asked Mabuza how the country planned to fund the scheme and he responded by saying SA had already acceded to the preconditions and the cabinet had agreed to establish the fund because the vaccination process must continue . <p> " We have signed the agreements with the intentions that we must proceed and vaccinate our nation so that we can fight this pandemic . Of course in medicine , whatever medicine that you take , there are side-effects , depending on the comorbidities you carry as a human being . " <p> Mabuza said the government was not aiming to introduce any tax to establish the fund and again assured parliament that the government was not being secretive about the negotiations . <p> " I think every vaccine that we receive goes through a process . Our regulatory body checks whether these vaccines are suitable to be consumed by our people . " <p> He said the government does not just simply acquire vaccines , it follows a process . <p> The South African Health Regulatory Authority has been asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vaccine and China 's Sinovac so the government can have more options . <p> DA MP Siviwe Gwarube said with the detection of a new variant and the looming third wave the government was lagging on its targets . <p> Posing a question to Mabuza , she said , " How can we trust the government will be able to roll out to the rest of SA on Monday ( May 17 ) when the rollout has been incredibly slow ? Would you also acknowledge that this vaccination programme has been a spectacular failure on the part of government ? " <p> To which he responded : " Yes we accept that our vaccination process has been very slow , I think affected by a number of factors . " <p> Mabuza reminded parliament about the hiccup during the procurement of the AstraZeneca vaccines which later had to be sold to AU countries because their efficacy was not up to standard . <p> While there were delays , Mabuza said , the country would meet its targets . <p> " We are confident that we are going to receive our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the vaccination and start in earnest with phase two , and move with speed .

@@62924231 <h> ISS TODAY : ANALYSIS <p> Mauritius 's history of drug policy has been predominantly punitive . The Dangerous Drugs Act of 2000 continues to punish people caught for personal drug use with imprisonment or a fine , or both . These measures have n't led to a decrease in drug consumption . ( Photo : pixabay.com ) <h> Mauritius is an example of how approaches globally neglect the stigma and discrimination faced by female users . <p> Mary ( not her real name ) was a smart student living in Mauritius who dreamt of becoming a social worker . After losing contact with my childhood friend and classmate in high school , we met up 10 years later . She was n't a social worker . A struggling single mother of two , she had become addicted to drugs . <p> The father of Mary 's children , also a user , was arrested and imprisoned for drug dealing . Her children were removed to state care , and although she learnt skills in rehab such as handcraft and sewing , she struggled to resume a normal life . Finding work was difficult and she could n't get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't unique to Mauritius . It is a common experience of female drug users in Africa and globally . It 's also a good example of how in most parts of the world , drug policies , especially those dealing with rehabilitation , often fail to consider the gendered aspect of users , specifically women . While the concept of gender encompasses both males and females , the focus here is on women recovering from drug use . <p> Mauritius is often hailed as an African country that exemplifies good governance and human development . The island has made some strides in achieving gender equality , ranking 20th in sub-Saharan Africa according to the World Economic Forum 's 2017 Global Gender Gap Report . <p> In the education sector , 58.2% of students in tertiary institutions in 2018 were female . In 2019 , women made up around 39% of most senior positions in government services compared to 37% in 2018 . Mauritius appointed its first female president , Dr Ameenah Gurib-Fakim , in 2015 . In 2019 the World Bank ranked the country as one of the top six @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's equality of opportunity . <p> However , these achievements shadow a sinister side to the island . Mauritius had one of the highest rates of drug use per capita in Africa in 2010 . Rates of heroin injection were also high , with a prevalence of 61.8% among females and 42.5% among males in 2013 . <p> Mauritius 's history of drug policy has been predominantly punitive . The Dangerous Drugs Act of 2000 continues to punish people caught for personal drug use with imprisonment or a fine , or both . These measures have n't led to a decrease in drug consumption . And many negative consequences have emerged , particularly regarding public health . In 2005 , 92% of new HIV/Aids infections in Mauritius were among people who inject drugs . <p> This health crisis was a turning point for the government , which started introducing harm-reduction services . In 2017 , the rate of new HIV infections among people who inject drugs had fallen to 32.4% . It was the first time in over 10 years that females injecting drugs had a lower HIV prevalence at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Due to the stereotypes of women as society 's nurturers , homemakers and caregivers , female drug users globally tend to be stigmatised more than males . Woman users are perceived as being at the bottom of the social strata , below their male counterparts . Those who manage to escape their situation tend to be rejected by their peers and society . <p> Drug consumption is often driven by poverty and social neglect . However , drug policies mostly neglect these issues , favouring measures that eradicate and outlaw narcotics . And approaches that do consider social problems do n't necessarily account for gender . This is because policy generally tends to be formulated to deal with specific situations rather than specific groups of people . <p> " Policies are documents which often do not reflect the reality of people on the ground , " says Dr Craig Moffat , head of the Governance Delivery and Impact programme at Good Governance Africa . " From a policy perspective , everyone is treated the same with a level playing field . " <p> However , society is n't equal . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ using drugs due to the gender roles they are assigned . Inadvertently , policy can become a tool of oppression -- an example being the rehabilitation aspect of Mauritius 's drug policies . <p> While the country has made promising advances , the rehabilitation policy mostly fails to account for gender . Its provisions for helping women earn an income and integrate back into their communities are limited . After completing rehabilitation , male drug users are more likely to find low-skill jobs than women , predominantly due to the gender gap in Mauritius 's labour market . <p> To address this gap , organisations have started establishing rehabilitation facilities catering for females only . They help women acquire skills to start micro-businesses in their local areas . While these skills can be helpful , such programmes must guard against perpetuating gender stereotypes by focusing on ' women 's work ' . As Mary 's story shows , handcraft and sewing are often ineffective in helping women earn an income . <p> When drug policies and implementation plans are designed , they must consider how men and women will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ direct experience of drug addiction in their drafting and application . <p> A better understanding is needed of the different ways women are excluded from drug policies and how this omission reinforces stereotypes that cause them more harm . Former head of the African Union unit on Drug Control and Crime Prevention Grace Adetula says a first step is " to obtain gender-disaggregated data on drug users , " without invading women 's privacy . <p> The government could partner with rehabilitation centres to work with community programmes and users ' families to dispel stigma and discrimination . Support to women who have recovered from addiction could also include financial assistance and helping them reunite with , and take care of , their children . <p> The marginalisation and stigma based on gender and gender-based violence are key factors propelling former female users back into the drug abuse cycle . Until drug policies become more gender-sensitive , many women like Mary will continue to be consigned to the lowest rung in society .

The academy was later taken over by another firm , Cobham , that was training the Nigerian air force at the site in October last year when Declassified visited , amid complaints from local residents about disruption caused by the helicopter noise.Amnesty International spokesman Oliver Feeley-Sprague told Declassified : " Nigeria 's security forces have committed horrendous abuses against civilians stretching back many years . <p> " Can Cobham show that it has conducted the necessary checks to ensure that it is not in any way linked to human rights abuses in Nigeria ? Cobham is a private company , but ultimately the buck stops with the UK @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overhaul of the way that military training is regulated . " <p> Although the site in Newquay is next door to a Royal Air Force base , a UK government minister told parliament that the Ministry of Defence ( MOD ) is not routinely informed about which foreign nationals are being taught by the company to fly helicopters . <p> Feeley-Sprague commented : " The provision of military training and assistance should be licensed in the same way as the export of arms and security equipment is , with a legal obligation on ministers and officials to decline licences where there 's a clear risk that UK training could contribute and facilitate to military and security forces around the world carrying out human rights violations .

" They do low passes every three or four minutes for hours at a time . Most people in our village thought these were police helicopters because of the way they 're painted , " Nelson commented . <p> " Having seen Declassified 's coverage last year , villagers are absolutely appalled about what is going on at Newquay Airport .

@@62929237 <h> Stardew Valley - Review <p> Editor 's Note : This review and score replaces our original March 2016 review . Read more on IGN 's re-review policy . <p> Each time I start up a new farm in Stardew Valley or return to my 100-hour save on PC , I feel like I 'm going home . There 's a comfort in Stardew Valley that I 've rarely found in other games . The music that changes with each season perfectly fits the mellowness of the 16-bit countryside town , and all the activities that await offer both peace in my daily routines and excitement in the land 's mysteries . Whether you want to farm , fish , fight monsters , craft , mine , become everyone 's best friend , or do a little bit of everything , this farming adventure has plenty to offer . <p> As we said in our original review , Stardew Valley " beautifully combines farm simulation with RPG elements to create an intriguing , absorbing rural world , " and it 's only gotten better with each massive free update . Multiplayer , new items , buildings , farm types @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better foundation and more of a reason to stick around past the coveted event in the third in-game year . <p> The five new farm maps offer better focus for players than when Stardew Valley first launched . Each of the farms ' designs encourages different types of work -- farming , fishing , foraging , mining , and combat . Each map 's activities are a relief from the grips of Joja Corporation , the cold , in-game company that encroaches on Pelican Town . <p> Stardew Valley 's story is a simple , yet satisfying one . You inherit your grandfather 's farm after leaving the grind of your job with the Joja Corporation . Once settled on the farm , you then have to decide whether to support the local Joja Mart or rebuild the decaying community center . This conflict is the driving factor in the two or so years that span Stardew Valley 's story , but once that 's all completed , befriending and learning about the townspeople introduce other contained stories . <h> The residents of Pelican Town and beyond are a charming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are a charming bunch , though improving your relationship with each of them is rather superficial . All you have to do is give them presents they like twice a week to slowly earn their trust and affection . Giving them items they dislike can lower their affection level , so that at least encouraged me to try and figure out what each person enjoys most and to get creative with my gifts once I had some expendable resources well into my second year . That 's right , Maru -- you 've been upgraded to pepper poppers . <p> Despite the system 's simplicity , it 's still rewarding to learn about each person 's dreams , passions , and challenges living in Stardew Valley . There 's a friendly monster who just wants to sell his merchandise to nice people , an artist who 's a little too shy to share her artwork , a bitter old man who 's hesitant to make connections , a scientist who studies the valley 's wildlife , and plenty other interesting folks . <p> After reaching certain friendship or romance levels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the right time and place . The 12 romanceable characters have more scenes than others , and if you choose to marry one , they move into your home and actually help around the farm every now and then . It 's a welcome benchmark for the late game . NPCs are also the key to learning certain food recipes and crafting blueprints , so there 's value in befriending them beyond discovering their interests and personal conflicts . They 'll even send a small gift back to you occasionally . <h> Sprouting Charm <p> The changing of seasons in Stardew Valley is perhaps one of the most exciting events . Where summer has plenty of sunny days with a few useful thunderstorms here and there -- with the right tools , you can make batteries with the lighting ! -- the snow-covered ground in winter prevents any crops growing outside , leaving the season 's activities a little more up in the air if you 're primarily a farmer . Every season has its own enjoyable pace that comes with the varying weather , crop types , NPC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep things engaging . Each season runs for 28 days , so figuring out how to best spend them is a great challenge as each in-game year passes . By the time I reached the end of my second year , I felt confident in my daily routine and farming strategies . <p> Farming is n't overly complex , but the methodical nature of it is relaxing . It does take a fair bit of time in the first year to make enough money to get a good number of the best seeds , optimize your farmland , implement a watering system , and figure out a routine to take care of it all . Stardew Valley has levels for each main mechanic -- farming , fishing , mining , combat , and foraging . Figuring out how to make the most of my days was a great challenge early on when I had a low energy meter for executing actions like chopping wood , tilling soil , and using the watering can , all without extra farming bonuses from my level . But even when that energy meter grew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I found in farming came from managing more land and deciding whether or not to process the farmed goods to make them into more profitable artisan goods or do something else with them entirely . For instance , I could sell all my grapes , cook them for my own consumption for energy and health , or I could save them to make jelly or wine with the craftable preserves jar and keg . Adding farm animals to the mix made for even more welcome diversity in my daily farming routine . <p> Even with the big updates , Stardew Valley still has the mild problem of having so much to do with little explanation for how to do it , but there certainly is a joy to creating your own routines and discovering what works best for how you want to play . The in-game TV show Living off the Land provides good tips on mechanics and seasonal changes , but there 's not a whole lot of help on how to use some of the less straightforward items . For instance , a great new item picks up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I had to use a guide to figure out how to actually get it to work . On the other hand , new items like the planter pot make the early game a little easier . It allows the player to grow any plant per pot indoors regardless of the season , making it especially helpful for completing some early important challenges and requests from villagers that are easy to miss once a season ends . <p> When I was n't farming or petting farm animals , I was foraging for the season 's natural goods ( which is as simple as walking around and picking them off the ground ) or fishing . Stardew Valley tracks everything you 've had in your collection , so there 's definitely an incentive to try each main activity . Unlike farming , where you need to buy seeds to grow the next thing on the list , there 's a strict schedule to when certain fish are available , and some of them are incredibly difficult to catch . The fishing minigame itself is easygoing fun for the small fries but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rare fish . Still , that challenge is something I 'm looking forward to conquering eventually once I craft enough of the right tackles and stock up on bait to lure the rare beasts in . <h> Stardew Valley really has a thing for collecting , and I 'm very into it . <p> Mining and combat , on the other hand , are a little more straightforward . The main mine has a handful of enemies that progressively get stronger with each of its 100 levels , and an additional cavern in an unlockable area houses even more difficult monsters and a seemingly infinite number of floors . Spelunking through the main cave is a dangerous endeavor early on , but obtaining better weapons and armor through the shop , chests , enemy drops , or through reaching new combat levels make it more manageable . The combat consists of simple button mashing to swing a sword , so pairing monster fights with the challenge of descending into a mine makes it a lot more fun and rewarding . The added difficulty of getting out of the mine before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pressure on for making it through the caves as efficiently as possible . Then , there are challenges from a group called the Adventurer 's Guild to clear a certain number of the more popular monster types , so there 's yet another incentive to descend the mines to slay monsters . Oh , and there 's even more collecting involved as you mine old and strange artifacts that can be donated to the local museum for even more rewards . Stardew Valley really has a thing for collecting , and I 'm very into it . <p> Regardless of their varying complexity , progression through all five skills is constant and rewarding . In addition to that basic fulfillment , just about every skill level has some sort of craftable reward and helps build your proficiency , or lowers the amount of energy required to use a tool . At skill levels five and 10 , you get to specialize your character further by choosing professions that give bonus stats to certain actions . For example , a rancher gets more gold from animal products , but tillers sell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ further at level 10 . I 'm halfway into my third year in Stardew Valley and I still have n't finished getting all my skills to level 10 . Like with real life , there 's potential to do a lot in a day , but how it 's spent is entirely up to you . When you add someone else to your farm , though , those days can be a whole lot more productive . <h> Ripened Co-Op <p> Multiplayer is a fantastic addition to Stardew Valley that entirely changes how the game can be played . As expected , it helps you accomplish far more in a day if you have a cooperative farmhand , but does so without feeling too much like a cheat code . When a friend joins they get their own home ( that the main player can enter and customize ) and have to start a new character from scratch . This means they have low energy , weak starting tools , hardly any crafting recipes , and no skill perks . While it would have been nice to have the option @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tools -- maybe even at a cost -- starting fresh is the more balanced trade-off for having multiple people on a farm . <p> You share money with up to three farmhands/friends who can meddle in your belongings , so it 's not entirely too difficult to get new players up to speed if you 're adding them to an established farm . Still , having to support others ' endeavors out of your pocket helps multiplayer maintain that balance between difficulty and power , and you can even change the profit margins for your co-op save if you feel like you 're making too much money . The updates added some incredibly useful but expensive items , so I definitely have n't complained about making more gold every day . If you 're starting a new farm together , I could see how splitting up each task could make that first challenging year easier to take on , and maybe even more fun . Someone who prefers to fish or mine could focus on that while someone who likes farming could look after the crops . <p> Farmhands have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ game , too , which is an important incentive for helping out a friend on their farm since it gives them both a stake in your land and in the rest of your game , too . They can upgrade their home and even get married to your character or an NPC you have n't romanced . It might be a bit tedious to have to go through the whole courting process again if you 've already unlocked everything on your primary farm , but I appreciate that it offers a chance to start a new romance with a different character and to essentially establish a new life on a farm that can progress while you 're not there if the primary farmer chooses to play without you . <p> My friend was incredibly helpful in kicking off the summer farming season as we toiled away for days leading up to it , calculating how many seeds of a specific fruit we 'd need . Communication happens through a simple in-game text chat that 's equipped with plenty of great emojis . It ended up being an expensive season because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that investment my friend suggested has definitely paid off . Though his farming suggestions were helpful , spelunking with him was even more fun . Together we slayed plenty of monsters and got further in the challenge cavern than I had before . The easygoing nature of Stardew Valley also creates a wonderfully pleasant space to hang out with friends , which is a nice thing to have when so many multiplayer games are set in rather tense situations . <h> Pros <p> Blend of genres <p> Complex characters <p> Plenty to do <p> Lots of secrets <h> Cons <p> Limited social system <h> The Verdict <p> After dozens of hours , I 'm nowhere near done with everything in Stardew Valley . One note I found on my farm promised an important event in my third year , I still do n't know what 's at the bottom of the mine , and I need to figure out who I want to marry . With so many interconnected systems , from the farm simulation to simple combat and cooking to crafting , and each driving the others forward in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ game than you 'd expect after the first day on the farm . There 's plenty to do while I wait to uncover more of the Valley 's secrets , and the prospect of filling my days with new adventures or just a better harvest is too enticing to pass up .

@@62939234 <h> PS5 Shortages Worsening : No New Consoles Until 2022 <p> Ever since the launch of the next generation of gaming , Sony and Microsoft fans have struggled to secure their very own unit of both the PlayStation 5 and the Xbox Series X and S models . While Microsoft has dealt better with the shortage in materials and various technologies due to the pandemic , Sony has struggled more with getting their PlayStation 5 's out to the gaming world . Its delays are projected to reach even worse circumstances , according to reports by various reputable sources . <p> According to Gaming Bolt , the PlayStation 5 's shortages in supply have been rising the day the console was released in 2020 . A collection of issues ranging from obviously high demand and anticipation , supply factories and lines being impacted by the effects of COVID-19 , greedy scalpers buying up all the consoles to sell at absorbent markups , and an overall , worldwide shortage of technologies all contributed to ongoing stocking problems . <h> What has Sony said about this ? <p> Sony tried to affirm with fans of the PlayStation brand that their supply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secure a PlayStation 5 unit in due time . Unfortunately , Sony 's CFO Hiroki Totoki urged that even if they could produce more , they would undoubtedly fall well below the demand of the popular console . Bloomberg 's report furthers that Sony does n't expect demand for the console to go down any time this year . It 's safe to say that anyone anywhere near the gaming did n't have to attend an oversized suit-and-tie meeting with a slew of analysts and clipboards to tell you that . <h> How is Sony handling the PS5 shortage ? <p> There have been some ideas about what Sony is going to do about PlayStation 5 shortages in the coming years . However , CFO Totoki continued his thoughts about their concerns . He suggested that Sony should find a workaround for these issues . <h> Semiconductor Shortage <p> CFO Totoki talked about the shortage of semiconductor chips and how that is a huge reason they are short on supplying PlayStation 5 's to the demanding community . His idea would be that the company search for readily available alternatives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problem with that by fans would be the performance not matching up with current models . <p> Typically , when you purchase a console , you assume that every version of that console is the same unless the creator announces model changes . For example , the PlayStation Portable , or PSP for short , saw nearly five different models in its lifetime . Their differences were subtle , and you would n't know it was different unless you owned an older one yourself . Still , with each update in hardware , there is usually an adjustment to the price or even the machine 's aesthetic . <h> PlayStation 5 Design <p> Another possible solution would be to change the look of the PlayStation 5 . People who have the current model are aware of its awkward design . However , players and fans of Sony have warmed up to the idea ( the power and performance of the machine made it easy ) . Changing the PlayStation 5 's design would be a great way to lower or modify the materials needed to make a functional console . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a " slim " model of a console does n't usually come out until about three to four years after the original machine has been released . PlayStation 5 has been out for less than a year , and they are already looking at changing the console model . This will get them back ahead of competitors in terms of the media and investors , but there 's a bit of a " space race " when it comes to dropping consoles . This seems like a reasonable option , but only time will tell how this affects their position in the gaming market . <h> What can I do about obtaining a PlayStation 5 ? <p> There is nothing you can do at the moment . At least , there is nothing LOGICAL you can do as there are ways to get a copy . However , they might not be ideal in this current climate , but you will want to avoid getting a PlayStation 5 as much as possible . Here are a few reasons why . <h> High Demand <p> When something is in high demand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Specifically , you want to be 100% sure that the PlayStation 5 you order is purchased on a reputable site . There are tons of sites out there looking for thirsty Sony fans who are vulnerable to being scammed . <p> If you see a PlayStation 5 available on sketchy sites or ones that you 've never heard of , click away . Most of the time , it 's a fake advertisement looking to steal parts of your identity or straight up steal your money . It costs nothing to start a site , so they do n't care if angry customers report them because , by the time they get taken down , they 've already taken from hundreds if not thousands of excited PlayStation 5 fans . <p> Also , the PlayStation 5 is in such high demand that you should already be concerned about its legitimacy when you see one for sale . People are either selling it because there is something wrong with it or selling it at a ridiculously marked-up price . <h> Scalpers <p> Speaking of marked-up prices , every time a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to order all available units . The reason they do this is so that later on down the line when the supply inevitably rises , they can get in front of the buyer and sell the units they 've procured . The only problem is there is never any practical intent with these people , and they almost always want you to pay more . <p> Unfortunately , it 's never fifty dollars more or even a hundred dollars more . It 's usually a $500 thing being market up by 200% . The sad part is that people still buy them , which makes this a great way to make money in front of any major tech launch . We 've seen this tactic stretch beyond the gaming industry , but video game launches are among the most prominent tech launches in the world , so we see it happen time and time again . <h> Be patient <p> We know that you want your PlayStation 5 now ; however , analysts and CFO Totoki himself believe that there wo n't be another consistent push of PlayStation 5 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that type of delay in a long time , but it makes sense due to this world 's current climate . <p> The best thing you can do is to be patient . We do n't know what it will take for you to get to a stage where you can accept this reality , but by the time the PlayStation 5 's stock is normalized again , it might not even look like or cost what it does today . Just enjoy what you have now , or play some Halo or Gears of War . <h> Do you have a PlayStation 5 ? <p> Were you being lucky enough to get the PlayStation 5 ? If so , let us know what your favourite games to play are . <p> If you 've been playing games like Grand Theft Auto 5 , you should visit Eldorado.gg because you can take some of your GTA V Money and trade it for some real money .

Dr Eric Albertini of the Future Fit Academy unpacks ' curiosity ' as one of the 15 ' future fit skills ' that are critical to being relevant and competent , if not advanced , in the future of work . We live in an ever-changing world of volatility , uncertainty , complexity and ambiguity , often referred to as a ' VUCA ' world . To stay relevant and add value in a VUCA world , you can not rely on existing skills . Your propensity to ask questions , try new things and suspend judgement is what matters . <p> The ability to learn faster than others is another distinct competitive advantage , but while learning enables change , it is curiosity that underpins an intentional learning mindset . Research by Dr Mathias Gruber at the University of California revealed that curiosity prepares the brain for learning and fortified long-term memory . Simply put , curiosity is about wanting to know more about something or indeed , someone . Curiosity is about willingly embracing new experiences , unknown situations and different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foundation for discovery . <p> Harvard Business School reports that cultivating curiosity throughout an organisation helps leaders and employees better adapt to uncertain and changing market conditions and external pressures . Curiosity allows for one to think more deeply and critically , without judging too quickly , and arrive at more creative solutions . For businesses , the benefits of an organisational culture that supports and encourages curiosity include : <p> Fewer decision-making errors as a result of reduced confirmation bias . Confirmation bias occurs when one looks for information that supports one 's beliefs rather than for evidence suggesting that they are wrong . <p> Increased innovation - when we are curious , we view tough situations more creatively and it makes us more observant of new ideas . This opens us up to new worlds and possibilities . <p> Reduced group conflict - curiosity encourages members of a group to put themselves in one another 's shoes and to take an interest in the ideas of others rather than their own perspective . This allows groups to work together more effectively , conflicts are less heated and groups @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - curiosity encourages communication and hence better team performance . With increased curiosity , people are more willing to share information openly and tend to listen more carefully to understand the perspectives of other people . <p> Curiosity brings excitement and optimism into life -- the curious mind is always attracted to new things and ways of doing things . Instead of feeling bored , stagnant and " empty " , curious people live a more adventurous life and more readily explore the unknown and uncertain . <p> Interpersonal curiosity is also the key to building meaningful and lasting relationships . Recent research has found that high and consistent levels of curiosity correlate with mental wellbeing and life satisfaction . Curious people also seem less susceptible to depression . Curiosity may indeed be critical in managing one of the vagaries of the post Covid-19 pandemic - that of mental illness . <p> The good news -- curiosity can be nurtured <p> We are all born with an innate ability to be curious . Research shows that the average four-year old asks an astounding 200-300 questions a day . The bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! <p> Seemingly , advancing age and a complacency that ' we 've seen it all ' dulls our natural curiosity . Robert Stokoe , director of the Jumeirah English-Speaking Schools in Dubai nailed it when he said " the creative adult is the curious child who survived . " <p> Why has curiosity been devalued in our society , and why this ten-fold decline in curiosity from childhood to adulthood ? <p> At a business level , a Harvard Business School study revealed that : <p> Although 92 percent of workers credit curious people with bringing new ideas into teams and profess curiosity is a catalyst for job satisfaction , innovation and high performance , 70 percent state they face barriers to asking more questions while only 24 percent claim they feel curious in their jobs . <p> C-level executives often shy away from encouraging curiosity because they believe the company would be harder to manage if employees were allowed to ask too many questions , challenge the status quo and explore their own interests .

Research done by Susan Engel , a Senior Lecturer in Psychology and Founding Director of the Program in Teaching at Williams College , found that in our traditional schooling system , ' sitting still , being quiet and not wasting time ' are valued far more than fostering and allowing curiosity . ' This ' sausage factory ' mentality still dominates in many educational environments . <p> The good news is that you can reignite and nurture your curiosity . <p> Dr Todd Kashdan of George Mason University refers to the five dimensions of curiosity : <p> Joyous Exploration -- the prototype of curiosity , the recognition and desire to seek out new knowledge and information and the subsequent joy of learning and growing . <p> Deprivation Sensitivity - has a distinct emotional tone , with anxiety and tension being more prominent than joy .

@@63006230 <h> Banning firearms for self-defence will make things worse for women in SA , says IRR <p> Gender-based violence is a serious problem in South Africa , with countless women and young girls at the receiving end of senseless violence . According to saferspaces.org , a shocking 25%-40% of all women in South Africa have experienced physical and/or sexual abuse over their lifetime . Equally horrifying are the murder figures . In 2009 , 56% of all women murdered in SA were killed by an intimate , male partner . Our police service is seemingly unable to bring this under control , with many cases of rape and abuse going unreported due to the lack of proper policing . Now , the IRR is arguing that banning firearms for self-defence will only make things worse for women in SA -- who are already at great risk . IRR analyst Amy-Claire Mouton believe that the state is using the legislation to evade responsibility for the country 's high crime rate , " by trying to blame law-abiding gun owners rather than addressing crime and holding criminals -- and the police -- accountable .

She says : ' Bheki Cele @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm going to be very bold and upfront in saying that . Women are being slaughtered in South Africa day in and day out at the hands of their abusers without firearms . And let it be on record that there are many policemen who attack their own wives and children in their home and , even when it is reported , their own superiors do n't take their firearms away from them ... Bheki Cele does n't understand that a woman who is 68kg ( or ) 70kg ... has got no physical chance against a man who is 100kg or over . ' <p> Mmekwa argues that taking away legal gun-ownership will not only fail to solve the country 's high crime rates but will also do nothing to protect women and curb gender-based-violence . Instead , it will leave women defenceless and victims of attackers who have the upper hand ( both in terms of physical advantage and illegal weapons ) . <p> Morton says the IRR believes the state is attempting to use legislation to evade responsibility for South Africa 's high crime rate by trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holding criminals -- and the police -- accountable . <p> She says the IRR has investigated arguments that law-abiding firearm owners are a major causal factor in serious and violent crime , that gun-ownership places women at risk , and that households with guns are unlikely to use them effectively to fend off an attack .

Pillay weighs in on the matter . -- Jarryd Neves <p> Kanthan Pillay on the proposed Firearms Control Act : <p> Essentially , what the Minister of Police has done is manufactured an emergency . It 's a classic play by governments around the world . The way in which you manufacture an emergency , in this case , is you end up not paying the service providers that are essential for actually processing forensic evidence -- it 's called the PCM system . Right now we have this absurd situation where there are more than six million pieces of forensic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ criminal cases that are sitting there unprocessed . <p> That 's the first emergency that the Minister of Police creates . The second emergency is they have their own firearm permit system , called FPS . It 's meant to actually track where firearms are . The SAPS has failed to maintain that . So , we have a situation where in Gauteng alone , there 's something like 84,000 SAPS firearms which have been lost or stolen . <p> On where the missing firearms go : <p> In terms of the other numbers we 're talking about , since June last year -- the figures that most of the gun lobby groups have been tracking and they 've got data to actually back this up -- there 's something like 500,000 unaccounted firearms in this country . The level of incompetence that we have is unreal . <p> You have well-meaning groups like Gun Free South Africa who say , " let 's organise an arms collection , let 's organise amnesty . " The firearms get collected and guess what happens ? Within the police ranks , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place . Those end up on the streets and end up being used by criminals . While people who are using firearms for self-defence , end up not being able to go through the legal process of obtaining firearms . <p> On training people to use firearms : <p> We were essentially proposing that primarily schoolgirls should be taught the safe use of firearms . The idea behind teaching is not to provide them with guns , but to actually up-skill them -- so that when they become responsible adults , they are able to safely acquire and carry firearms for self-protection . This ties in with gender-based violence and the incredibly high levels of criminality that we have in our country . <p> I personally think that we need to take this one step further . The solution that we need to be looking at is not to scale back on the use of firearms . We really need to go full blown Swiss army route -- which is to train every single South African in the use of firearms . That pretty much , in terms of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of autonomy and every Swiss home pretty much has guns . But it is one of the countries that has the lowest rates of violence in the world . <p> On the potential effects of the proposed legislation , if passed : <p> I know there 's been a lot of alarmist stuff that says they 're going to come and confiscate your firearms , but the process of actually acquiring a legal firearm is going to be significantly more difficult . The economic impact , I think , is going to be huge . Hunting and sports shooting provides a significant uptick in terms of our economy . It is going to affect the sports fraternity . It is going to affect the ability of tourists coming into this country to hunt , which is a significant source of revenue for us . If people are contributing to our country 's overall prosperity by spending their dollars here , that 's great . But from the point of view of individual gun owners , it 's going to become a lot more difficult for you to suddenly have someone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> On what this would mean for women , who are already a target for violence in South Africa : <p> It 's making it significantly harder for a young girl to get through the starting gates in order to get trained in the use of firearms . We have the process right now where firstly , the licensing applies to the firearm rather than the person . I 'm suggesting -- and a lot of other people have suggested this as well -- it should be like a driver 's license , where you become competent in the use of the piece of equipment and then go through the process of acquiring it . <p> This act is now suggesting that your firearm license is only valid for five years . It makes absolutely no sense because if you 're a responsible gun owner and they know exactly where the firearm is , what is the issue ? You do n't suddenly need to take your car for a roadworthy and relicensing every five years . You simply pay your fee every year and everything 's fine . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It 's making it far more difficult . The process becomes onerous . The problem with that , when you consider just how inefficient our public service is , you have the net impact of immediately making criminals out of people whose firearm licenses do n't get processed in time .

@@63006233 <h> Battlefield 2042 First Look : Man vs . Man vs . Nature <h> Who will defeat you first : the enemy team , or the environment itself ? <p> The world , according to Battlefield 2042 , has only a scant few decades left of normalcy before all hell breaks loose . The atlas has been ravaged by climate catastrophe , as vast swathes of the population are plagued by food , water , and energy shortages . Nations collapse in on themselves , and countless refugees pour through the borders of the few superpowers left afloat . <p> The United States and Russia are engaged in total war , with those same stateless exiles , known as No-Pats , taking sides in the bloody conflicts that now dot the globe . Needless to say , Battlefield 2042 does not have an optimistic outlook on humanity 's near future . For a franchise that has traditionally fixated on some of the most triumphant warfronts in human history -- most recently returning to the heroism of World War II -- 2042 represents a sobering change in tone . There do not appear to be any good guys or bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Longtime Battlefield developer DICE , as usual , has leveraged the prodigious capabilities of its Frostbite engine to deliver the apocalypse in startling detail . Battlefield 2042 intends to up the ante of the series ' formula in every way . The player-count has been juiced to 128 players , ( though the cap remains at 64 players on PS4 and Xbox One ) , the class system is more modular than ever before , and the studio has gone to great lengths to render our coming dystopia . <p> In the multiplayer map Kaleidoscope , set in South Korea , rogue super-tornadoes tear through the alabaster downtown skyline , sucking up every man , woman , and vehicle in its path . In Hourglass , set in a glistening Persian Gulf metropolis , a torrid , red-hued sandstorm threatens to completely envelop both armies . Breakaway , which takes place in northern Antarctica , will push " soldiers to the brink , as an industry clashes with nature and ice gives way . " The gameplay remains pure Battlefield -- Conquest and Breakthrough modes both return -- and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ points like they did all the way back in Wake Island . The only difference is that they 're now inhabiting a universe that is pushing back against them . There have n't been many triple-A video games that force the player to confront the ecological crimes of humanity , and Battlefield is n't pulling any punches . <p> DICE has made some smart changes along the way to furnish the first installment of the franchise on modern consoles . The traditional four-pronged class system has been upgraded into a cast of bespoke " specialists . " Think of them like the operators in Rainbow Six Siege . Each has both a munitional speciality and a trait , which helps define them in the warfront . Take Maria Falck , one of the four specialists already announced , who fits nicely into the support role . She comes equipped with a ranged healing pistol and the passive ability to juice her targets back to full health ( as opposed to the partial revive saddled on other players ) , which could come in handy among thoughtful parties . <p> DICE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imagine could allow for some technical , League of Legends-style compositional strategy that the series has lacked in the past .

@@63006234 <h> midnight-special - Review <h> Michael Shannon is a dad on a mission in this super-powered tale . <p> There is something different about Jeff Nichols ' Midnight Special . The Mud writer/director is back with a new , hybrid tale of what one set of parents will go through to save their son . <p> While the stakes involved in saving any child are tremendous , the boy in question , Alton ( Jaeden Lieberher ) , is different . Alton , whom the audience first sees with a pair of swim goggles on despite being under a sheet in a hotel room with the shades pulled and cardboard over the windows just in case , sometimes shoots white light out of his eyes and starts speaking perfectly in time with a radio station that is n't turned on . He even somehow intercepts military satellite transmissions , which , naturally , makes the government rather distressed . Alton has spent the past several years being cared for by a cult who have based their entire religion around him . <p> No one knows how Alton has these abilities and as the movie opens Alton 's father , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many times ) , has rescued Alton from the religious cult , the leader of which , Calvin Meyer ( Sam Shepard ) , wants Alton back and has sent out men to make that happen . Beyond that , the police are on the hunt as well , and the federal government has questions of their own for Alton , too . <p> The father-son pair along with a childhood friend of Roy 's , Lucas ( Joel Edgerton ) , are on the road , travelling at night , and deeply suspicious of everything and everyone . We do n't know much about their final destination and no one knows what will happen when they arrive . <p> All of the threads come together slowly over the course of Midnight Special , with Nichols revealing his secrets bit by bit . At first , it appears as though Roy and Lucas are indeed kidnapping Alton -- a child who even has Calvin 's last name , not Roy 's . We learn that Roy and Alton 's mom , Sarah ( Kirsten Dunst ) , left Alton with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alton 's life . <p> While Roy 's intentions may be good , there are definite questions about who is right and who is wrong posed by Midnight Special . Alton gets weaker and weaker during the movie and Roy keeps moving forward , keeps pressing for them to get to this unknown destination . Roy may be pushing too hard but refuses to listen as Lucas and Sarah try to explain that . <p> For the government 's part , Nichols ' wonderfully represents them . He offers both the side that suggests that Alton is bad news , and those who are more cautious ; more curious about it all . The latter is shown in the form of an NSA agent , Sevier ( Adam Driver ) . Sevier does n't know what 's happening , but he does know that it 's different , that it might be important , and he wants to find out more before drawing any conclusions . In this way , he also serves as a great stand-in for the audience . <p> What Nichols achieves with the movie is something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a tension-filled chase movie , but one which takes place at almost a leisurely pace . Nichols ' reveals are slow and methodical , his bringing Roy and Alton from one place to the next , one encounter to the next , are deliberate . It is a chase that never feels rushed . <p> All is not perfect however . As clear as it is that Nichols ' has a vision of this world , it is equally clear that he does n't always feel the need to share that which he has created , which can be frustrating . Midnight Special is about the father-son journey and that relationship , but it is surrounded by these larger questions about Alton and his family , and those are n't always explored . It is a true frustration as it definitely feels as though there are answers to be had . <p> While all the actors offer good performances , Driver and Shannon are the most memorable . Driver 's Sevier is the most light-hearted of the roles , his scenes are regularly funny , and the insight Sevier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stop and consider what 's happening -- depict a far more benign and yet far more three-dimensional look at the U.S. government than we regularly get . <p> Shannon imparts Roy with a deep and complicated sense of humanity . Roy is troubled , that is unquestionably true , and those troubles extend past whatever issues he has with Alton and Sarah , but he 's a man who in his heart believes he is not only doing the right thing , but also the necessary thing . With someone else in the role , or with someone else directing , Roy could easily be an unkind , unrepentant , unforgiving , cruel man . But , as presented , he is n't . He exhibits those characteristics , but they 're tempered with his deep love for his son and regret of what he 's put the boy through . While some of this is offered in words , more of it is delivered non-verbally , with an expression here or a look there .

This usually happens via a liquidity event -- typically when the investor monetises their investment through a sale of their shares , or when the company goes public via an Initial Public Offering ( IPO ) . <p> Obviously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has opted to monetise some of its shares in OPay by selling 29 percent of its 31 percent stake in OPay to some other entity that was left unmentioned in the announcement . <p> Interestingly , the announcement of the OPay part-share sale by Opera comes just a couple of weeks after The Information broke the news that OPay is in talks with investors to raise as much as USD 400 Mn in funding from Chinese investors . <p> The sentiment is that Chinese investors are increasingly looking at other developing regions like Africa to invest in having come up against a hostile political environment in the U.S. <p> If the deal happens , it 's a cash influx that insiders say will value OPay at around USD 1.5 Bn ; essentially another tech unicorn out of Africa . As it is , OPay has raised no less than USD 170 Mn in two rounds , with its last funding round announced in November 2019 when it raised USD 120 Mn from Meituan and a consortium of Chinese VC firms . That round reportedly valued OPay at about USD 500 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the recent revelations around selling a portion of its OPay stake , Opera may have also inadvertently lifted the lid on the valuation of OPay at this point ( provided talks of further fundraising remain in a state of flux ) . <p> Some ' back-of-napkin ' math paints a certain picture . Opera says it sold 29 percent of its 13.1 stake in OPay for USD 31.1 Mn . This would imply that Opera sold a 3.799 percent stake . And if that is worth USD 31.1 Mn , then some simple extrapolation drawn from mathematical equivalence suggests OPay is valued at 818.6 Mn , at least at the time the deal was done . <p> That valuation is shy of the billion-dollar mark but it is quite obvious that OPay is hot on the unicorn trail . If the reports that OPay is seeking a huge fundraise are true , then its valuation will most probably cross USD 1 Bn sooner rather than later . It 's quite remarkable for a startup that only launched full operations in Nigeria in August 2018 . <p> OPay actually kicked off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that was overshadowed for long spells by its pursuit of building a do-it-all super app . <p> This super app pursuit was implemented by blitzscaling across several verticals including e-hailing , food delivery , classifieds , digital lending , fund transfers , and various bill payments incorporated into the OPay app . <p> After making scarce progress with the super app ambition for much of 2019 ( coupled with the bike-hailing ban in its chief operational base , Lagos , in early 2020 ) , OPay had to abandon its super app chase . The blitzkrieg floundered . So , OPay went back to basics to focus solely on fintech services . And it appears that move is paying off . <p> As mentioned in Opera 's most recent financial report ( Q1 2021 ) , " OPay 's total payment volume continues to grow and has increased from December 2020 levels of USD 2 Bn . " <p> In the Q4 2020 report , Opera said " OPay processed a gross transaction value of USD 2 Bn on its platform in December , more than four-times the level in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the largest mobile money platform in Nigeria , though that is a disputed subject . <p> In any case , the Opera-backed startup is also posturing for expansion to other parts of Africa with a keen interest in North Africa . With some fresh capital in the coffers , OPay might really have a shot at making a further dent .

They get embarrassed when you try to act like a teen , dress like a teen and/or use teen language . They will not tell you this but they want you to be a parent not a friend . You already had your turn to be a teen . <p> You will be surprised by this one but teens get angry at themselves when they disappoint you , so what do they do ?

They are just not ready to help you handle your problems . They are kids , remember . Confide in them and they just might run up to their rooms with no explanation . I 'm sure that every parent has been there before . <p> Depressed kids often present as angry -- particularly males . It is not uncommon for depressed male teens to act out when feeling sad . Keep an eye out for this especially if it is anger that lasts for several days and if it is a change in behaviour . <p> When you try to solve all their problems your teens get bent out of shape . That is because they interpret this as you doubting them . They want to feel that you trust them not doubt them . <p> Do NOT call their teachers , coaches , etc. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get angry because most of them would rather you not interfere unless absolutely necessary . You would n't want your mom or partner to call your boss , right ? This is not exactly a fair comparison but it gets the point across . <p> They get mad when you ask them how their day was as soon as they walk into the house . This seems so odd because so many of us would love if our partners asked how our day was and then actually tuned in and listened to the answer . It 's different with teens though . They interpret this question as how are your grades . Also , their day is n't over when they walk into the house and they need time to decompress and think things over . <p> Try to read their non-verbal cues particularly when they are ready to end a conversation .

It is expected that this year 's survey will highlight the changes that have been wrought on ICT skills demand and supply over the past 18 months . <p> Adrian Schofield , production consultant at the IITPSA and co-author of the JCSE-IITPSA ICT Skills Survey report , says : " The clear message coming out of the past 18 months is that the world of work for everybody has changed . For the ICT skills environment , this means two things -- the way in which ICTs are used across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the need for support for people working from home . The other is the ongoing need for developing systems that are appropriate in the COVID-19 world and the ability to manage those systems in a more distributed environment than many organisations -- SMBs in particular -- are accustomed to . " <p> Schofield says : " While we can not predict the outcomes , the 2021 ICT Skills Survey might find the demand for skills remains constant , possibly increasing in some areas ; but the way in which people acquire those skills may be changing from the traditional meeting in a fixed environment to learning things on a more remote basis . The travel restrictions do have an impact on the mobility of skills across borders , and we hope to get some indication of how that is affecting our market .

The acceleration has been huge , so we might be seeing people in different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . An interesting thing that has happened over the last year is that almost all learning has moved from being face-to-face , to virtual . In the past we made a distinction between in-person learning and virtual learning , and it will be interesting to see how this impacts the findings on how companies source and grow skills now . " <p> The JCSE-IITPSA Skills Survey assesses skills demand and supply from both a corporate and practitioner perspective . Its objective is to identify the most pressing skills needs from the corporate perspective , balanced with the view of current skills capacity of the practitioners and their intentions for future skills development . The questionnaire is in a consistent format to track trends and is published as an online survey . <p> In the corporate survey , the research looks at digital skills shortages and capabilities across key technologies in 20 industry sectors ; as well as the ICT skills organisations expect to need in the next 12 months and how organisations plan to meet these needs . In this year 's survey , organisations will also be asked how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pandemic has had on workforces .

@@63031235 <h> Opinionista* Jeffrey D Sachs * 16 June 2021 <h> G7 summit relevance : It could , and should , have been a Zoom meeting <h> The latest G7 meeting was a waste of resources . If it had to be held at all , it should have been conducted online , saving time , logistical costs and aeroplane emissions . But , more fundamentally , G7 summits are an anachronism . Political leaders need to stop devoting their energy to an exercise that is unrepresentative of today 's global economy and results in a near-complete disconnect between stated aims and the means adopted to achieve them . <p> There was nothing at the G7 summit that could not have been accomplished much more cheaply , easily and routinely by Zoom . The most useful diplomatic meeting this year was President Joe Biden 's online meeting with 40 world leaders in April to discuss the climate crisis . Routine online international meetings by politicians , parliamentarians , scientists and activists are important : they normalise international discussions . <p> But why should those discussions occur within the G7 , which has been superseded by the G20 ? When the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Japan , the United Kingdom and the United States ) began their annual summit meetings in the 1970s , they still dominated the world economy . In 1980 , they constituted 51% of world GDP ( measured at international prices ) , whereas the developing countries of Asia accounted for just 8.8% . In 2021 , the G7 countries produce a mere 31% of world GDP , while the same Asian countries produce 32.9% . <p> The G20 , by including China , India , Indonesia and other large developing countries , represents 81% of world output , and balances the interests of its high-income and developing economies . It is not perfect , as it leaves out smaller and poorer countries and should add the African Union ( AU ) as a member , but at least the G20 offers a fruitful format for discussing global topics covering most of the world economy . The annual EU-US summit can accomplish much that the G7 originally aimed to cover . <p> The G7 is particularly irrelevant because its leaders do n't deliver on their promises . They like making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give the appearance of solving global problems , while really leaving them to fester . This year 's summit was no different . <p> Consider Covid-19 vaccines . The G7 leaders set the goal of vaccinating at least 60% of the global population . They also pledged to share 870 million doses directly over the next year , presumably meaning enough for 435 million fully immunised individuals ( with two doses per person ) . But 60% of the global population comes to 4.7 billion people , or roughly 10 times that number . <p> The G7 leaders offered no plan for achieving their stated aim of global coverage and , in fact , have not developed one , even though it would not be hard to do . Estimating the monthly production of every Covid-19 vaccine is straightforward , and allocating those doses fairly and efficiently to all countries is entirely feasible . <p> One reason such a plan has not yet been developed is that the US government so far refuses to sit down with Russian and Chinese leaders to devise such a global allocation . Another reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ privately and secretly , rather than as part of a global plan . Perhaps a third reason is that the G7 looked at global targets without thinking hard enough about the needs of each recipient country . <p> Yet another example of the G7 's false promises is climate change . At the latest summit , G7 leaders rightly embraced the goal of global decarbonisation by 2050 , and called on developing countries to do so as well . Yet , rather than laying out a financing plan to enable developing countries to achieve that target , they reiterated a financial pledge first made in 2009 and never fulfilled . " We reaffirm the collective developed country goal , " they averred , " to jointly mobilise $100-billion per year from public and private sources , through to 2025 in the context of meaningful mitigation actions and transparency on implementation . " <p> It is hard to overstate the cynicism of this oft-repeated pledge . The rich countries missed their own deadline of 2020 for providing the long-promised $100-billion per year -- a mere 0.2% of rich countries ' annual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fraction of what developing countries need for decarbonisation and climate adaptation . <p> The disconnect between the G7 's soaring aims and meager means is apparent in education as well . Hundreds of millions of children in poor countries lack access to primary and secondary education because their governments do n't have the financial means to provide teachers , classrooms , and supplies . In 2020 , Unesco estimated that the low- and lower-middle-income countries need $504-billion per year up to 2030 to ensure that all kids complete a secondary education , but have only around $356-billion of their own domestic resources , leaving a financing gap of around $148-billion per year . <p> So , what does the G7 propose in this year 's communiqu ? ? The leaders propose " a target to get 40 million more girls into education and with at least $2.75-billion for the Global Partnership for Education " . These are not serious numbers . They are pulled out of thin air and would leave hundreds of millions of children out of school , despite the world 's firm commitment ( enshrined in Sustainable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solutions are available -- such as mobilising low-interest financing from multilateral development banks -- but the G7 leaders did n't propose such solutions . <p> The world 's problems are far too urgent to leave to empty posturing and to measures that are a mere token of what is needed to achieve stated ends . If politics were a mere spectator sport , to be judged by which politicians mugged the cameras best , the G7 summit would perhaps have a role to play . Yet we have urgent global needs to meet : ending a pandemic , decarbonising the energy system , getting kids in school , and achieving the SDGs . <p> My recommendations : fewer face-to-face meetings , more serious homework to link means and ends , more routine Zoom meetings to discuss what really needs to be done , and greater reliance on the G20 ( plus the AU ) as the group that can actually follow through . We need Asia , Africa and Latin America at the table for any true global problem-solving . <h> Comments - share your knowledge and experience <p> Everybody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the experience to contribute meaningfully to a discussion .

@@63031237 <h> REPLIES <h> Dismissing discredited ideas <p> Shawn Hagedorn <p> 29 March 2016 <p> Shawn Hagedorn says the country 's most valuable assets are its youthful minds not its aging mines . <p> Dismissing discredited ideas <p> 29 March 2016 <p> SA 's top business leaders are a diverse bunch with a shared core trait : extreme determination . The executives who have chosen to work with the nation 's political leaders to fix SA 's economy will have to plumb the depths of such grit . <p> Recent events have made clear that SA 's economy and politics are both broadly ill-conceived . For over a quarter century , prospective remedies have focused narrowly while jumbling symptoms and causes along with values and emotions . To engage effectively with their political counterparts , SA 's business leaders must slay major misconceptions which impede SA 's politics and prospects . Half measures are the enemy . <p> The current chapter in SA 's evolution has begun with a team building exercise . It is in everyone 's interest to avoid having SA 's debt downgraded . This was sensibly selected as a shared goal but as the credit rating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exceed prudent budgeting . The credit rating agencies have highlighted the lack of a growth model , yet this too is symptomatic of deeper disconnects . <p> For far too long the public discourse has orbited around what growth rates need to be achieved while skipping over basics , such as , who is going to buy what . It is now clear that SA 's households are too indebted to spur domestic consumption led growth and that export growth requires diversifying beyond raw materials . <p> The path to broad upliftment is through adding value to goods and services destined for the world 's biggest , most demanding , markets . As has been demonstrated so formidably across East Asia , this is best done through integrating into international supply chains . For decades , this path has been impeded by government policies and , while there are certainly exceptions , SA 's private sector mostly focuses on domestic and regional markets or raw material production . <p> The extent to which SA 's politics and economics antagonise each other is exacerbated by the degree to which SA 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imperative of transformation is becoming ever more difficult to reconcile with global economic dynamics . <p> The African National Congress ( ANC ) consists of various factions , all of which favour redistribution policies . SA 's business community has also supported redistribution efforts . The moral and political justifications for redistribution policies are strong but the economics can easily become counterproductive . The level of redistribution is a separate issue . At some point such policies were always going to have to recede for SA to succeed . Rather they have become politically entrenched . <p> SA does not have a growth model because so many of the nation 's consumers are overly indebted while so few of its workers and companies are globally integrated and competitive . The decline in commodity demand has accelerated recognition that the economy is not tenable . <p> Geology , geography and politics have always discouraged SA 's economy from being globally integrated and competitiveness focused . The ANC 's redistribution biases have created compounding obstacles to exporting value-added goods and services nearly as formidable as the sanctions inspired by the prior regime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adverse to the interests of the ANC and many of SA 's big businesses . <p> It is because redistribution policies are so economically dangerous yet so politically appealing - given the country 's massive clusters of poor , unemployed and historically disadvantaged voters - that there should have been , in an ideal world , an agreed expiration date for redistribution policies . As a close substitute , the credit agencies are now saying the economy ca n't grow fast enough to meet its expanding liabilities . SA business leaders are going to have to explain how over emphasising redistribution has undermined policy-making to the detriment of all . <p> In SA 's early transition years , redistribution policies were necessary to maintain political calm . Thus , such transactions were consistent with increasing the size of the pie . Growing the economy while continually expanding the range of beneficiaries was always going to be intensely difficult . <p> Global economic growth has become ever more reliant on blending collaboration and cooperation . SA 's business leaders must help identify policy shifts which will improve competitiveness and advance integration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not lead to near term life-style upgrades for SA 's huge clusters of economically marginalised voters . <p> Blending economic and upliftment objectives into today 's policy framework can lead to tremendous benefits in ten years and phenomenal improvements over twenty or thirty years . Yet the near term implications are not appealing to today 's senior politicians . <p> Large numbers of low-income households across SA will experience set-backs over the next few years . This will play to the ambitions of populist politicians in the ANC and rival parties . Nonetheless , continuing to ignore the economic penalties for overemphasising redistribution policies is not viable . <p> Information age economics are fundamentally different from those of the industrial era . Diffusing knowledge does not deplete its availability , rather it increases it . Rural land , commodity deposits , and even machines are becoming less able to convey wealth . The potential for redistribution policies to redress historical inequities is in steady decline . <p> A simple quiz question helps to distinguish between accounting wealth and financial wealth . When two companies are both expected to produce R20 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's primary asset is R100 million of machinery and the other has only R1 million in assets , which company is more valuable ? <p> A company that requires a large asset base to produce its profits is , of course , less valuable . The value of Microsoft first exceeded that of any industrial company long ago as it can earn large margins without having to continually reinvest in fixed assets . <p> The ANC 's factions include communists , unionists , cronies , and populists . They have all favoured controlling assets over investing in minds . This bias is decades out-of-date and such thinking undermines policy effectiveness . Similarly foreign investments are prized more for the capital that they bring than the access to specialised knowledge , and distant markets , that they offer . <p> SA 's big businesses also frequently favour asset accumulation . Access to greater resources can provide competitive advantages over smaller rivals . Were SA focused on meaningfully integrating into the global economy , such biases would recede as capital is very expensive in SA relative to many other jurisdictions . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Most of the world 's food stressed people are smallholding farmers whereas larger commercial opperations are better able to cope with threats such as droughts . Most smallholding farmers would prefer a formal sector urban job -- though their local schooling is unlikely to be adequate . <p> Wars used to be initiated to capture large tracts of farmland or commodity deposits . Today , most failing economies focus on food production or extraction activities . The risks of invasion have been inverted . Refugees from such poor countries pour into prosperous nations . The politics of SA 's redistribution focused policies can not be reconciled with their economic effects . The policy-makers bet on a global economy that no longer exists . <p> Given SA 's history and geology , the greed and divisiveness of its political processes could be worse while transformation to achieve a vastly more inclusive economy is good for business and smart politics .

Theuns Stofberg took a quick throw in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Botha to kick the winning conversion . I was shivering like a jelly , but stoked ! <p> I was wearing a beanie , also in a flood , when I waded back from FNB Stadium to the Sasol on Nasrec Road to find a taxi . So buzzed from the vibe as we bade farewell to Mr Mandela . The rain bucketed down , the dignitaries gave eulogies , but the real tribute was paid in the bowels of the stadium , where marchers toyi-toyied and sang freedom songs around the tunnels of the stadium . <p> Again , I emerged wet , newly enlightened and wearing a beanie . <p> Perhaps even the same one I wore for six consecutive days trudging up Kilimanjaro with a blow-up sheep sex aid , which may have been named Nancy , if memory serves . <p> I spent two days convinced I was dying of altitude sickness , with a pulse in the 120s , but apparently that 's just how it goes and you do n't eventually die .

" There is no-one like him in terms of brain-power .

" <p> Today , his view is different but he recalls the optimism in the air in 1980 . " Those days were full of hope . And most of us respected Sally as much as we respected Mugabe . They were like a breath of fresh air . We knew Robert had a wild streak in him but at that time we thought -- ' Ah , well . Sally will rein him in .

With a desperately ill wife at home , in the care of a doctor flown in from Britain , Mugabe took time off from organizing massacres in Matabeleland to watch cricket . He 'd balance a cup of tea on his knee and chat with white farmers he was years later to throw off the land . He said he wanted young Zimbabweans to play cricket because it taught them how to be gentlemen . <p> Born at Kutama in 1924 Mugabe grew up without the influence of a father . Gabriel , a carpenter , left the family in the lurch . Robert never mentioned him again ; neither did his brothers or sisters . <p> It must have been hard to keep feet on the ground when your dad 's a carpenter and your single mum thinks you 're the son of God . <p> He was close to his mother who saw in young Robert the fulfilment of her own hard life . She lost her eldest son @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ premises . He was everything Robert was not -- tall , good looking and popular with the local girls . <p> When he died , the full weight of Bona Mugabe 's love descended on Robert . She wanted him to be ordained a Catholic priest . He resisted and instead became a teacher -- a good one , too . <p> James Chikerema was also educated at Kutama Mission . <p> He told me that before Robert left for Fort Hare University in South Africa , Bona gave him a Bible and told him to read part of it every day . <p> Said Chikerema : " She told him she had no money to give him . Only love . She said Jesus best loved poor people and she told him how hard it is for rich people to pass through the eye of a needle .

She was attracted more to his mind than his body and he was attracted to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Roman Catholic Crutch . " Come along Robert , she would say to him . " You can do that . " Those close to Mugabe said she was fully aware of the dictatorial streak that ran like a poisonous thread through this quiet , unassuming man 's make-up . <p> " Sally had all the qualities I lacked " Mugabe told journalists at State House during one of that moment he allowed the veil to drop . " But then again , I had some of the qualities she lacked . " <p> No-one in that room knew Sally was dying . It was mid- 1991 and she was spending most of her time on a kidney machine . The longer years by his side were drawing to an end . <p> None of us knew that as she was dying , Robert Mugabe was conducting an affair with a typist working at his office .

Grace and Robert had two children , a girl called Bona ( after his mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Those who knew Sally now say she knew Robert was having an affair with Grace and do n't mind . But she could not give him a child after the tragic death of her son from malaria in Ghana in 1966 . <p> That Robert Mugabe loved Sally is beyond doubt . <p> In a mood of utter despair after Sally 's death in January 1992 Mugabe told Lawrence Vambe : " Sometimes I turn out the light and no longer wish to live . " <p> But he did . <p> After forty days of mourning he flew to Ireland and stayed at the home of newspaper tycoon Tony O'Reilly , a fellow Roman Catholic . It was there that he told O'Reilly that next time he was in Harare he 'd be introduced to Mugabe next wife , Grace . <p> Trouble is , she was still married to a pilot with Air Zimbabwe , Stanley Goreraza . <p> But that was but a hiccup of a problem easily solved . The couple divorced and the former husband was given a well-paid job as defense attach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joke went round Harare . It said that Robert had read the Bible his mother gave him too closely and picked up on how King David dealt with Uriah the Hittite , husband of Bathsheba who the Jewish king took a bit of a liking to after spotting her having showed naked on a rooftop in Jerusalem . <p> Hubbie was sent off to do a bit of front line fighting and was never heard of again . <p> Grace was young enough to be Robert 's grand-daughter when they married in August 1996 . <p> Grace said she did n't the slightest interest in politics and the children would be kept out of the spotlight because Robert and Sally wanted them to live normal lives -- no special privileges for them . <p> Journalist Lupi Mushayakarara raised eyebrows the week after Zimbabwe 's Showbiz wedding . " Now rumours about Mugabe 's impotence will end , " she said in a column . <p> Robert Mugabe was an unknown quantity at Independence almost 38 years ago . <p> Sally gave him a human face . <p> Today , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a heroic human being . <p> He has betrayed millions of people and although he fades away , for the time being , in disgrace the woman who caused his downfall has not been seen for over a week . <p> The story of their greed and plundering will probably never be told .

@@63075230 <h> How risky is public transport for infectious disease ? We tested it <h> Next time you hop on a bus , you 'll want to shout : " Open the windows ! " <p> In the early days of the pandemic , March 2020 , buses would be " sanitised " . But as knowledge increased of how SARS-CoV-2 , the virus that causes Covid-19 , is spread , it was recognised that this was not that useful . Archive photo : Ashraf Hendricks <p> Every day millions of people in South Africa have to take a taxi , bus or train to go places . In the midst of the Covid-19 pandemic how risky is this ? No one knows for sure . But we ran some tests that we hope shed light on this . <p> We used a carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) meter as a proxy to measure how much of each other 's air we 're breathing while we travelled repeatedly on different public transport modes in Cape Town . The science behind this approach is in its infancy . What we did falls far short of a scientific study that could be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's nevertheless interesting and useful . <p> A CO2 meter measures the prevalence of carbon dioxide in a given space in parts per million ( ppm ) . Since people exhale CO2 , this meter can be used to estimate how much of other people 's air we are breathing . The more of each other 's air we breathe , the more likely we are to catch or transmit viruses that can be transmitted by droplets , such as Covid-19 , tuberculosis , influenza and even common colds . <p> Studies have used these readings to calculate the odds of acquiring tuberculosis on public transport in South Africa . A 2013 study found that " Environmental risk , reflected in the rebreathed fraction of air , was highest in minibus taxis and lowest in trains ... Among daily commuters , the annual risk of tuberculosis infection was projected to be 3.5% - 5.0% and was highest among minibus taxi commuters . " <p> We took readings of CO2 concentration every two minutes , and noted the number of windows open , the number of passengers , and other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the weather conditions . We travelled in pairs , and wore two masks at all times , including one KN95 mask . <p> Outside , in the suburbs of Cape Town , the CO2 meter registers a reading of about 485 ppm . Over 26 minutes , the relatively small GroundUp office ( approximately 32m2 ) , with five people wearing masks and three windows open , averaged readings of 559 ppm , with a low of 525 ppm and a high of 593 ppm . <p> Exactly what a safe level is before you 're breathing in your fellow passengers ' germs in large amounts is n't precisely known . For one thing traffic can increase the CO2 substantially and this has no relation to the risk of catching an infectious disease . But , based on discussions with scientists , 800 ppm is a good threshold to try to keep below . Above 1,000 and you 're getting a bit worried . Above 1,500 is bad . Above 2,000 is terrible . <h> Minibus taxis <p> We took eight minibus taxis over three days . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and we travelled from Rondebosch to town and back .

You could get lucky and ride in a relatively empty vehicle with windows open in the morning , and a few hours later be squeezed like a sardine between two coughing , sneezing people , with the windows closed . <h> Conclusions <p> Our study is journalistic , rather than scientific ; strict inferences from our data are ill-advised . <p> We could n't say whether CO2 levels in a particular mode were affected by the use of masks , but it certainly made us feel safer when we could see general compliance . Also , we can only make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ readings . <p> Nevertheless , it 's clear that so much depends on the weather . The trips that recorded high levels of carbon dioxide concentrations were all when there was rain .

" Open windows , all the time " needs to be our golden rule on public transport , no matter what the weather . ( They probably do n't need to be completely open . ) Perhaps the windows on buses and taxis could be fitted with devices that keep the rain from coming in when the windows are open . <p> After completing these trips , these reporters watched the EFF 's march on SAHPRA ( we were on journeys during Magashule 's protest ) .

That is a total increase in remuneration from R1.7 million to R3.27 million , which amount to an increase in 89% , in the 2008/2009 financial year . <p> The explanation provided was that the remuneration increase was as a result of : <p> a salary increase of 13.26% in 2008/2009 ; <p> performance related bonuses payments in the amount of R236 667.53 for the 2006/2007 and 2008/2009 ; and <p> a once-off restraint of trade payment " to protect the interests of the company " <p> The explanation reveals some facts but conceals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not : <p> disclose actual amounts paid in salary increases ; <p> disclose whether annual bonus payments were made ; or <p> disclose the actual amount paid , which must be more than R1 million , as a result of the once-off restraint of trade payment to Sipho Thomo . <p> This explanation raises more question than it answers . <p> First , why were performance bonuses paid to Sipho Thomo over a period when : <p> it was decided that Sipho Thomo should not be suspended , but should receive counselling for his management style and should face disciplinary action for making offensive remarks to employees by the Board of Directors of Armscor ; <p> the resolution of the a grievance lodged against Sipho Thomo by a senior manager Nthathi Borotho cost R 1 816 722 made up of R1 216 858 for special paid leave payments , R 506 964.10 for attorney and consultant fees and R92 900 for directors fees ; <p> there are serious delays in major capital acquisition projects for the defence force ; <p> the balance sheet reflects decreasing surpluses from R44 million in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ payments from R415 million in 2008 to 479 million in 2009 ; and <p> there is a concern about the long term ability of Armscor to deliver on its mandate to acquire defence material for the Department of Defence . <p> Second , why was it necessary to enter into a restraint of trade agreement and pay a once-off restraint of trade payment in what appears to be an effort to retain the services of Sipho Thomo at Armscor ? Usually , restraint of trade payments are paid to individuals who are about to exit an organisation . <p> Given Sipho Thomo 's dismal performance , it would seem that his departure would have created a significant opportunity to rejuvenate the top management and leadership at Armscor . <p> Popo Molefo , Chairperson of the Board of Directors at Armscor , who is responsible for the management and control of the state entity , appears not to be acting to protect the interests of the shareholder but rather to be acting in the interests of Sipho Thomo and Armscor . <p> We believe that Popo Molefe , Sipho Thomo and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explanation . <p> The DA will today write to the Chairperson of the Portfolio Committee on Defence and Military Veterans , Nyami Booi , to : <p> request that a meeting which includes Popo Molefe , Chairperson of the Board of Directors of Armscor , Sipho Thomo , Chief Executive Officer of Armscor , and the entire management board of Armscor be scheduled as soon as possible ; and <p> request that all portfolio committee members by furnished with copies of Sipho Thomo 's employment contract , all relevant Armscor policy documents relating to remuneration , annual bonuses , performance bonuses and restraint of trade payments and copies of minutes of board meetings where Sipho Thomo 's remuneration was authorised . <p> We have to get to the bottom of how it was that higher salaries and increased benefit payments were being made to Sipho Thomo and his management team when there is a concern about the long term viability of Armscor . <p> Statement issued by David Maynier , MP , Democratic Alliance shadow minister of defence and military veterans , September 23 2009

These are digital currencies that are tied to real-world assets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a stable value , unlike most cryptocurrencies which are known to be volatile . Bitcoin , for example , rose to an all-time high of nearly $65,000 in April and has since almost halved in value . <p> Tether was designed to be pegged to the dollar . While other cryptocurrencies often fluctuate in value , tether 's price is usually equivalent to $1 . This is n't always the case though , and wobbles in the value of tether have spooked investors in the past . <p> Crypto traders often use tether to buy cryptocurrencies , as an alternative to the greenback . This essentially provides them with a way to seek safety in a more stable asset during times of sharp volatility in the crypto market . <p> However , crypto is n't regulated , and many banks avoid doing business with digital currency exchanges due to the level of risk involved . That 's where stablecoins tend to come in . <h> Why is it controversial ? <p> Some investors and economists are worried tether 's issuer does n't have enough dollar reserves to justify its dollar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reserves for its stablecoin . The firm revealed that only a fraction of its holdings -- 2.9% , to be exact -- were in cash , while the vast majority was in commercial paper , a form of unsecured , short-term debt . <p> That would place Tether in the top 10 biggest holders of commercial paper in the world , according to JPMorgan . Tether has been compared to traditional money-market funds -- but without any regulation . <p> With more than $60 billion worth of tokens in circulation , Tether has more deposits than that of many U.S. banks . <p> Tether and Bitfinex agreed to pay $18.5 million in the settlement and were barred from operating in New York state , however the companies did n't admit to any wrongdoing . <h> Market contagion <p> Analysts at JPMorgan have previously warned that a sudden loss of confidence in tether could result in a " severe liquidity shock to the broader cryptocurrency market . " <p> But there are also concerns that a sudden increase of tether withdrawals could lead to a potential market contagion , affecting assets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and other stablecoins as one of several potential risks to financial stability . <p> " These stablecoins are becoming more popular , " he said during a presentation . <p> " A future crisis could easily be triggered as these become a more important sector of the financial market , unless we start regulating them and making sure that there 's actually a lot more stable stability to what 's being marketed to the general public as a stablecoin , " Rosengren added . <h> Sign Up for Our Newsletter Daily Update <p> Get the best of CNBC Africa sent straight to your inbox with breaking business news , insights and updates from experts across the continent . <p> Get this delivered to your inbox , and more info about about our products and services .

" @ @ Festival reloaded <p> From now on , the National Arts Festival will be both a live and digital events company , CEO Monica Newton announced at the event 's opening briefing on Thursday 8 July . The 2021 National Arts Festival Experience was to have been a hybrid event with live and online performances , workshops and exhibitions . Leading up to it was the Standard Bank Presents series in Cape Town and Durban -- suspended in Johannesburg because of rising Covid-19 cases there . The President 's announcement of a two-week alert Level 4 lockdown put paid to the hybrid plan and for a second year , the event is entirely online . <p> In 2020 , as the reality of the Covid-19 pandemic took hold , the Festival team reimagined and reworked the programme into the first " vNAF " virtual Festival . That experience stood the Festival team in good stead , Newton said . Having successfully made the superhuman switch from partly live to all digital in 10 days , they have opted to use their new " superpower " to adapt their business model going forward . <p> " This year we had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Newton said . It had been crazy -- changing and swapping venues ; capturing exhibitions that were going to be up for live viewing on 3D camera . <p> " But the artists were prepared to walk this journey with us and the team was more than up to the challenge : we are professionals at this . " <p> The Standard Bank Presents programme leading up to the main event had given the Festival a head start , Newton said . Many of those shows had been recorded for a second virtual run . <p> " Our 2021 Festival was built with change in mind , we knew we might need a Plan B and this was a part of our risk mitigation strategy from the start , " said Newton had said earlier . <p> The town and its long-running roads , sewage , water and pothole problems that were centre-stage as Mjekula , who opened the virtual session , said they 'd hoped that by this time Makhanda would have addressed its infrastructure challenges . <p> " This move to online is a reprieve , " Mjekula @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us not be having a debate about the suitability of Makhanda as the host city for the Festival . " <p> The Mayor had to respond and , during his presentation , assured Mjekula , and the Festival community , that the municipality was not sitting back . <p> " I would like to assure Mr Mjekula that we are working flat-out to address historic infrastructural backlogs because we understand what the Festival means to the city , " Mpahlwa said . " The Festival is the gold , the diamond of this city . " <p> He said the city was working with the Department of Sport , Recreation , Arts and Culture on developments for the former Dakawa Arts Centre building in Froude Street . <p> " There are big plans : watch this space , " he said . <p> Eastern Cape Tourism CEO Vuyani Dayimani referred to the R377 million GDP for the region that the Festival generates . <p> " Despite all the challenges , the National Arts Festival has stayed in the Province , " Dayimani said .

" Enjoy the Festival virtually for now , but the time will come when you can be here again . " <p> Arts and Culture MEC Fezeka Nkomonye said the Department 's support for 250 artists to showcase their creativity was a bid to ensure the entire value chain of the creative sector is developed in the province . <p> " Throughout the province , there are smaller festivals that feed into this national Festival and we want to move the sector from relief to recovery . " <p> Nkomonye said she had held discussions with the Festival on how better to spread the benefits of the festival -- not only to Sarah Baartman and Makhanda , but to other parts of the Province @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Amazing ' beyond Makhanda to venues in Durban , Cape Town and Johannesburg and accommodating Standard Bank Presents : the parts we got to enjoy were a delight . <p> " We had expected to be experiencing Makhanda hospitality -- including the famous gluhwein , " Pooe said . " But thank you for ensuring we still serve the artistic community . Resilience and the lessons learnt from last year 's Festival ensured you were able to turn what was going to be a hybrid festival into a fully virtual one . <p> " If there was ever testament to the Festival 's ability to find new ways , this is it . " <p> Pooe thanked artists for their resilience . <p> " Artists adjust -- they 're more than ready to do it , " Pooe said .

It is only in Africa where financial management are an unnecessary competence for leaders . <p> I have argued in the past the masses have a very trifling collective intelligence when it comes to politics because people vote based on emotion and not logic.The Limpopo provincial government in my view should be liquidated for incompetence and voters should be demonstrating at the abuse of tax payer 's funds . In fact the premier should be fired in my books . <p> This is another clear case of " the underdevelopment of Africa by Africans " where having caused significant damage to the public purse , the perpetrators have the audacity to hold a pressconference and claim that they are being victimised .

As blacks people , we can not defend the shenanigans in Limpopo and whoever is involved should really be ashamed of their actions . The danger we face is that the perpetrators have not admitted their mistakes which means they think they are right and have nothing to learn from this . <p> I am not also told by some contacts in Limpopo that they have had to close their BEE companies because they have not been paid by the government nor have they been getting new contracts as these have been dished out to Malema 's cronies .

@@63118234 <h> Starting your own business ? Beware the risk when purchasing property <p> While it is common to purchase property in your own name or with your spouse , it may be at risk when you decide to run your own business , says Tiaan Pretorius , manager for Seeff Centurion . <p> With the increased number of people looking to start their own business , it is prudent to investigate whether your property will be at risk . You may for example want to consider purchasing it in the name of a company which provides relative protection , especially for small business owners , says Pretorius . <p> South African Law recognises two types of " persons " , being natural and juristic and you can purchase property as either , he says . Natural persons are ordinary human beings who act and conduct business in their own name . Juristic persons are legal entities such as a company , close corporation or trust . <p> Purchasing a property as a natural person <p> Most people will purchase property in their own name or jointly with a legal spouse , partner or another person or persons and these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The property will be registered in your own , or joint names depending on how it is purchased . You will also need to pay transfer duty on the purchase price as set down by SARS , the first R1 million being exempt . Additional costs will apply such as bond registration , conveyancing and other incidentals . When you decide to sell it , Capital Gains Tax ( CGT ) will be payable on the profit made above R2 million in the case of your primary residence . <p> The downside , says Pretorius , is that should you decide to run your own business , or encounter financial difficulty , your home could be at risk . If you are thinking of your own business , you should consider whether a legal entity might be a better option . <p> Purchasing property as a juristic person <p> Purchasing as a juristic person is , however , more complex and costly , but does offer a level of protection of the asset , adds Gerhard van der Linde , managing director for Seeff Pretoria East . <p> There are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close corporation or a trust . Given the legal complexities , tax and cost implications , you should start with legal advice . The legal entity will also need to be registered . <p> Purchasing as a ( Pty ) Ltd company will attract transfer duty at the same rate as a natural person , except if the seller is registered for VAT and the property forms part of the operations for which the seller is registered in which event VAT would be payable . <p> A company must comply with certain regulations such as annual audits , payment of annual tax and would potentially pay comparably more CGT on the profit of sale . Van der Linde says that when you purchase a property which is already in the name of a company , there would simply be a transfer of shares and not the property and hence there would be no transfer duty . You can , however , purchase a property which is in the name of a company and then register it in your own name , he adds . <p> The benefit of a company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ private individuals , trusts and companies which makes it preferential for investment property or extensive property holdings .

Close corporations attract the same transfer duty , CGT and tax and regulatory obligations as companies . <p> A trust is more complex and generally used where property needs to be held in a trust to the benefit of beneficiaries . A Trust Deed will be drawn up and appoint a trustee/s who will administer the affairs of the trust for the benefit of the beneficiaries . <p> The trust offers protection of the assets against creditors of the beneficiaries as well as exemption from estate duties and executor fees in the event of the death of the owner of the trust .

As of today , primary and secondary schools are shuttered in 19 countries , affecting over 156 million students . <p> " This should not go on . Schools should be the last to close and the first to reopen . <p> " In their efforts to limit transmission , governments have too often shut down schools and kept them closed for prolonged periods , even when the epidemiological situation did n't warrant it . These actions were frequently taken as a first recourse rather than a last measure . In many cases , schools were closed while bars and restaurants remained open . <p> " The losses that children and young people will incur from not being in school may never be recouped . From learning loss , mental distress , exposure to violence and abuse , to missed school-based meals and vaccinations or reduced development of social skills , the consequences for children will be felt in their academic achievement and societal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most affected are often children in low-resource settings who do not have access to remote learning tools , and the youngest children who are at key developmental stages . <p> " The losses for parents and caretakers are equally heavy . Keeping children at home is forcing parents around the world to leave their jobs , especially in countries with no or limited family leave policies . <p> " That 's why reopening schools for in-person learning can not wait . <p> " It can not wait for cases to go to zero . There is clear evidence that primary and secondary schools are not among the main drivers of transmission . Meanwhile , the risk of COVID-19 transmission in schools is manageable with appropriate mitigation strategies in most settings . The decision to open or close schools should be based on risk analysis and the epidemiological considerations in the communities where they are situated . <h> Sign Up for Our Newsletter Daily Update <p> Get the best of CNBC Africa sent straight to your inbox with breaking business news , insights and updates from experts across the continent . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ info about about our products and services .

With the global vaccine shortages plaguing low and middle-income countries , vaccinating frontline workers and those most at risk of severe illness and death will remain a priority . All schools should provide in-person learning as soon as possible , without barriers to access , including not mandating vaccination prior to school entry . <p> " Ahead of the Global Education Meeting on July 13 , we urge decisionmakers and governments to prioritize the safe reopening of schools to avoid a generational catastrophe .

@@63166233 <h> How to Fix the Alien Movie Franchise <p> In many aspects , the Xenomorph is the perfect horror movie villain : a relentless force of nature that ca n't be reasoned with . In the first Alien movie , the motivations behind this ultimate killer are never fully explained , the creature seemingly killing every crew member of the Nostromo for the hell of it . <p> However , with each subsequent film in the franchise , the backstory of the Xenomorphs got expanded upon , eliminating some of the mystery behind this once enigmatic life form . To make matters worse , one of the most critically acclaimed movies in the franchise might also be responsible for the series decline , as we will see next in this article . <h> Let 's discuss how to fix the failing Alien movie franchise . <h> The ' Aliens ' Situation <p> There 's an eternal debate among Alien fans : there are those who prefer the first film 's overtly horror style , while some others are all aboard for James Cameron 's 1986 action film sequel . Aliens was loved by critics and audiences both , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began its steady decline . <p> For starters , it expanded upon the Xenomorphs as a species , giving them a Queen and more animalistic behaviour . The Alien we saw in the first movie was close to that film 's heroine in intellectual terms ; In Aliens , the Xenomorphs are even called " bugs , " yet another jab at their archaic behaviour . <p> However , 1986 's Aliens is n't the worst offender when it comes to demystifying the Alien . That honour goes to 2017 's Alien : Covenant . <h> Less is More <p> The original 1979 Alien movie had a simple premise : it was a slasher film set in space . There was no higher meaning to be found in the actions of the killer alien life form and just a vague hint of a conspiracy being thrown in by one of the film 's characters . <p> The latest Alien movies , Prometheus and Covenant , are seemingly ashamed to be called " slashers " by fans or film critics . The franchise has become a pseudo-intellectual rambling on the origins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... unexpected for a series about alien parasites that burst out of their victim 's chest . <p> Covenant also gave us some conflicting info on the origins of the Xenomorph species . The entire Xenomorph species was seemingly created by David , an android antagonist from the last two films . We see everything from his point of view , including the planning and creation of his ultimate life form . And just like that , the mystery of the Alien is no more . <h> Alternative Media <p> It would be easy to say that there 's no way to fix the Alien movie franchise -- that it was never meant to be a series in the first place . However , there 's one final glimmer of hope shining in the depths of space for this Xenomorph , and it comes in the form of branching from the film industry . <p> With 20th Century Fox 's acquisition by Disney , a new Alien movie sounds like a tall order . However , the franchise is still going strong with fans , partially thanks to how popular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and even some pretty neat videogames keep the franchise alive in the eyes of pop culture . <p> If you 're craving a more traditional Alien experience , definitely give 2014 's phenomenal Alien : Isolation a try . It is the closest thing we 'll ever get to a proper sequel and an excellent reference for future filmmakers who wish to continue the Xenomorph 's horror legacy . <h> What do you think ?

Its incredible soundtrack , the irresistible vibes of the city of Shibuya , and its compelling coming-of-age journey stuck with me even when the weird intricacies of its plot had faded . So my desire for its long-awaited Switch sequel , NEO : The World Ends With You , was not necessarily that it would answer every hanging plot thread that had been left at the end of a game I played years ago . Rather , I hoped it could recapture the feelings that made the original so special : themes of growth , connection , and love of a place because of its people . <p> While NEO mostly delivers in that regard , what 's also clear is that Square Enix was so eager to at last revisit the same stories , characters , and places of its predecessor that it left this follow-up little room to tell an interesting new story or reach a new emotional peak of its own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off well enough , with a flashy signature style and entertaining combat mechanics that were translated surprisingly well to the Switch . <p> NEO : The World Ends With You takes place in a parallel version of Shibuya , Japan , where the deceased are sent to play a sadistic week-long " Reapers ' Game " for the right to return to life . The passive new protagonist Rindo and his charming cinnamon roll of a best friend Fret are sent to this alternate reality after Rindo has a strange and upsetting vision of Shibuya in chaos , and are later joined by the fangirlish Nagi and returning , math-obsessed , former antagonist Minamimoto . Across seven days , the group completes challenges , fights off strange monster-like enemies called the Noise , and solves puzzles set by the death warden Reapers . It 's a set-up that will be familiar to fans of the first game , but with the interesting new twist that instead of pairing off , players can form teams of unlimited size and work together as a group to " win " and set their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to explore a much larger party of allies at once than the first game could , while also opening the door to dynamics between competing players rather than merely implying their existence . <h> Just as in the first game , Shibuya remains a delight to explore , stuffed with fashion , food , music , and culture . <p> Even though Rindo and friends are effectively ghosts , they can still interact in limited ways with the real-world Shibuya by visiting shops or restaurants . And just as in the first game , Shibuya remains a delight to explore , stuffed with fashion , food , music , and culture . It 's vibrant and exuberant , packed with real-world references and clearly assembled by a team of artists and designers that adores the actual city . Some of the best objectives in NEO involve getting to know its fictional Shibuya better , whether that 's by exploring its urban legends or seeking out notable landmarks . I loved popping into restaurants to stuff my characters with mouth-watering ramen , piles of fluffy pancakes , and spicy curry , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new couture I could buff them up with . <p> But beyond these bold strokes , NEO is full of small touches that bring its Shibuya to life . You can see them in its detailed art and character designs , and in the flavor text of equipment and the skill-tree-like " social network . " But the best example stems from Rindo 's ability to scan NPCs and read their thoughts . Apart from the required plot moments , scanning serves no gameplay purpose beyond giving you a better understanding of the world of NEO . Passersby will muse about their relationships , idols , TV shows , food , gaming , school , work , and plenty more . You ca n't do anything with this information , but these pensive moments are well-written and charming , and help paint a brighter picture of NEO 's Shibuya and why its inhabitants love it so much . <p> Inseparable from all of this is NEO 's music , which continues in the footsteps of its predecessor as one of the most stand-out and bopping video game soundtracks I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rock , pop , and metal , and includes plenty of new tracks alongside remixes of fan favorites -- often perfectly timed atop big story moments that excited me as a long-time fan .

Nowhere is this more evident than in the real-time battle system , which layers familiar 3D hacking and slashing with a timing-based combo system and a whole host of customizability .

For instance , the X button will typically have pins with rapidfire , close-range attacks , while Y has fast long-range moves . Each character can use a pin a certain number of times before it must recharge , making it necessary to balance their usage so you 're not sitting on your butt half the battle .

I loved the thrill of Fret pulling off a pristine combo with a flaming sword , followed up by a big aerial kick from Minamimoto , passing to Rindo to shoot electricity out of his hands for a spell , and wrapping it all up by having Nagi drop a semi-truck on an enemy 's head before launching into a team finisher move , then passing back to Fret to do it all over again . That 's a peak I was always chasing , but the reality was that I spent a decent chunk of the roughly 40- to 50-hour campaign experimenting to find the moments where it flowed just right like that . <p> Especially in NEO 's first half , you wo n't have a wide enough arsenal of pins to have perfectly smooth battles every time -- or even if you do , your favorite pins might be outclassed by less comfy ones in sheer damage numbers . The solution is usually to grind more or try harder difficulties in the hope of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answer . Though it 's worth adding that , having appreciated the difficulty options and associated collect-a-thons from The World Ends With You , I was delighted to see these customizations return in all their robustness for NEO , further giving me reason to return after the credits had rolled . <h> Having appreciated the difficulty options and associated collect-a-thons from The World Ends With You , I was delighted to see these customizations return . <p> Hitting those good vibes are what will ultimately stick with me about NEO 's battle system , but the groove had its missteps , too . For one , NEO 's boss battles seemed to only either be effective but unmemorable , or flashy but frustrating . The later hours have a number of battles with some truly fascinating twists and turns , but its dodge and camera controls are n't always up to the task of keeping your team out of danger but also in view . Because you only control one character at a time ( whichever one last used a pin ) , the AI is left to manage the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poison clouds or directly into attacks that you correctly dodged , meaning you might lose a fight here or there despite doing everything right . This does n't happen often , but in fights with huge enemies boasting hard-hitting moves , it can feel more like you 're fighting your comrades than the enemy . <p> I also ran into a few annoying bugs in battles , especially in later chapters . Multiple times , enemies mysteriously got launched outside the official boundaries of the battlefield , making them nearly impossible to hit and forcing me to randomly fire off long-range attacks in the hope a few would connect and eventually whittle down their HP so I could move on . One enemy turned invisible ( it was not supposed to turn invisible , though there are other foes that do have this as a functional mechanic ) and became completely undamageable by anyone for any reason , forcing me to start a chain of eight interlinked fights all over again . Another time , NEO completely crashed as I was entering a very dramatic boss fight . These were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often enough to frustrate and merit mention . <h> Wicked Plot Twisters <p> Story-wise , NEO is as direct a sequel to The World Ends With You as one could want , despite coming 14 years after it . Without getting into any spoiler-y specifics , put simply : if you liked The World Ends With You and are hungry for resolution to the numerous plot threads left dangling at the end of it , NEO is likely to be very satisfying . I highly recommend either playing The World Ends With You : Final Mix or watching the anime first , though -- while the characters try their best to summarize certain major events key to the setup of NEO , the weird intricacies of that story can be difficult to follow if you 're just listening to characters deliver rushed summaries to a confused Rindo . <p> What NEO unfortunately sacrifices in its success as a direct sequel are its new , original characters . Rindo , Fret , Nagi , Shoka , Kanon , and other new members of the cast have occasional moments of depth and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the arcs in the first game . The first World Ends With You was all about Shiki , Beat , Joshua , and especially main protagonist Neku coming to terms with their own weaknesses , reckoning with trauma , and growing up a little through their connections with one another . NEO 's new cast does n't get the same space to tackle that growth because they 're constantly giving up their own time to returning plots and problems . <h> What We Said About The World Ends With You : Final Remix <p> Because of the Switch 's two modes , The World Ends With You : Final Remix is simultaneously a good port and a bad one . Using handheld mode and touchscreen controls , Final Remix holds up as a great JRPG with tons of depth . It packs all the flair and charm seen in the DS original , along with some new incentives to keep playing after the story wraps . But the moment you dock the Switch and try to use motion controls TWEWY becomes a pain to play , which eliminates the fun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soundtrack is great and the story delights , but if you 've played before you may want to think twice before double ( or triple ) dipping . <h> Score : 7.8 <p> When they do get a bit of character development , it 's usually all smashed into one day here or there , with characters making bold pronouncements about themselves or others with little build-up or explanation . The main protagonist , Rindo , in particular gets done dirty by an arc that boils his problems down to a single , flimsy character flaw he only meaningfully exhibits once or twice . The rest of the time he 's not much more than a plot delivery vehicle . Without your lead hero having a meaningful conflict or a central perspective , a lot of NEO 's intended emotional peaks do n't matter nearly as much as they should , whether you played the original or not . <p> That 's a shame , because Rindo and his friends are a genuinely fun group to spend time with , especially compared to the antisocial tendencies of their predecessor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a delightful bit of work that leans into modern youth and meme culture without coming off as too corny or " How do you do , fellow kids ? " , and it has both the English and Japanese voice acting to match . The one exception is a spoiler-loaded character that appears in the middle of the story , whose speech felt both awkward and appropriative in a way that was totally unnecessary given that character 's setup . <h> I found myself disappointed that NEO leaned so heavily on nostalgia , and did n't do more to embrace its new characters and stories . <p> As someone who adored The World Ends With You as a teenager and waited eagerly for a sequel for over a decade , I found myself feeling a bit conflicted about what NEO tried to do and whether or not it succeeded . It 's a worthy sequel both in how it captures the feel and spirit of the DS game , as well as in the very direct ways in which it follows up its story . But with such a long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NEO leaned so heavily on the nostalgia I had for characters I loved as a teenager , and did n't do more to embrace the new characters and stories I was excited to get invested in as an adult ( and especially the ones that headlined all its marketing ) . <p> It 's hard to say much without spoiling anything , but there 's a point about 20 hours into the 40- to 50-hour story where it becomes very apparent that NEO is not really about what the trailers and box art want you to think it 's about . That might be fine for some , especially those who checked out the Final Mix version of The World Ends With You or the recent anime , but even those connections ca n't magically give NEO a theme and throughline of its own as strong as its predecessor . NEO feels like it 's here to finish what The World Ends With You started , and it does that well enough . I just wish it had n't sacrificed its own story and characters to do so . <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a sequel that leans heavily on recapturing what made the original so special . That 's to its benefit in some ways , such as its vivacious depiction of Shibuya , its incredible soundtrack , and its stylish , flowing combat system , but to its detriment in others .

@@63172240 <h> It was n't perfect , but better than how most retailers have handled the sale of PS5s , Xbox Series X/S , and GPUs . <p> Within the last year , AMD , Nvidia , Sony , and Microsoft released new gaming hardware . Like every major hardware release , demand is always high , but fervent demand for next-gen consoles like the PS5 and Xbox Series X/S and new PC graphics cards turned the act of purchasing these high-ticket items into a recurring nightmare akin to going to your favorite retail store on Black Friday , hoping to find something good at a discounted price , but with all that disappointment popping up again and again from home . <p> So , when Valve announced the Steam Deck , I , and I 'm sure many others , imagined the same hellish cycle would once again play out : Valve would announce the product 's release date and MSRP , followed by details on when and where to preorder , and chaos would ensue from there . While , yes , the initial part of the process went as expected , Valve also found a more efficient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hardware , the Steam Deck , while also starting to combat the biggest challenge facing many looking to buy a PS5 , Xbox Series X/S or a new GPU : scalpers . <p> The entire process had its flaws , sure , and even with those requirements the weekend after reservations opened up saw plenty of scalpers trying to make a quick buck , but the upsides to this queue system demonstrated a measure that more retailers should take note of and apply to future launches . <h> The Persistent Preorder Problem <p> Gaming hardware has often been susceptible to the resale market , but the recent supply issues due to chip shortages combined with the high demand for the recently released consoles brought a new level of notoriety to the scalping secondhand market . <p> Late last year , Sony officially unveiled the pricing for the PlayStation 5 along with a release date and word that preorders would become available on September 17 . Unfortunately , PS5 preorders started appearing a day early . While it 's never been made exactly clear what problems arose behind the scenes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opened availability early , and many retailers began to follow suit after the shopping giant gleefully announced on social media that it was opening PS5 ahead of the announced time . <p> Preorders , unsurprisingly , ran out nearly instantly , and in the months since most of those looking to buy a PlayStation 5 have had to wait for retailers to randomly drop stock availability periodically , or if they felt no other options were available , to turn to third-party sellers on the Facebook marketplace or eBay where consoles could potentially have an overinflated price and , in the worst cases , even potentially be a scam . And though Xbox kept preorders for its new console set to a specific date and time , those consoles too became difficult to find in stock , and in both cases scalpers found opportunities to sell consoles at massive markups . <p> And PC owners looking for the latest parts have run into similar issues . Both AMD and Nvidia announced a new line of graphics cards in 2020 : AMD 's Radeon RX 6000 series and Nvidia 's RTX @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , have been just as if not more complicated to purchase as a ninth-gen gaming console since their release late last year , and most of these GPUs can cost you upwards of over $1,000 depending on the GPU you are looking to buy , such as an RTX 3080 Ti or a Radeon RX 6900 XT . And it 's not even resellers marking GPU prices up either ; Nvidia and AMD consistently keep their own in-house GPUs at the MSRP both announced , yet third-party companies such as EVGA and Zotac tend to increase the prices above the debut MSRP . <p> An ongoing global semiconductor shortage has strained various industries , including the gaming industry , which further limited supplies of all this new hardware . The lack of defined restocking windows has even led to a bit of a cottage industry , as Twitter accounts and live streams kept tabs on restocking moments for major retailers like Amazon and Walmart . <p> All of this demand and limited supply came at a time when interest in gaming skyrocketed , in part due to pandemic stay-at-home orders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , US consumers spent record amounts on video games , as NPD reported a record $56.9 billion spent on gaming , hardware , and accessories . If you focus on money consumers spent on gaming hardware alone , it was $5.3 billion , higher than it was in 2019 , making it the most in hardware spending since 2011 which reached $5.6 billion in hardware spending alone , according to NPD . <p> Between an ongoing chip shortage , a global pandemic that has caused most of these high-ticket items to be sold mostly online or in select in-store locations through specific means , combined with unprecedented demand , it seemed , at first , that Valve 's portable gaming PC was to have a similar fate . <h> Valve 's Preorder Mandates <p> As someone who preordered a PS5 and an Xbox Series X , and also purchased two RTX 30 graphics cards ( one on launch day and another within weeks after release ) , I found reserving a preorder for the Steam Deck to be less of a headache . Yes , even a cursory glance over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Deck 's preorder launch , with several listings pricing the handheld well above its MSRP for the high-end model . eBay is starting to remove these egregious listings from its site , per its pre-sale policy , which specifies that pre-sale items must ship within 30 days , but it 's clear scalpers hoped to find the same success as they had with the recent console launches . <p> Thankfully , Valve 's approach with the Steam Deck queue system demonstrated a number of smart choices that made buying this high-ticket gaming hardware much simpler for actually interested buyers than the rest of the recent crop . <p> Ahead of preorders opening on July 16 , Valve revealed Steam Deck hopefuls would actually have to meet some requirements to even be eligible for the first wave of preorder reservations . The major sticking point was that would-be buyers needed a Steam Account used to make a purchase before June 2021 to be eligible within the first 48 hours of preorder reservations opening up . Accounts would also be limited to one Steam Deck per Steam account . <p> The Steam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2021 would theoretically prevent any scalpers from just making an account on the day to buy a system . Compare that to other retailers , such as Amazon and Best Buy , where an account is not required to purchase something . Valve also required you to be logged into a Steam account to check for preorder reservations ; you could not simply go onto Steam on a web browser and make the reservation for all three models of the Steam Deck . Each Steam account was locked down to one model that you placed $5 on to ensure you had a reservation for when Valve eventually opened up full-fledged preorders at a later date . <p> The decision to place a $5 reservation down with a one per account-model was a smart move for multiple reasons . On one hand , the $5 reservation guaranteed that you would have a chance to actually preorder the Steam Deck you wanted when it was your turn to order the console , ensuring that you would not have to endure a mob of bots and other humans . The decision to lock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , would theoretically prevent bots and scalpers from taking advantage of the system and buying up multiple units . Yes , scalpers can still get their hands on a Steam Deck , but being limited to one per account was a sensible mandate that helps Valve better control how the Steam Deck supply was distributed . <p> That said , it 's not like Valve 's Steam Deck " sold out " so to speak , you can very much go on Steam Deck 's listing right now and make a reservation . However , I would not expect your unit to come in anytime this year given the high demand and many users seeing various 2022 shipping windows . Nevertheless , Valve is still taking into account how many people are interested in the product . While some will need to wait longer than others , the fact they are still taking reservations right now is a tremendous buyer service - if someone is interested in preordering a Steam Deck , they can immediately see a window of availability , and not just hope for a tweet to drop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are worth analyzing in the context of where the Steam Deck was being sold . Unlike other high-ticket gaming hardware , the Steam Deck was sold exclusively on Steam , whereas the other products were being sold at multiple third-party retailers such as Amazon , Best Buy , Game Stop , and/or Target , alongside first-party retail outlets like the PlayStation Direct service Sony used for the PS5 . Even so , these retailers could learn something from Valve 's implementations . <p> Sure , some of them are already taking measures , such as GameStop 's PS5/Xbox Series X/S bundles being sold sometimes to only Pro members or Best Buy giving out tickets on the rare occasions it has done in-store RTX 30 restocks . ( Granted , people are prone to camp out to ensure they can get one in that case . ) But Valve 's protocols make requirements like users needing accounts for online storefronts seem like easy fixes that could be implemented across the board , no matter whether a seller is first- or third-party . <p> Of course , you do not have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or Xbox Series X/S . Both Microsoft and Sony have been known to sell its product on their own , respective storefronts . You can very much get lucky one day and buy an Xbox Series X or Series S console . However , like most retailers , Microsoft does unannounced drops , meaning you either have to be at the right place at the right time or have some type of another notification system that keeps an eye on restocks when you do n't have the bandwidth to do so . <p> Sony 's Direct service is a bit different , as it uses a virtual line queue , which unfortunately means timing can again be a factor since reservations are not always open like with the Steam Deck , but it does at least allow Sony to directly reach out to PlayStation users and offer a chance to purchase a system . <p> Valve 's process was by no means perfect ; I very much was one individual among many others met with error messages and long waiting periods just to ensure I had a reservation for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many smart tweaks to the preordering system that sellers across the industry should take note of . But it employed many smart tweaks to the preordering system that sellers across the industry should take note of . <p> The preorder process was imperfect and it did not keep scalpers away entirely . But the fact of the matter is , scalpers will always exist in some capacity . And there is no sign that retailers are planning to consistently sell these highly desired products anytime soon and even if they do the supply will be even more limited than it would to just sell it on a retailer website . And based on the few instances we have seen PS5s , Xbox Series X/S and RTX 30s out in the wild , people are more than ready to campout for the chance to possibly secure these items . <p> Will scalpers always exist ? Yes , so long as highly anticipated items are sold online in any capacity . But the Steam Deck 's queue system showed us there is a better way to ensure there is somewhat more of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for these expensive but highly in-demand items . Hopefully , some of these lessons can be learned before the PS6 and Xbox Series XX come to market . As preordering becomes more of a norm and the internet becoming a better way to distribute units to order compared to dividing a limited supply of units across various stores , it is time for retailers to implement a better moderation system and stop making it easier for scalpers to control the supply of many high-ticket items . And Valve just demonstrated some of the simple but important measures that can be taken to achieve just that . <p> Taylor is the Associate Tech Editor at IGN .

@@63182238 <h> The quantum Internet : a glimpse at the future of connectivity <p> Jul 28 , 2021 <p> While many of us may not have heard of quantum computing , in the background , it 's quietly starting a tectonic shift in the world of tech . Quantum computers are capable of calculating complex problems in seconds , which would take the fastest supercomputers 10 000 years . <p> By Prenesh Padayachee , chief digital officer at Seacom <p> Although the tech has a long way to go before it hits the mainstream , researchers and scientists are looking for ways to harness the power of quantum mechanics and pave the way forward for the quantum Internet . The promise of unprecedented computation power and unbreakable cybersecurity could change communications forever , and lead to many astounding capabilities . <p> What is quantum computing ? <p> Traditional computers encode information in 1s and 0s , and this basic unit of information is called a ' bit ' . This computing power relies directly on the number of binary transistors that can be used to run computations . <p> A quantum computer , on the other hand , leverages the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ encodes information using the physical properties of individual particles ( such as the direction a photon is spinning ) to create 1s or 0s called ' qubits ' . Classical computers exhibit a direct increase in computing power with every added transistor , whereas quantum computing power increases exponentially with every qubit added to the system . <p> Quantum computers also take advantage of a unique phenomenon called entanglement , where two particles that have interacted can be split up across vast distances -- and are still able to interact instantaneously with one another . These particles are inextricably linked , and share information with each other . Knowing the physical state of the one entangled particle allows you to know the state of the other , and because they interact instantaneously across distances , they share information faster than the speed of light . <p> The quantum roadmap <p> While quantum computing is yet to reach its true innovative potential , this futuristic tech has been around for longer than you may think . As early as 2004 , a bank in Austria carried out the first quantum-encrypted money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Switzerland used quantum cryptography to protect its elections . <p> In 2014 , Chinese scientists launched the world 's first quantum satellite and were able to achieve quantum entanglement to perform communication experiments across hundreds of miles between Earth and space . They were also able to expand this into a quantum network that spans 4 600 kilometres across China . In 2021 , a team of engineers created a network of quantum computers with a bandwidth switch that minimises operational costs and would make the theoretical quantum Internet more efficient . <p> Although still only a concept , researchers and scientists around the world are racing to build the world 's first quantum Internet . In theory , a quantum Internet will harness the unprecedented capabilities of quantum mechanics by allowing quantum devices to exchange information over a wide network . While it is currently not possible to use quantum entanglement to communicate faster than the speed of light , a quantum network would have other benefits . Sending qubits through a quantum Internet would give us access to computational capabilities that surpass today 's web applications . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as supply chain management , chemistry , physics , biology , machine learning , and even finance . With the astounding capabilities of quantum computing power , our ability to innovate would only be limited by what we can imagine . It would also allow us to send information in the most secure way possible : using quantum cryptography . <p> A new standard for security <p> Quantum cryptography surpasses most classical encryption methods as it sends information in the form of a physical particle ( such as a photon ) . It is impossible for an intruder to observe these particles without changing or destroying them , so a quantum Internet would be virtually unhackable . <p> At the same time , quantum computing could pose a threat to current methods of encryption in the near future . Most encryption protocols today use a combination of private and public keys , and with traditional computing methods , it is impossible to derive the private key from a public key that only holds a part of the relevant information . Quantum computers , however , are exceptionally good at decryption @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keys . <p> RSA is a widely used encryption method that we rely on for secure data transmission . According to a research paper by Cornell University , a 1024-bit RSA encryption would require approximately 1500 to 2000 qubits to decrypt with a quantum computer . Considering that IBM 's latest quantum computer aims to have 1121 qubits by 2023 , it may not be that long before current encryption methods become obsolete . Even the cryptocurrency blockchain , which is praised for its robust security , could be vulnerable . Deloitte has stated that " presently , about 25% of the Bitcoins in circulation are vulnerable to a quantum attack " . <p> Fortunately , current quantum computers still have high error rates and can only operate in lab conditions at temperatures near absolute zero . There are none that currently have enough qubits to pose a global security threat , but if quantum computing power continues to advance at its current exponential rate , we may soon have to rethink our encryption methods . <p> The era of quantum communication <p> Quantum communication may still be in its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the unique challenges of quantum mechanics , and because of parallel computing , quantum computers are becoming exponentially more powerful and stable . <p> Quantum cryptography could become the de facto standard for secure communication systems , and if it does , businesses will need to ensure that they find future-facing technology partners . The era of quantum communication seems distant , but it 's certainly worth thinking about what opportunities it may herald along the way .

CRAIG LEWIS reports . <p> A look at the Springboks ' bench for the highly anticipated rematch against the British &amp; Irish Lions in Cape Town says a lot about the Boks ' intent for this weekend 's battle . <p> After an opportunity for players to bank some much-needed game time this past Saturday , the Springboks have been able to revert to the true Bomb Squad configuration for the bench , with six forwards and two backs offering substitution options . <p> It 's vastly different to what we saw over the weekend in terms of the attributes of this new-look bench . <p> Frans Malherbe and Steven Kitshoff are now back in the starting lineup -- which is somewhat injury-enforced due to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the front row is the option the Boks went for in the opening 2019 World Cup match against the All Blacks . <p> As was also the case back then , Trevor Nyakane is now on the bench , while Vincent Koch -- who was a key member of the Bomb Squad later in the competition -- will also offer real dynamism in the second half . <p> But then come the Springbok trump cards : Marco van Staden is a vastly different loose forward to any others in the Bok squad , someone who hunts at the breakdown and serves as a metaphorical heat-seeking missile on defence . <p> He is someone who can offer real game-changing influence after a period of Bok blunt-force trauma in the first 40 to 50 minutes . <p> The same can be said for Kwagga Smith , who just seems far better suited to an impact role off the bench when he can lift the tempo and exploit any space that has opened up in broken play . <p> Then there 's Willemse , who is effectively taking the baton from double World @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to allow for the Boks to be able to replace almost their entire forward pack at some stage or another . <p> For Willemse to be given this responsibility over Steyn , who is in the squad , is something that should not be overlooked . <p> As I wrote after the Boks ' first warm-up game against Georgia , Willemse 's high work rate and intensity in looking to get involved in play would have been particularly satisfying for the Springbok coaches . <p> Willemse has accumulated eight Test caps since making his Bok debut in 2018 , and his on-field game time has been rather sporadic . In that context , though , this period in the national set-up has undoubtedly been his most rewarding to date . <p> The responsibility and trust placed in him , particularly for a series of this magnitude and what is now a must-win second Test match , speaks volumes for his impressive progression . <p> That exact point was driven home by Nienaber at Tuesday 's team announcement media conference : " Damian has participated in almost all the games we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 12 and 15 , similar to what Frans Steyn gave us at the World Cup , and I think his form amplifies his selection currently . <p> " He 's a versatile guy and now that he 's been introduced into various roles to fulfil for us we 're comfortable that he can do a good job at 10 , 12 or 15 . And with the inclusion of Marco and Kwagga on the bench , there should be some nice energy to inject in the second half . " <p> And there is the buzzword for the Boks and the Bomb Squad : energy . If injected effectively , it could be a game-changer on Saturday .

Covering the Springboks , Bulls , Stormers/Western Province , Sharks , Cheetahs , Kings and Lions , as well as schools and club rugby . <p> SA Rugby director of rugby Rassie Erasmus says he found it " weird " that British &amp; Irish Lions head coach Warren Gatland questioned TMO Marius Jonker 's integrity before the first Test of the Lions series last week . <p> The buildup to this past Saturday 's first Test between the Springboks and Lions was dominated by the Lions ' reported angry reaction to Jonker being appointed as the series TMO , after Brendon Pickerill had to withdraw due to travel issues caused by the Covid-19 pandemic . <p> Jonker and referee Nic Berry made a few contentious calls in the first Test on Saturday , which Erasmus himself highlighted with video clips on social media . <p> During Tuesday 's team announcement media conference , Erasmus was asked whether he felt the Lions had successfully influenced the officials through the media , and whether the Springboks hoped to do the same with match-day referee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we have found that when we talk in the media too much it normally backfires on us , " Erasmus said . " But then Warren Gatland spoke last week about Marius Jonker . Warren is a great guy and a good man , but it was weird for me that people would question Marius ' integrity . <p> " If we had to say this week that Ben O'Keeffe is a New Zealander and Warren is also a New Zealander , we would never say that . It would n't sit well , and the whole integrity of the game would be questioned . We will never do that . " <p> Erasmus explained that part of his motivation for tweeting the videos was that feedback from World Rugby over the officiating in the first Test was slow . <p> " So , we 're trying to find out from World Rugby exactly about some decisions we got wrong during the game . That 's what we 're focusing on a hell of a lot . Feedback was a little slow and we are trying to incorporate that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Saturday . <p> " So , no , we wo n't be loud in the media . " <p> Erasmus was then asked if micro-analysing every refereeing decision and promoting it on Twitter was also a part of undermining the integrity of the referee and the game . <p> " That 's 100% right , " he answered . " If someone goes and micro- analyses every wrong decision , I think that 's wrong , you ca n't do that . A referee only has two pairs of eyes . But if you do analyse things he 's supposed to see , then you are spot on in doing that when it comes to the integrity of the game . " <p> Erasmus added he was unsure whether World Rugby should step in when pre-match comments are made about the referees , but emphasised that he had learned his own lessons in this regard . <p> " Not sure what the answer is on that one . It is a difficult one . I was baffled when Marius was appointed as the TMO . I am actually close , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I made a point of not phoning him before that match because I thought it was such a tough thing for him to do . I did feel when he was mentioned because he is South African , that did n't sit well with me . <p> " I know last year , in the Rugby Championship , New Zealand and Australia played with New Zealand referees and Australian referees against each other . That 's the way things happened because of Covid . <p> " I do n't know if World Rugby should interfere , but if Ben O'Keeffe makes wrong decisions on Saturday , you will never hear us say it 's because he is New Zealander . One must try and stay away from those things . I have learned my lesson when I have made those mistakes many times . I have many times talked too much about referees. "

Today , the school management is uncertain about the future of teaching and learning after the property was damaged and looted . <p> The school currently caters to more than 200 pupils and it employs 22 teachers . <p> " Initially , classes began in the basement of a home in Watsonia in Tongaat with 12 pupils . Thereafter , they were held in the basement of the nearby Chelmsford Hotel . As the enrolment grew to 36 , the school moved to the Hindu Patshala Temple in Fairbreeze . As the enrolment numbers grew , classes were then held in a wooden structure in Verulam and in 1985 it was converted into a brick structure , said Shireen Hariparsad , the head of the senior phase . <p> During the unrest , 25 sponsored computers from the school 's computer centre and three television sets were stolen . The looters also vandalised the skills room . <p> " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for pupils , was destroyed , and the appliances , including the fridge , microwave , kettle and industrial cooker , were stolen . They also stole the stored food , dishes , the tools from the agriculture centre , the equipment from the woodwork room and the hair salon where we train pupils . " <p> Hariparsad said the two school buses that they recently acquired from the Department of Education were damaged and parts were stolen . Fuel from the bus tanks was extracted . Hariparsad said the damages amounted to more than R100 000 . <p> She said this would impact teaching and learning . <p> " We admit pupils with multiple disabilities and we currently have 217 learners . They are placed in different classes according to their capabilities . Here , they acquire speech and occupational therapy and skills development .

Apart from their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provide them with hot meals and transport to and from home . Although Golden Steps is a public school and it receives a subsidy from the Department of Education , the subsidy is not enough to sustain the school 's day-to-day operations . The looting and damage will subsequently cripple the culture of learning and teaching at the school . " <p> Hariparsad said the school was reliant on sponsorships and donations from non-profit organisations and the public . <p> Due to the pandemic and the lockdowns , they recently embarked on hamper drives to assist the pupils ' families . <p> She said the school always maintained and upheld its standard of education . <p> " Our vision is to ensure our learners are provided with quality education and skills , so that they become responsible and independent individuals . However , today the school does not have the basic necessities to pursue that vision . We may have to close until the infrastructure is repaired , rebuilt or replaced .

It hurts and it 's sad that people would destroy and steal from a school meant for special kids . I hope they are caught .

@@63200233 <h> From ' Boardroom 606 ' to Zoom : how wage talks have changed for SA 's mining unions <p> COLLECTIVE bargaining in South Africa 's mining sector has been under the auspices of the Chamber of Mines ( now Minerals Council South Africa ) since 1915 . Inclusive collective bargaining was established in the gold and coal sectors in 1983 when the National Union of Mineworkers ( NUM ) , led by its first general secretary Cyril Ramaphosa , joined the central bargaining process . <p> Negotiations took place in Boardroom 606 in the Minerals Council 's building . The negotiating teams of the various mining houses and mining trade unions sat around a huge table with the shop stewards and the mining house delegations being seated behind the negotiators . <p> When , in 2015 , the mining trade union AMCU became part of the negotiations together with NUM , Solidarity , and UASA , the availability of space became a challenge and the negotiating venue had to move to conference centres . <p> With almost 200 trade union and company representatives involved in the process , the services of independent facilitators were called in . Members @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hall , chanting . Due to their mutual rivalry , they never sat next to each other . Even their caucus rooms were far apart . <h> End of an era <p> The scene in what is the negotiating theatre has since changed dramatically after the coal companies last year decided to start negotiating at the mine level . Gold companies followed suit this year . And so , the era of central collective bargaining came to an end . <p> On the coal sector side , it was the large companies that wanted to negotiate at the mine level due to the constraining effect central bargaining had on them . They were in a position to grant higher increases than the other companies but were bound by a collective process , though . This meant that when a deadlock was reached , the larger companies would become the centre of a strike , while they would have been able to reach a settlement had they negotiated on their own . <p> As for the gold sector , there are only two major mining houses left -- Sibanye-Stillwater and Harmony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these companies prefer to negotiate tailor-made agreements . <p> Before decentralised negotiations could shift to a mining house boardroom the impact of Covid-19 resulted in the introduction of virtual negotiations . " Virtual " means nearly 60 stakeholders per mining house can arm-wrestle on a digital platform . Digital breakaway rooms are then used where the respective parties can hold their strategic caucus discussions . <p> Initial teething problems duly followed as connections failed and some miners , accustomed to a different era of communication , struggled to follow online protocols . <p> While a virtual platform does have logistical advantages , the main disadvantage is the inability to read the other party 's body language . Fortunately , with the relaxation of lockdown regulations , a hybrid approach will become available . The main negotiators will then be able to share the same room with a virtual link to rooms where the various representatives can follow the negotiations on screen . <h> New strategies <p> As the unions and the mining houses no longer have a collective platform , new alignment strategies needed to be developed . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mining houses exchange notes behind the scenes because they follow the same approach , using the same information and arguments . The trade unions , again , use the same negotiators at the respective mining houses to remain aligned and they try to submit the same individual demands to each mining house . <p> The trade unions have now also come up with a historic first : At Harmony NUM , Solidarity and UASA formed a coalition , consolidated their demands , and are negotiating under one banner on behalf of the majority of the workers . This year , AMCU again dropped its traditional financial presentation to motivate their demands , this time motivating its demands mainly on the basis of Bible verses . AMCU relies specifically on Genesis 1 : 26-30 , contending that all are equal and that everything on earth should be shared by all -- their interpretation would get a nod of approval from Karl Marx . <p> The gold and coal negotiators adjusted easily to the new normal , but the real test lies in the end result . The two mining sectors have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the demand for coal locally .

@@63200234 <h> OPINION : SA labour law inflexibility offers no support for unforeseen eventualities <p> JACO SWART , National Manager and Collective Bargaining Co-ordinator of the National Employers ' Association of South Africa ( NEASA ) <p> Over the years , a lot has been written by numerous commentators on the inflexibility and stringent requirements of the South African Labour Law dispensation . <p> This commentary usually centres around the rigorous legal and administrative requirements surrounding the dismissal of employees , as well as the impact complex labour legislation has on the ability of employers to adapt quickly to changing circumstances . <p> These shortcomings have , yet again , been laid bare in the latest incidences of unrest , looting and vandalism which caused many businesses to be unable to trade . The simple question is , what are these employers to do in respect of their obligations towards their employees where there is currently no work for them to perform ? <p> The employment relationship between the parties attracts two aspects of the law that deserve attention in this context . The first is the contractual right that an employee has in terms of his/her contract of employment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fair labour practices as contained in the Labour Relations Act . This means that an employee has two distinct courses of action on which to base a claim against his/her employer . <p> In terms of a purely contractual claim , the employee will have to assert that the employer is in breach of its obligations in terms of the contract , to remunerate him/her where the employee is tendering performance and can claim specific performance or damages . In the current circumstances , an employer may well be able to resist these claims by a defence of force majeure or impossibility of performance , each of which comes with its own complexities . <p> Force majeure , also known as ' an act of God ' is a concept that is not found in the South African common law , but is a principle that may be incorporated into a contract . In terms thereof , the parties to a contract may stipulate circumstances under which a party may be excused from performing for as long as a particular set of unforeseen circumstances persist , or under which a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be of a permanent nature . An employer will not be able to rely on this , should such a force majeure clause not have been included in the employment contract . <p> In the absence of a force majeure clause , an employer may still rely on the common law principle of ' intervening impossibility ' to defend a contractual claim . In terms of this principle , if some sort of event , i.e. fire , flood , riots etc. makes it impossible for a party to perform in terms of a contract , such a party may be excused from his/her obligation . However , the burden of proof for this defence is extremely difficult to discharge , as the employer will have to prove that it is objectively impossible to perform and not that it would merely be difficult or disproportionally burdensome to do so . <p> Even if an employer is able to successfully defend a contractual claim , it does not absolve it from potential liability based on the right to fair labour practices . The defences mentioned above are not available to an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practice . This is so because a claim based on breach of contract is based on the lawfulness or not of such breach , whereas an unfair labour practice is based on the fairness and not the lawfulness thereof . <p> The current situation , where the employer can not operate due to the riots , must be distinguished from the situation that prevailed during the Covid-19 hard lockdown . The lockdown regulations prevented both the employer and the employee to perform in terms of the contract , as the employer could not operate and the employee was not permitted to tender his/her services . Therefore , the principle of no-work-no-pay is applied . <p> In the current circumstances , as long as the employee tenders his/her services , the employer is obligated to perform in terms of the contract . This does not mean that the employer must supply work to the employee , however , the employer is obligated to pay the employee . <p> Although there are a number of options available to these employers , they are wholly unsuitable due to the nature of the required @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legal ramifications emanating therefrom . <p> An employer may opt to implement short-time or a lay-off for the period that it is unable to trade , however , these processes require consultation and agreement with the employees in order to implement them fairly . The South African labour laws contain no general provision for short-time or lay-offs ; consequently , the right to implement these processes needs to be acquired by the employer by virtue of such provisions in the individual contracts of employment , a collective agreement or in the absence of any of the former , by agreement with the employees . <p> In the absence of any agreement , the employer may have to resort to initiating a retrenchment process which is technical , time-consuming and carries a cost implication for the employer in terms of severance packages , leave balances and notice pay , all while the employer can not generate any income and has to rebuild the business . <p> It may be possible for the employer to unilaterally implement changes to the conditions of employment . This is , however , also not without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strike action . It may , in any event , not be a suitable option as the required changes to the conditions of employment , in order to address the current situation , are so excessive and fundamental in nature , that it may well be viewed as an unfair- or constructive dismissal , if the employees should resign , claiming that the actions of the employer made it intolerable to continue with the employment relationship . <p> Another natural option is for the employer to simply liquidate the business , placing the employees in the position of creditors of the estate . However , this is never the desired option and never viable for employers who wish and need to rebuild their businesses for the sake of the economy , their employees and their own livelihoods . <p> Although the riots have presented the quintessential example of the unsuitability of the South African Labour Law dispensation , there are many other sets of circumstances where the inflexible and stringent laws and regulations are preventing employers from adapting to changing circumstances , accessing opportunities and competing on a global scale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without being hamstrung by bureaucratic red tape and regulations that do not assist anybody in the long term

" Take art investment as an example . The artwork has intrinsic value to the individual who buys it , but it has no income or cash flow stream for the investor .

In this case , the networking gear was made by an affiliate of H-P 's in China , exported to India on lease , then sold back into the Chinese market . <p> Equipment deal <p> According to court documents , including affidavits , the saga that led to the lawsuit began in 2011 , when ICT employees Jade Cheng and Jason Yuyi were informed of a major opportunity : H-P Financial Services India was going to sell them used computer networking equipment for resale to their clients around the world . <p> Preparing for the deal involved hours of gruelling work : " As long as there were potential buyers , Jason and I spent days and nights making phone calls , sending emails and creating online ads just to prepare for the ' big future , ' " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the equipment was delivered , it became clear the gear was n't as advertised . ICT 's clients complained the equipment was in poor condition and contained defects , which resulted in damages to profits and the company 's reputation , Cheng said . The first instalment of gear was purchased for $250,000 , with plans in place to sell it for $1.5 million . But ICT 's clients backed out once they realised the equipment was defective . <p> The fallout with clients after the discovery of the problematic equipment consumed Cheng and Yuyi 's time . Cathy Yu joined ICT in 2012 , and she , too , worked during the year on trying to repair client relationships . <p> Missing workers <p> Then one day -- December 10 , 2012 -- Cheng noticed his two colleagues were n't logged on to their work computers . <p> Cheng , the former Asia-Pacific director of ICT , at first thought they 'd slept in . They were young and it was Monday morning . After repeated attempts to reach them by phone , including calling their parents , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeling when your gut is telling you something 's not right , " Cheng said in an affidavit . <p> His gut was correct . Cheng 's colleagues had been arrested by the Chinese Public Security Bureau , and placed in the Haidian Detention Center in Beijing , accused of selling fraudulent equipment . Cheng would soon join them as an inmate when he traveled from Rushan City to China 's capital to find out what was going on . <p> Cheng , in his affidavit , said that following his arrest he lived in various cells in the detention center , slept on the floor and had to share a blanket , missed Christmas and New Year 's with his family , sat on wooden boards for hours at a time , drank filthy water , was forced to take ice cold showers and was threatened by other inmates . <p> " I felt like I stepped into hell , " Cheng said in the affidavit . <p> Filing suit <p> These conditions persisted until Cheng and his colleagues ' release on bail in July 2013 . In 2014 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letter from the police , essentially exonerating them . In 2015 , they sued H-P 's successor companies : Hewlett-Packard Enterprise Co. and HP Inc. ; as well as subsidiary H-P Financial Services India and H3C , a company joint venture in China . <p> In interviews and affidavits , Cheng and his jailed colleagues and their boss ICT founder and Chief Executive Officer Alex Styller said they believe H-P 's Indian subsidiary sold them fake gear , representing it as authentic , and the Chinese joint venture reported them to the authorities . <p> " This left them in a bind , " Styller , in an interview with Bloomberg , said of the Hewlett-Packard related companies . " If they admitted they had sold us counterfeit equipment , it would mean a violation of the law in India . It would also hurt their reputation in China , a very important market to them , and would mean their reckless sale of that equipment had caused three innocent people to be imprisoned . " <p> ' Remarkable tale ' <p> According to the H-P companies , those accusations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is n't supported by the facts . <p> " Under Styller 's direction , ICT intentionally broke a host of Chinese civil and criminal laws by conducting business without a license ; depriving employees of legal protections ; smuggling goods past customs officials ; evading taxes and selling counterfeit transceivers that did n't come from HPFS India , " the defendants said in their dismissal request . Representatives of the companies declined further comment . <p> Sorokin in 2017 tossed a false imprisonment claim made by the ICT employees , saying there was no evidence the H-P related companies intended to have the workers locked up : " The court , drawing on its ' common sense , ' finds implausible the individual plaintiffs ' bald suggestion that the defendants made insufficient efforts to obtain their release because they intended to keep them confined . " <p> The ICT group submitted a revised suit to try to get the judge to reconsider that rejection . <p> ICT said the years of wrangling in court and failed settlement discussions with the H-P related companies represent the defendants ' efforts to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cover their tracks . The defendants , whose dismissal petition attacks the legal validity of the suit , said pretrial information-sharing revealed both sides agree there is no evidence H-P supplied the counterfeit gear . That , in turn , shows that ICT 's leaders are the real fraudsters , the H-P related companies say . <p> ICT 's history <p> Styller started ICT in 1993 , three years after fleeing the Soviet Union as a political refugee , to " give old technology a new life " and provide equipment to companies that could n't afford full price for new gear . Since then , ICT says on its website that it has processed almost 5.4 million pounds of e-waste and the company 's business dealings are " fully compliant with regulations and standards . " <p> Still , this is n't the company 's first legal tangle with a US technology titan .

However , it is one man 's dream to bring Lagos Nigeria on the same luxury list . <p> Thirty-year-old Adetola Nola has a big vision for the real estate market in Nigeria . " We think that we can actually bring something that 's not really in the Nigerian luxury space , " he tells FORBES AFRICA . <p> Adetola Nola , CEO Veritasi Homes . <p> He founded Veritasi Homes and Properties almost six years ago , and since then has achieved what many only dreams of before the age of 30 . Making it on some of the worlds global lists such as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Young Africans list by Avance Media , he has set his eyes to the sky . <p> " Initially , in the real estate business when it comes to affordable homes , they prioritise functionality over aesthetics . So when you buy a cheap building it just has to be functional . However when you come to Lagos , they prioritize aesthetic over functionality , " he says . <p> Through Veritasi Homes , Nola aims to rebrand the company providing premium housing in Lagos proving that luxury and affordability do go hand in hand . Over the last years they have been able to learn from the best locations of luxury and architecture such as France , Dubai , England and New York to bring his vision to life in some of the most affluent neighbourhoods in Lagos . <p> As a result , Veritasi Homes is rebranding its identity to reflects its growth over the last four years and also as it upscale its housing development into new areas like Ikoyi , Lagos and Asokoro , Abuja .

" This is a big danger because sometimes 1000 people stay in a space and the building is tilted , and it can fall off anytime , " he says . <p> Infused with technological advancements such as voice control features and fingerprints the luxury that Nola speaks of offers both functionality and aesthetics from the lights down to the basement parking . " It 's about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house and when you are in some of the best hotels in the world . If you can achieve that then I think you can say that you have developed luxury , and that 's what we are trying to do , " he says . <p> " Usually , three or four years ago people would think that these were very hard to combine , but we now make sure that you can make your home smart and it can still be affordable , " he says . <p> Apart from overcoming the infrastructure development issues in Nigeria , the other challenges faced by property development companies is the political and economic challenges in the country . All this from getting the right land documentation , working with policies and artisans are mountains sometimes difficult to move . <p> " These are the problems we face from money problems , government policy , artisans and political instability .

But instead of running away from the problems , Nola stands firm in his decision to be part of the solution to Nigeria 's infrastructure . <p> " There is never a right time to do anything . You want to make the time right for yourself , " he says . <p> " As an entrepreneur , I have tried my hands on several businesses early on in my life and a number of them failed . The failure from these businesses brought in important business lessons that will eventually come in very handy in running Veritasi Homes with my team , " he admits . <p> By the time Veritasi Homes was founded , it was his eighth business and everything fell into place which he is extremely grateful for . <p> Nola carries the spirit of American civil rights activist John Lewis who once said " If not us , then who ?

However , although the schemes provide regular paydays , they do not build wealth . It 's a problem that required a new view , a digital face and an entrepreneurial spirit to bring traditional stokvels up to date . Recently , all three requirements for this transformation of the traditional into modern methods came together when mining engineer turned banker , Tshepo Moloi , realised that things could be different , and began working on an app named Stokfella . The app went on to win the Best Financial Solution section of the 2020 MTN Business App of the Year Awards and is now attracting a new generation of stokvel savers . <p> The key to the app 's success has been digitally based options that ease the administrative burden of their traditional community-based schemes and offer business-focused investment options and benefits . <p> " Stokfella was my first socially based developmental challenge . My thinking was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needs for years , it could work better , " says Moloi . <p> " With my engineering background , I realised that I could build processes around stokvel operations and then , using my banking experience , marry the processes to a financially efficient model . <p> " I believe that stokvels are an industry . Like any industry , they operate at different levels and offer services that are matched to customer needs . I found that about 60% of stokvels are still traditional and focus on burial schemes , buying groceries , consumables and other services and that the rest of the schemes concentrate on savings . <p> " It became obvious that even members of community-based stokvels did n't realise that they were , in fact , participants in long-term savings schemes . This was particularly the case in burial stokvels . People are content to contribute to these structures for many years , knowing that funds are paid out as members pass away .

For example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 000 a year and has total reserves of R100 000 , this meant that the opportunity to have R90 000 invested and earning better returns was being lost . " <p> So , how does the Stokfella app change all this ? <p> As a digital platform , it addresses a younger generation of savers ( average age about 35 years old ) and investors who are comfortable with the stokvel traditions but want to accumulate funds and build future wealth . <p> " They want stokvels to work for them and open up investment opportunities by using accumulated funds from like-minded people to invest in , say , a property where they can benefit from the growth of property values and also through rentals , " says Moloi . <p> By broadening this concept , Stokfella encouraged people to participate as group investors in activities like transport and logistics , buy franchises and even invest in start-ups buying machinery to produce retail products .

Stokfella also assists those who want to start community-based initiatives by helping with structuring governance measures that safeguard investors . <p> The success of updated , digital stokvels is demonstrated by the 30 000 people who now regularly use the platform and the millions of transactions that have been recorded since the app went live . <p> Stokfella may be small and focused now , says Moloi , but with more than eight million members , the stokvel industry offers boundless opportunities . <p> " The success of Stokfella proves that even time-honoured , traditional practices can be given new life , " says Kholo Magagane , Head of Marketing at MTN Business .

And yes , here at Grocott 's , while we stand by the science and countless studies that have brought us the COVID-19 vaccines , we believe it is important to hear other viewpoints before we begin to pass judgment or formulate our immediate responses . <p> One such example was shared with us in the comments of a Facebook post this last week , where one member of the community shared how they had been treated as an anti-vaxxer because of their current refusal to get vaccinated . <p> That is , for some , an immediate reaction : to judge when we hear that people do not want to be vaccinated . But in reading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They had already had the virus twice , and drawing on a study from a peer-reviewed journal , could argue that their immune system had already received the same ' message ' that another person 's immune system would receive from getting the vaccine . This person is not opposed to vaccinations but does not believe that , right now , it is necessary because their body has developed the necessary antibodies . In this moment of engaging with this experience shared with us , I wondered how we could create the space for people to share their viewpoints without increasing divides ? <p> One thing we are trying to do at Grocott 's Mail when differing viewpoints come in is to approach them with respect and careful consideration . There is great potential , value and learning in all viewpoints . While this may make us initially uncomfortable -- whether we 're pro , anti , or somewhere in the middle -- it is important that we hold space for differing views if we want to have productive conversations that ultimately bring us together as a community instead of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find common goals between those of us who have differing viewpoints . For instance , back to the case of the COVID-19 vaccine , what do those who are pro-vax and anti-vax have in common ? The wish to prevent harm . This is understood from their different viewpoints , but it does come down to this . How do we move the conversation forward with this in mind ? <p> Issues such as COVID-19 and vaccinations are not clear cut . There are real concerns from all groups , and they should be heard without trying to correct or judge off the bat . Once again , we are appealing to the community to reach out to us and share your views on the COVID-19 vaccine . We want to understand your experiences , wherever you may fall in the current debate on whether to receive the vaccine or not . <h> Listen <p> The Rhodes University Community Engagement Division has launched Engagement in Action , a new podcast which aims to bring to life some of the many ways in which the University interacts with communities around it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @

The answer is not very surprising : Printers manage a lot of data , explains Canon South Africa 's Data Privacy Information Officer , Ian Nel : " If you have to think of what gets printed on multifunction devices in our daily environment , it covers various types of content -- some of a sensitive nature . Think of employee salaries , running budgets , contracts , purchase orders , etc . Having sensitive information on a printer , whether it is in a centralised environment or in a home office or another remote environment , can pose a risk .

But software vendors partnering with multifunction vendors are starting to tone down the level of complexity with these types of solutions . For example , connecting a printer system with a secure cloud-based storage service is much easier to deploy today , even if the printer is at a remote location .

Sometimes , the gap is due to the tendency of people to focus on the here and now and not the long-term benefits and rewards , favouring immediate gratification . <p> A second barrier is the complexity and information overload that exists in the financial services sector . Financial products can be overwhelming for those consumers who are n't financially literate or astute . Research shows that when there are too many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choose anything as they become overwhelmed . Having more options requires time and effort to process , leading to inertia , procrastination , or buyer 's remorse . <p> Analysing these barriers through a behavioural lens reveals opportunities to create new financial offerings that are better suited to customers ' needs . Interventions using psychological triggers or nudges can be designed to assist people in bridging the gap between intentions and actions . <p> A nudge is effectively an intervention that reframes the way choices are presented so that people are more likely to pick the option that benefits them . Importantly , while nudging may reframe choices , it does n't restrict them . It is not as forceful as an incentive or a penalty . <p> Another behaviour change technique is a commitment device , which helps a user to make a choice in the present that restricts choices in the future to help control impulsive spending . An example is opening a savings account that has hefty fees for early withdrawal or that disallows withdrawals for a pre-specified time . <p> Using these techniques , the team @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to change financial behaviour , which will ultimately address financial inclusion . It is aimed at South African fleet operators , owner and courier drivers and focuses on three aspects for the driver : to save on expenses , to make the participant lendable and to automate and improve on cutting the costs of expenses such as fuel and tyres . <p> The app uses an online marketing technique called gamification , which encourages engagement with a product or service . By gamifying financial spend , we hope to encourage usage , assist logistics business to run more profitably , and , more importantly , to uplift and educate drivers to better manage the vehicle . The app connects to the vehicle , empowering the driver to be financially healthy as expenses are monitored and incentives provided for effective cost-control . <p> There are infinite possibilities on what the user can automate . All the user needs to do is choose a trigger , such as ' after every 100km travelled ' , then an action , such as ' put aside R45 ' , a function , such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accept or reject an automation . This automation is repeated until the independent driver has to use funds to pay for tyres . <p> By better understanding how people process information , make choices , form preferences and act on their choices , the institutions and people working to promote financial inclusion can make progress on closing critical gaps and address not only access but also action .

@@63296230 <p> Answer:I am always wary when it comes to answering income tax questions because there are so many factors that could have an impact on the answer . <p> With that health warning , let me sketch out the key issues that you should watch out for . <p> In the past , home office expenses were generally only claimed by those who earned more than 50% of their income from commission . Salaried people who worked at a company office did not spend enough time working from home to qualify for the allowance . <p> With Covid-19 , most of us have spent a lot more time than usual working from home . We now have a situation where many salaried employees may qualify for this deduction for the first time . The question is : Should you do it ? <p> There are a number of hoops you have to jump through to get this deduction : <p> The part of your private home that is used for trade purposes must be specifically equipped for trade purposes . If you just haul out your laptop and work at the dining room table , you would not qualify @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dedicated area with , say , a desk where you work from . This area must be regularly and exclusively used for trade purposes . <p> You can not , for example , use a spare room that has a bed in it and claim that it is a home office because it breaks the exclusivity rule . I have heard an anecdote about a home office claim being denied because there was an exercise bicycle in the office . <p> You will probably be audited and asked to upload a 360 ? photo of the office . If you can not show that it is a dedicated area that has been set up as an office for the exclusive use of the business , the deduction will not be allowed . If you are due any payouts from other claims , you should take into account the time delay that this audit may have on the potential payout . <p> More than half of your employment services must be rendered in that part of the home that you are claiming for . <p> If , for example , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coffee shop , then you would not be able to claim for the deduction . <p> What you can claim for : <p> If you pass the above tests , then you must determine the percentage of the floor area of your office and what percentage of the floor area of your house it represents . <p> For example , if your home office is 30m2 and your house is 300m2 , then you qualify for a 10% deduction of costs such as : <p> Rental of the property or interest on the mortgage bond ; <p> Rates and taxes/levies ; <p> Electricity ; and <p> Cleaning costs . <p> This can be quite a saving . <p> What you can not claim for : <p> You will not be able to claim for items that are not related to the premises . These would include : <p> Contents insurance ; <p> Phone costs ; <p> Stationery ; <p> Furniture ; and <p> Computer equipment . <p> You would need to negotiate with your employer to have these costs reimbursed . <p> Insider tip <p> Your employer may need you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may require upgrading to a faster fibre connection . If your employer pays for it , it will be taxed as a fringe benefit . If , however , you pay for it , you can claim it back from your employer as a business expense . <p> Watch out for this potential pitfall : <p> When you sell your home , you are allowed an exclusion of R2-million on the capital gain . If , however , you have been granted a deduction for a home office , that percentage of the property would be excluded from the primary residence exclusion . <p> In the example above , where 10% of the house was a home office , then there would be a proportionate deduction in the capital gain exclusion . <p> As with most financial issues , there are several moving parts .

@@63296232 <p> The baseless and vitriolic attack on retired judge Siraj Desai by the South African Zionist Federation ( SAZF ) in the form of their complaint notarized in apartheid Israel and lodged with the Judicial Services Commission ( JSC ) warrants a response , for it underpins a sinister agenda to silence those justice and freedom loving people who speak out against the colonial occupation , crimes of apartheid and genocide by the Zionists against the people of Palestine . <p> Judge Desai , by expressing his support for the people of Palestine , has not committed a breach of the Judicial Service Commission Act or the Code of Judicial Conduct . His principled stance on issues of social justice globally is consistent with the values and precepts that informed our struggle against colonialism and apartheid , as well as our global solidarity with the oppressed in other parts of the world , especially in occupied Palestine . <p> The JSC , which was established in terms of section 178 of the Constitution , should refuse to accept or validate this complaint by the SAZF and not waste any resources investigating it , for it does not involve any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We should be mindful too that Judge Desai , who is currently a retired judicial officer , has not committed any judicial misconduct to begin with and that his support for the people of Palestine is commendable . <p> Judge Desai has been consistent in his support for the Palestinians for many years , even before his retirement , and therefore the motive and timing of the SAZF complaint is obvious , coinciding as it were when apartheid Israel has committed heinous crimes against the Palestinian people recently , and when misperceptions abound of the alleged unfair treatment of judicial officers who appeared before the JSC recently and were robustly questioned on their commitment to human rights and to fighting corruption . <p> The SAZF complaint against Judge Desai also coincides with the misguided application instituted by CASAC against the JSC , based on the perceived irregular questioning of judicial candidates by members of the JSC . <p> One such candidate is Judge David Unterhalter who failed to get the nod from the JSC for the vacancy on the Constitutional Court , after he was questioned about his declared membership @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , an organisation well known for its support for the Zionist and apartheid state of Israel , and his understanding and commitment to human rights values and international law . <p> We submit that the malicious complaint by the SAZF is unmeritorious and similarly the application instituted by CASAC , whose blatant display of double standards is equally astonishing as it is disappointing for an organisation that has sworn to uphold the values and precepts of our constitution . <p> They ( CASAC ) are objecting to the line of questions about judicial candidates ' interest in and commitment to human rights , but never once objected to similar robust questions posed to those judicial candidates who were known or perceived to be associated with the Broederbond , a secret organisation well known for its support of the apartheid regime and the heinous atrocities committed against Black people in South Africa . <p> The struggle against apartheid was a just and partisan cause in South Africa , and so too the struggle against Zionist oppression and exploitation of the Palestinians . <p> Support for Zionist oppression in occupied Palestine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ justice , equality , and freedom , globally and locally . <p> We do not believe that it is necessary for Judge Desai to explain or justify his commitment to human rights , and the values of freedom , equality , and justice . <p> NADEL supports the robust questioning of any judicial candidate 's commitment to human rights and finds the narrative of ' unfairness ' to be absurd . Any judge 's view on human rights is central to their eligibility or suitability for high judicial office . Members of the JSC were therefore entirely justified in asking judges , including Judge Unterhalter , questions which sought to test their understanding of human rights , globally and locally , mindful too that all judicial officers are required to have regard to international law when interpreting the Bill of Rights ( see section 39 of the Constitution ) . We therefore call on CASAC to withdraw its application and not waste any resources in pursuing a Zionist agenda . <p> The SAZF complaint falls outside the mandate and scope of the JSC , and lacks any merit and substance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We therefore call on the JSC to dismiss the SAZF complaint against Judge Desai , failing which it will be in the public interest for individuals and organisations to be permitted to make representations to the JSC in an open and transparent process . <p> Issued on behalf of the National Association of Democratic Lawyers ( NADEL ) , South Africa , 19 June 2021

" <p> Further , the collapse of major end-users of minerals , together with a significant decline in local construction , has also contributed to a poor outlook for the mining industry , he adds . <p> While it is trite , improving the mining industry depends entirely on a holistic approach to reform to ensure ease of doing business , says Beech . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calls for nationalisation or , at the very least , the implementation of nationalism measures that include incentivised local beneficiation . These incentives must be balanced so that they can have a positive effect . <p> " Government 's announcement of a ban on the export of raw chrome , with effect from July 2022 , as a means of protecting the local ferrochrome industry , will probably not meet the objective of encouraging local beneficiation . Additionally , it is unlikely to improve investment . " <p> In addition to general investor concerns surrounding regulatory certainty , corruption , crime , security and infrastructure , recent actions by government , which include the granting of rights to prospect and mine in environmentally protected areas and national parks , have resulted in a backlash from environmental activists . <p> Coal mining ventures in national parks , and the granting of rights to prospect and mine within national parks are " extremely concerning " . <p> Beech notes that government is likely to face " extremely strong resistance " from environmental activists about the impact of the granting of rights to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> There have been several initiatives by nongovernmental bodies in Zimbabwe -- including from the legal fraternity , and supported by global entities -- to overhaul the country 's policies and mining laws , without significant progress or success . <p> Where changes have been made , they have been viewed in an " extremely negative light " and , following international pressure , the Indigenisation Laws , which required 51% ownership to be held by black Zimbabweans , were reversed . <p> " If Zimbabwe is serious about being open for business , urgent reform is required , and must include addressing the rapidly growing small-scale and artisanal mining sector , " says Beech . <p> He explains that , owing to the country 's centralised gold-buying and payment system , the artisanal sector contributes to smuggling and " off the book " payments , with all the consequences that flow from this , including loss of revenue to government and negative impact on the environment . <p> The small-scale and artisanal miners are also exposed to the highest health and safety risks . <p> " Zimbabwe presents significant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and made more attractive . Increased extraction of platinum-group metals can benefit government , and diamonds are of great investor interest . <p> " However , local beneficiation is absolutely key to Zimbabwe 's growth and development , and tax incentives could play a key role in the development of local beneficiation facilities , " adds Beech . <p> Current restrictions on foreign exchange and repatriation of funds on investment will , however , remain a concern , and these aspects must be addressed . <p> " Occasionally , there is positive news . The announcement of the partnership between the State-owned National Oil Infrastructure Company of Zimbabwe and newly registered South African company Coven Energy Limited to build a second oil pipeline from Beira to Harare , is good news .

According to the Global Business Travel Association , spending on corporate trips could slide to as low as $1.24trn by 2024 from a pre-pandemic peak in 2019 of $1.43trn . <p> Business travel has " forever changed , " Greg Hayes , CEO of jet-engine maker Raytheon Technologies , said in a Bloomberg Radio interview in July . About 30% of normal commercial air traffic is corporate-related but only half of that is likely mandatory , he said . While the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really changed our thinking in terms of productivity , " Hayes said . <p> Having saved billions from slashed travel budgets during the pandemic with only a marginal impact on operations , companies , banks , consulting firms and government offices will be hard pressed to explain why they 'd return to their old ways . Kit Kat chocolate-bar maker Hershey said the pandemic showed that online meetings were a more efficient use of time and financial resources . Companies like Pfizer are grappling with questions about what one accomplishes with a trip that ca n't be done virtually , Tina Quattlebaum , its director of global travel operations , said at the GBTA Mid-Year Virtual Summit in July . <p> " We do n't think business travel will ever return to 2019 levels , " said Will Hawkley , the global head of travel and leisure at KPM . " Corporates are looking at their bottom-line , their environmental commitments , the demand from employees for more flexible working and thinking : Why do I have to bring that back ? " <p> That 's a blow to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the pandemic . Business travellers , who buy premium-class or more-expensive refundable tickets , rang in as much as three-quarters of airlines ' pre-pandemic profits while accounting for only 12% of seats , according to PwC . The hotels sector , which draws about two-thirds of its revenue from business travellers , could see a dip of as much as 18% by 2022 as virtual meetings replace 27% of corporate travel volumes , a Morgan Stanley study shows . <p> The world 's biggest airlines collectively lost a whopping $126bn in 2020 and are set to lose another $48 billion this year , according to the International Air Transport Association , their lobby . As they wrestle with those losses and the huge debts racked up after coronavirus punctured a decades-long boom in travel , the last thing airlines need is corporate customers cutting back . Carriers like Lufthansa , Air France-KLM , Delta Air Lines and American Airlines , with thousands of staff and overhead to support , depend on business travellers returning . <p> " The effect of this structural decrease in business travel will be enormous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are the most exposed to this category of traveler , " said Pascal Fabre , managing director in Paris for AlixPartners , a consulting firm . <p> Airlines are trying to stay optimistic . Delta CEO Ed Bastian said about 80% of the carrier 's large corporate clients have indicated that as much as 90% of their pre-Covid business travel will eventually return . <p> " I do n't expect we 're going to see a degradation in the aggregate of business demand over time , " he said in an interview . " The more people are connected in person , the more opportunities are created . I do n't see this being a significant body-blow to the industry as prognosticated by some . " <p> Traveling thousands of miles to meet with customers to discuss key issues across a table or over a meal made business sense before the pandemic and that has n't changed , said Warren East , the CEO of Rolls-Royce , which makes aircraft engines . <p> " Covid-19 has definitely taught people that some of the mad regular dashes across the Atlantic hither @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speaking at a net-zero event on June 17 . " But when you peel back beyond that superficial analysis , you realise people were doing it because they thought it delivered real benefit to them . " <p> There may also be competitive pressures to keep flying , Air France-KLM CEO Ben Smith said in an interview . " I hear many of our corporate customers saying that the day they lose an account because they were n't somewhere face-to-face will immediately bring them back to the way operations were before . " <p> Airlines are banking on a recovery sparked by pent-up demand after about 18 months when executives could n't visit customers -- hopes that are being dented by the spread of the delta variant . Even if there is an initial burst of activity , it will start to stabilise and the structural change to business travel will become evident by around 2024 , according to Fabre . <p> " In the past , it was seen as a good thing to go to the other side of the world to shake someone 's hand , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Aeroports de Paris , which operates dozens of airports around the world , said in an interview . " Many things that have been done by conference call during the pandemic will stay that way , especially when it comes to far-flung countries . This will be for costs and the environment as well as people 's wellbeing . " <p> Company executives travel for many reasons -- from business development and customer support to trade shows , conferences and meetings with local staff . Trips for intra-company activities will likely bear the brunt of the cuts " because client relationships are n't at stake , " said AlixPartners ' Fabre . <p> " We have learned how to work , develop products , sign contracts without traveling , " he said . <p> Deutsche Bank 's global head of Investment Banking Coverage and Advisory , Drew Goldman , said that while the bank 's client-related business travel will return to about 90% of pre-pandemic levels , trips for internal meetings will probably be a shadow of what they were before -- at 25% to 30% . <p> Volkswagen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fly . Internal booking software steers them toward alternatives to flying , the most carbon-intensive form of travel . They 're also asked to justify why they ca n't conduct the business online . At French defence and tech giant Thales , " trips will be for longer and probably less frequent in order to optimise costs , environmental impact and wellbeing , " said CEO Patrice Caine . <p> In Singapore , United Overseas Bank Ltd. , Southeast Asia 's third-biggest bank , plans to cut its travel budget by as much as 50% , and will limit trips to cases " where face-to-face interaction is essential , " said Dean Tong , head of group human resources . On New York-based Marsh &amp; McLennan 's second-quarter earnings call , CEO Dan Glaser said , " companies , not just Marsh McLennan , will travel with more purpose and will be more thoughtful about traveling .

" We will continue to travel because human bonds are absolutely necessary to our activity , but we will most certainly have an overall reduction of about 20% to 30% in our travel costs . " <p> Royal Dutch Shell has created online control rooms with interactive 3D simulations of oil platforms and plants , giving engineers virtual access from home . In Troy , Michigan , Kevin Clark , the CEO of Aptiv , a former car parts unit of General Motors , is using drones and Oculus augmented-reality headsets to show customers the performance and manufacturing run rates of plants in Mexico , Hungary , or China . <p> " We wo n't travel as much , " Clark said .

The European Commission rolled out an ambitious climate plan in July to force all industries to shift away from fossil fuels . Aviation has long been a target even though it accounts for only about 2.4% of global human-induced CO2 emissions . That 's because the sector was growing rapidly before the pandemic and has other negative effects on the Earth 's upper atmosphere . <p> " Companies have acknowledged that reducing the level of flights is one way of reducing climate change , " said Andrew Murphy , aviation director at advocacy group Transport &amp; Environment . " For the next 10 years , the best way to reduce emissions from aviation is to fly less . " <p> Airlines are providing companies tools to blunt the impact of CO2 emissions with carbon offsets and refreshing fleets with newer , more efficient planes . But with the tons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much to show that flying is a sustainable way to get around . Hydrogen-fuelled planes and electric commercial jetliners are decades away , and alternative aviation fuel is n't widely available and jacks up ticket prices . <p> Carriers may have to modify aircraft configurations to cut business class seats and add more premium economy places . Premium economy costs less to operate than business class and takes up less space . <p> Air France , for instance , is developing its so-called leisure-business category for passengers who buy premium-class tickets for holiday travel , according to Steven Zaat , the group 's CFO . Thirty-two Air France 777s are fitted with " quick change " systems that allow the airline to reduce the size of its business-class cabin . The airline is still confident about a rebound in business travel , but " we can always reconfigure our planes if necessary , " Zaat said in a Bloomberg TV interview . <p> While airlines grapple with the possibility of fewer business customers , some of those clients are happy not to be zipping around the world all the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business trips is less stress for the people who fly , " Hans-Ingo Biehl , the head of VDR , the German Business Travel Association , said in an interview . A study by the Baylor College of Medicine found frequent fliers have the same cancer risk as obese people . Also , companies have found that jet lag hurts productivity . <p> " There are a lot of myths and fantasy about travel , but it 's really very tiring , " said Michelin CEO Menegaux . " We should do it only when it 's absolutely necessary . I travel a lot and I can tell you it 's physically gruelling and takes a heavy toll . "

@@63324232 <h> Apple 's car ambitions thrown into doubt <p> The abrupt departure of Apple 's top automotive executive imperils its efforts to develop a self-driving car , a project that 's been seen as one of the tech giant 's biggest bets . <p> Doug Field , a Tesla veteran who joined Apple in 2018 to head up its car project , left on Tuesday to become Ford 's chief advanced technology officer . The announcement made only passing reference to Field 's work at Apple . <p> Field 's exit calls into question the progress Apple has made towards developing the technology and experience needed to compete in the auto industry . It 's just the latest upheaval for the division : Field is the fourth executive leading the Apple car project to step away in its seven-year history . <p> Apple 's car efforts have always been a bit of a paradox -- it 's a hotly anticipated product that the company says almost nothing about <p> Not that developing self-driving cars has been easy for anyone else .

And Uber Technologies agreed to sell off its autonomous-driving division last year . <p> Apple 's car efforts have always been a bit of a paradox -- it 's a hotly anticipated product that the company says almost nothing about . Field 's official title at Apple was vice president of special projects , belying the significance of his role . But he was entrusted with developing one of the company 's " next big things " , a product that could keep sales growing the way the iPhone , iPad and Apple Watch did in the past decade . <h> Lack of vision <p> Apple first kicked off plans to develop a self-driving electric car around 2014 , entering a race with the likes of Tesla . By 2016 , the project was struggling with confusing messaging from leadership , a lack of vision and problems surrounding autonomous-driving technology . Apple also found it hired too many people and laid off hundreds of engineers from the project in 2016 and 2019 . <p> Around the time of the first layoffs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the effort -- known as Project Titan -- and sought to refocus on the underlying capabilities .

He had previously worked for Apple before leading Tesla 's engineering efforts for the popular Model 3 , and his return was seen as a sign that the company was back to building an actual vehicle . Field reshaped the car group , bringing in Tesla 's former executives in charge of self-driving software , car interior and exterior designs , and drivetrains . <p> Tesla ... the one to beat <p> After Mansfield retired last year , oversight of Field 's project shifted to John Giannandrea , Apple 's top executive in charge of artificial intelligence .

Apple said it wishes Field well , but it would n't comment on how he would be replaced . Field 's departure could also indicate that he believed he had a better shot shipping electric cars at a legacy company rather than Apple -- despite it being the most valuable technology company in the world with nearly limitless resources . <p> After launching the Apple Watch in 2015 , Apple has been seeking breakthrough new product categories to continue expand its territory and gain new customers . <p> Its other forays , such as its Apple TV+ streaming service , have n't had much of an impact .

He does not have to follow the recommendation and the law gives him a prerogative , " Curlewis said . <p> Section 75 of the Correctional Services Act states that the national commissioner is empowered to " place under correctional supervision or day parole , or grant parole or medical parole to a sentenced offender serving a sentence of incarceration for 24 months or less " . <p> The Helen Suzman Foundation has threatened to drag Fraser to court if , by Monday next week , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @

@@63334235 <h> Internal political party campaign financing : All eyes on the high court <h> amaBhungane has argued in the Pretoria High Court that donations to internal political party campaigns -- which can lead to the candidate 's elevation to high office -- are constitutionally required to be disclosed . <h> Cherese Thakur for amaBhungane advocacy <p> Cherese Thakur is advocacy coordinator at the amaBhungane Centre for Investigative Journalism <p> Does the Constitution require that donations made to advance the cause of candidates vying for positions within political parties be disclosed ? <p> This is the question debated before the full Bench of the high court this week in a dispute between the amaBhungane Centre for Investigative Journalism and the president of the Republic of South Africa . <p> amaBhungane argued that this is indeed what the Constitution envisages : in order to curb the undesirable influences that donations can have on recipients , such donations should be disclosed by law -- at least in respect of members of the executive . <p> Section 96 of the Constitution envisages that members of the Cabinet and deputy ministers must act in accordance with a code of ethics set out by national @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must not act in any way that is inconsistent with their office , or expose themselves to any situation involving the risk of a conflict between their official responsibilities and private interests . <p> The Executive Members ' Ethics Act and its associated code , which is promulgated by the president , is the legislation that gives effect to Section 96 -- but amaBhungane argued that , to the extent that the Executive Members ' Ethics Code does not provide for members of the executive to disclose who funds their internal party campaigns , the code does not meet this constitutional standard . <p> Lawyers representing President Cyril Ramaphosa opposed the application by drawing on technical points relating to whether the condition " triggering " amaBhungane 's application had been fulfilled and on the merits and distinctions of whether such donations do in all cases constitute a " benefit " to the candidates . <p> The high court : there and back again <p> amaBhungane has argued its case concerning internal political campaign transparency before . We intervened in the president 's application to review a report by the Public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ failing to disclose donations to the CR17 campaign . <p> However , we were careful to distinguish our case from the dispute between those parties , given the apparent logical , legal and factual errors contained in the Public Protector 's report . <p> This meant that we made no assertions that Ramaphosa had or had not been obliged to disclose donations made to his 2017 bid for the top leadership position of the ANC . <p> Our litigation was instead based on the question of principle , and was forward-looking . <p> The high court dismissed our application on technical legal grounds , finding that the matter was not properly before it . <p> Tethered as our case was to this president/Public Protector dispute , we once again put forward our views in the Constitutional Court when the Public Protector was granted leave to appeal in that court . <p> There , the tide turned : on the specific question of our appeal , the Constitutional Court found that the high court had " erred in concluding that the challenge by amaBhungane was impermissible " . It remitted the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ merits . <p> And so , back to the high court we went . <p> Our case for disclosing internal party campaign financing <p> Our approach was informed by the Constitutional Court 's judgment , which had interpreted the existing code as not requiring the disclosure of internal campaign donations -- at least in the circumstances that pertained to the CR17 campaign , where the funds were raised and managed independently of Ramaphosa himself . <p> The crisp question was , then -- is this constitutional ? <p> Clearly , we argued , it can not be . <p> It is well-known that where money and politics collide , a significant risk of corrupt influence arises . This has been acknowledged by the Constitutional Court in its My Vote Counts 2 decision , as well as by the enactment of the Political Party Funding Act , 2018 . <p> The antidote to such risks is not to preclude donations entirely , though some limits can apply . <p> Rather , transparency is the tool that can be used to make sure that , should holders of high office be swayed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ benefactors than the interests of the public in their decisions , they can be checked and held accountable . <p> To amaBhungane , this principle holds , whether it relates to a political party 's election campaign or an individual 's bid to rise in the ranks of a political party . The salient issue is the potential for a conflict of interest to arise . <p> The principle underlying our argument is perhaps best illustrated by the example our counsel put to the court : a member of the executive would be obliged to disclose gifts such as two bottles of wine worth R500 , the provision of rent-free accommodation for a month worth R5,000 , and the payment of his or her university fees of R50,000 by a benefactor to enable the member of the executive to complete a part-time degree . <p> But if the company provides a R5-million donation to a campaign to elect that member of the executive to a senior position within the ANC , DA , or any other political party , nobody ever needs to be told , provided , according to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to that politician or is not spent at his direction . <p> This was the argument made by the president 's lawyers -- that the steps Ramaphosa 's campaign took to distance him from direct benefit and control of campaign funds rendered them immune to disclosure in a way that was still constitutionally compliant with the code . <p> We disagree . <p> We regard this distinction as superficial . It seems to suggest that a donation to a campaign for office within a party is entirely different to a donation or gift to a person forming the subject of such a campaign . This ignores that the fortunes of the campaign and the candidate are inextricably intertwined . <p> It fails to acknowledge that , win or lose , the candidate may feel beholden to the benefactor of his or her campaign . <p> The Constitutional Court 's landmark 2011 judgment in Glenister v President of the Republic of South Africa and Others held that Section 7(2) imposes a positive obligation on the state to take reasonable measures to combat corruption . <p> Surely , transparency in respect of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vast ( as the CR17 campaign demonstrated ) and which are not caught by the Political Party Funding Act , is one such reasonable measure ? <p> The stakes are high <p> The Constitutional Court issued a stark warning in 2011 : <p> " There can be no gainsaying that corruption threatens to fell at the knees virtually everything we hold dear and precious in our hard-won constitutional order . It blatantly undermines the democratic ethos , the institutions of democracy , the rule of law and the foundational values of our nascent constitutional project . It fuels maladministration and public fraudulence and imperils the capacity of the state to fulfil its obligations to respect , protect , promote and fulfil all the rights enshrined in the Bill of Rights . When corruption and organised crime flourish , sustainable development and economic growth are stunted . And in turn , the stability and security of society is put at risk . " <p> In the ensuing years , there has been no respite from the deluge of news reports concerning allegations of corruption at every level of government . These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ministers ( think Digital Vibes ) and even the former president . <p> Disclosure of donations does no harm to those who contest elections for office within political parties . It can only be of detriment to them if they stray from serving the public interest to privilege the interests of their donors -- as well it should . <p> This , in our view , is the accountability called for in the Constitution : no more , no less . We 've walked a long road in pursuit of this principle . <p> A finding of invalidity together with a suspension that allows the president time to amend the code to meet the constitutional standard would , in our view , serve the public interest by striking a much-needed blow against corruption . <h> Comments - share your knowledge and experience <p> Everybody has an opinion but not everyone has the knowledge and the experience to contribute meaningfully to a discussion .

@@63334239 <h> OPINION <h> An old man escapes ANC justice <p> Jeremy Gordin <p> 09 September 2021 <p> Jeremy Gordin writes on the death of Timol-accused Jan Rodrigues <p> Jo ? o ( Jan ) Rodrigues , formerly a clerk in the security police who was charged with the 1971 murder of Ahmed Timol in July 2018 ( 47 years later ) , died on Monday evening , 6th September , at his Wonderboom South home in Pretoria . <p> According to his attorney , Ben Minnaar , 82-year-old Rodrigues " had spent a couple of weeks in hospital . After the lobe of his one lung was removed , he had difficulty breathing and spent some time in the intensive care unit . He went home and was home for a week or two . He was recuperating and feeling stronger , but had a setback and passed away " . <p> Following the October 2017 verdict of the re-opened inquest into the death of Timol , who perished on 27 October 1971 at John Vorster Square Police Station , Rodrigues was charged in July 2018 with murder and defeating and/or obstructing the administration of justice . Rodrigues applied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> His application was refused by a full bench of the Gauteng High Court . Rodrigues then applied to the Supreme Court of Appeal to set aside the High Court decision . This was refused on June 21 , 2021 , and Rodrigues then applied to the Constitutional Court to set aside the SCA 's judgment and to get a stay of prosecution ( have the case dropped ) . During this time , the criminal trial of Rodrigues was , for obvious reasons , repeatedly postponed . <p> Minnaar has said that , although the criminal trial obviously wo n't continue now , he hopes the application to the Concourt will still be heard . It 's puzzling to understand how this will happen , especially as Rodrigues ' legal costs were being funded by SAPS i , of which he was a member when he allegedly murdered Timol , and SAPS would presumably not want to continue paying . But why Minnaar hopes the Concourt matter will still be heard is a significant issue , to which I 'll return . <p> It also needs to be noted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the reopened inquest ii , his daughter Tilana Stander spoke out about the verbal , physical and sexual abuse she suffered during her childhood at the hands of her father and then instituted criminal charges against him . <p> Rodrigues admitted in a letter to court that he had sexually abused her , and , in terms of mediation procedures , his daughter agreed that charges be dropped against her father , given that he admitted what he had done . " He acknowledged everything that I put in my affidavit , and I am just glad that I could get this over and done with , " Stander has reportedly said . <p> The two points I want to make is that Rodrigues ' acknowledged behaviour vis- ? -vis his daughter had nothing to do with the death of Timol ; and , secondly , as best as is known , Rodrigues has not at any time changed the evidence he gave at the reopened inquest into Timol 's death ( or , in any substantial manner , at the original one of 1972 ) . In brief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of murder . <p> And yet the " narrative " continues . <p> " Rodrigues ' death before he could be tried was not unexpected because the tactic has always been to delay , and in essence he did get away with murder , " Imtiaz Cajee said on Tuesday . <p> Cajee has campaigned indefatigably since 1998 , if not before , to have the inquest into his uncle 's death reopened -- and , as I have written previously , Cajee should be saluted for this . As I also wrote , it is largely attributable to Cajee that the death of Timol has become " a sacred touchstone -- you impinge at your peril on the memory of Timol , on the narrative of what was done to him , as presented in the state 's case against Rodrigues " . <p> But the hard truth is that Rodrigues has not been found guilty of anything . Additionally , as has been argued by James Myburgh and me in at least six articles on Politicsweb iii , there remain deeply worrying aspects about the evidence led and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inquest . <p> Having studied the " Timol case " as hard as we could , we could not conclude , as the NPA alleged , that Rodrigues threw Timol through the window of room 1026 , on the tenth floor of John Vorster Square Police Station . The worst , in our view , that could come out of a trial ( for Rodrigues ) was that he was party to a cover-up -- that he was told by the superior officers either to hold back or lie about certain of the events leading to Timol 's death . This would make him guilty of obstructing justice . But perjury is not murder . <p> But there is a reason why Minnaar , on the one hand , and Cajee , on the other , are keen on Rodrigues ' matter going ahead at the Concourt . <p> Both " parties " are keen on the court setting a precedent that would -- from Cajee 's point-of-view -- stop other implicated apartheid-era policemen from " using endless legal ploys to stall justice " ; and that will , from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approach in the Rodrigues matter , which was that Rodrigues had obviously benefitted from an " amnesty " which had been arranged by the then ANC government , in terms of which pre-1994 " perpetrators " would be left alone iv . <p> What is at play here is that there could soon well be a number of further prosecutions of similar cases involving alleged offences perpetrated during the apartheidera by police officers , who did not seek amnesty for the offences from the TRC . <p> As Cajee has said recently , a Concourt ruling on Rodrigues would be " very significant " in the reopened inquests of other anti-apartheid activists , including for example Neil Aggett , Ernest Dipale , and Hoosen Haffejee , currently being heard in the lower courts . There are also about another 300 similar cases that were referred to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission back in 2003 , but of which only a handful has come before the courts v. <p> From the point-of-view of Minnaar and Rodrigues ' counsel , JG " Jaap " Cilliers SC , they are hoping to head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying to " legalise " the secret amnesty deal or , at worst , buy a few more years for it . <p> Cajee has recently said that " It is time that the National Prosecuting Authority ( NPA ) be confronted directly on the conduct and behaviour of their members sitting in the priority crimes unit , specifically advocates Chris Macadam and JP ( Torie ) Pretorius . In 2019 the full bench of the South Gauteng High court was very clear that these two advocates should be investigated by the National Director of Public Prosecutions . But today they remain in those offices -- positions they 've held since 2003 " . <p> For what has emerged from the various Rodrigues court actions is that there was indeed " a deal " done -- NPA prosecutors were " informally " instructed , in about 2003 , to abide by an agreement obviously cobbled together by the ANC leadership and the security force generals and commanders of the previous government ( or their proxies ) . This " agreement " was that once the TRC was over , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The reason for this agreement was neither a humanitarian one nor a desire to let bygones be bygones but stemmed from the old regime 's security personnel knowing a great many of the " secrets " of those in government , including possibly that there were those in the new seats of power who had one " collaborated " with , or even spied for , the old regime . Above all , it is common cause that among the cases never acted on by the TRC or anyone else were those " human rights abuses " carried out by ANC members , some of whom are still alive . <p> The decision not to go after certain people is called realpolitik and clearly there were those in the ANC who decided it was the lesser of two evils . Doubtless it was -- and is -- also a tragedy for a number of families . <p> But to traduce the name of an old man , who was apparently not guilty of anything but being in the wrong place at the wrong time and of being a white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and albeit in the pursuit of " justice " -- does not smell at all good to me . <p> Endnotes <p> i According to Ufrieda Ho in Daily Maverick , it was only after a Promotion of Access to Information Act application made in May 2019 by Imtiaz Cajee that the Department of Justice revealed that the legal costs in Rodrigues ' case at that point stood at more than R3,5-million . <p> ii It 's understood that one of the reasons " making it possible " for Rodrigues to appear at the reopened inquest was that his daughter had told Imtiaz Cajee of Rodrigues ' whereabouts -- of which the " state " was apparently unaware . Why this was so is unclear ; Rodrigues had been living at the same address for decades . <p> iv It is beside the point now , and not germane to this article , but in my view Rodrigues ' role was probably adjudged to be so minor , or the Timol case was adjudged to be as per the verdict of the original inquest ( Timol committed suicide ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " list or during discussions about it . It seems unlikely that the Mbeki presidency would have obstructed an investigation in this particular case , given that Essop and Aziz Pahad were close family friends of the Timols . <p> vThe families of the Cradock Four , Nokuthula Simelane , Imam Haron , Matthew Mabelane , and Caiphus Nyoka , are among those who are also campaigning " for justice " and " closure " .

Might the attendant look the other way , compromising safety for compensation . <p> Travel + Leisure reports that American carriers like Southwest Airlines and American Airlines offer a clever approach to tipping as they have rewards programs where passengers can recognise cabin crew .

@@63350238 <h> Work-Life Balance Or Screen-Life Balance ? <p> Restricted physical movement and social contact have increased the reliance on technology but what are the long-term side effects ? We unpack the science behind screen time . <p> By Tiana Cline <p> As Early As 1955 , people started panicking about the idea of too much screen time . The saying ' square eyes ' came along with the invention of television yet today , we 're looking at screens more than ever before . The old adage of a work-life balance has shifted to achieving the perfect screen-life balance which is said to be better for sleep , brain development , mental health and everything in between . <p> " The problem with screens is not the screens themselves but rather the distance , " explains Dr Johann Lamprecht , a specialist ophthalmic eye surgeon based in Johannesburg . " If we look at the long- term effect of too much screen time , the most likely problem is the development of myopia , or nearsightedness . " <p> Lamprecht explains that the eye grows before the age of seven and again during the teenage years . The longer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " If you spend all day , every day , on a screen -- especially during your early developmental years -- and you 're focusing up close the whole time , you 're sending your brain signals that your eyes need to grow . It 's long-term , you can not reverse that growth or make your eyes shorter again . " <p> Increased screen time is n't the only link to myopia -- reading can also cause nearsightedness . In East Asian countries , for example , there is a myopia epidemic which began in the 1980s . According to a Lancet journal , nearly 90% of adults in thisregion are nearsighted and this is due to lack of exposure to natural sunlight . Being hunched over a book indoors is just as problematic as too much time spent on a tablet , phone or e-reader -- our eyes need bright , ambient light for optimal eye growth . <p> " In terms of near work , the recommendation is a 20-20-20 rule . For every 20 minutes , for 20 seconds , look at something more than 20 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something is six meters or more away from you , the light rays from that object are essentially parallel . For your brain and your eyes , that is distance vision , " says Lamprecht . " When you 're in constant focus , your eyes have to work constantly . That is the trigger for axial length growth -- the front to back size of your eye which is then stimulated and eventually becomes a form of shortsightedness . " <p> Another screen time side effect is digital eye strain , also known as computer vision syndrome ( CVS ) . While digital eye strain is temporary and has n't been linked to any long-term health issues , it can affect both adults and children . <p> " The type of content you look at plays a big role . If you 're concentrating on an Excel spreadsheet the whole day , it is very different to watching a movie . Staggered images and interactive images differ , " adds Vincent Mahlangu , Acer 's product manager for commercial displays and gadgets . <p> " Newer screens are built @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Today 's technology manages the light at the source to ensure compliance with the two standards for color balance and blue light reduction . " <p> While older monitors that flickered saw people picking up additional accessories like screen protectors or computer glasses to protect their eyes from CVS , today 's devices have this technology built in . What 's more is that there is a big difference between looking at a LED or LCD screen : " LED or OLED displays are organic . It 's been proven that LED displays -- light emitting diode technology -- release less than 50% of blue light compared to normal screens . It is inevitable that you 'll find flickering with LCD displays due to backlight scanning and local dimming , " says Mahlangu . <p> Mahlangu adds that brightness and color accuracy go hand-in- hand with eye health . Reducing the light of your screen may lead to eye strain so choosing a display that offers 100% color accuracy ( which is as close as possible to what the human eye sees ) is a good , long-term investment for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Blue light , on the other hand , is naturally occurring -- it 's one the several colors in the visible light spectrum and our exposure to it mainly comes from sunlight . Natural blue light exposure compared to what is emitted by an artificial , electronic source is surprisingly minimal and can not cause retinal damage . <p> It may , however , interfere with sleep and in the long run , this plays a role in both brain development and mental health . One 2020 Harvard University study reported that different colors of light have different effects on the human body and being exposed to blue wavelengths at night supresses the secretion of melatonin , the ' sleep hormone ' . <p> According to Dr Michael Rich , director of the Digital Wellness Lab in Boston , healthcare organizations are considering technology addiction a pathology , similar to substance abuse , yet the use of screens has only accelerated with Covid-19 which means we need to start looking at the science behind screens before declaring what is good , bad or mentally problematic : <p> " It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changes when withdrawing from a substance . The word addiction is so stigmatizing ... the overuse of screen time is n't a standalone diagnosis but rather a syndrome driven by underlying psychological issues that were subclinical outside of the interactive media space or undertreated . " <p> " Screen time has been on the increase for the last 50 years and it 's not going to get any less , " says Lamprecht . " If you stare at a blue light filtered screen with the perfect prescription , glare-protected glasses for 10 hours , you 're still going to get digital eye strain , tension headaches and neck pain . It has got to do with the amount of time that we are exposed to screens , more than the screen itself . Positive screen time is about self-regulation , building good habits and going outside .

Just this last year they removed 434 kg of waste from Cape Town 's coastline and waterways , which included some 9,127 cooldrink lids , 7,447 lollipop sticks , and 5,422 individual sweet wrappers . <p> It 's a depressing sight that mirrors a global issue where beaches all over the world are filling up with waste . If not addressed urgently it could become so costly to manage you would need entire countries ' wealth to mitigate . <p> This is according to a new report by global consulting firm Dalberg , and commissioned by the World Wide Fund for Nature ( WWF ) , that in September released its Plastics : The cost to society , environment and the economy report @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made in just 2019 , from production to degradation , to be $3.7 trillion ( R52 trillion ) - more than the GDP of India . <p> From food packaging to buckets and disposable bottles , plastic is used widely because it 's versatile , cheap , and convenient .

The number is so large that for every person 41kg of plastic waste is generated a year , above the global average of 29kg . <p> " But these estimated stats from the global model study ( Jambeck et . al , 2015 ) have been updated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still one of the top polluters in Africa because of our extremely high consumption and lacking waste management , " says Lorren de Kock , WWF South Africa 's Project Manager : Circular Plastics Economy . <p> " The most shocking for me is our very high consumption -- there is just too much plastic and so much of it either goes to landfill , open dumps , or leaks into nature .

Instead , the WWF wants policy makers to shift from linear models of waste management to circular models driven by recycling . <p> Government has also come to the party in some ways . The battle against plastic waste has been raging in South Africa since 2003 , when it first implemented plastic bag levies . <p> " This extends the responsibility of companies who place packaging on the market to the end-of-life stage of that product .

It 's a retro throwback to the Final Fantasy 1 or Dragon Quest era of 2D RPGs with a randomized roguelike twist , and it succeeds in invoking that era while still being a modern game . Earth Born consoles pop up in most of the major settlements alongside token-operated dispensers that spit out Pixballs -- toys-to-life doodads that give you reusable boosts while playing -- which you use to get further and unlock new party members inside Earth Born . It 's the icing on top of Eastward 's cake , even though it 's entirely optional . So I guess it 's more like the chocolate sauce on Eastward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go by , characters accrue action points that they can use to fuel their most powerful skills . Knowing when , and against what enemies , to use your skills is the key to progressing . As you explore Earth Born 's little branching world you pick up new party members , and a larger party lets you swap through more characters during each combat and start with more characters each run . They 've all got something unique going on : there 's the Monkey , who helps even when not on the front row during fights , or the Merchant , who does n't use the action-point system but instead uses accrued gold to do battle . <p> I quite liked the tactics available in the turn-based combat , though if it were a real-world game it 'd quite honestly be a " pay-to-win " experience because getting more Pixballs makes it easier and easier each time you start a new run at it . It 's hard to be upset when the bonuses are something you earn in the course of finding secrets in the main game @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pace from Eastward 's more sedate stories or fast-paced combat . For some , I expect it might even be the highlight of Eastward . <p> It 's a relief that the world is so attractive and the characters are so appealing , because Eastward 's greatest weakness is its writing . Character dialogue is hit or miss , with more than a few cliche lines and real stinkers . I 'm talking about unironic use of lines like " I 've been running my whole life . " Frankly , it 's because the writing does n't know when to step back and let action or movement convey words . It uses two sentences when one would do -- or , more often , one sentence when none would do . Dialogue that should pop up in the background -- laughter , exclamations -- is more often than not in a bubble that requires a button to progress . The only time I felt impatient or bored with Eastward was during the drawn-out dialogues . <h> Fights are simple , and most enemies can be easily defeated with judicious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ combat are a welcome break from all that staring and reading . Fights are simple , and most enemies can be easily defeated with judicious application of John 's frying pan . Everything else is susceptible to the neon-colored shotgun or flamethrower . There are lots of weird enemies though , like a giant frog person , tentacle plants , or ultra-tough zombies , and they 've all got their own attack pattern -- but I usually took them down the same way , no matter what they were . But let me be clear : Simple is n't always bad . It was fun to weave around attacks , smack mutants with a pan , and blow them away with the shotgun . <p> It 's weird that while you swap to Sam pretty often to do puzzles , I rarely felt the need to use her in combat ; her ability to put monsters in frozen bubbles comes in handy for a few things , but you do n't absolutely need it to win . If you had a psychic sidekick , would n't you want her to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bit of a downer that the puzzles Sam 's instrumental in solving are never too complex , only ever getting difficult when it 's a challenge of timing or skill -- or to get at a few tricky hidden chests . Most often , you 'll have to notice something like a wall to blow down with a bomb , a puzzle of which cables to connect , or which obstacles to remove so a raft floats where you want it to . The harder puzzles will have a timing element -- moving quickly after triggering a switch , or golf-swinging a bomb into a narrow opening from a moving platform . It 's not complex stuff . <p> The simplicity did bug me sometimes . While parts of the fighting are good in their straightforwardness , others are just basic . Partially it 's because the single-stick controls feel inadequate for aiming weapons . It 's fun to bash with a frying pan , not so fun to make sure the characters are both dodging incoming projectiles . <p> The relatively infrequent boss and miniboss fights are an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between both John 's weapons and Sam 's powers . I liked them a lot more than the platforming and puzzle bits , and a lot of them really tested my ability to use every tool in my arsenal for a clean victory . One in particular stands out , an enemy knocks away bombs that you try to place at a vulnerable point . To win , I needed a deft hand at dropping bombs as John , then to switch to Sam to use her powers to distract the enemy , then back to John to dish out damage after the bomb went off . That 's the kind of synergy Eastward 's combat needs more of . <h> The Verdict <p> A delightful journey from beginning to end , Eastward has charming characters and beautifully animated vistas to explore . The story is nicely plotted and the chapters tell self-contained stories that are darkly amusing , if a bit overwritten . The simple combat , relaxed puzzles , and cute minigames keep gameplay variety high and the pace upbeat enough to carry you through to the end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @

Now , we are entering the age of Earned Wage Access(EWA) that promises to break debt cycles for millions of employees around the world . <p> To focus on advancements in banking technology , the evolution of digital payments not only eliminated the need to carry , protect and store physical cash , but allowed for people to safely , securely and instantly pay or transact with anyone , anywhere through platforms such as PayPal . <p> Digital payments technology has become so ingrained in the fabric of our modern economies that , even in developing countries with little to no physical presence of financial institutions , individuals can transact with each other using nothing more than mobile phone numbers . Global acceptance and comfort related to digital transactions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Covid-19 lockdown restrictions forced people to stay in their homes . There is now literally no question about the digital future and the shape of the financial services industry to come . <p> At the same time , one of the world 's longest-standing banking norms is being revolutionised by the adaptation of technology to meet social needs . As much as transactions have been made seamless and instantaneous by technology , monthly payment cycles have entrenched destructive debt cycles that force employees to pay back high-interest loans when they are caught short of cash before month-end . <p> " In a country like South Africa , without a significant savings culture and where the majority of those employed in the formal economy are under persistent financial pressure , the unsecured lending industry has flourished on the back of unsecured loans that are typically taken out to cover living expenses .

Rather than borrowing from the employer , it means a flexible payment schedule that allows employees to cover financial emergencies or shortfalls and retain financial control while avoiding exorbitant fees . <p> Not only do employees benefit from the arrangement .

@@63360233 <h> 10 Actors Who Took Their Roles Too Far <p> Preparing for a role is one of the most important moments in the life of any performer . Proper research of a character and getting into the right mindset could mean the difference between getting the role or getting the boot , but some actors just take things too far . <p> From method actors to insufferable perfectionists , the history of cinema is filled with performers that decided to take things to the next level in preparation for the roles of their lifetimes . <h> On this list , we 'll take a look at 10 actors who took their roles just a bit too seriously . <h> 10 . Viggo Mortensen <p> Better known for his role as Aragorn in the Lord of the Rings trilogy , Viggo Mortensen has a history of taking his roles a bit more seriously than other actors . For instance , he shattered his toe kicking a helmet during a scene in The Lord of the Rings : The Return of the King . <p> Perhaps the worst example of Mortensen taking things too far happened when he was preparing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learning all he could about the lives of the Vietnam War soldiers , only to lose the part to Willem Dafoe. <h> 9 .

That 's precisely what Anne Hathaway achieved in 2012 thanks to her role in Les Mis ? rables -- and she had to go through hell to prepare for her character in this film . <p> To prepare for portraying the tormented Fantine , Hathaway spent months eating as little food as she could and going through prolonged bouts of isolation . In the end , the actress ' life was just as miserable as her character 's : just what she needed to get into the proper mindset for her role . <h> 8 .

Natalie Portman <p> Ballet might sound like a lovely and delicate pastime , but if you ask any professional ballerina about their training regime , you 'd know that it 's one of the most physically demanding forms of entertainment that exist . For his role in Black Swan , Natalie Portman took things dangerously close to a breaking point . <p> The actress began a rigorous diet that included eating only carrots and almonds . Additionally , she began practising ballet for eight hours every day . <h> 6 . Jared Leto <p> Impressive body transformations are something we 're used to seeing in Hollywood all the time .

Jamie Foxx <p> Jamie Foxx did a phenomenal job playing the blind musician Ray Charles in his 2004 biopic , and this was partly achieved by the actor 's dedication to his role . It takes a considerable amount of skill to play a blind character believably , and Foxx absolutely nails the role seemingly with ease . <p> To make his blindness look genuine , Foxx used prosthetic eyelids that effectively left him blind .

Needless to say , she absolutely nailed the role . <h> 3 . Leonardo DiCaprio <p> The role that finally gave Leo his Oscar was one that almost cost him his life . The Revenant follows the harrowing tale of survival of frontiersman Hugh Glass , and Leonardo DiCaprio wanted nothing more than authenticity for his portrayal of the mountain man . <p> From stepping into ice-cold rivers to sleeping in real animal carcasses , DiCaprio went through hell to deliver a performance that is as close to the real deal as it gets .

Then , there 's his surprising transformation for The Machinist -- a movie that follows a disturbed industrial worker who has n't slept in a year . Bale lost close to 63 pounds for this role , leaving him in a debilitated state that almost killed him . <h> 1 .

All of today 's high-growth economies emphasise specialisation and competitiveness to spur value-added exporting . <p> Central banks , regulators and software developers see value in using blockchain technologies and crypto currencies for payments . Yet the ' mining ' of bitcoins is very costly environmentally . <p> Masondo should ask himself how gold 's role might soon be reconsidered given the environmental costs of mining it ? Much coal is mined and burned to extract tons of earth from kilometres below the surface to extract sprinklings of gold dust . This carries on until gold bricks can be formed which are then buried metres below the surface in central bank vaults . <p> There is much scope for South Africa to propose an arrangement which is green , global and future-focused . It is n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off . <h> Ideologically obsessed <p> What is difficult to imagine is such a proposal coming from the ANC . They are just too ideologically obsessed with trying to justify redistribution . More disturbing still , they seem to have bequeathed this mindset to their organisation 's next wave of leaders . <p> Pledges to achieve a net-zero emissions global economy are incompatible with supporting bitcoin mining . They are no less inconsistent with mining coal to mine gold in South Africa . <p> In just the last two years or so , there has been an abrupt decline in the willingness of leading global investors to fund environmentally harsh extraction projects . Would someone like Masondo in a senior position at such an organisation be better positioned to drive a deal with wealthy nations to close mines as part of a massive debt restructuring project and with concessionary funding to compensate negatively affected stakeholders ? <p> For many reasons , the answer is no .

@@63407234 <h> Tech can rewrite Africa 's story <h> Share <p> After a decade of unprecedented growth and promise during the 2010s , African economies took a battering in 2020 as a result of Covid-19 . While the continent was not alone in this -- the UN found that the pandemic is reversing decades of progress on poverty , healthcare and education around the globe -- the disease 's current resurgence means that it will have to work even harder to regain the ground lost over the past 18 or so months . <p> Technology will be key to its ability to do so . Utilised correctly , it can help foster a new narrative for Africa . Beyond the dated images of people languishing in poverty , and even of a continent that is " rising " but never quite meeting its potential , technology wo n't just help Africa achieve economic growth and prosperity . It also has the potential to position the continent as a global centre of innovation and invention and as an emergent leader in new ways of thinking about energy , healthcare , education , and many other fields . <p> Overcoming challenges <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if Africa is to reach this point . Connectivity is a major one . <p> In Sub-Saharan Africa , for example , approximately 800-million people are not connected to the mobile internet . Of those , some 520-million can access the mobile internet but do n't , because of factors such as smartphone penetration and lack of skills while 270-million can not access the mobile internet because they do n't have the requisite coverage . Across the region , 4G broadband coverage is at just 20.5% . <p> The figures are even starker when it comes to fixed-line internet connectivity . According to figures from research firm Ovum , there are just 6.6-million fixed-line internet subscriptions in Sub-Saharan Africa . While numbers are projected to grow three-fold by 2023 , that still represents a small fraction of the region 's population . Those figures make it clear that the region needs to address a major internet infrastructure shortfall . <p> Fortunately , new enablers of connectivity are entering the market all the time , driving the cost of internet access down . <p> But connectivity on its own wo n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continent , people will need the right skills to make the most of that connectivity .

South African president Cyril Ramaphosa , for example , recently announced that South Africa would play host to a vaccine technology transfer hub run by a consortium comprising Biovac , Afrigen Biologics and Vaccines , a network of universities , and the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) . <p> " Through this initiative and others , we will change the narrative of an Africa that is the centre of disease and poor development , " he said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in reducing the burden of disease , advancing self-reliance as well as advancing sustainable development .

It also contributed more than US$17-billion to public funding through the course of the year . The International Telecommunication Union ( ITU ) has also established that a 10% increase in mobile broadband penetration in Africa would generate an increase of 2.5% in GDP per capita . <p> Innovation on Africa 's terms <p> None of this potential will be reached , however , if Africans simply copy models for innovation and digital transformation that have worked elsewhere . <p> While the ingredients for success are there -- the population of the continent has already surpassed China and the vast majority of people are young -- it 's critical that any digital transformation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mobile-first approach that caters to different connectivity levels and speeds . It also means even acting as an enabler of certain basic services in some locations . <p> To some , those might seem like obstacles , but they 're really opportunities . If organisations support skills development not only of their own employees but also of young people who might work for them one day , they will positively impact their own bottom lines and the wellbeing of the communities they operate in . <p> This is n't pie-in-the-sky thinking either . People across the continent are already taking steps in the right direction . As critical mass builds , Africa will be well-placed to own and rewrite its narrative and take its place among the world 's technological and innovation leaders .

Without fail , residents of the town express disgust at the ANC . " Why do they have to steal everything ? Why not just take a small amount for themselves and use the rest for the community ? " is the most common refrain . <p> One night , ward 10 councillor candidate Mxolisi Ntshiba and Kota drove around Tyantyi township with a loudhailer , inviting residents to a meeting . A group of angry residents approached the car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You are so cruel ! We do n't want you here .

" <p> There are no ANC posters in the town and very few public meetings , which annoys residents . " You see how the ANC takes us for granted ? They think they do n't even need to campaign , " said residents in Vukani at one of the public meetings . <p> On voter registration weekend , an MCF party agent who asked not to be named was assaulted by two ANC party agents in full regalia at a registration table . A video of the assault circulated widely , prompting an apology by the ANC and a comment by the sole EFF councillor , Siyamthanda Dyantyie , that the assault was " service delivery at its best .

MCF councillor candidates spent three hours on 28 September trying to dig channels to release some of the water . <p> Makana Citizen Front councillor candidates and supporters dig channels on Tuesday 28 September to drain water from the trench that claimed the life of Asanele Qomfo , 13 . They were able to drain about one metre of water from the trench dug by a service provider as part of the Makana Bulk Sewer Phase 1 project . Photo : Loyiso Dyongman <p> Municipal spokesperson Anele Mjekula would not give a direct answer when asked why the municipality had not drained the trench , saying , " The trench is now the site of the scene where an unfortunate incident @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that specific area until Department of Labour has concluded the investigation " . <p> Mjekula added that the municipality believed the thin net around the trench qualified as a " barricade " and that hiring security guards at the trench would be " an unprecedented requirement " . <p> The 2019/20 Auditor-General 's report into Makana municipality found that the municipality did not account for all property , equipment and land , wasted over R900 million on irregular and unauthorised expenditure , and was being investigated by the police for financial misconduct . Tenders were awarded , but there were " under achievements " on the projects . This is a town that does not have a single playground in any area . <p> This is life in a " captured municipality , " says Jonathan Walton , fieldworker at the Black Sash 's Makhanda office and a supporter of the MCF . " The evidence of the dysfunctionality is in the different reports ... there is weak management in place or incompetent or unqualified managers or staff or councillors who were elected from the ruling party or the opposition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decisions the council took are consistent with the constitution and the rule of law , " says Walton . <p> " Unfortunately , the media did not pay too much attention to municipal capture as the focus was more at a national level , yet there is a lot of corruption and fraud in municipalities , especially around procurement and awarding of tenders . <p> " Makana Municipality has conducted itself outside the law . There is no transparency , there is non-compliance with the law , and you can call it delinquent or a habitual lawbreaker . This municipality self-inflicts problems . If the municipality ca n't run waste management properly or fix potholes , street lights or provide water , it is inviting future problems , " he says . <p> The ANC seems to have little regard for the people of the municipality . The high court ordered the municipality to dissolve itself in January 2020 for failing in its constitutional obligations to provide services -- the first municipality ever ordered to do so . But this has been delayed for the past 20 months after the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ramaphosa supporter -- appealed the judgment twice , using public funds . <p> Kota frequently speaks of the " rot " in the ANC , which has led to the municipality failing to maintain basic infrastructure , much of which has now collapsed . Makana municipality includes the small rural towns Alicedale and Riebeek East plus a few former commercial farms about 25km away . <p> Power of the people Dozens of MCF party agents piled into borrowed bakkies on Heritage Day to go with ward 13 councillor candidate Reverend Milo Geelbooi to Manley Flats . In several public meetings , Geelbooi has promised to donate half his first month 's salary to buy food parcels for needy residents . He attracts dozens of residents to his campaign meetings in a corrugated iron room that serves as his church . Former farm dwellers at Manley Flats speak of how the government bought them two farms and gave them 10 shipping containers to live in but did not provide toilets , electricity , or any other amenities apart from a minimal supply of drinking water . <p> They have lost hope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " The MCF is not a political party .

" <p> Mluleki Mtjizana of the Yendela Community Property Association -- a farm bought by the government for farm dwellers -- describes life in this area as " terrible , really " . <p> " We were born in these mud houses , and we live here still .

@@63415232 <h> If you could only keep one loyalty programme , which one would it be ? <p> PRESS OFFICE Pulling out a loyalty card at checkout has become a way of life for South African shoppers , but thanks to lockdown and a complete shift in our shopping habits , the average middle-class adult is now a member of almost nine different programmes . For the past 6 years , BrandMapp , together with loyalty specialists Truth have published a whitepaper that tracks and measures the impact of these programmes on our everyday consumer lives . <p> Released in mid-2021 , BrandMapp 's consumer insights research uniquely captures the opinions of more than 33 000 South Africans living in households with a R10 000+ monthly income . While that may be a 30% segment of the population , it 's a group that controls 80% of all consumer spend and by definition , is the group who are fortunate enough to benefit the most from Loyalty programmes that typically operate on the principle of ' the more you play , the more you earn ' . <p> And while it 's no surprise that the massive retailer programmes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ win the ' most used ' awards , with 80% of all shoppers using these mega-programmes , the 2021 results show a very different picture when consumers were asked a simple question : if you could only keep one loyalty programme , which one would it be ? <p> Financial programmes rule the roost <p> Amanda Cromhout , founder of Truth Loyalty , says , " We know that ' cashback ' is the single biggest driver of loyalty for consumers , and what 's fascinating about this ' most valuable ' filter is that all the banking and financial loyalty programmes come immediately to the fore as the ones their members just ca n't live without . You can only pick a programme if you belong to it , so it 's a brilliant way of discovering a ' hidden secret ' . If you consider a fairly elite consumer programme like Investec Rewards , which has a tiny 3% footprint in the market , there just are n't enough members for it to ever show up on the ' most used ' radar . But when you ask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ third of them tick the box , making it the fourth most valued programme of all . " <p> Brandon de Kock , director of storytelling for BrandMapp goes on to describe why it 's a vital measure in the annual survey . " There 's such a high usage of loyalty programmes in South Africa , that if you look at , say , the Pick n Pay Smart Shopper and the Checkers Xtra Savings user , there 's almost a 70% crossover there , so if you try and compare the two groups , it 's the same people ! Being able to identify the real fans means we can really start understanding the differences between these loyalty programmes , and why they are so important . " <p> The top three programmes in order are FNB eBucks , closely followed by Discovery Vitality and Standard Bank UCount , with FSP programmes making up five of the remaining spots in the Top 10 . " It 's just a theory , but I think it has to do with the fact that these consumers enjoy what I call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says de Kock . " In other words , you do n't have to claim anything , do anything different , or actually do anything . There 's no second movement required . You just swipe your credit card , go about your business and when you log into your rewards account , there 's a pot of usable ' cash ' . Happy eBucks day ! FNB arguably set the bar and they 've been at the top of the podium ever since . " <p> The relative outlier is Discovery Vitality , but as de Kock explains , there are logical reasons for it ranking so high in its members ' lives . " The Vitality members who seem to squeeze maximum value are the ones who stay fit , go for regular checkups and generally play by a set of rules that 's been medically approved . So Vitality is fascinating because it 's basically rewarding people for doing what they should do !

@@63415233 <h> Succession planning in South Africa : an opportunity , not a box-ticking exercise <p> As leaders , one of our biggest fears is no longer having a meaningful role to play in our organisations . For many business leaders , the fear of being obsolete can be crippling , especially when it comes to the vital process of succession planning . However , if done correctly , succession planning can afford South African organisations an opportunity to tap into diversity , build resilience , and architect a sustainable future . <p> We see fear of giving up power as the biggest inhibitor of good succession planning . Leaders see succession planning as losing control of the business , or sending a message that they are no longer useful or even relevant , rather than focussing on the opportunity of the process -- which is creating a lasting legacy . Most of the action businesses have taken have been , at best , to designate succession planning as an HR initiative , and at worst , to succumb to virtue signalling in an effort to appear to care . Very few are talking about a systemic overhaul of how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ codified <p> Exploring succession planning challenges a little further , Hawke says another common mistake she sees is that , in many businesses , culture is not codified . She says leaders ca n't create a succession plan if they are not inspired and aligned on what great leadership looks like , adding that companies must have a common understanding of what leadership for growth looks like . <p> Everyone wants their life to mean something , and when you ask leaders to reflect on what they would be most proud of , growing people will always be part of that . Work we did with the successful payments and software platform , Yoco , saw this process in action . The leadership team needed to reset their role in the company . As much as they wanted to build a sustainable business with succession planning , the DNA of the business sat with the four founders and so until that was codified and made explicit and replicable , there was no way they could pass it on and scale the business . <p> Katlego Maphai , Yoco 's CEO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scales , it 's essential to codify how you thrive -- finding the unique behaviours that link to unique outcomes and that are difficult to replicate . Our values are n't aspirational , and they are n't borrowed from other great companies . They are a reflection of how we 've done things when we were at our best . " <h> Moving away from traditional frameworks <p> In another growth business we 've worked with , the overriding parent-child leadership style was impeding growth . <p> We worked with them to co-create their purpose and values -- the foundations of their culture . By building ownership and getting a team alignment of what a successful business looks like we could move them away from the traditional parent-child relationship affecting so many local companies . Once everyone is in an adult space of responsibility and accountability you have the ability to move forward with plans for growth and future leadership . <p> Ultimately a business builds its future sustainability when it is not reliant on individuals . However , each leader is motivated by different things . <p> Our experience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thrive , is that they are motivated by different things . Some are inspired by building pioneering businesses that pave the way for change , others might see empowered teams as the new source of growth in a business . What these leaders have in common is a sense that what has got us here , will not serve us in the future . For example , traditional hierarchies mean power and decision making is limited to a few people at the top . In a fast changing environment this can be very inefficient , not to mention extremely stressful as we have seen through the pandemic . <p> The pressure for leaders to have all the answers is prohibitive . Holding a mindset of curiosity , and really listening to people across the organisation not only grows leaders of the future , but engages the whole organisation in problem solving , enhancing everyone 's sense of contribution which really energises a system . These are the leaders that will build the companies of the future . <h> The opportunity of diversity <p> While so many South African organisations see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believes it is a real opportunity for local companies to architect a more diverse , equitable and inclusive organisation -- one which could be done meaningfully and organically , rather than the often mechanical and forced equity deals so often concluded . <p> We are at the infancy of understanding the real benefits of diversity , equity and inclusivity . Many see it as difficult to build an organisation when people come from very different backgrounds , but we should rather view it as a valuable opportunity . With some good leadership work and the right mindset , succession planning can be so much more than a compliance tick-boxing exercise . We could be laying the foundations of a strong , resilient organisation that is able to respond well to change -- and in today 's environment that means companies are gaining far more than a new leader to take over when the current one retires . <p> Kim Hawke , partner at global partnership of growth strategists , Within People , a global partnership of growth strategists who are helping people and companies find their purpose to drive growth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strategy , design thinking and leadership coaching to create a new blueprint for business .

The 50-year old is now the world 's richest person -- something he has n't let Amazon founder Jeff Bezos forget . Now worth U$222 million , his fortune has more than doubled on the past year , surpassing his Amazon counterpart 's still-impressive U$191 million .

Credited with changing the way consumers thought of electric cars , Musk introduced a range of stylish luxury cars that were innovative and desirable . Cars like the Model S took on stalwarts like the Mercedes-Benz S-Class and -- while it had teething problems -- was a credible alternative to the ubiquitous luxury car brands .

@@63445230 <h> Many challenges in expanding SA agricultural exports into Africa <p> SA 's agricultural sector is arguably one of the most vibrant on the continent . <p> This has largely been occasioned by technological adaptation , sound knowledge , regional and overseas market access , and logistical efficiency . <p> Hence , the importance of trade and logistics to SA 's agricultural sector can not be over-emphasised . <p> This is because our agricultural sector is highly export-orientated , with roughly half of the produce in value terms exported each year . <p> However , for the sector to remain vibrant it will have to urgently and continually expand and diversify its markets beyond the traditional ones such as the Southern African Development Community ( SADC ) , the European Union and several in Asia . <p> This urgent matter came up sharply in a range of engagements my colleagues and I had with agribusiness captains in the Western Cape last week . <p> I suspect that if one were to have similar talks here in the Eastern Cape , the feedback would broadly be the same , especially as the province is expanding its horticultural production and focusing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expand trade within the African continent beyond the SADC region , where nearly 89% of SA 's agricultural exports to the continent are concentrated . <p> The continent is also a special case as the African Continental Free Trade Area ( AfCFTA ) is set to provide further opportunities for the expansion of SA 's agricultural exports , while the rest of the other countries I mentioned still need further engagement to establish market access . <p> But the main question is whether the African continent can really be the saving grace for SA 's agricultural exports , as it is purported to be . <p> In an article for Econ3x3 , an independent forum for public policy debate , fellow agricultural economist Dr Tinashe Kapuya and I considered this question . <p> Our view is that the benefits of the AfCFTA are not as much as many have reported , due to structural limitations to expansion into untapped markets in the continent . <p> However , the product scope of exports into the SACU and SADC is quite diverse and includes maize , processed food products , apples and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bottled water , fruit juices and wine . <p> With 90 cents out of every rand in African agricultural exports earned within the SACU/SADC under an expanded diverse set of products , it is important to diversify export markets beyond the region . <p> But just how much more can SA export beyond the SACU/SADC , into the West , East and North Africa regions ? <p> The challenge is that Saharan Africa ( that is , Algeria , Libya , Mauritania , Morocco and Tunisia ) is much closer to Europe and thus its trade activity is more interlinked with the EU than Sub-Saharan Africa . <p> In addition , SA competes with this region for several products the exports of which the country intends to increase -- primarily the high-value horticultural products . <p> Penetrating and establishing a market presence in North Africa may prove challenging due to direct competition with well-established EU supply chains and competitive local produce . <p> SA 's realistic opportunity within the African continent is more in the East and West Africa regions . <p> But we are not sure whether the near-term @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to at least three reasons . <p> First , the East and West Africa regions have a range of Non-Tariff Barriers ( such as the ban of genetically modified products , which are grown in SA ) , which could remain a hindrance in boosting trade regardless of lower tariffs brought about by the AfCFTA . <p> Second , the high level of corruption in some of these targeted countries increases the costs of doing business , which has proven to be a major issue of consideration for South African businesses . <p> Last , the fragmented value chains due to poor connectivity and infrastructure are also major contributors to high transport and storage costs , which tend to increase significantly as goods are transported inland . <p> This narrow scope of expanding agricultural exports in the African continent is what typically leads to frustration among the agribusiness leaders , who continue to see improvement in production domestically but limited avenues for external sales . <p> The major economies in the east and west of the African continent , Nigeria and Kenya , remain very small markets for SA 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year . <p> The composition of food and agricultural imports into these two countries from the world over is mainly in staple grains and vegetable oils , which is also indicative that SA 's scope to export high-value horticulture , meat and wine products is limited . <p> Notably , Kenya 's horticultural production is steadily expanding . <p> In sum , my inference from the Western Cape roadshows is that agribusinesses are eager to work with the government in expanding export markets for SA 's agricultural products . <p> But due to the aforementioned hindrances , efforts will have to be channelled into the Asian and Middle Eastern markets , such as Japan , China , India , Bangladesh and Saudi Arabia , instead of the African continent , which presents limited opportunities . <p> Wandile Sihlobo , chief economist of the Agricultural Business Chamber of SA ( Agbiz ) and author of " Finding Common Ground : Land , Equity , and Agriculture " , is a research fellow in the Department of Agricultural Economics at Stellenbosch University .

@@63445240 <p> A shortage of semiconductor chips , as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic , has seen a surge in new and used car prices . Some manufacturers have had to stagger production or , in some cases , shut down factories completely . As a result , the motoring industry has taken a knock . BizNews spoke to two industry leaders -- Bidvest Automotive CEO Steve Keys and WeBuyCars co-founder , Dirk van der Walt -- to gain insight into this global phenomenon . -- Jarryd Neves <p> Absolutely . We are starting to see quite a push on new vehicle pricing as the quarter has just ended . We have received notification from various OEMs of price increases . I must stress , however , that these price increases are not only attributable to the semiconductor shortage . We 've seen a surge in international shipping costs . There have been shortages of other raw materials ; steel , plastic , electrical harnesses and the like . It 's not all attributable to semiconductors but the crisis has played a significant role . <p> Steve Keys on whether higher prices will remain once the crisis calms down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of pricing for some time . But as -- specifically logistics -- costs start normalising , I think there will be scope . There are very few instances where prices will drop but they will probably remain stable for a longer period . <p> Steve Keys on which countries and regions were worst affected by the semiconductor shortage : <p> I know China was fairly badly impacted . Most of the countries in the Far East -- where quite a lot of componentry is made -- were impacted because of Covid-19 and factories having to shut . Probably the most impacted country was India , where a lot of the cheaper cars emanate from . But pretty much , it 's a global situation . Everybody 's been impacted . There are a number of US-based motor manufacturers that have complained about the impact of the shortages . Some have had to close factories or work shorter times . <p> Steve Keys on whether the shortage has stirred a spike in used car sales : <p> When the need for transport is urgent , people will migrate from new to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the supply of used vehicles . When the pandemic hit last year , travel was really decimated as a consequence . Car rental companies -- which take up about 18% of new vehicle volumes on an annual basis in a normalised system -- were forced to rapidly de-fleet and bring the levels of their fleet down . Big companies basically halved the size of their fleets . For the last 18 months , car rental has not been re-fleeting . <p> As a consequence , the supply of those vehicles -- because they 're sold after around 12 months into the retail network -- we 've kind of missed a season , if I can put it like that . Not only have fleet sizes in the car rental industry halved ( which is a feeder to retail ) , but there also has n't been a re-fleet . There 's quite a shortage of used vehicles and hence the used vehicles are holding value much more than they would have done historically . We are having to pay significantly higher prices for that stock to keep our used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether local car pricing has been affected by the semiconductor crisis : <p> Absolutely . My neighbour is an executive at one of the major OEMs . He also shared with us that they are really having problems obtaining new stock from the OEMs . It 's in pockets and particularly with specific brands like BMW and Mercedes , which have a greater problem for the simple reason that luxury models require more chips . People may not realise that a normal car does n't have just three or four chips . It 's more like 40 to 120 , depending on whether it 's a Corolla or a S600 Mercedes . <p> But this whole thing that 's happening also has positive consequences in that it sort of revives the second-hand market . For us , the chip shortage is obviously a boon . It 's good for us because we are in the second-hand motor trade . We are sitting with all the chips that are in the existing cars .

@@63465230 <h> A bitcoin ETF : What does it all mean ? <p> Last Sunday , it was confirmed that the Securities and Exchange Commission in the US would not block the very first bitcoin-based ETF from beginning trade . <p> This is a hugely significant announcement for crypto investors and likely a watershed moment in terms of global , mainstream acceptance of crypto assets as an asset class . <p> Let 's get up to speed with what an ETF actually is , why this is big news for crypto investors , and what effects this news could have on bitcoin 's price . <h> WTH is an ETF ? <p> An exchange-traded fund is a type of investment fund that tracks the price of another asset or basket of assets and can be traded on an exchange . If that still sounds like finance nerd language to you , that 's because it is . So , let 's use an example to put this in context . <p> The SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF is the largest ETF in the world . It tracks an index called the Standard &amp; Poor 's 500 , which includes 500 of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The S&amp;P 500 index is considered one of the best gauges of the performance of large-market-cap companies in the US . Now , if you were to decide to take " large-cap US companies " as the basis of your investment strategy , it would likely be a full-time job keeping up with factors driving the stock prices of those 500 different companies . That 's where ETFs come in . You could simply invest in the SPDR S&amp;P500 ETF and gain exposure to that entire market segment with a single , simple investment . <p> The plot thickens in the case of a futures ETF , which is exactly the kind of ETF that Proshares has managed to get through the SEC as of this past weekend . In a nutshell , a futures ETF allows investors to " bet on " price movements of another asset without exposing themselves to any of the risks that owning the underlying asset might come with . <h> What does this mean for bitcoin ? <p> A bitcoin ETF comes with many fringe benefits , but all others pale in comparison to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and high-net-worth individuals the opportunity to gain exposure to bitcoin on their own terms and in a highly regulated setting . <p> The fact is , there is already massive institutional interest in bitcoin . Research indicates that even a relatively small investment weighting of 1-5% in your investment portfolio can drastically improve that portfolio 's overall performance . This can mainly be attributed to the fact that bitcoin is largely uncorrelated to other asset classes , so its returns can make up for the lacklustre performance of more traditional assets . <p> The Grayscale Bitcoin Trust , perhaps the primary vehicle for institutional investors wanting to add bitcoin to their hefty portfolios , currently holds over 654 000 bitcoins . That 's 3.47% of all circulating supply . Trusts like this one are the most popular financial instruments used by institutions looking to gain exposure to bitcoin , but they come with a host of challenges .

Historical data says yes . The table below shows how the bitcoin price responded over the 12 months prior to other major launches in the bitcoin investment space . <p> Twelve months before launches of both bitcoin futures by CME and Coinbase 's direct listing , the bitcoin price skyrocketed . In both those cases , though , we saw a sharp pullback post-launch . Many investors do n't believe this will be the case with the approval of Proshares ' bitcoin ETF , though . <p> Unlike CME 's futures and Coinbase 's direct listing , this is just the first approval out of nine other proposed bitcoin ETFs , all scheduled for launch before the end of 2021 . Rather than being a single pivotal event in the history of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of events set to change big money 's relationship with bitcoin . <p> Furthermore , institutions generally invest and make changes to their portfolios on a quarterly basis . This means the first time we are likely to see any significant volumes of trade in these new ETFs is January 2022 . So , it 's unlikely that this or indeed any of the ETFs launching in 2021 are going to drive massive shifts in the bitcoin price in 2021 . <p> That is exciting news for retail investors looking to get involved in the current Bitcoin rally , which just saw Bitcoin achieve its highest ever weekly close . <p> Now is a fantastic time to get on the bitcoin action with Revix , which is doing everything it can to ensure its users make the most of this bitcoin price rally .

But the CDC says that patients and their physicians should watch out for potential relapse six to 18 months after completing treatment . Infections that cause ulcers around the genitals also increase the likelihood of HIV transmission , public health officials say . <p> Unlike gonorrhoea or syphilis , which can be asymptomatic , people with donovanosis almost always have detectable symptoms . " Western-educated people do n't like things on their genitalia , so they seek treatment , " Bowden said . <p> Q : Should people in Britain worry about donovanosis ? <p> A : No , based on current numbers .

This township is significantly popular for its rich history and the history of the country in general . Having been home to many of South Africa 's prominent historical figures and home to popular historical sites , Soweto has grown from its historical struggles of the past to become a popular tourist attraction . <h> The history of Soweto and how it came to be <p> Soweto is a township in South Africa considered to be the biggest in the entire country . It is located in the southwest of the City of Johannesburg and is home to a population of over one million South Africans to date @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 1930s , when the White apartheid government started to segregate Black people from the White people in society . <p> Black South Africans were relocated away from Johannesburg to an area that would be disconnected from the White suburbs , by what was called a cordon sanitaire at the time , which is also known as a sanitary corridor . This was usually a river , a railway track or an industrial area of a highway , amongst others . The White government was able to achieve this through the notorious ' Urban Areas Act ' in 1923 . <p> Soweto soon became the largest Black city in the whole of South Africa , but unfortunately until 1976 , its population was only allowed to have status as temporary residents , only serving as a workforce for the city . Soweto is said to have gotten its name from William Carr , who was chair of non-European affairs and initiated the naming of Soweto in 1959 . The city council then opted for the acronym SOWETO , derived from South West Townships . The name Soweto was then used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some prominent South African figures from Soweto ? <p> Soweto is home to many prominent South African political and famous figures , which is what makes it one of the most popular townships in the country . Politicians from Soweto include the current President of South Africa , Cyril Ramaphosa and the current Minister of Basic Education , Angie Motshekga , amongst others . <p> There are also some famous business people such as Basetsana Kumalo , Precious Moloi-Motsepe , Tokyo Sexwale and Mfundi Vundla who were all born and bred in Soweto . Former Public Protector , Thuli Madonsela and Constitutional Court Judge , Sisi Khampepe are amongst the top officials and academics who also hail from Soweto . <p> Soweto is home to many actors and actresses , as well as musicians and music industry leaders , such as Benjamin Dube , Yvonne Chaka Chaka , the late Sibongile Khumalo and Lebo M of the Lion King soundtrack fame .

The township boasts figures who have made significant names for themselves in the country . <h> What are some historical and famous tourist attractions in Soweto ? <p> Because Soweto is so rich in political history , it boasts some historical attraction sites that represented significant political events that took place under the political systems and confines of Soweto 's history . Some sites and establishments are named after some of the political figures that fought in the political struggles and systems of the country , and the most obvious being the apartheid regime . <p> Political fighter , Chris Hani has the Chris Hani Baragwanath Hospital named after him , considered to be one of the largest hospitals on the continent . Many prominent political figures also had residences in Soweto , such as the late former president , Nelson Mandela , whose residence is situated in the now popular tourist attraction and well known Vilakazi Street in Orlando West .

Erin Schaff/Pool via REUTERS <p> GLASGOW , Nov 2 ( Reuters ) -- Leaders at the COP26 global climate conference pledged on Tuesday to stop deforestation by the end of the decade and cut emissions of the potent greenhouse gas methane to help slow climate change . <p> On the second day of the two-week summit in Glasgow , Scotland , wealthy nations took some overdue actions to provide long-promised financial help for the developing countries worst hit by global warming . <p> U.S. President Joe Biden chided Chinese President Xi Jinping for his decision not to attend in person . <p> " It 's been a big mistake , quite frankly , for China -- with respect to China not showing up , " Biden said at a news conference . <p> " The rest of the world is gon na look to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And they 've lost the ability to influence people around the world and all the people here at COP , the same way I would argue with regard to Russia .

It would have hoped that President Cyril Ramaphosa 's reform agenda would regain the trust of voters and propel them past the 50% mark again . The President gave everything to the ANC 's campaign .

The party fell further away from outright majorities in Mogale City and Metsimaholo . <p> The ANC had 30 more seats than the DA going into this election in this steel-producing region . That gap fell to 14 as the ANC lost 13 of its 51 seats . The party lost seats to the DA , EFF , three local parties including the Mmusi Maimane-endorsed New Horizon Movement , and a party with very strong ties to Sharpeville -- the Pan Africanist Congress of Azania . This might well be the first small victory the PAC has had over the ANC since 1994 . <p> Voters simply had enough of the almost complete collapse of service delivery in Emfuleni . This is a stunning shift away from the ANC in one of its Gauteng strongholds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here is through a deal with the EFF . There is no other way . <p> These elections were very tough for the DA , but the result in Emfuleni is one of growth . Voters here are impressed by what they see in , and hear of , Midvaal and that is a fundamental reason their vote share grew here instead of following the metro trend in Gauteng -- a trend of decline . <p> This area of Mpumalanga is known as a hub for stainless steel and coal mining . The ANC saw a gap of 15 seats between it and the official opposition , the DA , slip to four as the former was hit hard by a local party , the Middelburg and Hendrina Residents Front ( MHRF ) . This party was formed by a well-respected ex-ANC mayor and local business people . The MHRF took the bulk of the seats off the ANC in Steve Tshwete with its seven-seat haul .

If the opposition is able to form a coalition , either Jomo Segage , the MHRF candidate for mayor , the towering , former Pumas rugby lock , and DA member of the provincial legislature Bosman Grobler would emerge as mayor . <p> This result was not final at the time of writing . The ANC 's percentage vote share might go up by 1% . Whatever the final result , this is a shocking result for the party .

A resurgent IFP , a compelling local party , and a party offering clear solutions are among the many reasons the ANC finds itself unlikely to return to the council with the mayoral chain around its candidate 's neck . <p> What now ? <p> These results suggest that voters want change . They do not want the ANC to run these municipalities for the next five years . They want to give other parties a chance at the wheel . The DA made a campaign promise to its supporters that it would not work with the EFF . It is understandable why it did that . The local government governance agreement reached between the parties in 2016 did not result in success for either party , and tarnished their respective brands .

They have not had good experiences in these large towns over the past number of years , and their wish for pragmatism over intransigence will need to be strongly considered .

@@63511236 <p> Today , Discovery Health shared the latest data from its actuarial team 's ongoing analysis of the trajectory of the COVID-19 pandemic and real-world effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines . <p> The new research answers three main questions -- addressing themes that are highly relevant in the context of South Africa 's efforts to quickly vaccinate as many eligible individuals as possible : <p> What is the real-world effectiveness of the Pfizer-BioNtech ( Pfizer ) COVID-19 vaccine ? How well does it protect against hospitalisation and death ? Does the reported high effectiveness reduce in the context of the Delta variant ? <p> Do people who get fully ( Pfizer ) vaccinated after recovering from a COVID-19 infection , benefit from added protection ? <p> Are adverse events from COVID-19 vaccines ( Pfizer and Johnson &amp; Johnson ) a concern , posing significant health risks ? How does the risk of complications from COVID-19 stack up against the risk of adverse events from COVID-19 vaccination ? <p> " Discovery Health 's analytics team has collaborated with leading scientists and clinicians to deploy global best-practice methodologies in the research undertaken , " says CEO of Discovery Health , Dr Ryan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emerging from the evidence , that vaccination with the two-dose Pfizer vaccine is safe and highly effective for Discovery Health-administered members , here in South Africa . " <p> What inspired this analysis ? <p> South Africa has procured sufficient COVID-19 vaccine doses for around 80% of the population . Furthermore , the National Department of Health has set targets to vaccinate 70% of the adult population by December 2021 . Based on current vaccinated population levels and projections , it is unlikely that South Africa will meet these targets , and will most likely finish the year with slightly more than 50% of the adult population vaccinated . <p> " The demand for vaccination has unfortunately slowed , " says Dr Noach . " COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy is a key deterrent to vaccine uptake and is fuelled in large part by misinformation , which drives confusion and fear . Our analysis definitively addresses this misinformation , through carefully constructed and evidence-based research on more than 1.2m Discovery Health-administered medical scheme members . " <p> " People want to understand the true , real-world nature of the protective effects of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ risk of experiencing side effects post vaccination -- and whether they are at higher risk of an adverse event post vaccination or complications from COVID-19 . Our analysis answers these questions . " <p> Dr Noach goes on to say , " In addition , what this research clarifies is our pathway to resuming a productive new normal , whilst protecting lives and livelihoods . " <p> High levels of COVID-19 vaccine penetration evident in medical scheme member base <p> " By 3 November 2021 , more than 22 million vaccine doses had been administered in South Africa , with 2.5 million vaccine doses given to Discovery Health-administered medical scheme members , " says Dr Noach . " Within our administered medical scheme members , more than 60% of all adults and almost 80% of those over the age of 60 have received at least one COVID-19 vaccine dose . " <p> " The high vaccine uptake to date within the Discovery Health client base allows us to examine the relevance and impact of the two COVID-19 vaccines being rolled out in South Africa . Considering the time frame required @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three months ' worth of data on fully vaccinated medical scheme members included in our analysis . All in all , 1 734 276 data points were reviewed over this period , ensuring extreme rigour in the analysis , and leveraging Discovery Health 's extensive clinical database . Our analysis includes just over 1.2 million vaccinated medical scheme adult members vaccinated up to 23 September 2021 . " <p> 1 . What is the real-world effectiveness , in South Africa , of the two-dose Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine in protecting against COVID-19 admission and mortality ? <p> " We are delighted to share extremely promising findings around the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine 's real-world effectiveness , analysed here in South Africa during the third wave of COVID-19 which was dominated by the Delta variant , " adds Dr Noach . <p> " We determined the Pfizer vaccine 's effectiveness in protecting against COVID-19 admission and mortality by analysing 526 516 pathology test results , 14 673 COVID-19 admissions and 3 441 COVID-19 deaths . All of these occurred between 17 May 2021 ( the start of South Africa 's mass vaccination campaign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ period is very important as it coincides with South Africa 's third wave of COVID-19 which was fuelled by the Delta variant of SARS-CoV-2 ( the virus that causes COVID-19 ) attributable to more than 95% of infections . This Delta variant is more contagious than previous variants and consequently was responsible for a substantial wave , with much morbidity . The fact that vaccine effectiveness during a Delta wave has not been widely reported on in large global studies makes Discovery Health 's research even more relevant , on a global basis . " <p> " The findings are striking and extremely encouraging . We have shown that following each dose of the two-dose Pfizer vaccine , there is significant protection against both serious COVID-19 illness ( relative risk of admission to hospital ) and death -- of course , most notable for those who are fully vaccinated , 14 days after receiving the second dose . " <p> In summary <p> The Pfizer vaccine is 73% effective in protecting against COVID-19 admission risk 14 days after dose one and 92% effective from 14 days after dose two . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ COVID-19 mortality risk from 14 days after dose one and 94% effective from 14 days after dose two . <p> There is a stabilisation in vaccine effectiveness protecting against COVID-19 admissions and mortality at 28 days after dose one and at 14 days after dose two . <p> Encouragingly , in considering the effect of sex , specific chronic conditions , and province/location , we observe little to no variation in vaccine effectiveness in protecting from COVID-19 admission . There is , however , a 5% to 7% decline in vaccine effectiveness in protecting against admission in people over the age of 80 , and in individuals who live with three or more chronic conditions . <p> Globally , studies are being conducted to establish the durability of the vaccine-mediated immune response , ie how long vaccine effectiveness lasts . To date , Discovery Health 's data shows no waning in vaccine effectiveness in protecting against COVID-19 admission and death , in the three-month data interval following the second dose . We will continue to track this and follow up for longer periods . <p> Relative to members fully vaccinated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times higher risk of COVID-19 infection ; and 20 times the risk of dying from the complications of a COVID-19 infection . Importantly , there have been zero vaccine-related deaths recorded in the Discovery Health administered scheme member population . <p> 2 . The powerful , protective effects of COVID-19 vaccination after recovering from COVID-19 <p> To what extent are people who have recovered from COVID-19 and then been vaccinated , protected from future admission to hospital to treat COVID-19 ? <p> In some circles , it 's being referred to as " super immunity " -- people who have previously recovered from COVID-19 have a stronger immune response following vaccination , than vaccinated people who have never had a prior COVID-19 infection . <p> For people who have both recovered from COVID-19 and are fully vaccinated ( Pfizer two-dose vaccine ) , there is a 98% drop in the risk of COVID-19 admission . <p> Dr Noach adds : " It is important to mention that whilst immunity following an infection provides some protection from future COVID complications , the risk of reinfection remains . Over the full period @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in South Africa , more than 11 500 Discovery Health-administered members have experienced reinfections . " <p> Dr Noach emphasises that being vaccinated is extremely important considering these reinfections and the very high likelihood of exposure to COVID-19 for all of us . " Contracting COVID-19 carries a far higher risk of experiencing complications than getting vaccinated for COVID-19 does . This data clearly reinforces the call for COVID-19 vaccination , even in people who have had a prior COVID-19 infection . " <p> 3 . Are scheme members more likely to experience adverse events post COVID-19 vaccination or in dealing with COVID-19 ? <p> " We are encouraged to see that , within the Discovery Health client base , the risk of experiencing any adverse event following vaccination is low . And even more importantly , the risk of a severe adverse event is extremely low - in fact , rare . To reiterate , there have been zero vaccine-related deaths recorded in the Discovery Health administered scheme member population . " <p> " Importantly , the absolute risk of a severe adverse event following vaccination for COVID-19 with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ COVID-19 vaccine is significantly lower than the risk of complications following infection with COVID-19 . " <p> To conduct this analysis , a list of 179 clinically relevant conditions was compiled . This list consisted of medical conditions that could potentially follow COVID-19 vaccination and included all conditions that had been mentioned in peer-reviewed , published research and others that are of immune-mediated origin . <p> Mild vaccine-related adverse events such as fever , malaise and local injection-site reactions were excluded from the analysis ( which focused specifically on understanding any severe side effects of vaccination ) . <p> In summary <p> Three conditions ( adverse events ) were found to have a statistically significant risk of occurrence following COVID-19 vaccination , though they are extremely rare . They are lymphadenopathy ( a benign enlargement of lymph nodes ) , myositis ( inflammation of the muscles presenting as general muscle pain ) and paraesthesia ( a tingling sensation ) . " These were fortunately easily treated , " says Dr Noach . <p> What is the risk ( comparing vaccinated to unvaccinated people ) of experiencing these three very rare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ muscles presenting as general muscle pain ) occurred in nine of every 100 000 doses administered ( 0.009% of vaccinations ) . <p> Paraesthesia ( a tingling sensation ) occurred in three of every 100 000 doses administered ( 0.003% of vaccinations ) . <p> " Our analysis shows that the complications of COVID-19 illness are significantly more common and serious than vaccine-related adverse events . For example , lymphadenopathy , myositis and paraesthesia are all known complications of COVID-19 . They also occur with higher excess frequency in people who have COVID-19 than following COVID-19 vaccination , " adds Dr Noach . <p> Relative to these rare and manageable adverse events , the complications of COVID-19 are significant and potentially fatal . In terms of absolute risk relating to COVID-19 infection : <p> There is a 40-fold increased risk of pulmonary embolism ( 40 times higher chance of experiencing pulmonary embolism after a COVID-19 infection ) <p> " Whilst myocarditis is important to keep in mind as a potential adverse event following vaccination -- particularly in teenage males -- this complication did not show up as statistically relevant across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this analysis . This is not unexpected considering that myocarditis remains extremely rare , and that younger males were not eligible for vaccination in South Africa during the period of this analysis , " says Dr Noach . <p> " The risk -- benefit consideration of being vaccinated against COVID-19 is undoubtedly strongly in favour of vaccination " <p> " We are very encouraged to share our findings that , in the sizeable population under review -- just over 1.2 million members of Discovery Health-administered medical schemes -- COVID-19 vaccination has proven effective and very safe , " says Dr Noach . <p> " Discovery Health 's rigorous analysis spans a sizeable medical scheme member base , representative of all South Africans , and concludes unequivocally that vaccination with the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine is extremely safe and is highly effective at preventing COVID-19 complications and mortality . The complications of COVID-19 infection are severe and in some cases are fatal . The risk -- benefit consideration of being vaccinated against COVID-19 is undoubtedly strongly in favour of vaccination . " <p> " The data also reinforce reports of substantial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a previous COVID-19 infection . " <p> " Furthermore , the complications following COVID-19 infection significantly outweigh the risks of COVID-19 vaccination with either the J&amp;J or Pfizer COVID-19 vaccines .

@@63511237 <h> OPINION <h> A gatvol South Africa <p> Andrew Donaldson <p> 03 November 2021 <p> Andrew Donaldson writes on the media and political reaction to the results of LGE 2021 <p> A FAMOUS GROUSE <p> SOME moaning and keening , I note , about the low voter turn-out for the municipal elections . Which is a little weird , seeing as it was only last week that the commentariat were bitching there was no-one worth voting for and , as a result , they really could n't be bothered . <p> More than 500 political parties are now registered with the Independent Electoral Commission . About 300 of them fielded candidates in Monday 's election . In addition , some 1 500 independents also participated in the poll . Did any of our mainstream commentators know or care who these minnows are ? It seems not . <p> However , when it came to the bigger fish , the experts lined up on digital platforms and in the dead tree press to tell us how rubbish they all are . <p> This being a South African election , there have been cock-ups galore . Delays in getting underway are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Late results announcements from the IEC are now par for the course . Last week , on the stump for the ruling party , former deputy president Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka complained there are cadres in municipalities who " can not count their fingers " , but the problem appears more widespread than that . With such a low turnout , though , the tallying of votes should , ideally , have been a breeze even for the remedially challenged and dispensed with , chop-chop . <p> As I write ( Wednesday morning ) , only 65 per cent of the results are in , so no precise figure of voter turn-out is available . Business Dayreported that , by 7pm on Monday , two hours before polling stations were officially meant to close , eight million South Africans had cast their vote . This was little more than 30 per cent of the country 's 26.2-million registered voters . A day later , matters appeared to have improved , and the figure was pegged at almost 47 per cent . At this stage we can only guess at the final tally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that and this has prompted a mass tugging of forelocks over the implications of a low poll . Our greatly revered democracy , the pundits say , is apparently up shit creek and minority rule has once more been foisted on the masses . There is much doom and gloom and anguished brow-beating . After reading Mark Heywood in Daily Maverick on Tuesday , for example , I 'm surprised that I did n't just throw myself under a passing bus and be done with all of it . <p> " The vast majority , " he writes , " either did n't register or registered but then did n't vote . The no-vote included tens of millions of people , most of them coming from South Africa 's swelling underclass , made up of people who are young , gifted , black ... and poor . It is a terrible irony that the biggest vote was the no-vote ; the biggest political movement , the political party that does n't exist on the ballot ; the most coherent statement on the elections , the incoherent abstention of the politically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he continued , but something far more disturbing : " Instead , what we are witnessing is a profound alienation of the masses from those who work the political system and , dare we say it , from the democratic system itself , which is held to have failed to deliver . That so many people should not have voted at a moment of crisis in South Africa , needs profound introspection , particularly by those who have political and economic power and are abusing it , or simply not using it to try and better the lives of the majority . " <p> Introspection . That 's another election buzzword . In the ANC , they regard it with the sort of disquiet usually reserved for a proctological procedure . <p> Here , for example , is ANC KwaZulu-Natal spokesman Nhlakanipho Ntombela having his no-shit-Sherlock moment : " The biggest problem we faced in these elections is that our supporters stayed at home and did not go to vote ... What we need right now as the ANC in KZN is to undergo introspection . " Yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's no consolation , I suppose , but we should remember that this was not a general election . Turnouts are traditionally low in municipal polls . <p> Only 34.7 per cent of voters , for instance , took part in the May 2018 local elections in England . A year later , the turnout for the UK general elections was 67.3 per cent . That " profound alienation of the masses " with regard to management of council services is not unique to South Africa ; the housing estates here may have more in common with the townships than we care to admit . <p> However , the more important buzzword du jour is " coalition " . <p> There is a strong likelihood that several parties will be seeking partnerships in order to effectively manage councils and local authorities . There could , according to a TimesLivereport , be coalitions in at least half or as many as two thirds of the metros . <p> Many commentators seem rather fearful of this particular consequence of a low turnout . As the Institute for Justice and Reconciliation 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per cent poll " would represent a political crisis far beyond internal party factions or the messy business of coalition-building " . <p> The political scientist Bheki Mngonmezulu warns of possible bullying : " While it is true that the ANC , DA and EFF enjoy more support compared to the other parties , there is a possibility that smaller parties could gang up against the big three to run some municipalities . " Another commentator , Stellenbosch University 's Amanda Gouws , was more blunt : " We do n't do coalitions well . " <p> The point , though , is that there is no reason why coalitions should n't work . The list of countries that are successfully run by coalitions is extensive . These are , by definition , governments where several parties cooperate to form a cabinet . Because South Africa 's democracy is regarded as " fledgling " -- a euphemism for " childish " and " immature " -- our coalitions have yet to get to grips with the " cooperate " bit , and so instead squabble like brats while the grown-ups @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particular , spring to mind ; the redshirts ' secretary-general , Marshal Dlamini , has already warned that any party wishing to go into coalition with them should realise that this will happen only on EFF terms . This is a bit like trying to make a sponge cake by throwing a brick into the mixing bowl . <p> Our politics is still mired in the black-and-white , good-and-bad binary of the apartheid era . Apart from mind-numbing tedium , its adversarial nature is possibly why the big parties fared badly in the elections and why so many of those voters who did turn out on Monday threw their weight behind the smaller independent groups who focused on real issues rather than insulting one another . <p> It 's the gatvol factor , and for the devolutionaries among us , this is a good thing . Local really should be lekker . And that 's what locals want . More happily , we are seeing the beginning of the end of ANC hegemony . The party 's drift towards irrelevancy in urban centres has now shifted up a gear . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad news . The world leaders and their advisers who gathered in Glasgow this week for the Cop26 climate conference appear to have ignored the memo regarding " quote-unquote-global warming " from Institute of Race Relations policy fellow John Kane-Berman . His fevered warnings that little Greta Thunberg is some kind of unexploded Chinese incendiary device go unheeded , as do his blithe assurances that rising sea levels are the stuff of fairy tales and that the apocalypse is not on the cards just yet . <p> Instead , the experts blunder on with their foolish " breakthroughs " : so far , more than 100 countries signed a treaty committing themselves to a target ending global deforestation by 2030 .

@@63521240 <h> Want good security ? Think like an attacker <p> In the security world , it helps to understand the way cyber criminals think . " It takes a thief to catch a thief , " goes the maxim , and top security researchers frequently hunt for the same types of flaws that cyber criminals hope to exploit . <p> " People often think of cyber crime as one person trying to break in , then someone sees it happen on the other side and tries to intervene , " says Lavi Lazarovitz , Senior Director of Cyber Research , CyberArk . " That 's how the movies portray it , but it 's not how things work . Most good security depends on prevention and finding those attack opportunities before the bad guys do . That means that the best security experts think like attackers . " <p> Further to the movie example , Hollywood has us believing that a hacker manages to break in , deploy some advanced software , and grab what they can before they disappear . In the real world , things are more prosaic yet also aggressive . <p> A typical breach can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could take almost a year before identifying they have been hacked . In all that time , the criminals can sit in the system , stealing data while avoiding attention . In the infamous hack of Sony Pictures , the attackers even intercepted and changed security-related e-mails to help cover their ongoing presence . <p> Attacks can be swift and brutal . Ransomware , in particular , becomes visible very soon after a breach . It will encrypt data and then publicly demand a ransom . But even in such highly visible attacks , a lot of preparation went in beforehand . Criminals identify soft targets , such as employees , that they could fool with a phishing attack or even blackmail to do their bidding . Many criminals will lurk around to steal information , then release ransomware to make additional gains . If companies do n't pay up , that data is sold to other criminal groups . <p> Finding the flaws <p> Criminals need to find flaws in a system to launch successful attacks . Flaws come in many forms , and they are the number one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on patches . <p> It helps to know the types of vulnerabilities they aim to exploit . According to Lazarovitz , two of the most common examples are design flaws and insecure coding . <p> " Design flaws are small mistakes that an attacker can exploit . We can find an example of such a flaw in some credit card chips . When the consumer pays , the first thing that happens is a non-encrypted communication between the card and a terminal when the user inserts the card . The terminal asks for a personal identification number ( PIN ) , receives it , then checks back with the chip in the card to ensure validity . If it is , the transaction goes forward . Finally , the credit card will send some encrypted data to the terminal , which in turn is sent to the bank to validate the transaction so the vendor can get paid . " <p> Yet , in some credit card chips , the pin verification generates an unencrypted yes/no response . Not all credit cards and terminals work like this , adds Lazarovitz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the only check is when the credit card says yes or no , they can exploit the design flaw and create credit cards that say yes . It does n't matter what PIN is sent , because the next data transmission in the process is encrypted -- so the terminal ca n't check it . " <p> Simple yet effective -- this is the nature of security flaws . Such flaws can creep in due to mistakes at the programming level . Another example , insecure coding vulnerabilities , arises when programmers do n't follow the rules for secure programming . These are -- unfortunately -- very common in the software world . <p> " These vulns come in many forms -- including memory-based bugs , which allow attackers to write code in places in memory where they should n't be able to do so , as well as credential management vulns , where attackers can get access to credentials that they 're not supposed to see . Sometimes programs just show debugging information that can give adversaries more useful information that they can exploit . " <p> Insecure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secure . Recently a bug was discovered that exploits the powerful Sudo administration command in Linux systems , giving an attacker powerful privileges . In the cyber security world , such flaws are very valuable , and some groups even keep them a secret to continue exploiting them . This is called a zero-day vulnerability . <p> Fighting fire with fire <p> How do attackers find these vulnerabilities ? One common technique is fuzzing , an automated software testing technique that looks for hackable software bugs by randomly feeding invalid and unexpected inputs and data into a computer program in order to find coding errors and security loopholes . <p> " The attacker assumes that somewhere in the program there is a hidden bug , and now has only two problems to solve . The first is finding out exactly where the bug is , and the second is figuring out what input must be passed through the program in order to trigger the bug . " <p> Digital security experts deploy the same tricks , skills and experiences as cyber criminals . Only they use their abilities for fairness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think they are not common criminals . But in a digital world , they are no different from a street-side mugger or home burglar . Fortunately , just as with good detectives and police constables , security experts learn to think like cyber criminals and anticipate their plans . <p> " The key takeaway is that the best weapon a researcher has is learning to think like an attacker ; to develop a similar mindset . By analysing the same flaws attackers are looking for , researchers can find the exploitable gaps and enhance the security posture of their organisations , " says Lazarovitz . " This is useful even for non-security experts . Look at your company 's digital assets . What is valuable ? Who has access ? How could they be compromised ? Thinking like an attacker can tell you a lot about the risks your business might face . "

The competition is open to everyone who resides in the Talk of the Town distribution area , from Fish River to Alexandria , and inland to include Makhanda ( Grahamstown ) . Do you sing solo , or in a band or a choir ? Do you play a musical instrument or are you part of an orchestra ? Do you dance solo or in a group ?

In an attempt to restore normal electrical supply , the government placed an order for powerships , essentially floating electrical power generators . However , the tender , awarded to Karpowership , is now being contested by a losing bidder , DNG , on the grounds of corrupt tender practices . That problem should sound familiar among residents of the area who are aware of the political machinations involved in the various RO tenders issued by the municipality .

@@63550240 <h> Humanising the digital experience will give banks the edge <p> Nov 15 , 2021 <p> Rapidly changing customer expectations and steadily increasing competition within the banking sector are forcing financial institutions to digitalise their operations , while at the same time ensuring that they humanise their digital experience to gain a competitive edge . <p> By Dharshan Naidoo , sales team lead : SADC at Infobip <p> More and more banks are now trying to move away from brick-and-mortar environments and traditional communication channels , such as email and SMS , with the adoption of omnichannel digital banking platforms which include increasingly popular applications such as chatapps , social media messenger services and chatbots . <p> The conversational nature of these apps brings the human touch that email for example typically lacks , though email is still very much a preferred form of contact in some instances . In this sense , being able to offer all platforms is key to achieving a seamless omnichannel experience for the consumer . <p> Interestingly , the main catalyst for this transition has been Covid-19 that prompted the banking industry -- which remained largely unchanged for many decades -- to embark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are largely driven by economic and efficiency considerations , the main driver seems to be the realisation that the new generation of the digitally-connected customer expects not only convenience , but also a memorable customer experience ( CX ) . <p> The pandemic has created the need for banks to re-engineer their customer engagement strategies and seek innovative ways to keep their customers engaged and loyal , which is key to growing revenue . To achieve this , banks must look at evolving their online platforms to more digital-focussed engagement strategies that enable the consumer to have the best experience through multiple touchpoints during the customer journey . <p> Fundamental change <p> Today 's modern customer for example expects more than ever before , to be able to transact on their mobile device and the way they want to interact with a brand has changed fundamentally . While this requires banks to significantly reposition themselves as omnichannel organisations , this model and different use cases it offers also presents an opportunity for growth . <p> Humanising digital interactions means customers are now able to engage in two-way , multi-channel conversations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the opportunity to interact in this way , they become more open to receiving information that is not purely transactional -- for example , personalised marketing offers . <p> Essentially , this requires banks to personalise messages relating to their products and services , and deliver them via preferred channels , at a time that suits a customer . Banks are also expected to respond to customer requests quickly -- night or day -- , and in order to do this they must add new features to their platforms , such as integrating automation with a chatbot across a variety of banking channels . <p> Taking this approach will help banks to connect with their customers in a more meaningful way and also provide a personal touch via the digital interactions that they provide . A stronger customer connection will ultimately result in better customer experience which inevitably results in increased acquisition and better retention rates . Happy customers stay longer and buy more in that sense . <p> In an increasingly competitive market , one of the best ways in which banks can differentiate themselves is by listening to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meet their needs . Customer data is the new currency . Used properly , it will ensure customer loyalty , which is one of the biggest problems for brands these days . Modern customers are generally not loyal and will readily switch brands if they do not get what they expect from their bank . <p> Enhancing the customer journey <p> An omnichannel personalised and conversational banking approach is therefore key to enhancing the customer journey and ensuring that banks can meet their customers on the channels they prefer at their time of need or want . <p> Omnichannel banking essentially bridges the gap between online banking and traditional face-to-face banking . It provides customers with a choice of banking channels and allows them to seamlessly transition between channels without ever needing to visit a physical branch . <p> As part of an omnichannel banking strategy , banks can provide customers with the convenience of digital channels such as WhatsApp , Telegram or Viber , depending on the preference of the particular customer . However , they can also introduce automation such as a chatbot that can handle tasks like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , all the while keeping the interaction personalised . <p> Yet , banks often fail to take advantage of this when they rely on isolated touchpoints like video conferencing or an online banking service , instead of building a more integrated customer experience . This is where the omnichannel aspect really comes into play . <p> When banks become innovative in terms of client engagement , they get the opportunity to gather customer information throughout that entire customer journey . This is insightful data that you can not put a price on . This data can be leveraged to create meaningful and personalised campaigns that are relevant to customer segments across a bank 's typically broad customer demographic . This allows customer data to be monetised to the fullest . <p> In order to successfully humanise their digital experience , banks have to listen to their customers and respond by providing the engagement and banking channels that they require .

@@63556231 <h> In the application economy , the ability to ensure all applications -from ERP through to focused customer-facing ones - are secure and performing optimally is crucial to success . <p> In 2008 , Apple coined the slogan , " There 's an app for that " , inaugurating the app economy - the proliferation of apps designed for easy use on mobile devices . Apps have become vital ways to deliver the experience that an increasingly discerning consumer ( and employee ) audience expects . <p> The app economy was only made possible by the digitalisation of companies ' business processes over the past several decades via the use of mission-critical applications like ERP , CRM and so on . Today 's apps " feed " off these back-end apps . <p> ( In this article , " app " will refer to the more modern , highly-focused applications that are used to get specific tasks done or deliver specific services , while " applications " will generally refer to the underlying mission-critical applications on which the business essentially runs . However , these are not watertight categories . ) <p> Statista says the global app economy has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since 2016 and should reach $6.3 trillion in 2021 - up from $1.3 trillion in 2016 . <p> Unsurprisingly , all of this has created a uniquely complex environment that needs to be managed - no easy task . Partly this is because of the large web of interdependencies that exists . <p> If one part of the system - or perhaps ecosystem would be a better term to use - is not operating optimally , then others will be affected . To give a simple example : if the CRM system malfunctions , then the customer-facing app that draws information from it will be affected and the customer experience will suffer . <p> The emergence of hybrid IT environments adds to this complexity . Cloud adoption is growing as a way to reduce costs , but also because it enables the kind of open or distributed architecture that is well-suited to the anywhere/anytime working and shopping styles that have become the norm , especially since the COVID-19 lockdowns .

Whereas the big , mission-critical applications like ERP can still take months or even years to implement , apps are being developed almost continuously to address specific business issues or take advantage of new business opportunities .

CIOs should be asking themselves if it is best looked after by the IT team . It 's a reality that as IT has become more and more essential to business - indeed , nowadays it 's hard to separate the business from the systems on which it runs - the more pressure there is on the IT team . <p> Now , everybody 's an expert and has a view on how to cut costs or increase efficiencies , but the real challenges are an unremitting pressure on budgets across the whole business and a shortage of skills . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skills combined with the reality that even if an appropriately skilled person can be employed , he or she is unlikely to be a long-term employee in a single company , no matter how large .

@@63570240 <h> tick , tick ... Boom ! - Review <h> Lin-Manuel Miranda directs an uneven but effective musical biopic . <p> Tick , Tick ... Boom ! is in limited theaters , and will debut on Netflix on Nov. 19 . <p> When Tick , Tick ... Boom ! begins , Jonathan Larson ( Andrew Garfield ) -- the real-life creator of the show of the same name , and of the 1996 Broadway smash Rent -- works at a diner , is about a week from turning 30 , and has yet to create any works of note . The year is 1990 , and these two imposing round numbers hang over him like a dark cloud ; the introductory song " 30/90 , " which Larson performs on the piano for an unseen audience , speaks to his panic as the clock counts down . The film that follows ends up being about a great many things , from Larson 's real life , to creative frustrations , to the nature of adaptation and , ultimately , to the then-worsening AIDS epidemic that would inform his most famous show . Despite this enormous breadth of scope , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Larson 's fears of failure during this week-long window , an intimate exploration owed to Garfield 's stellar performance ( even if the actor 's singing voice is unremarkable ) . However , while the rest of Tick , Tick ... Boom ! remains watchable and engaging , it ends up trapped in an uncanny adaptational limbo , thanks to a narrative structure that undercuts its most impactful moments . <p> Directed by Lin-Manuel Miranda and written by Steven Levenson -- who created Hamilton and Dear Evan Hansen respectively -- the film is an homage to Broadway and to Larson , who died a few weeks before turning 36 ( and a day before Rent 's first public performance ) , but it 's almost too beholden to his work . Its structure is two-pronged . On one hand , it features a mostly straightforward musical narrative unfolding in New York City , and comprising brand-new staging and choreography based on Larson 's original songs . On the other , it features a frequently interspersed framing device in which Larson , accompanied by a few musicians and a pair of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ latter is a close approximation of the original show , Larson 's thread-bare , semi-autobiographical " rock monologue " about its own creation , in which he played every character ( though it contains a few elements of the posthumous Broadway re-staging , in which one actor played Larson , and two others played everyone else ) . Essentially , Miranda and Levenson attempt to craft a transformative adaptation that visualizes Larson 's narrations in the form of a traditional movie musical , but they simultaneously attempt to film it in its original one-man form , using this stage performance to more closely examine the events that led up to it . It 's a bright spark that works on paper , but in execution , it ends up sucking some of the tension from Larson 's story , and some of the magic from the film 's own big ideas . <p> The central problem with this approach lies in the fact that the narrative of the original Tick , Tick ... Boom ! exists largely in the imagination . A story of Larson 's intense focus on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that never came to be ) and the way he pushes away his girlfriend , Susan ( Alexandra Shipp ) , and his best friend , Michael ( Robin de Jes ? s ) -- an actor turned ad executive , who Larson believes " sold out " -- it is told almost entirely through Larson 's descriptive lyrics , which create a soulful overlap between literal events as they unfolded , and Larson 's subjective conception of them . He painted musical pictures that explored the dynamic between reality and the world in his head ; thanks to this tension , the resultant show about pursuing artistic greatness at any cost was n't just autobiographical , but self-critical . In the movie version , that tension is bogged down by an unyielding literal-ism ; almost every lyric is accompanied by an image that portrays exactly what the words have already described . It ca n't help but feel like a waste of visual and thematic real estate . <p> There are a few exceptions , during which characters burst into thoroughly original dream-like dance sequences , but for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , an object or an interaction , the visuals aim to portray these things in their own isolated shots , as if to accompany the lyrics with explainers , rather than complementing them with related ideas or enhancing them with some kind of rhythmic feeling . The pictures feel focused on individual words , rather than on turns of phrase , and they capture ideas out of context rather than as threads in a moving tapestry . In the process , the dramatic tension held by the words -- between dreams and reality -- is rarely carried over to the images , inadvertently giving way to an entirely new tension : between Larson 's original songs and the filmed adaptation itself , which feels so dedicated to the lyrics as to be hampered by them . <p> This tension of adaptation , ironically , plays out in the form of the film breaking its own dramatic tension , by cutting away from emotionally charged moments so that Larson can further explain each interaction from his future vantage on stage . The result is two warring films that often feel incomplete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play to their emotional conclusions , and another that attempts to re-create Larson 's intimate one-man show , but reduces it to a series of fractured intrusions , thus robbing it of its immersive power ( it does n't help matters that nearly every scene is drenched in indiscriminate lens flare no matter the light source or emotional tone , a persistent distraction from Larson 's poetry ) . <p> However , while the film 's frantic narrative ends up working against it , its frantic central performance is its strongest suit . Garfield usually reads young on screen , but in Tick , Tick ... Boom ! , he plays Larson with the exhaustion of someone who 's lived a thousand lifetimes ' worth of rejection , and is now paralyzed by the possibility of being rejected again . His wrinkles and receding hairline certainly add to the effect of someone worn down by repeated failure , but what makes his performance so specifically " 29 " is the way he combines Larson 's mounting regret with a final , desperate shred of excitement and possibility . His tug-of-war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charging towards some inevitable explosion , in the form of either enormous success , or a complete and utter breakdown . Just by watching his weary body language , you begin to fear and anticipate the eventual , inevitable " Boom ! " once the clock ticks down . <h> The story often zips between ideas , rarely stopping to consider emotional beats or visual tableaus . <p> Despite the film 's other failings , this aspect of Larson 's story is its most powerful through line , and is also a major reason Miranda makes for a not-altogether-terrible fit . Miranda has only one prior directing credit to his name -- an hour-long project from his teenage years -- and while Tick , Tick ... Boom ! features only a few notable flourishes ( his staging of frolic and movement within the confines of cramped New York apartments feels wonderfully true to life ) , the way he captures Garfield 's frazzled internal terror feels particularly precise . The story often zips between ideas , rarely stopping to consider emotional beats or visual tableaus ( it strangely ignores its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of note ) . However , when a given scene is about the central theme of 29-going-on-oblivion , the focus remains on Larson , and Larson alone . Miranda not only captures this central fear as a fixture of Larson 's present , but late into the film , he finally makes innovative use of the framing device and lets those same fears play out on stage -- not through lyrics , but through fleeting moments of silence , focused on Garfield 's contemplative stares , as if Larson were inviting us to fill the gaps with lyrics of our own . <p> These moments are brief , but they are the film 's heart and soul . They also zero in on the major difference between Larson 's conception of Tick , Tick ... Boom ! and Miranda 's . Two and a half decades after Larson 's death , the story can not help but take on a fatalistic tone , as if Larson is singing not only about his life , but his impending demise ; his search in the interim becomes especially haunting , but when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the more valuable . It 's powerfully bittersweet . Hamilton , Miranda 's own Broadway hit , features similarly cogentexpressions of death anxiety and the race to stake one 's place in history before it 's too late ( " How do you write like you 're running out of time ? " ) , and while his two-tiered adaption of Larson 's show rarely finds balance in individual moments , the bigger picture at least makes coherent sense . <p> While it adapts Larson 's story wholesale , it functions as a posthumous biopic based on an autobiography penned when the subject was still living . While the perspective Miranda brings to the film 's straightforward scenes is one of admiration ( rather than the original 's more critical eye ) , his conception of Larson 's piano interludes feels not unlike his conception of Hamilton , which begins with other characters recalling the titular statesman after his death ; perhaps the version of Larson that Garfield plays on stage is n't Larson at all , but the idea of Larson that remains in the collective memory . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a marginally more complicated portrait of Alexander Hamilton , as told through the eyes of the man who killed him , this approach in Tick , Tick ... Boom ! inadvertently un-complicates Larson in the process of memorializing him . It seeks to tell the story of those he pushed away and how he found his way back to them ( his relationship with de Jes ? s ' Michael is especially moving , as is their power ballad duet " Real Life " ) , but the visual focus is so fractured and literal that each time it cuts to Larson on stage , in some future time , it pivots away from the story 's emotional complexities and sweeps them under the rug . <p> Instead of presenting us with Larson 's self-conception -- as someone whose flaws hurt the people around him -- Tick , Tick ... Boom ! places a greater importance on Miranda 's conception of him : as a genius creator preserved in Amber . While a more sentimental approach , it is , perhaps , a less honest one than Larson intended , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Verdict <p> Lin-Manuel Miranda tries to turn Jonathan Larson 's one-man show into a traditional musical , but ends up getting stuck halfway in between . However , Andrew Garfield delivers a tremendous , running-on-fumes performance as the real-life Broadway mainstay , whose impending 30th birthday pushes him to his creative and emotional brink .

However , checking boxes to ensure that you are meeting the requirements of these acts is not going to win over your customers or help you to establish connections . It could also negatively affect the customer experience and damage trust . <p> While customers seek tailored and personalised experiences that delight , often these experiences feel generic and do not deliver the desired response from customers . This is partly because companies have got stuck in the data , using information such as birthdays to remind customers that we know you and we are thinking about you , but instead , this reminds them that you are watching them . <p> As customers continue to use online platforms for searching for information , shopping , engaging friends and family on social channels , and connecting to the brands they love , companies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , search history , engagement history and more . <p> This information may be useful to determine what your customers like and possibly gives you enough information to provide targeted deals and information about the product ranges they have browsed online . But this does not delight your customer and it may even have an adverse effect and lead to negative responses . While some theories state that customers may respond differently depending on where they are in the customer journey , many customers believe that just because you have their information , it does not give you the right to use it . <p> Rather than adding to the customer experience , many of the interactions from companies remind customers that they are being watched and while they may have provided you with their details as a trade-off for something that they wanted from you , they do not necessarily want to be bombarded with information or spammed with offers . <p> Company-centric data <p> According to new research , how companies use customer data is becoming more important to the customer experience . However , many companies are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either via on your own platforms known as first-party data , second-party data whereby companies use other company 's first-party data , and third-party data , which may have been purchased from another source unrelated to the company . <p> While collecting data from cookies or observing purchasing habits has been a quick and easy way for companies to collect customer data over the past few years , this company-centric approach has a rebound effect on the customer relationship and delivers a lower return on investment . <p> Based on this , companies need to find new ways to gather customer data that are privacy-friendly and gathered first hand . This move from tracking customer behaviour to engaging customers also allows for companies to establish deeper relationships with their customers and build trust . <p> Customer-centric data <p> After years of tracking customer behaviour , it could be a daunting process for companies to discover new ways to gather customer data but according to Forrester , there is a way to gather data straight from the customer . This approach , which they have coined Zero-Party Data , entails asking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on this approach , customers intentionally and proactively share data with a brand , helping companies to gain insight into customers ' preferences , purchasing intentions , personal context and how they want brands to engage with them . <p> This aligns with Justice Theory which adopts three pillars . First , customers will give data to companies based on what they will get for the data and if they foresee a fair outcome , this is known as Distributive Justice . Next , is Procedural Justice , customers are concerned about how the process of data is handled and how well they were treated post-purchase . Finally , Interactional Justice is about the elements of the interaction from the tone of voice and use of language . <p> By gaining valuable insight and data about customers , companies can engage customers more meaningfully , improve customer expectations and build trust throughout the buyer 's journey . Zero-party data can also be used to tailor personalised experiences , creating experiences of ones that are authentic and delight customers . <p> Customers know what they want <p> For companies wanting to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on customer privacy , the zero-party data strategy enables companies to gain the information they want in a manner customers are willing to provide to improve customer experiences . <p> There are several mechanisms available to do this , though companies should not bombard customers with requests for information or overwhelm them with questions . Rather , gathering customer data should be a seamless part of engaging customers and gathering the information that you need to improve the customer experience . <p> To gather this data , companies would benefit from using tools that are easily available to each employee and gain feedback as part of the customer engagement . For example , incorporating email surveys into customer 's correspondence can help to gather valuable insight into what the customer 's expectations are of the brand and how they want brands to interact with them . <p> Email surveys can be done quickly and easily using a solution like BrandQuantum 's email offering , BrandMail , which allows companies to incorporate email surveys as part of the email signature .

Its opening frames replace the 1961 film 's glorious overhead establishing shots of New York 's skyline with sweeping closeups that quote the former 's framing and movement , but focus on the intricate details of dusty slums in ruin , waiting to be torn down . It carries the same energy and whistling melody that preceded the Romeo and Juliet-inspired gang warfare , but it sets the stage for a story that zeroes in on specific facets of the classic musical 's subtext and turns them up to 11 . The result is not just a new movie based on old material , but a complementary piece that feels in conversation with Robert Wise and Jerome Robbins ' original . It is , for all intents and purposes , edgier , angrier , and more melancholy , with each performance rising to match this enormously high bar . And while certain vital elements get lost in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the most visually dazzling works of Hollywood cinema in recent memory . <p> The broad strokes remain the same , with a few plot tweaks and some minor rearranging .

And in the middle of their Upper West Side territory war is the young romantic duo of Bernardo 's sister , Maria ( Rachel Zegler ) , and Riff 's best friend , Tony ( Ansel Elgort ) , a former Jet . The story still unfolds in the mid 1950s -- as did the 1957 stage show , conceptualized by Robbins , with music by Leonard Bernstein and lyrics by Stephen Sondheim -- but the remake 's relationship to the time period is an immediate departure from the stellar original @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1961 movie exists in a heightened , vivid New York , whose interiors run bright red , and whose real problems are expressed not through spaces , but through dialogue , dance , and Sondheim 's heartfelt lyrics .

In the new film , the demolition is still ongoing , and visible in nearly every scene . Its characters live under constant threat of displacement ( the real clearing affected 7,000 families ) , and the intimate details of its production design create a living , breathing , decaying neighborhood that gives way to a rougher interpretation of the characters . <p> The film 's focus is n't new , so much as it is renewed .

For instance , the character Anybodys -- a tomboyish girl in the original , who some have read as transgender because of certain lines and interactions -- is much more explicitly a transgender boy ( played by nonbinary actor Iris Menas ) and populates the background in ways that feel stunningly , scarily true to life .

Equally charged and adversarial is the Sharks ' response , which arrives not only in the form of violence , but a more impassioned cultural pride . While their introduction , and film 's introduction in general , lacks the original 's audacious tough-guy ballet -- there are minor hints of it during the opening , but it 's mostly reserved for a later number -- it instead has them belting the Puerto Rican national anthem in compelling defiance of the Jets . <p> Although , while Riff is immediately magnetic , and the introduction is punchier , it unfortunately lacks a certain grace . While the Sharks all feel visually and emotionally distinct -- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be a major standout -- rarely are the other Jets distinguishable from one another , whether through their appearance , body language , or blocking ( the edit rarely holds on wide shots long enough for these dynamics to take charge ) . Robbins ' choreography , which was used in the original film and show , and practically every major version since , is n't replaced with anything memorable here . A mischievous musical detour like " Gee Officer Krupke " suffers doubly , since its boisterous group dynamics are stripped down but are n't replaced with individual flourishes . Its marginally more serious visual focus -- through held closeups on pained expressions , during lyrics about the Jets ' broken home lives -- is n't accompanied by significant musical rearrangement . Thankfully , these minor disconnects begin to fade as the film goes on , and its other qualities come rushing to the fore . <h> Most magical of all is the way the film captures Tony and Maria . <p> Justin Peck 's renewed choreography finds itself with flying colors during the ballroom dance attended by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meaningfully departs from the original 's movements , it becomes an adrenaline rush thanks to how it 's filmed , with the camera riding up and down lines of dancers like a gust of wind , and spinning around to match the energy in the room . The same can be said of the 2021 version of the delightful " America , " led by Bernardo 's girlfriend , Anita ( Hamilton 's Ariana DeBose , who moves and emotes with tremendous passion ) . The music and lyrics remain nearly identical , but it 's one of two numbers that 's transformed thanks to not only its new placement in the story -- which more closely matches the stage show -- but its transposed setting , from an isolated rooftop to the busy streets of San Juan Hill . The other notable changes surround the jazzy number " Cool , " which has a brand-new emotional and physical context , and a full-bodied commitment to the original 's balletic aggression , resulting in a gripping intensity that ripples through the rest of the film ( it now leads directly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and into the heart-stopping rumble ) . <p> The 1961 film was stage-like in its visual conception ; its story burst to life through wide shots and lateral movement across the screen . In contrast , Spielberg and Kaminski charge breathlessly into the third dimension , exploring how these characters move through their environment , and how their environment moves through them . It 's the Renaissance fresco to the original 's more flat Italo-Byzantine , with depth and point perspective woven into each shot -- through dance , camera movement , and even some of Sarah Broshar and Michael Kahn 's cuts , which regularly punch in and out from the same angle , as if to shake you by the collar and remind you that editing is what makes a movie , and makes it magic . <p> Most magical of all is the way the film captures Tony and Maria , a wildly imaginative conception of young love that makes all its other flaws simply melt away . <p> Zegler , who plays Maria , brings both a radiance and a lifelike honesty to the movie 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discomfort around Tony , and a sense of comfort within that discomfort , like it 's a part of herself she can share with him . Maria also has a discomfort speaking English , but the film features significantly more Spanish and Spanglish than the culture of ' 50s American musical theater might have allowed . In keeping with the themes of cultural belonging , the Spanish is n't subtitled by default , conferring equal importance upon English- and Spanish-speaking viewers ( depending on the showing , either all the dialogue is likely to be captioned -- for disability access -- or none of it ) . <p> In a narrative departure , Tony is rougher around the edges , with a background that makes his story about wrestling between light and darkness -- an idea Kaminski embeds into his visual palette , with lights and lens flares seeping through the corner of every gloomy space . The Tonys in each film embody their respective versions of New York ; Richard Beymer had a dreamlike quality that made it seem like he was floating on air . Elgort , meanwhile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a perfect match for the film 's crumbling corner of New York that wants nothing more than to rebuild itself . His optimism is grounded in a convincing desire to be better -- a touching sentiment that , unfortunately , finds itself at the mercy of real-world events ( the recent allegations against Elgort cast an unavoidable shadow , making Tony 's decency an occasionally hard pill to swallow ) . <p> Tony also works for ( and has an incredibly sweet dynamic with ) a new character named Valentina , a replacement for Doc , who still runs a drug store , and who 's played lovingly by the great Rita Moreno , who played Anita in the original film . It 's the most explicit connection between the two works , which are folded further into conversation when Valentina is given her own number about belonging ( she sings " Somewhere " instead of Tony and Maria ) , and the film briefly fades between her and DeBose 's Anita , as if to connect Moreno 's two characters through time . Her role within the film is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a white man , so her generational experience allows her to speak directly to the hurdles Tony encounters while courting Maria . <h> It 's a remake that feels both hyper-charged and wholly justified . <p> That courtship is heart-fluttering to witness because of how Kaminski paints it , turning Spielberg 's busy backgrounds and lively foregrounds into showstopping tableaus . The remake interprets the butterflies of love-at-first-sight as flashing lights -- as spotlights positioned horizontally along a ballroom floor , interrupted briefly by dancers charging past , lost in their own movement as they fade into silhouettes , while the glowing Tony and Maria get lost in each other 's eyes . A key scene of them together is lit through the stained glass of a church , with a light source swaying slowly outside , as if it were trying to peek in on a private moment , inadvertently washing them in a floating rainbow . It 's a rare thing for a musical to make even the presence of God feel like it 's dancing . <p> And just when the film feels like it might become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silently on Tony 's crooning , as if it 's out of the ordinary -- Spielberg and Kaminski lean unapologetically into their dreamlike formalism , using bright lights and broken spaces to root the characters in the vibrant and the crestfallen , the real and the ethereal , all at once . The floodlights illuminating Tony as he searches for Maria are blurred and foggy , to the point of resembling morning clouds . Their heavy lens flares become rays of sunshine . When Tony ends up at Maria 's balcony , the dingy lights from the cramped apartments above shimmer in the filthy puddles below , and make him seem like he 's walking on stars . It 's the kind of breathtaking imagery that closes the gap between heaven and Earth , and keeps bringing us back to the movies . <h> The Verdict <p> Not everything works in Steven Spielberg 's West Side Story -- how could it , when the 1961 classic is nigh unimpeachable ? -- but his visual translation of some of the original 's latent ideas makes it a complementary piece . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ points that seldom overlap with its predecessor , resulting in a remake that feels both hyper-charged and wholly justified . A true thing of beauty .

@@63612240 <h> Looking at residential rentals for Q3 <p> SIMON BROWN : I 'm chatting with Michelle Dickens , CEO of TPN Credit Bureau because their market strength index looking at rentals came out for the September quarter . Michelle , I appreciate the time today . Tenant demand in the third quarter -- the short answer is it remains weak . There are some improvements , we can touch on those , but broadly it is still tough out there . <p> MICHELLE DICKENS : Yeah . I think tenant demand remains really , really weak with job losses in the market and loss of income . Again in the third quarter we 've seen another enormous shedding of jobs and this is impacting tenants ' ability to remain in the marketplace and , in fact , many might start to exit again . <p> We 've seen our quarter-three vacancy rates have come down . But just yesterday we looked at the quarter-four vacancy rates , and those are starting to trend back upwards again . So where we thought we had seen the bottom of the vacancies , unfortunately driven by weak demand , driven by job @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start to edge up again . <p> SIMON BROWN : ... I had noted that there was a slight uptick in vacancy rates , a slight improvement -- that has now deteriorated . The interest-rate increase this quarter , only 0.25% , but that is going to hurt stressed consumers . Possible lockdowns are coming , particularly in the leisure industry . The picture is therefore not getting better in a hurry . <p> MICHELLE DICKENS : No . It will definitely become more challenging . If we look at , for example , the tourism industry , we 've a loss of international tourists coming in now . That 's going to impact the short-term lets . The short-term-let landlords are going to pivot back into the long-term market ; that increases supply with weak demand . It 'll push the vacancies back up . That drives down the escalations as well . So it remains a very challenging market at the moment . <p> SIMON BROWN : Is there a different situation at different price points of availability ? <p> MICHELLE DICKENS : Absolutely . We 've got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ below R3 000 per month . These are tenants who actually have been the most affected by job loss and income deterioration . Our tenants in this particular bracket are really struggling ; the demand is still there , but in terms of quality of tenant application it 's just not meeting the criteria for landlords at the moment . <p> We see that effectively 68% of these tenants are in good standing . To give some context to that , nationally 80% of tenants are in good standing , tenants who are fully paid up ; there 's nothing outstanding . <p> So our landlords in the centre area of the market are dealing with tenants that are particularly under pressure from a financial position . <p> In our mid-sector , our affordable sector of the market , demand is fantastic . In this sector of the market one in three tenants rent at between R4 500 and R7 000 per month . As we know , this is an area of the market where there 's a lot of demand from tenants . Also , 80% are in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ date . <p> But the sweet spot , Simon , are those tenants in the R7 000 to R12 000 range ; a whopping five in 10 tenants rent here , and they 've managed through this process from their income . They 've maintained their level of income , and so they 're the best performing . <p> SIMON BROWN : We 've seen some reduced residential buildings completed , and that number had spiked . It 's come down a bit . Is this a lead indicator of census , suggesting that perhaps over the course of next year less new stock is coming in , or is that a little grasping at straws ? <p> MICHELLE DICKENS : The construction industry obviously has been under a huge amount of pressure , and particularly in the 2020 period when we were in hard lockdown , buildings came to a standstill . So we are seeing about 50% of the number of properties , new builds that are being completed in the last two years , compared to what we saw in the 2019 period . <p> In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ residential dwellings coming into the market , but 50% of those -- in fact nearly 60% of those -- were into the Gauteng market . This is why the Gauteng market in particular is struggling with the high level of vacancies . Gauteng is a fabulous area because 50% of all tenants in South Africa reside in Gauteng . So you do expect the building activity to offer a lot of support for the needs of the tenants in this particular area . <p> But in the last few years , the reduced number of new builds means less stock are coming into the market . Hopefully we get ourselves back to equilibrium with high demand , low stock , new stock . Hopefully we get to a point of equilibrium again . <p> Fundamentally , though , Simon , we need jobs , people employed , earning an income and able to able to get back into the tenant or home-buyer market . <p> SIMON BROWN : I take your point on that .

This midsole is crafted from a bio-based sugarcane , which offers a low-carbon component using natural materials . <p> Not only is it low-carbon , but the sneaker is also one of the lightest in the industry . This is a further saving on material usage as only what is needed is used during manufacturing . Even with these reductions , the performance integrity of the shoe is still maintained . <p> The upper of the FUTURECRAFT.FOOTPRINT is another material hybrid . It is manufactured from a material made of 77% recycled polyester and 23% natural Tencel .

Residents in areas of Gauteng and KwaZulu-Natal where looting and violence took place are battling to find food and basic services amid the devastation . ( Photo : Shiraaz Mohamed ) <h> With shops and malls looted and empty , the real struggle to survive begins . Tshabalira Lebakeng is a journalist who lives in Orlando . This is his account of trying to find food last week after the violence and looting stopped . <p> " I 'm sorry Sir to tell you that our tests say you are diabetic . " That 's what the nurse at Diepkloof clinic told me in 2018 . That changed everything about how I have to eat . I have to eat healthy food . No more amagwinya or fried eggs . <p> On Wednesday after the looting , I woke up . The streets were quiet . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were hiding . <p> I took my diabetic meds with boiled carrots and potatoes and tea for breakfast . <p> But I noticed I 'm running out of food . I had two carrots , an onion , some pumpkin and a half packet of brown flour left . I had some money in the bank from writing my story , but I did n't have cash . <p> So I took myself to the Engen garage at Orlando , 1.5km away . There was a tuckshop and an ATM machine at the garage . My plan was to get some money and buy some food . On the way to the garage , I noticed all the tuckshops on the street were closed . I passed a Shoprite , my low price shop to get food but it had been vandalised . The doors were all open and the shelves were completely empty . <p> Before I got to the garage , I passed two freezing old ladies with their shopping bags . They wore big coats and scarves with warm hats . They asked me if I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get their Sassa social grants . I told them nothing seemed open . No banks , no shops , no post office . <p> The one old lady looked at me and said : " My son , this is the end of South Africa . I do n't know what I am going to do with my grandchildren . Their mother left them with me . I do n't know where she is in this world . Now at my age , I 'm suffering . " <p> She looked at me crossly . <p> " You see what you are doing with your girlfriends and then they go away when they have babies and leave them with me . I ca n't enjoy my pension . I have to share my Sassa money with the grandchildren . I do n't know what to give my grandkids to eat . I need my Sassa money today . " <p> I told her , " Me too .

There was nothing on the shelves . The ATM was out of service . So I asked the lady if I could get some tomatoes and pay her cash back later . I have money in the bank but I need an ATM to get it . She told me , " Sorry Sir , I ca n't do that . " <p> At the garage , dirty , dusty kids aged between four and five were playing . They were digging in the rubble next to a fallen door . There was rubbish everywhere . They were looking to find leftovers . <p> I wondered if their fathers and mothers had looted the day before . Will they grow up believing crime is okay if it puts food on the table ? <p> So I took off rushing to see if the FNB ATM across the road was open . But when I got there I was shocked to see five boys -- young boys wearing old pants and jackets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spades . Four of them were digging the ATM from the wall . The one , Zembe , was sitting making a joint of marijuana . He was telling the others to dig . If they dug hard he would give them a smoke . I looked at them in surprise . I thought I was dreaming . <p> One of the boys , Mandla said to me : " Big man . There is no money here . Last night the lucky ones took the money . We are trying to take out this metal for recycling . " <p> I asked them why they did n't run when they saw me . What if I was a policeman ? <p> Tshabalira Lebakeng with Ngizwe , a theatre group for children and youth in Soweto which he runs . ( Photo : Mark Lewis ) <p> Hayibo ! I was surprised .

On my way back this guy stops me and says if I need anything I must shout . He 's got things from food to anything I can think of . <p> I told him I do n't buy stolen goods . He told me it 's not stolen . " I just took the stuff free from the shop . " He told me he has to do something to survive . <p> " Because South Africa will look like Zimbabwe in the next coming five years .

I felt really emotional thinking about what I had seen and what will happen to me in the next coming weeks . If the shops do n't open and I ca n't get money , how will I eat ? <p> Then I looked behind my little grocery cabinet . Hey ! I was so happy and excited . There was a packet of Knorr soya mince soup . I was crazy happy asking myself how did this soup fall behind the cabinet ?

But none of my neighbours would lend me the money . So I walked to my aunt 's house . She lives in Diepkloof three kilometres away . She works as a cleaner for government in town . She said she had some money but it was in the bank and the ATMs in central Johannesburg were all closed . <p> The next morning a guy I know phoned me . He said he had three fridges and did n't I want to buy one ? Low price . He said I must move quickly because now the police are coming door-to-door to look for stolen goods . <p> " You are a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money . " <p> I asked him how much he wanted for the fridge . He told me at the shop it 's R15,000 but he will give it to me for R1,000 . I asked him when he started to smoke nyaope ? <p> He told me he is not smoking . It 's just he wants to get rid of the stuff he stole at the shops . I told him : <p> " I 'm sorry I ca n't help . I do n't even have R12 for a taxi to town . " <p> He replied : " Now you are a man of big newspapers , " he says . " You getting stingy and God wo n't bless you because you do n't want to help others . " <p> I dropped the call . I did n't want to fight with such a stupid person . <p> Then an hour later my friend Emma called me .

Emma organised an Uber for me and I was going to meet her at Rand Steam Shopping Centre where I could draw money and buy food . <p> When the Uber arrived I was happy like a child seeing an ice cream . I was getting away from the world of loud noise where people shout at night " Mbambe viba asimbulale " : " Catch him . Stop him . Let 's kill him . " <p> When the Uber arrived at Rand Steam , it smelt so nice . I could forget the smell of burning tyre smoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It 's like being in another country . <p> Then comes my friend Emma with a beautiful smile . She was so happy to see me after all these months in lockdown . <p> We shopped at Pick n Pay and then when we finished we talked about the future of our project and what had happened to the children . Our ' little one ' , was forced by her mother to go to KZN to be a sangoma . Jabu finished matric but is trying to study . He does n't have a job . But Thami is studying law at Wits and wants to be a politician to change the world . Emma says Thandi got a degree in film and TV production from Tshwane University Technikon .

The trouble is , looting has been the social compact of our country for too long . Politicians loot the state coffers , municipal managers loot billions , the president facilitates the Guptas to strip the SOE ' s bare , tenderpreneurs gorge at the public trough . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the job , and the declining tax base is loaded with ever increasing social grants . <p> Forget white monopoly capital , the state only runs monopolies and extends the egregious privilege to it 's labour voting base by ballooning its wages while the rest of the country is unemployed . <p> We have become a get something for nothing nation . <p> In the northern suburbs behind our high walls we decry that soweto does n't pay for electricity , but that 's just more of the social compact . Anyway , how much cheaper would it be without having to pay for the corruption costs being recovered ? And the same goes for all municipality price gouging . <p> So our man in the street is late to the party but he 's just trying to get his turn while the government is pushing for legal theft with EWC and more BEE . <p> And let 's not forget that the riots started as tiff between the looting factions of the ruling party . <p> Cry the beloved country indeed . Ours is a country that has never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like you out there . Maybe this disaster shows how important a law abiding society is and how much we rely on a healthy private sector . The ANC can learn from this that without business the country grinds to a halt . Time to recognise this and turn away from racist BEE legislation that is the root of so many ills and move to remove all legislation that prevents growth . We have world class business people here , we are the solution not the problem ! <p> My first ever comment .... Yet with all of our 11 languages to choose from , I do n't have the right words . THANK YOU for finding the words and painting the picture . This is not ' behind the scenes ' reporting . This is the scene Go well Go with God He has n't left South Africa <p> This on-the-ground writing is so important in our shattered society . As SA citizens we pass one another in the night , clueless about one another 's experiences . It seems that this suits government just fine -- divide and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effect change , and deeply angry . When do we get to be one people ? and in a position to know one another 's strifes and to actually make a difference for all of us ? Integrate us on the ground in terms of housing and opportunities , you 'll find that the majority of South Africans will be in support of this . <p> I have feelings for you Tshabalira but I also hope that you realise that what you are experiencing is the fruit of the majority of this country voting to keep the ANC running the place . I have great faith and hope in what our president is trying to achieve but it is time that the people of South Africa stand up and support him publicly and say yes Mr Rhamaposa -- get rid of that corrupt and greedy rubbish and put individuals into power who have the the welfare of the people in their heart , not personal gain . <p> If we think , the privileged , that this country is hopeless ... imagine how the disenfranchised feel about it . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with SA , please can we address the inequality ? Create the society we need . No one 's possessions or lives are secure while there is such disparity between the haves and the have nots . It is not sustainable . <p> Thsabalira , thank you . After all it took to get simple food to your table you took the trouble , with Harriet , to bring us your story . Everyone who reads this is fed by you today . I wish CR would read this for greater strength , I wish the corrupted would read this to find shame , I wish everyone would read this to know better where we are . Your voice is a compass for us . Thank you . <p> When Zuma and Ace et al ask what they have done wrong , please read this piece aloud to them . My heart breaks for you , Tshabalira , and your community . One moment of reprieve is like parole . God has not left South Africa . It is the reverse . Keep writing . We need your voice . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ someone make this article compulsory reading before the next session of Parliament for all Big Man trough-feeding ANC officials to digest along with their Moet and cake . <p> What jumped out at me from this article was the comment by a granny lamenting how grandchildren are left with her to support on her meagre pension . When will the call for responsible parenting become a goverment initiative ? <p> A truly down to earth graphic account -- thank you for publishing Tshabalira 's experience of trying to survive one day at a time in Orlando . I pray that at least one municipal representative for Orlando reads this and draws the plight of ' unrepresented ' residents to the attention of the relevant authorities . <p> Thankyou for this beautiful , heartfelt article , Tshabalira . God is very present in your article . We can only hope for a better day and that you and Des Erasmus can win an award for your incredible articles . <p> For one who claims to not have a ' proper education ' ... you are doing exceptionally well . Well not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of your story is humbling . It is always gratifying to know how some of the people you have tried to ' lead by example ' have gone on to ' achieve ' in life . That does not detract from the disappointment of finding others who did not ' make ' it , or are floundering . In life , unfortunately we ca n't have one without the other . They are the two sides of the same coin of life . Best wishes with your endeavours . <p> Thank you DM for bringing us these stories from Tshabalira and the Homeless Writers Project . They give insights which are not easy to find elsewhere . Please do continue commissioning more stories like this . <p> Thanks for sharing your experiences in Orlando East -- it was an eye opener for me . I really wish I could say more , do more . Most importantly I hope God will return to the streets of South Africa . You and your friend Emma and your theatre group are already making that possible and there 's ' redemption ' for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . I can not pay you a better compliment than Jeep 's : " Yes uncle you are a good man . My sister once in 2012 attended your drama classes . " <p> I do not need to read this article to know the ANC and the government has failed its people and fails South Africa as a nation . They are a disgrace to what the ANC stood for pre-1994 and post 1994 could have been the government fully supported by all . Shame on you Luthuli House ! However I will read the article as it deserves reading and deserves to be heard , not like the pitiful family messages that leaves the population wondering what was this message actually saying ! We need leaders with backbone and some horns . <p> Very sad and poignant . So many good people struggling . As a white person I wonder how bad do things have to get , and how much more proof of evil and wrong doing does a country have to go through before the same political party and others similar to them are voted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good lasting change happens , or will South Africans always vote along colour lines and not for what a party does and their track record . Why are n't the young taught from an early age about the importance of their vote , and how they can bring change and to not just vote for the same as their parents but for people who truly have our country 's success at heart ? <p> Heartbreaking journalism . Tshabalira 's story reminds us of the devastating inequality that exists . As we read this story from the warmth and comfort of our homes ... I need to ask ... ' how can I help ? ' ... DM perhaps you have some ideas ? ? <p> This makes me so sad but strangely hopeful . Surely a country who has peopke like this and people who stand together , can overcome this ? But then I think about Zimbabwe and my heart falters .

These bacteria assist in decreasing the possibility of certain bacterial , viral , and yeast infections , enhancing the digestion and absorption processes , and the production of vitamins and minerals . Antibiotic therapy alters the microbial balance of the gut , as it not only kills harmful bacteria but also the beneficial bacteria that are necessary for the optimal functioning of a person 's gastrointestinal tract . A probiotic is a substance that contains live cultures of beneficial microorganisms . These microbes provide health benefits to the host when taken in sufficient quantities . Supplementation with probiotics reinstates and maintains the beneficial bacteria and restores the gut microbial balance . <p> Question : Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whereas others on an empty stomach ? <p> Answer : Food and medicines can interact profoundly . Some medications need to be taken on an empty stomach in order to aid absorption and therefore maintain the effectiveness , of the medication . It also ensures that the medicine is not destroyed or deactivated by digestive processes , such as stomach acid , which would result in its ineffectiveness . Some medications need to be taken after meals to prevent gastric upset and abdominal side effects . There are many other reasons as well , but these would depend on the medication itself . You can discuss these with your pharmacist or doctor , but always follow all the instructions that come with your medicines . <p> Question : I do n't have a medical aid and sometimes use original medicines and other times I use the generics that my pharmacist offers me .

An immature digestive system might not cope with the gas build-up , which is a natural result of digestion , leaving the gas trapped in the gut to cause bloating and pain . Your baby might also pull his knees up and strain to move the gas with little success .

Read on ! <p> Near-sightedness is one of the most common vision problems in childhood . <p> Does your child suffer from near-sightedness ? Near-sightedness ( also known as myopia ) is one of the most common vision problems in childhood . In fact , about 9% of kids aged 5-17 years are near-sighted , according to the National Center for Children 's Vision and Eye Health in the USA . Kids with this condition can usually see things close up , but struggle to see things far away . It 's often diagnosed when they start school when they struggle to see the board in class . <h> Can you stop your child 's near-sightedness from getting worse ? <p> According to Adrian Yssel , an optometrist and director at Dynamic Vision Optometrists who has specialised in treating near-sightedness for 10 years , you can control the deterioration of your child 's vision with new advanced technologies . You do n't have to accept that nothing can be done for your child . <h> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to know that the earlier one intervenes with near-sightedness in kids , the better their chances are of avoiding the risks of more serious eye conditions like cataracts , glaucoma , and retinal detachment when they get older .

Taking control early on to slow the progression offers the very best prognosis . <h> An increased rate of near-sighted <p> Experts are seeing a big increase in the number of kids with this eye condition and are concerned about a " myopia pandemic " , fuelled by the vast amount of time kids are spending on near-vision tasks and being exacerbated by the COVID-19 lockdown . Less time outdoors in natural light and more time indoors staring at computer screens and devices are impacting young , developing eyes . <p> Evidence also suggests that young children who sleep in very dark rooms are less likely to develop myopia than children that sleep with night lights or in bright rooms . Not only are we seeing more children with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diagnosed are lower than in the past . This can be largely attributed to the very young age at which they start playing on smartphones and devices .

Older generations were never exposed to these high-energy levels of light while growing up . <h> Three ways to stop your kid 's eyes from getting worse <p> There are 3 tried-and-tested ways to slow down the progression of near-sightedness in children : <p> The first method , called Ortho Keratology , is backed by research and has the longest history of successfully reducing myopia progression in children with between 36-56% .
