Photo : Kopassus <p> Pacific Scoop : Review -- By Ezki Suyanto <p> At one point during Aceh 's nearly 35-year battle for autonomy from Indonesia , a woman approached an officer at a military post in the village of Trio . <p> The Acehnese woman alleged that she had been raped by a member of the Kopassus , also known as the Indonesian army 's Special Forces . <p> An investigation was launched into the matter . It was decided that the rape never took place . <p> Later , it was revealed that the woman had a relationship with the soldier . <p> This story , among many others , can be found in Kopassus Untuk Indonesia ( Kopassus for Indonesia ) , a book which claims to give the " inside story " on the army 's Special Forces . <p> While going into the history of the elite force and explaining its daunting selection and training process , it is apparent that Kopassus published the book to " clarify " and " justify " its use of force in military operations and conflict @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warfare tactics , appears to have deployed the same skill in this publication -- using civilian writers to tell its side of the story to gain public acceptance . <p> Civilian reporters This book , published in January , marks the first time that a book on Kopassus has been written by civilian reporters . As such , the narrative about the country 's most elite force has garnered a great deal of attention from both activists and observers . <p> Authors Iwan Santosa and E.A. Natanegara 's 351-page book is broken down into six chapters . One delves into the history of Kopassus and illustrates why only the country 's fittest and smartest make it . The intensive selection process that new recruits undergo is explained in detail . <p> " Once during survival training at Situ Lembang West Java , I inspected my equipment and my students , " says Letkol Iwan Setiawan , the head of the training command , in the book . <p> " One student was missing . We searched for him for an entire night . He showed up at 8 am the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he claimed that an old man had helped guide him back to the mountain . We do not know whether it was true or not , but it showed that he was a coward . " <p> According to the book , the final test for new recruits is a 500-kilometer march from Batujajar West Java to Cilacap Central Java . The entire journey takes five days and nights of walking , and the cadets can only rest for meals . They receive the coveted red beret if they reach Cilacap on time . <p> " They forget all their suffering and what they had to endure when they receive the red beret , " Setiawan says . <p> The most interesting part of the book by far is the description and depiction of Kopassus 's involvement in conflicts in Aceh , East Timor , Poso , Ambon and Papua . <p> Defending Indonesia According to Kopassus , they were defending Indonesia from breaking up , as Aceh and Papua were waging armed insurgencies to break away from Jakarta rule . <p> At the same time , they were aware @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ military operations that they carried out . <p> Human rights groups have routinely accused Kopassus of murder , rape , robbery and torture during their tour of duty in the tho troubled provinces . <p> Kopassus denies all the accusations , saying that it was the separatist Free Aceh movement ( GAM ) who was responsible for the human rights violations that took place during the insurgency . <p> The book recounts an incident when an Acehnese female reporter , Cut Aisyah , reported a soldier to the Military Police for allegedly kidnapping her husband . <p> Commander Major General Syamsul Jalal investigated the case . <p> " We still doubt the veracity of the report and the accuracy of the evidence . Every woman who reports anything related to violence will get compensation , " says Major Ari Yulianto , who was on duty when Cut Aisyah lodged her report . <p> Chinese community The book also tells how Kopassus protected the Chinese community during the May riots in Jakarta in 1998 . <p> " There was a rumor that we were taking bribes of Rp 2 million $210 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who was Jakarta battalion commander . " I assure you it is not true . " <p> The book only twice mentions the name most often associated with Kopassus : that of Prabowo Subianto , one of its most famous and formidable leaders , who has now turned politician . He is mentioned as commanding the rescue operation to free a hostage from Mapenduma , and when he led an expedition to conquer Mount Everest . <p> Prabowo , the former son-in-law of the late President Suharto , wielded tremendous power when he led Kopassus . <p> There are no details about the missing activists who were abducted at the time , an issue that brought about the fall of Prabowo 's military star . As of today , 13 activists remain missing . <h> 2 comments : <p> Colin , 3 . February 2010 , 14:51 <p> Just a few comments : This is the second book to written , by a civilian , on Kopassus . The first book " Kopassus " was written by Ken Conboy . It is interesting that as a S.F. unit , Kopassus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other countries are normally extremely popular -- possibly due to perceived human rights issues ? It is also a fact that Kopassus use the John Wayne movie " The Green Berets " as a training film ! Last point -- The hostage rescue in Papua was actually carried out by the Brit SF . Most of the command work for this op.was done by the British Military Attache in Jakarta , Col. Ivar Hellberg . <p> Enrico , 17 .

He continued as an attache in MALAYSIA . So there goes your statement down the tube . <p> You have been judgmental in " so unpopular " . What are your arguments ? Every year hundreds of people tried to apply to the Army , and many of them apply for a slot in the Kopassus . So what 's " unpopular " ? If you compare Kopassus with dangdut ( national @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 're not ! <p> Kopassus used John Wayne movie as part of ENTERTAINMENT ; the so-called " special military skills " in the movie is copied for entertainment purposes only , if there are guests around . You get that ? <p> Every now and then some writer would have some claim that the Mapenduma op is done by ABCDEFG spec ops unit . Well , it changes everytime , but which one is true ? Just ask the former hostages ... They 'll give you the answer .

" A joint investigation by NGOs into Singapore palm oil giant Wilmar International in October 2009 revealed that crucial information about land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ team discovered that a large majority of local people living in the Landak plantation area had been misled into relinquishing their land to the company. ?

The health effects of the mill on local communities for the past 33 years has been severe and in some cases , irreversible. ? <p> The study documented the effects of nine toxic chemicals such as the herbicide ' paraquat ' used commonly in all plantations as well as a variety of insecticides . Its effects range from skin diseases , ulceration and alterations to the Central Nervous System resulting in intense nausea and loss of reflexes . Paraquat was banned by the European Union ( EU ) in 2007 but remains legal in most developing countries . Though it is still commonly used in Australia and New Zealand , there are strict regulations governing it . <p> " The people live all the way down near the rivers there and those rivers have all been polluted with the effluent from the mills .

They drink from it and they wash their clothes in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nowhere else to go . " <p> In response to allegations of pollution made by CELCOR and Friends of the Earth to the RSPO grievances panel in 2008 , Wilmar responded that they would prepare ' to adopt a precautionary approach by conducting Environmental lmpact Assessments , a full HCVF Assessment and Social Impact Assessments before any land development in the area commences . ' <p> But Tanago maintains that he has not seen any real commitment from the company . <p> " Their complaints have fallen on deaf ears . The company says that there is no scientific backing and sometimes they will just refuse to answer them . There is evidence of suffering though . About 60 per cent of village of 200 people are affected . Only few ever speak up about it . " <p> WWF also seems to believe that complaints from the communities and findings of NGOs require more substantial evidence . <p> " There will always be allegations , and WWF ca n't be everywhere at once . " <p> " Cargill and Wilmar are definitely not a hundred per cent there yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't say that any of the companies are quite there yet . " <p> " WWF is very much aware of the situation on the ground , " said Grant Rosaman , forests campaigner for Greenpeace International , " But when WWF becomes an external assessment body for the companies , the companies become their clients and it gets very difficult for them to stay loyal to their agenda . " <p> Forest Restoration coordinator for WWF Indonesia , Fitrian Ardiansyah concedes that some companies on the Roundtable have continued their malpractices . <p> " This is a challenge for us . And we have been naming and shaming companies which use the RSPO to cover up their practices , " said Ardiansyah . <p> The RSPO website has a list of companies whose memberships have been terminated but no such ' name and shame ' list that draws attention to the alleged malpractices of major companies like Wilmar and Cargill , exists . An older version of the RSPO website however , did report a complaint made against Wilmar International by Friends of the Earth in January 2008 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Board , which consists of stakeholders instead of external assessors . In response to the allegations against Wilmar , the executive board stated that ' There are three items in the response where further assurance is to be secured ... none of these three items , individually or collectively , were considered as invalidating the acceptability of the response . ' There was no specification of what those three items were and whether Wilmar delivered its assurance . At the time of this article 's publication , the executive board 's response had been removed from the new RSPO website , a move that further shows the board 's lack of transparency . <p> The Singapore biofuel giant remains a member of the Roundtable and received full certification in January 2009 as ' a testament of Wilmar 's strong commitment towards sustainable palm oil production , based on sound management and active engagement with the different stakeholders in the palm oil supply chain ' , according to a company press statement <p> Gaskell describes the Roundtable as a ' journey of improvement ' that WWF guides them along . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is constantly seeking ways to improve the principles and criteria . <p> " RSPO has worked hard to get a set of standards that are far and beyond the current level of practices . They are the best practice management right now . And those standards are not set . WWF will continue working with companies to strengthen them . " <p> But both international and local campaigners believe that WWF is missing the point , which is that without a legal framework within the country that can govern a company 's actions , the RSPO is useless . Furthermore , local governments often have no regard for the environmental impacts of plantations and this makes it difficult for the company to carry out assessments without heavy financial losses and thereby making them more likely to skip the process . <p> Government indifference <p> In Indonesia , the Department of Agriculture regulates and distributes permits to companies . These location permits provide for the transfer of rights of the land to companies for commercial uses but are only valid for three years . In that time , companies must carry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , secure investments , apply for and be granted requisite permits for clearance and construction and install the necessary infrastructure . Delays occur for a number of reasons and permits are often forfeited if the company can not complete the process on time . <p> " It is very likely that the companies will not perform assessments or community consultations properly because they are afraid they will lose the land to someone else , " said Kuswardono . <p> " The government in Indonesia or Papua New Guinea does n't care how much forest will be destroyed when they give out these permits . " <p> The same investigation by Sawit Watch , Wild Asia and Forest Peoples Programme found that as a reaction to complaints of other businesses , governments often rush to reallocate these permits to other companies . Wilmar International was reported to have had over a total area of 120,100 ha in 2006 with active permits . By 2009 , the Minister for Agriculture had cancelled permits to almost all these areas and had then restored to Wilmar only 52,204 ha . The main receiver of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not RSPO certified and was alleged to have cleared land without conducting environmental impact assessments or securing agreements from host communities . <p> " The big task which WWF and RSPO should focus on is creating a legal bind for the HVC assessments so that companies can be held accountable for their actions , " said Tanago . <p> " Nothing is being done right now about the pollution and land clearance because the government is on the company 's side . " <p> WWF concedes that it is a difficult situation but maintains that it is taking a constructive approach . <p> " We have been involved with the Indonesian government since the early days of the RSPO and taking all the necessary steps in the process , " said Ardiansyah , former forest restoration coordinator for WWF Indonesia . " It is a difficult process because the government does not yet understand . " <p> " But I would say that 50 per cent of the P&amp;C have already been incorporated into government agenda . The critical points related to social and indigenous issues are not quite there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also accounts for a large majority of Indonesia 's carbon emissions . When each hectare of peatland is drained for oil palm production , an estimated 3,750-5,400 tons of carbon dioxide is released over 25 years . Due to this , Indonesia is the highest emitter of greenhouse gases after China and the U.S. <p> The Roundtable held its annual conference in Kuala Lumpur in early November 2009 and according to its press releases , the executive board managed to ' reach a compromise in which some emissions reduction requirements will be directly incorporated in the Roundtable 's certification standards . ' Again , the standards to be followed will be voluntary . <p> " This is a move in the right direction , " said Adam Harrison , WWF 's representative on the RSPO Executive Board in a press statement released after the meeting .

@@1405238 <p> In a recent blog posting headed " Fiji Media Joins the Coup " well-known Pacific affairs journalist Michael Field called Nazhat Shameem a " coup perpetrators ... a key player in the judicial coup that sacked a chief justice and ... a close adviser of Bainimarama . " And then went on to write , " Without even the vaguest nod of consultation with the public , Shameem and Bainimarama have come up with some kind of decree defining crime . " The article has prompted Crosbie Walsh to challenge Michael Field over the facts ... <p> Michael Field is a NZ journalist with many years Pacific reporting experience . He was fearless in his coverage of the pro-democracy movement in Tonga and in his condemnation of the 1987 , 2000 and 2006 Fiji coups -- between which he can see no difference . <p> Following a succession of negative reports on Fiji ( and a rebuke from the NZ Broadcasting Standards Authority for his libellous comments on a former Fiji Attorney-General ) Field was declared persona non grata and denied entry to Fiji . He continues to write short , essentially " copy and paste " articles on Fiji for the mainstream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so departs from normal journalistic standards that his mainstream colleagues must be embarrassed . He has been especially harsh in his treatment of former Fiji High Court judge Nazhat Shameem , the subject of this posting . <p> In a recent blog posting headed " Fiji Media Joins the Coup " he called Nazhat a " coup perpetrators ... a key player in the judicial coup that sacked a chief justice and ... a close adviser of Bainimarama . " <p> And then went on to write , " Without even the vaguest nod of consultation with the public , Shameem and Bainimarama have come up with some kind of decree defining crime . " <p> IN FACT , the Crimes Decree was essentially the Qarase government draft completed by the Law Reform Commission in 2006 before the coup . It is not a creature of this government in substance although it was passed by this government . All relevant bodies were consulted during the drafting process including the judiciary , the Law Society and all the women 's groups pre-2006 . The 2006 draft also included the treason offences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drafted or changed by Nazhat Shameem . <p> Field then wrote that " subtle changes " were made in defining treason in order to protect .. those who purported to draft this decree from the very charge itself . " These changes , he said , were such that overthrowing the Constitution or the government of Fiji is no longer an offence . <p> IN FACT , the law on treason is a refection of the law as defined in the Silatolu and Nata cases by Justice Wilson and by the common law , and overthrowing the Constitution or the lawful authority of the Government of Fiji are certainly criminal offences under section 65 . Treason is an enactment of the common law on treason about which Field seems to be unaware . It was set out in the Silatolu case and is summarised as an act of levying war against the State . This is still a type of treason . <p> Changes made to the Decree were not in relation to treason . Section 64 , on treason , remained unchanged from the Qarase government draft . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 65 ( 2 ) of the Decree ) that formerly existed as a type of sedition in the old Penal Code , was more clearly defined , and other offences of sedition retained . <p> However , the point is that the treason definition was drafted not by this government , or Shameem , but by the Qarase govefrnment . And it was drafted after a full consultation process . <p> Field then went on to attack The Fiji Times and the media for providing " its training facilities to the regime for an Education Camp on Military Decrees " before awarding the " prize for the idiot remark of the day " to Fiji Times managing director Anne Fussell for saying " the media workshop has been invaluable in helping our journalists have a better understanding of the intricacies of the judicial system . " <p> IN FACT , Field 's " camp " was a " workshop " , organized by Fussell and Fiji Broadcasting Corp 's news editor Stanley Simpson and conducted by Shameem , on court reporting by the media , although I have no doubt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Crimes Decree ! ) was discussed because it limits what the media may report before cases are transferred to the High Court without risking contempt of court charges . <p> Field 's remarks on the media are incorrect . They are also very unfair . One might have thought that as a fellow journalist he would have recognized just how difficult it is for Fiji journalists to write stories in the present circumstances -- and just how important it is that they get things right . <p> If it did nothing else , the workshop would have provided an opportunity to discuss matters of concern and interest on the relationship between the media and the law , with Shameem , and with Justice Madigan who , I understand , was also present for one session . <p> Finally , he asked , " Why did n't Fiji journalists simply choose not to go to Shemeem 's School of Indoctrination . They 've done sweet all else . " <p> IN FACT , Michael , it 's Shameem ( not Shemeem ) ; it was a workshop , not a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organized it , not Shameem .

From the school that thinks by virtue of a cushy little number at USP ; completely out of touch from the day to day reality of those struggling in Fiji -- except from an elevated position that allows him to look down and ponder and postulate ; with old- fart paternalistic attitude bording on the " neo-colonial " attitudes his little protoge 's are qucik to try and accuse others of ; he ( and those he 's fooled ) is accorded " expert status " . I note even in this article that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name -- when he 's WELL aware that Field is capable of spelling same correctly . Unfortunately Mr Field may not be an expert in proof reading , but he certainly has a better handle on Fiji and Pacific affairs generally than Walsh will ever have . When one systematically goes through Walsh 's scribe and comments , one is increasingly reminded of a Fox News approach to commentary ( Fair and Balanced ! ) . He may think he 's an expert on Fiji and Fijians and be able to convince others that he is -- except for most people that are the subject of his waffle . And.as for the BSA complaint -- he should know that a precedent has been set by that wonderful organisation that has become a joke and that few now take seriously .

Rabuka was thrust into a situation that was thought to be well above his depth ; at some stage he decided to take control of the political game that had rationalized the 1987 coup . And the fact that he successfully swam through it for 12yrs has to be credited to the man . <p> That journey , which was initially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , called for the continuous plotting of a path for his political purpose once he decided to stay on . This is where the real legacy of Rabuka lies . He created a web of lies , a complex facade of truth to keep the aggrieved , angered and self-righteous hordes out and continue to appease the hungry factions that propped him . Fiji politics , which has largely been Fijian , continued in that vein -- that 's what was being exploited by Qarase and his Gang . <p> Coming back to the issue of forgiveness for Rabuka , no matter what model we apply , two factors stand out as pre-requisites for real forgiveness : the need for truth and repentance . I doubt that Rabuka will ever be able to tell the whole truth ; his lies that beget further lies have entangled and strangled the truth too strongly . That leaves repentance . And that is what nobody can strangle Rabuka with ; he is free to repent in the unending web of his lies . <p> The Now <p> 23 years later much has changed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ renewed at every turn to castigate and ostracise Fiji even from the Pacific fraternity . The un-neighbourly outbursts from Samoa are shocking at best . Any attempt to try to present a non-outraged position on the Bainimarama regime is seen as pro-coup and seditious . Where will the solutions come from ? Do elections guarantee democracy , transparency and accountability in Fiji ? <p> Today marks the 23rd anniversary of the 1987 coup that transformed Fiji 's political landscape from one of smug complacence and acceptance to one of forceful denial of the tenets of democracy and the verdict of the voter through militant advocacy of the unfettered rights of a section of the community that could not comprehend the responsibilities that went with that elevated political positioning and has continued to refuse to accept the same . <p> The trials for Fiji continue . <p> Subhash Appana is an academic and political commentator .

Capital cost = $7000 plus running costs of $700 per month for 12 months = $8400 for total of $16400 or 131 tables for the same amount . Are there 131 outdoor tables in the Octagon ? $700 monthly is a lot to pay for a web-page only service . <p> I think the real question is why has the charge gone up ? An extra $25 per table per year is neither here nor there . $25 may cover one person 's meal and a drink . Given that the Octagon is alive with customers I do n't think the pinch is that hard . I suspect the real reason for the increase is to boost the DCC 's coffers to cover their extravagances . Given the city 's debt overload the council probably has no choice but to cream money from wherever they can get it . <p> Your reporting of figures for fees at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will not realise that the figure of $1488 for an adult burial buys only the burial rights ( the plot ) . This fee does not include the fee to dig the grave ( interment fee ) nor a service fee and these must also be paid so the total new fee for an adult burial is actually $3192 . The price used to be $2579.56 , so this is an increase of $612.44 . <p> Let 's get rational here . On 12 tables it 's about 1.5 coffees per week . Businesses in the Octagon are utilising public space for their own benefit . The $125 per table fee , considering the square meter-age these tables ( and occupants ) take up , is a fraction of the cost to lease the same space in a commercial premise . The council is very considerate in keeping the fee low .

On land the frustrations from the race track can continue into the beer tent and then into the crew accommodation . Just how does a boat owner deal with all of this stress along with getting their boat to the start line and back to the berth without having a world war on the foredeck ? <p> Down in Australia , Quantum Victoria managing director , a veteran of 17 Hamilton Island regattas and crew boss and mainsail trimmer for the Victorian boat , Scarlet Runner , 45-year-old David Eickmeyer , shares his experience in how to manage crews competing in a week-long , intensive , highly competitive event . <p> What is the defining point when it comes to managing teams at regattas ? You ca n't treat every different personality the same . The key is break out the different personalities and to treat them differently . Whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any team sport , you definitely need to break out the different personalities of people and treat them individually . <p> What are those different personalities ? In business coaching personalities are classified into four different types . Firstly there is D or dominance . This is a person who is to the point , decisive and bottom line orientated . These people tend to be independent and results driven . They are strong willed people who enjoy challenges , taking action and immediate results . <p> The second type of personality is I or Influence . They are optimistic , outgoing and tend to be highly social . They prefer participating on teams , sharing thoughts and entertaining others . <p> The third personality is S for steadiness . Empathetic and cooperative , these people tend to be team players and supportive and helpful to others . They prefer being behind the scenes working in consistent and predictive ways . They are often good listeners and avoid change and conflict . <p> The last one is C for conscientious . They are concerned , courteous and correct . These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plan ahead , consistently plan for accuracy and want to know how and why . <p> Can you have a cross-over between personality types ? Yes , definitely . To put all that in perspective , For me , when I walk into a shop , I want to know how much it is , I want to know how many colours it comes in and when can I have it . I am a high D which is a dominant person where I know my wife is an S. <p> When she walks into a shop she wants to know how many different models . She wants to know was it built in Australia , how many colours , does she have to wait long for it , what are the individual parts made up of and where do they come from . <p> Different people have different personalities and different approaches towards different things . <p> Scarlet Runner <p> David Eickmeyer <p> Where has your experience in different types of personalities come from ?

Look at sporting teams -- AFL , VFL teams -- they are use this type of thing to work out how their team players respond to different types of coaching . <p> How long have you had business coaching at Quantum ? At Quantum Melbourne we have been involved in coaching for a couple of years . Our business is changing and everyone needs to think outside the square . We are all trained here .

There are some people who are highly strung on boats and others who are just happy to be a part of a team whether that is sitting on the dock with an esky waiting for the boys to finish their day 's racing . Others need to be involved in the day to day running of the boat or tactics or steering or trimming . Everybody has a different role on a boat . Different personalities fit different roles better . <p> Your in Hamilton Island and about to step out on your boat for a week-long event .

If it comes to a team meeting situation then you need to be honest and say ' right oh boys , you and you have a clash , you and you do n't . You and you should pair up better in a room ' . <p> Regattas are definitely at the top end for the rate of attrition so you need to pace the team and you need to be quite involved with the team and manage them , no different to a business . <p> Basically you can say the skipper or owner of the boat is the leader . He 's the business man . He 's the boss . He really needs to manage his team , his crew for the week .

Is it to have fun or is it to get results ? If it is to have fun , well , we need to structure our week in a different way . But , if it to get results , we need a team meeting to say this is our plans for the week so people can plan around that whether we are having dinner at 7pm every night or a drink at the room at 5pm or whatever it is . <p> The team need to be briefed on what they can expect for the week . I then organise crew dinners just to keep people together and keep them out of the pub , keep them out of trouble .

For someone causing a disturbance within the crew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the start of the week , John , for example , is appointed by the boat owner as the crew boss for the week . If you have a problem , take it to him . He will then take it to the owner and together they will sort it out and they will give you a response . <p> Generally , I will say there is going to be a crew boss for the week . Take all problems to the crew boss , not to the owner so that the owner can have fun and can concentrate on dealing with what he has to deal with because there is plenty of stuff . The crew boss can basically settle the person down , quiet chat with him and basically deal with the problem . <p> Dave Eickmeyer of Quantum Sails was driving today as the boss was on ' Etihad Stadium ' .... - Entire Group Cock of the Bay <p> What is the best kind of person to be a crew boss ? I think an influential person who is quite social and quite to the point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a way that won/t just be pushed aside . A guy that is going to follow up and monitor the situation . <p> What is your worst experience with managing crews ? One experience I had in past years was where there was really no structure set up in the crew , that is , there was no crew boss , nobody really leading the team . The crew were living together and some of them got quite upset and starting making a disturbance among the others . So the bad feelings spread throughout the crew . <p> In hindsight , if there had been some sort of structure set up such as a crew boss , they could have nipped it in the bud on the first day and the crew would have lived happily and harmoniously ever after . But it left a bad taste in a lot of people 's mouths . The fact that ( a ) it happened and ( b ) it was n't dealt with . <p> Reflecting on that , it is important to have some people management job roles among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ briefing of the day , appoint your crew boss . If anyone has issues , whether it is lack of fun or too much fun , they can go to this person and say look I have a problem -- someone to go to help deal with a problem . <p> Your final words of advice ? A regatta is no different to running a business . You have to set a set of goals with the end in mind then work back from there . It 's about sticking to the plan and the result will be what you wanted .

It proposes to raise the current threshold to harmonise it with that of other international regulators . <p> The FEI said of the key anti-inflammatories used with horses : " The List Group has unanimously concluded that the science available from the few limited studies carried out to date on the use of NSAIDs is contradictory and provides insufficient evidence for allowing levels in competition that are not a potential threat to horse welfare or enhance performance . " <p> The FEI said the new list would allow low doses of phenylbutazone and flunixin between competitions for the well-being of the horse , but only to the extent that the medications will neither be detectable nor affect the performance or welfare of the horse at its next competition . Nor should any levels be detectable at competition time . <p> The FEI said each of the substances named on the proposed Equine Prohibited Substances List for implementation in 2011 were agreed unanimously by List Group members . <p> " It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ required rest and medication , ensuring that there is a good approach to management and training , rather than relying on medication to effect a recovery , " the FEI said . <p> The FEI Executive Board reviewed the issues involved and will recommend the adoption of the List Group 2011 Equine Prohibited Substances List by the General Assembly and the Bureau . <p> It noted that the proposed approach would also have the benefit of being compatible with certain national laws across a number of equestrian nations . <p> National federations have now received the data needed to make a fully informed choice on whether to accept or reject the proposed 2011 Equine Prohibited Substances List in November . <p> " If the 2011 list is not approved , the 2010 list presently in effect would remain in use for another year .

( Photo by Thakur Ranjit Singh . ) <p> Pacific Scoop:Report -- By Thakur Ranjit Singh . <p> Just mind-blowing and magnificent -- these are the terms that sum up the Waitakere Diwali at Trusts Stadium on Sunday 24th October , 2010 . The Stadium , with seating , temporary chairs , standing and sitting was choc a block with some 5000 attentive people witnessing the grand stage Ram Lila performed by the students of Waitakere Hindi School . This perhaps is the largest indoor Diwali celebration in the southern hemisphere , if not in the world . <p> The stage play Ram Lila , based on life of Lord Ram from Hindu epic Ramayan , was preceded by the traditional aarti ( welcome ) song , followed by the New Zealand National anthem on the accompaniment of Harmonium and tabla , ( Indian twin-drum ) first in Maori followed by the English version . <p> The formal ceremony saw the Chief Guest , Ethnic Affairs Minister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the diversity in New Zealand and assured the Westies that Waitakere Diwali would remain an icon of the West Auckland , even in the Super Auckland City . <p> With what was witnessed in the Waitakere Diwali function , Auckland will be poorer if such community based functions become a victim of the increased bureaucracy and politicians ' whim of centralisation . As was witnessed , each of Auckland 's localities has their cultural uniqueness which should be retained to magnify the rainbows silhouetting the cultural landscape of Aotearoa . This was shining from the background of the magnificent Waitakere Ranges on a beautiful Labour Weekend at the Trust Stadium in Henderson . <p> The day 's programme saw involvement of youths through Bollywood schools dance competition in which nine schools in primary , intermediate and high school categories took part , with the overall first prize going to the visitors from North Shore , Kristen College . <p> The stage play , Ram Lila , which retains the uniqueness of Waitakere Diwali , was the star attraction .

With weeks of dedicated rehearsals and mastering of the sound recording and scene selection , the final result was a deliverance that made some overcome with pleasant emotions because of the devotional chaupaais ( quadruplets ) from Ramayan sung in the traditional tunes of the yesteryears and the narration that depicted the purpose and the origin of Diwali . <p> While all this was in Hindi , the pin drop silence added credence to the adage that music is universal- you need not understand the language to catch its spirit . Nevertheless , the screen has subtitles in English . The large number of non-Indian Kiwis and the diversity within the audience enjoyed the theme and tradition of Diwali still maintained and retained at Waitakere Diwali . <p> This does not mean that those with more contemporary taste were left disappointed .

At the peak of events at around seven in the evening , the complex had some fifteen thousand people around the event while the rolling crowd during the day would have exceeded twenty five thousand . <p> That is the extent to which an icon of Waitakere City Council and that of Waitakere , still managed by a community group , Waitakere Indian Association , with blessing of its loyal supporters , were able to deliver a memorable and hugely successful event that reflected the diversity of New Zealand and gives the reason to the Super City why community based events should not only be encouraged , but emulated in other parts of Auckland . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organisations , which appreciate their respective cultures and traditions , are best suited to organise such events in partnership with the local government which should allow the community to sit in the driver 's seat when organising such events .

The environment is n't stationary . What we do to the water and soil on this farm affects others downstream and even the methane our stock exhale contributes to global warming . " <p> On a sunny day , the view from the top of the farm is breathtaking , but a brisk cool breeze is a reminder that the wind turbines standing on the Tararua ranges opposite are there for a good reason . <p> It has been a tough winter for the couple , who , with stock manager Mike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ romney ewes and 220 angus cows . <p> Because of its closeness to the hills and with naturally heavy soils , the farm is summer-safe and , even in the worst of the recent droughts , a three-month dry spell was only " uncomfortable " . <p> But it is not winter-safe . Ewes went into winter in reduced condition on low pastures after a dry autumn . They did not improve through the cold , sunless days and constant wind that followed . When they lambed in September , new- born lambs struggled in day after day of cold rain and wind . <p> They lost 1100 of the 5400 lambs born . By the end of docking the lambing percentage was just 103 per cent when it should have been 140 per cent . <p> " It was abysmal , one of the most trying winter and spring periods I can remember , " Mr Perry says .

Some of its customers are Telecom , NZ Post , ASB , NZ Customs Service , Ministry of Justice , Fletcher Building , Southern Cross , Placemakers and Waikato District Health Board . <p> Power issues <p> The big issue that all datacentre providers are facing now is power density , the ability to support increasingly energy-intensive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " People are concerned about how much power is being used and how much they are going to have to pay for it , " he says . <p> Having shorter cable paths , more efficient generators and UPSs will help , but in order to make more radical changes to efficiency you need some sort of non-conventional cooling technology , that uses the environment to create the cooling , he says . Datacom 's Orbit facility in Auckland uses air from outside as a cooling medium . <p> " When we are operating in that mode , the conventional air conditioning in the datacentre does n't even run , " he says . " This works in Auckland , because the climate and humidity is appropriate for this , but it does n't work everywhere . " <p> Maxnet has been continually upgrading its two datacentres in Auckland and Christchurch for the past five years , says Maxnet CTO , Derek Gaeth . A recent improvement is the replacement of its older UPSs with brand new UPS gear , which the organisation expects will save $70,000 to $100,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , M&amp;C Saatchi , Yarrows and Trustpower . <p> UPS efficiency , for example , has gone from 80 percent efficiency to more than 94 percent , giving quite significant savings , he adds . <p> Maxnet is now working to increase density in its facilities . Traditionally , customers have bought a full rack of hosting -- and would require that full rack to hold the equipment . Now , thanks to virtualisation , the same customers only need half a rack . <p> " We are actually encouraging our full rack customers to go to half a rack , so we can double density in our datacentres and become more efficient , " says Gaeth . <p> Shipping-container solution <p> Microsoft has recently developed its G4 ( Generation 4 ) datacentre that is a shipping container with up to 2500 servers inside . <p> " Literally , all you need is a concrete block and power to plug it in . You do n't even need water , " says Bradley Burrows , product manager of Windows Server &amp; Tools , Microsoft New Zealand . " So you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretty fast . " <p> These mobile facilities are all about using the natural environment to run -- they use outside air to cool the systems and solar cells for power . <p> " It takes one guy to build an entire container with 2500 servers , and have it up and running in four days , " says Burrows . " It is just phenomenal . " <p> It is a huge shift from the older datacentres where you had to build a massive piece of infrastructure , he says . <p> Datacentre management tools have also developed immensely , says Burrows . Hotmail , for example , which has more than 200,000 servers , has one engineer for every 35,000 servers today . <p> " You would n't be able to do that without having really good , scalable and remote tools for the job , " he says . <p> Microsoft is taking on the cloud space with its Azure offering . But the software giant has no datacentres locally . <p> " That could be in the future , " says Steve Haddock , business group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Our main datacentres are in Singapore , the US and Ireland . " <p> Microsoft has 15 datacentres around the world , adds Burrows . With Azure , it does n't matter where in the world the servers are , because a lot of the services it provides are web-based , he says . But if a customer is running a full infrastructure for a customer , including desktop and virtual infrastructure , they need to be local , he says . An organisation could completely outsource its infrastructure , using a local hosting company , which could back-end some of its services into Azure , he adds . <p> Safe storage <p> But how secure is cloud computing ? And is it safer to have your data hosted here rather than overseas ? Datacentres are becoming hubs for cloud computing , which raises the bar of what is required in datacentres , says Datacom 's Matheson . <p> " Customers expect cloud services to be very reliable , " he says . <p> In the past six months , Datacom has deployed cloud nodes in all of its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ redundancy is built into the environment . In October , Datacom had an interruption to its cloud service , caused by a simultaneous hardware failure . The primary device failed and the back-up device also failed . <p> " In this particular case , it is difficult to see how the environment could have been made more resilient , " says Matheson . <p> Maxnet also recently had an outage , due to an alleged fault by a vendor . <p> " It was very unfortunate , " says Gaeth . " The design we run in our virtual environment is the highest redundancy design you can possibly build , " he says . <p> The design was jointly created by Cisco , VMware and Dell . <p> Maxnet has started a full audit of the incident and has also improved its ability to see trends and catch errors like this one earlier , says Maxnet CEO John Hanna . <p> None of the datacentre providers spoken to feel threatened by overseas players such as Amazon and Rackspace that offer cost-effective , scalable services . <p> For local banks and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ security issues with using overseas providers , says Matheson . <p> " And if something goes wrong , who do customers call ? " he asks . <p> Maxnet has actually won customers over from the likes of Rackspace , Gaeth claims . Some of Maxnet 's customers run 24-hour , critical applications out of the datacentres and need a high-availability provider , he says . The SLAs that some of the international hosting companies provide are also relatively low , Hanna suggests . <p> EMC works with its customers to design the next generation datacentres , says EMC country manager Arron Patterson . Customers include Gen-i , Datacom , ANZ , ASB , Vodafone and Telecom . Power and cooling are top of the list of its customers ' issues , he says . <p> " A lot of the datacentre space was allocated five to 10 years ago , " says Patterson . " With the amount of compute capability that is going into some of these facilities , it is getting very dense . " <p> These datacentres are using a lot more power and producing a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with , he says . This has led to customers looking for new datacentre space and more efficient ways of doing things . <p> Converged infrastructure <p> Hewlett-Packard has done a lot of work in the area of converged infrastructure , which unifies individual stacks of storage , servers and networking into a single virtualised environment , says Trevor Armstrong , country manager of enterprise servers storage and networking , HP New Zealand . A properly structured datacentre helps enable businesses to focus on innovation and driving growth , he says . <p> Customers that are looking to use services from a datacentre provider should do their research first . Check the reliability and security of the datacentre and the reputation and stability of the vendor , says Datacom 's Matheson . <p> " Datacentres that are built on top of public carparks and datacentres in multi-tenanted buildings -- they are not really that secure , " he says . <p> Revera 's Cockayne believes there are a number of companies currently in the market that are making claims they are not ready for . <p> " If a company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , make sure you see the evidence of that , " he says . " A lot of people have been caught short by the trend to bring things to datacentres .

@@1717238 <h> Singapore still the science all-star <p> UNESCO has just produced its report on science for 2010 and a brief chapter details the recent shake-up of the New Zealand science system with a number of graphs benchmarking us against our neighbours in the Asia Pacific region . <p> The report 's overwhelming theme is of an increased focus on science among emerging countries that is beginning to challenge the domination of the traditional " scientific triad " of the US , Japan and Europe , who have traditionally been the world leaders in research and development and scientific projects . <p> One of the big measures used in the report is gross domestic expenditure on R&amp;D and on that count , China , India and Korea are raising Asia 's game : <p> Led mainly by China , India and the Republic of Korea , Asia 's share increased from 27 to 32% between 2002 and 2007 . Over the same period , the three heavyweights , the European Union , USA and Japan , have registered a decrease . In 2002 , almost 83% of research and development was carried out in developed countries ; by 2007 this share had dropped to 76% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to GERD is considered . Between 2000 and 2007 , the private sector share of R&amp;D spending , as a proportion of GDP , saw a sharp increase in Japan , China , Singapore and especially the Republic of Korea , while it remained stable in Germany , France , and the United Kingdom and even saw a slight decrease in the Russian Federation and the USA . <p> In our part of the world -- UNESCO includes New Zealand and Australia along with the Pacific islands in the same group as many nations of South East Asia , we are doing pretty well . New Zealand and Australia account for just five per cent of the population in the region , but nearly half of its total GDP . Traditionally the bulk of scientific expenditure comes from those two countries as well as the bulk of scientific output . But that is changing and at a swift pace , largely driven by Singapore and to a lesser extent Malaysia and Thailand . The table below gives some of our key measures against others in the region . <h> Singapore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really paid off for the country according to UNESCO : <p> Singapore is one of the few countries in the region with a net inflow of scientific personnel , both from the region and from other scientifically advanced economies . There is growing evidence that Singapore is becoming central to global knowledge hubs in fields such as biomedical science and information technology ( IT ) . A big challenge for Singapore will be to maintain the present inflow of human capital in order to underpin sustained knowledge-based development over the next decade , even as the rapid growth of the Indian and Chinese economies is stimulating demand for skilled personnel in these countries . <p> Singapore produces more patents than New Zealand and across the border in Malaysia , scientific developments are also gathering pace : <p> Malaysia registered less than half as many patents as New Zealand in 2001 but matched it by 2006 and moved ahead in 2007 . <p> In that respect its good to see announcements like the one this week from New Zealand 's Health Research Council , that detailed a new scientific collaboration with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up by the HRC and Singapore 's Agency for Science , Technology and Research for cancer research .

Subject to the industry 's support , it would be implemented immediately . <p> Labour has argued the disease might not have arrived if the Government had not made cuts to frontline biosecurity staff . <p> Carter has denied this , but today said the Government was " looking at the way of the future for the management of biosecurity incursions " <p> HOW FAR WILL THE MONEY STRETCH ? <p> $50 million should be enough to tackle 700 hectares of affected orchards , says Zespri . <p> Around 180 hectares of orchard land in the Bay of Plenty , Hawkes Bay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be affected . <p> Up until Tuesday night , the disease was thought to be confined to Te Puke , known as the country 's kiwifruit capital . <p> But yesterday came the news that it had been found in Hawke 's Bay and other parts of Bay of Plenty , and in green-fruit vines . Then Carter revealed infestations had also been found in Motueka and Golden Bay in the South Island . <p> Zespri director of corporate and grower services Carol Ward said in some infected orchards only one or two vines are affected , and in others a wider area of vines has PSA so it is hard to put firm numbers around how far $50m will stretch , but 700ha is the estimate at this stage . <p> PSA has been confirmed on 37 green and gold fruit orchards since the alarm went up 13 days ago , with the number expected to rise as results from tests on many thousands of samples taken from suspect orchards by the Ministry of Agriculture come in . <p> GROWER MEETINGS <p> Orchardists in the country 's main @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ details of the joint Government-industry proposal to aggressively contain the disease in the $1.5 billion industry .

Zespri is the main marketer and exporter of New Zealand kiwifruit . <p> Growers are expected to support the plan , which is likely to be ratified by industry leaders tomorrow night . Details of the action plan would be made public after ratification , Ward said . <p> There are three broad elements to the discussions with growers , she said . <p> Those with PSA leaf spotting would be expected to prune their vines back . Where PSA symptoms have progressed , growers would be asked to remove the plant to the stump and set a buffer zone around infected areas . <p> The second element is the proposal to use some of the $50m to compensate growers who have to remove vines or cutback their plants , Ward said . <p> " It 's about recognising the individual burden they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ industry .

I would propose that there is not one person in Christchurch who would say , " Yes , we need another shopping mall " , especially one that will be five minutes from Northlands and 12 minutes from The Palms . However , if this Styx Mill development proceeds the viability of these centres will come under pressure , and long term all will struggle due to the lack of sensibility with the proposed investment . <p> There are 23 main shopping centres in Christchurch and this is not counting all the smaller corner centres dotted throughout the city .

There are empty sites in town ready for development , the city centre needs a boost and the developer could be offered rates rebates , planning cost discounts and other incentives . Why build a major shopping centre out of town when you can build it where it is most needed : the city centre . I am not proposing we vilify this developer for wanting to invest his money in our community , not at all .

Resource consents , heritage considerations , not forgetting the onerous development and reserve contributions all make it difficult to invest in the city centre .

The incentive needs to be so attractive he would give it serious consideration .

The cost of any incentive would pale in comparison if it has the potential to strengthen our community and take us into a more positive future . <p> Our city centre has come under pressure from the ever-expanding suburban sprawl , suburban shopping centres and the decentralisation of office space to the suburbs .
