@@4532240 for a smarter , safer drive <p> As far as technological showcases go , there 's nothing like bombing them to bits with an absolute flood of tech -- there 's certainly enough of that in the BMW ConnectedDrive arsenal , covering a staggering number of topics . Our earlier story focused on the communications , infotainment and personalisation aspects , already impressive in its breadth and scope , and now , it 's the turn of the driver assistance-related systems , many of which merge into the Efficient Dynamics domain , and these are no less notable in both amplitude and presence . <p> Full story after the jump . <p> Active assistance for parking <p> Park Distance Control , no stranger to all , is moving forward , and actively . A new , extended version of the parking aid called Active PDC , which uses a three-stage intervention strategy ( based on speed limitation , appropriate adaptive braking and braking to a complete stop ) is the next step in offering greater protection from parking bumps and scrapes . <p> Active PDC offers the familiar visual and auditory feedback regarding the remaining clearance in front of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the vehicle 's surroundings , the four ultrasound sensors at the front and rear of the vehicle are assisted by the laterally positioned sensors of the Park Assist system . During the parking manoeuvre , Active PDC limits the speed of the vehicle to 5 kph , and as an obstacle appears in the predetermined sensing range , the system reduces the speed of the vehicle down to 1 kph as the gap decreases . <p> If there 's a risk of hitting the object , the system initiates abrupt braking of the vehicle to a complete stop , taking into account the vehicle 's direction of travel and the steering angle . The system also primes the brake system in advance to further reduce response times -- by braking or applying the accelerator , the driver can override or reinforce the function at any time without deactivating the system . <p> Park by remote <p> Not too confident of parking your car in a garage ? Get Remote Controlled Parking to do it for you . The system can perform an entire parking manoeuvre -- in this case forward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fuss , and you do n't even have to be sitting inside the vehicle . First presented by the company in 2006 , the system has been improved on and refined -- the new prototype of this system is capable of parking in any garage , even an unfamiliar one , without the aid of a reflector . <p> A driver planning to park in a narrow garage or a confined parking space simply gets out of the vehicle and activates the automatic parking manoeuvre using the vehicle key -- RPC takes control of the acceleration , braking and steering functions and manoeuvres the vehicle autonomously into the narrow garage , or out of it again . The parking manoeuvre is activated by pressing a specific sequence of buttons within a set time limit , and the driver must remain in the immediate vicinity of the vehicle throughout . Activation of the system simultaneously locks the vehicle , switches on the parking aid and the dipped headlamps and folds in the exterior mirrors . <p> The previous prototype featured a camera and reflector , but the current one uses the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ultrasound sensors of PDC and Park Assist systems , the vehicle slowly moves forward into the garage at around 2 kph , aligning itself centrally between and parallel to the walls on either side . Necessary steering corrections are performed by the power steering system motor , and the control unit also works the engine Auto Start-Stop function , the gear selector and brake system . If there 's an obstruction , the sensors order an automatic stop and the hazard blinkers come on to signal that the operation has had to be aborted . If it 's all clear , the system completes the parking manoeuvre , brakes to a standstill and changes to selector position P. <p> Safety 's the big thing -- whether going in or out of a garage , the last button in the sequence must remain held ; if the button is released , the car stops immediately . For the exit procedure , if the driver 's door is not opened within a given time limit , the system automatically shuts off the engine and locks the vehicle . There 's also a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the case of the BMW 5 Series prototype , a maximum of seven metres . And with the law in many countries making it illegal to start the engine from outside the vehicle or to move the vehicle if the driver is n't at the wheel , this one needs more than just tech to get going . Seeing it in action is quite the adventure . <p> Improved pedestrian protection , with the help of cameras <p> While cars have become a safer place for occupants , the vulnerability of other road users , namely pedestrians , has n't changed . Hence the need to go beyond passive protection , and preempt things before they get nasty . Pedestrian recognition with warning was added to the Night Vision system three years ago to help combat early morning and late night mishaps with pedestrians , and now BMW is developing a more proactive pedestrian protection system . <p> Here , pedestrians are detected using a camera . The camera-based pedestrian protection system is based on a detection and warning algorithm which detects potential pedestrian accidents using a sequence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't new on this , of course -- Volvo is the first off the block commercially with its Pedestrian Detection system as seen in its new S60 ; that one is also camera-based and works in tandem with auto-braking , operable at speeds up to 35 kph . <p> The system here is essentially similar . First comes the acute warning stage , which as with the Night Vision system , warns the driver of potential risks by means of visual and auditory signals -- usually , the pedestrian will still be far enough away from the vehicle for the driver to be able to avoid a collision by taking evasive action or by braking . In parallel with this warning , the braking system is primed so that it will be able to deliver more braking power more quickly . <p> If it 's no longer possible for the driver to react in such a way as to avoid an accident , the system moves on to automatic braking . The driver can reinforce the system 's intervention by braking , but can also override and cancel the automatic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emergency braking , lasting no more than 600 milliseconds at most , takes place as late as possible , in order to prevent unnecessary activation . <p> It 's called AHB , in short <p> On the vehicle-vehicle front , Active Hazard Braking takes things further ; at speeds of 80-130 kph , the research prototype uses autonomous braking to avoid an accident . In the current prototype , laser scanners and radar sensors pick up vehicles and obstacles up to around 160m in front of the car and up to 20m on either side . Additional radar sensors monitor the area up to 150m behind the car . <p> To ensure that situations are recorded as accurately as possible ( to prevent misreading of say , a situation where the driver is merely preparing to overtake another vehicle ) , the sensors not only record the distance and speed to the vehicle in front , they also determine overlapping , acceleration differences and the time in hand in relation to all relevant vehicles within the detection range . They also monitor the entire area around the car , including @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ check whether an evasive manoeuvre would be an alternative course of action <p> Again , at the first hint of impending trouble , the car first alerts the driver to the hazardous situation with a warning signal , flashed up on the Head-Up Display but also delivered in audible and tactile form -- if there 's no reaction and an effective evasive manoeuvre can not be had , Active Hazard Braking intervenes to slow the vehicle automatically , with the degree of stopping power graded as the situation demands to the point of emergency braking . It 's this anticipatory strategy that gives AHB a capability far beyond that of the emergency braking systems currently available , the company says . <p> Work is currently being carried out to integrate the distance to the vehicle behind the car into AHB 's activation strategy , with the aim being to reduce the risk of rear-end collisions caused by the car braking rapidly and the vehicle travelling behind it failing to take the appropriate braking or evasive action in time . The system can tailor the braking strategy in such a way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the vehicle behind suitable warning of the car slowing . <p> Helping to avoid side-on collisions <p> For this one , there 's a new driver assistance system that goes by the name of Lateral Collision Avoidance ( LCA ) , a further developement of Narrow Passage Assistant , a driver assistance system which helps the driver to follow the optimum central line along roads narrowed by roadworks . <p> The LCA is pretty much an extension of the Lane Change Warning System , which monitors the driver 's blind spot . The system , which features ultrasonic sensors positioned at the front and rear of the vehicle flanks to monitor the sides of the car , works on all roads with at least two lanes -- the sensors monitor an area on either side of the car measuring anything up to four metres , depending on the car 's speed . In the current research prototype the system works up to speeds of 130 kph , though the speed band is surely to be extended . <p> If another vehicle enters a predefined area around the car , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and if the other vehicle closes to within a critical distance , the alert symbol becomes a warning , accompanied by a slight steering impulse that suggests to the driver to immediately move away from the danger . Tests show this form of feedback -- which can be overidden -- to the driver is immediately and intuitively understandable . <p> Look ma , no hands ! Not <p> Sure , you 've got the likes of Active Cruise Control with Stop &amp; Go function ( ACC Stop &amp; Go ) , which not only maintains the desired distance to the vehicle in front but can brake the car down to a standstill in heavy traffic . But how about if the car could also actively control the steering , especially in more mundane situations such as traffic jams and queues ? <p> That 's what the Traffic Jam and Queuing Assistant project is all about -- a car that can think and steer , from standstill up to 130 kph . The system extends the reach of ACC Stop &amp; Go to include a lateral guidance function -- the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the steering . Further development of camera tech enables the car to anticipate the path of the road ahead on the basis of the road markings and automatically carry out minor corrections in its line . <p> However , there are limits to how much steering work is possible -- automated driving is n't yet achievable -- or desirable -- through tight corners , so if a corner is too tight or the system reaches its limits due to insufficient road markings , the system prompts the driver to take over full driving duties again and switches off . The system , which complements the proximity control function of ACC by actively introducing steering inputs to correct the car 's line , is only active when the driver has his hands on the steering wheel . Hands off and the system automatically deactivates . <p> So why would one want something like this around ? Well , up to certain speeds , this would allow the driver to work on emails or call up multimedia applications , though whether this is a good thing or not is another thing altogether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Back on the pedestrian front , transponder-based systems such as AMULETT and Ko-TAG are helping to prevent contact between a vehicle and a pedestrian in the first place , especially in situations where pedestrians are concealed from view ( coming out from behind a parked car , for example ) . <p> The AMULETT research project ( a mouthful less than the full term , which is ' Active mobile accident avoidance and mitigation of accident effects through cooperative data acquisition and tracking technology ' ) demonstrates " car-to-X " communication to improve pedestrian safety -- a vehicle communicates with a wireless transponder worn or carried by the pedestrian or cyclist . <p> It works by transmitting a query signal by the vehicle , which the transponder then replies to with an identification signal . The system evaluates this reply , from which it is able to calculate the distance between the vehicle and the transponder , along with the angle of incidence of the signal , and it can also identify the type of road user . The EMV signal is evaluated by a 2.4 GHz multi-aerial system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ based on the time lapse between transmission and reply , the system calculates the distance between vehicle and pedestrian on an echo time principle , offering a range of well over 100m in an unobstructed environment and around 20m if the pedestrian is concealed . <p> Yet again , the system works as mentioned earlier -- detecting a potential collision situation , the driver gets a visual warning via the HUD as well as the central information display , and if he fails to react the warnings escalate right through to automatic emergency braking as a last-resort means of preventing a collision . <p> Working hand in hand with Ko-TAG <p> The findings of the AMULETT project are being taken further as part a research initiative called Ko-FAS -- Cooperative Vehicle Safety , which is being carried out by BMW and 18 partners from throughout Germany . This will comprise development of a protocol to support system functionality in complex scenarios , along with further miniaturisation and industrialisation of the transponder . <p> Whereas at the start of the AMULETT project the transponder was still roughly the size of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ size of a small cigar box . In future , Ko-TAG transponders , as they are known , will shrink further still , and may soon even fit into a walking stick or inside a small compartment in a school bag . <p> A number of collateral issues exist . For example , the transponder can not work without a reliable power supply . Also , reliable and interference-free data transmission requires a dedicated wireless frequency . Currently though , no frequencies are available , and it 's unlikely that any frequencies will be freed up for this type of safety function . Additionally , a transponder can only protect individuals who actually wear or carry it , so a stated project objective is to find ways of integrating the transponder to allow a wide as possible deployment , for example in mobile phones , school bags or running shoes . <p> Stopping safely when there 's no more driver control <p> Imagine the scenario and the ramifications : a car is travelling on the outside lane of a busy motorway when the driver suffers a heart attack and is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stop Assistant to combat any untoward mishaps that will undoubtedly come up in such a case . <p> It 's an assistance system that activates an autonomous driving mode when it detects that the driver has a serious medical problem , and carries out a controlled emergency stop . In simple terms , the car switches on the hazard warning lights and manoeuvres carefully -- taking into account the traffic around it -- to the outer edge of the road , before drawing to a standstill . At the same time , an emergency call is sent out containing the data required to initiate the necessary medical and traffic-related assistance measures . <p> The ESA system is in place in a research prototype . In the test vehicle , a heart attack can be " simulated " at the touch of a button on the steering wheel . The technology then takes over full control of the car , keeping the car on the move within its lane and maintaining a safe distance to the vehicle in front , before eventually moving onto the hard shoulder -- changing lane several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Secure pinpointing of the vehicle within its lane and , above all , the reliable recognition of all vehicles and objects in its immediate area is achieved by bringing together various sensor technologies such as LIDAR , radar and camera recording on all sides of the vehicle as well as GPS , and the vehicle uses at least two different measuring principles in each direction to clearly establish its position . <p> The system pulls back from initiating a lane change if the manoeuvre will impede another driver . Only when it 's possible to change lanes without creating danger does the vehicle move into the new lane . On a test run in Munich , I got to sample the system 's workings , and it was plenty impressive , the car avoiding other vehicle mules used to depict moving traffic and working its way to a stop , safely and surely . Ford has something along the same lines , though that one uses a heart rate monitoring seat . Eventually , that system 's overall workings are n't going to be very different than the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end it <p> There were many other technologies on call at the Connected Drive showcase , of which I 'll just run through a couple very briefly in summing up this rather lengthy discourse . <p> One of them is called the Green Driving Assistant , which offers drivers a tool that also tells them their fuel consumption over each route and helps them to select one which will burn less fuel . It 's also able to calculate if the vehicle has sufficient fuel in the tank to reach the desired destination with the current driving style and route . A learning phase of around 500 km is all that is required to produce an adapted , vehicle- and driver-specific value which can be used by the GDA each time the driver is planning a new route . <p> The other is predictive navigation , in which artificial intelligence is used to teach the pathfinders how to learn .

A 3 Series converted by research engineers into a prototype has been able to predict -- through its IleNa system -- with a high level of probability ( 80% ) where a journey is heading and which route has been chosen , without the driver inputting the information in advance . <p> To make the required predictions , the navigation system first has to get to know the driver and his regular routes . A secure profile is created for each driver in which past journey history is recorded . This will include not only destinations , short cuts and rat runs used en route , but also information such as the time of day and seat occupancy . Much of the data absorbed by the intelligent navigation system is useful not only for individual drivers , but for every user on the network .

Just last week , the Nissan Leaf was named the Japanese Car of the Year for 2011-2012 at the prestigious Tokyo Motor Show , a first for EV in the award 's 32-year history . <p> A quick survey shows dozens of new EV models will enter the market in the next two years not as prototypes or trial vehicles , but actual commercial production models . Mitsubishi will be delivering its much touted MiEV to the North American market next year , after selling them in Japan for a while . Nissan 's Leaf is already on sale in major markets like the United States and Japan ( in fact , the entire year 's production has already been sold , and it is concentrating on deliveries now ) . At least 10 EV models have been approved by the British government to qualify for special rebates : the Mitsubishi i-MiEV , Peugeot iOn , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Tata Vista , Vauxhall Ampera , Chevrolet Volt , Toyota Prius Plug-in Hybrid , and Renault Fluence ZE . <p> Malaysian EV : Proton 's Exora REEV is targetted to hit the local market in early 2013 . <p> Closer to home , the Singapore Government is evaluating the feasibility of EV by test-bedding five Mitsubishi MiEVs and four Daimler smart electric drive vehicles . The trial started in June and will go on well into 2013 . Both normal and quick-charging stations have been deployed centrally for convenient access . " The purpose of the EV test-bed is to gain a better understanding of EV technologies , business models and user preferences which will give us more information to determine the feasibility of using EV in Singapore , " said Chee Hong Tat , chief executive of the Singapore Energy Market Authority , in a media statement . <p> The drive to go electric is a natural one , given that energy efficiency has been roundly promoted as one of the many solutions to the problem of global warming caused by rising levels of carbon dioxide generated from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attracts attention due to it being a major user of energy . Various parties are pushing for higher fuel economy standards in this sector , and EV fit nicely in the equation . <p> Zero emissions <p> When measured on a " tank-to-wheels " basis , EV are roughly three times more efficient than cars running on internal combustion engines , and the motors consume no energy when the car is stationary . However , the picture is not so rosy when looking at the " well-to-wheel " efficiency , While electric and hybrid cars have reduced tailpipe carbon emissions , the energy they consume is sometimes produced by means that have environmental impacts . For example , the majority of electricity produced in the United States comes from fossil fuels ( coal and natural gas ) , so the use of EV there is far from being carbon-neutral ( or even low-carbon ) . In fact , the efficiency of the latest petrol and diesel engines ( like those that are Euro VI-compliant ) can match the efficiency of EV in most countries , with roughly comparable CO2 emissions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burning fossil fuels . <p> But putting aside the life-cycle analysis perspective , EV do make a difference . They offer virtually noise-free driving ( too quiet , in fact , for some people , who argue that EV are dangerous for hearing-impaired pedestrian as they can not hear one approaching ) , zero emission at the tailpipe and in some cases , a sense of independence from fossil fuels ( if one charges his car using electricity generated from his rooftop solar photovoltaic installation , for example ) . <p> Some of the largest obstacles for EV include heavy and expensive batteries , relatively long charging times , and the lack of charging infrastructure . And without massive subsidies , EV are just way too pricey for the masses . <p> Naturally , proponents of EV technology argue that there is no time to waste , even as matters such as the above are being sorted out . The British government appears to be one of the most aggressive in rolling out EV , with official sanction for the Plugged-In Places ( PIP ) programme to install vehicle recharging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government will match the funding raised by a consortia of businesses and public sector partners to support the installation of EV recharging infrastructure in strategic places . <p> In Japan , a consortia called Better Place concluded a trial on switchable-battery electric taxis in Tokyo at the end of last year to discern driver behaviour as well as consumer acceptance . The project focuses on the feasibility of battery switch as means for taxis to have extended range . " There has been very little information about how an EV battery will perform under heavily-used , real-world , taxi conditions . This programme has provided us with critical insights into the battery performance in a switch model and switch station performance for the toughest customers -- taxi drivers , " said Kiyotaka Fujii , President of Better Place Japan , in a press release . <p> To introduce Malaysians to its electric car , Mitsubishi has put its i-MiEV on a roadshow . <p> EV in Malaysia <p> Though Mitsubishi Motors Malaysia registered the first ever EV here this year ( a MiEV that is based on its i-MiEV model @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ introduce EV here comes from national car company , Proton , which introduced a fleet of trial vehicles in Putrajaya in September , consisting of three range-extended Exoras ( Exora REEV ) and five fully-electric Sagas . The test fleet will eventually be enlarged to 200 Exora REEVs and 120 Saga EVs next year , with the intention of commercial production by 2013 . However , the trial is restricted mainly to the government sector , and there is no avenue for public participation , unlike in Singapore , where incentives are given to those who want to contribute data to road trials . <p> In any case , Proton 's trump card should be the Exora REEV , which it said will help overcome " range anxiety " -- the fear of being stranded should the battery runs outs . The Exora REEV has a tiny petrol-driven generator to top up the battery whenever it runs low . It can also be charged if the driver can find a wall socket or charging point , as opposed to the Saga EV , which runs purely on batteries . Range-extended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will solve the interim problem of a lack of battery charging infrastructure , said Datuk Zainuddin Che Din , project director of Proton 's green tech department . <p> Officials from the Energy , Green Technology and Water Ministry , Proton and Tenaga Nasional Bhd have visited several countries , including Britain , to observe how the charging infrastructure is developed . According to Zainuddin , current laws forbid anyone other than TNB from selling electricity to end-users . The successful introduction of EV here will depend greatly on the availability of a wide network of charging stations . Charging an EV is not as simple as plugging it into a domestic power socket ( though that is possible ) as there are safety considerations . EV owners will be advised to install a proper charging outlet using industrial-spec sockets and connectors . <p> " EVs are actually quite simple . The main components include an electric motor , controller ( electronics ) and battery . There is no oil tank , fuel tank , and there are no spark plugs or oil to change , " said Zainuddin during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ EV partner , Frazer-Nash , in Surrey , England . <p> In fact , the first automobiles were electric and invented in the 1830s before the internal combustion engine became popular .

They assert that since these cars typically have half the moving parts of conventional internal combustion engines , lower maintenance cost can be expected . <p> Electric vehicles are zero-emission only if measured at the tailpipe . EVs at the moment are nowhere near being carbon-neutral , unless the electricity used for recharging them comes from renewable resources . <p> " For example , by using the electric motors to brake ( or regenerative braking ) , your brake pads last longer .

An EV will cost a lot less to run , even if there is a premium to be paid to own the car , " said Gordon Dixon , Frazer-Nash 's director for regional operations . A specialist in EV drivetrains , Frazer-Nash is Proton 's technical partner for its upcoming range of EVs . <p> Better engines <p> Going electric is not the only way to save Earth , though . While waiting for alternative technologies like the hydrogen fuel cell vehicle ( actually another form of electrification ) and EV to mature , there is belief that the average fuel economy of vehicles running on existing internal combution engines can be improved by at least 50% by 2050 , relative to 2005 levels . This belief is best encapsulated in the 50by50 Campaign ( 50% improvement by 2050 ) that is driven by the Global Fuel Economy Initiative ( GFEI ) , a multi-sectoral effort to promote fuel efficient vehicles . Launched in 2009 , GFEI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Transport Forum , the International Energy Agency and the United Nations Environment Programme . <p> GFEI thinks that the bulk of the gains can actually be made in developing countries such as Malaysia as well as other non-OECD countries , where the number of cars are growing at the fastest rate , and to a lesser extent , in OECD countries . ( OECD or the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development is a grouping of 34 countries founded in 1961 to stimulate economic progress and world trade . The bulk of OECD members are developed economies like the United Kingdom , Britain , France , Germany , Australia , Japan , and South Korea . ) <p> According to GFEI , the average fuel economy ( measured in litres per 100 km ) of new cars in OECD countries can be improved 30% by 2020 and 50% by 2030 at either low or zero cost . The good news is that much of the savings can be achieved by improvements to the internal combustion engine , the conventional engine that burn either petrol , diesel or compressed natural gas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the main additional measures would be full hybridisation of a much wider range of vehicles ( possibly including , but not requiring , plug-in hybrid vehicle technologies ) . Vehicle technology is changing rapidly and more cost-effective technologies are likely to emerge in coming years , increasing the potential and lowering costs further , " said GFEI on its website ( globalfueleconomy.org ) . <p> " Many of the improvements are achievable using existing , cost-effective , technologies . The technologies required to improve the efficiency of new cars 30% by 2020 and 50% by 2030 , and the efficiency of the global car fleet 50% by 2050 , mainly involve incremental change to conventional internal combustion engines and drive systems , along with weight reduction and better aerodynamics , " said GFEI . <p> The European Community , for example , will very soon adopt the Euro VI standard for diesel vehicles , which will spur the creation of ultra-efficient clean diesels . Malaysia , sticking to the antiquated Euro II for diesel , is only beginning to experiment with B5 biodiesel , a mixture consisting of fossil-derived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for sulphur reduction in our diesel is only 5% at most ( corresponding with the percentage of palm oil ) , improvements in air quality is not expected to be significant , if at all . <p> While recognising that EV can result in further carbon dioxide reductions and oil savings if they succeed in achieving mass-market commercialisation , GFEI noted that the actual contribution of electric vehicles will depend on the provision of low-CO2 electricity by the electricity generation sector , otherwise it is just akin to transferring the pollution from the tailpipe to the power plant smokestack . <p> A quick look at TNB 's generation mix show a less than ideal situation , with half of the electricity currently being generated by burning coal . The percentage of fuel oil and distillates that are burned for power is also very substantial for this year , given a severe reduction in the supply of natural gas for power generation from Petronas . And so , driving an EV right now is actually not doing any real favours to the environment when viewed from a carbon footprint perspective . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lower carbon sources like hydro , nuclear or renewable sources , then EV can take one step closer to being a form of low-carbon commuting .
