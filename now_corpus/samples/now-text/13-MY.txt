Instead , they prefer to leave matters to chance . <p> This situation is quite prevalent among many parents who are still refusing to even consider vaccinating their children with PCV . <p> The spectrum of diseases caused by pneumococcus is largely preventable , and as such , wilfully denying your child this vaccination might mean toying with the fine line between life and death . <p> It may not be a well-known fact , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best antibiotics , once an unprotected child is infected by pneumococcus , modern medicine may not be able to save his/her life . <p> It is not too late to vaccinate older children who have not received this vaccine before .

@@4601230 <h> An unwavering dedication to Singapore - Heng Swee Keat <p> Published : 17 September 2013 8:14 AM <p> The first time I met Lee Kuan Yew in person was in March 1997 , when he interviewed me for the job of Principal Private Secretary ( PPS ) . His questions were fast and sharp . Every reply drew even more probing questions . <p> At the end of it , he said : " Brush up your Mandarin and report in three months . We have an important project with China . " <p> I realized later that , among other things , it was perhaps when I replied " I do n't know " to one or two questions that I made an impression . With Lee , it is all right if you do not know something . But you do not pretend and lie if you do not know . Integrity is everything . <p> I had the privilege of working as Lee 's PPS from mid 1997 to early 2000 . This was the period of the Asian Financial Crisis , and Lee was writing his memoirs . <p> Lee 's world views are comprehensive and consistent . Three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The first is about Singapore 's place in the world . His view is that a small city state can best survive in a benign world environment , where there is a balance of powers , where no single state dominates , and where the rule of law prevails in international affairs . <p> A small city state has to stay open and connect with all nations and economic powerhouses . To prosper , Singapore has to be relevant to the world . We must be exceptional . <p> Second : His views about human nature , culture and society . Human beings have two sides to our nature -- one that is selfish , that seeks to compete and to maximize benefits for ourselves , our families , our clans ; the other that is altruistic , that seeks to cooperate , to help others , and to contribute to the common good . <p> A society loses its vigour if it eschews excellence and competition ; equally , a society loses its cohesion if it fails to take care of those who are left behind or disadvantaged . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between yin and yang , is one that has to be constantly recalibrated . Within a society , those who are successful must contribute to it and help others find success . We must share the fruits of our collective efforts . <p> Third : His views about governance and leadership . As a lawyer , Lee believes deeply in the rule of law and the importance of institutions in creating a good society . But institutions are only as good as the people who run them . Good governance needs leaders with the right values , sense of service and abilities . It is important to have leaders who can forge with the people a vision for the future and to forge the way forward . <p> Above all , leaders are stewards . They should develop future leaders and , when their time comes , they should relinquish their positions , so that the next generation of leaders can take us to greater heights . <p> His favourite question : " So ? " <p> While Lee 's world views are wide-ranging and widely sought , when I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how his views are so coherent , rigorous and fresh , and how he put his agile mind in the service of the Singapore cause . <p> Lee 's favorite question is " So ? " If you update him on something , he will invariably reply with , " So ? " You reply and think you have answered him but , again , he asks , " So ? " This forces you to get to the core of the issue and draw out the implications of each fact . <p> His instinct is to cut through the clutter , drill to the core of the issue , and identify the vital points . And he does this with an economy of effort . <p> I learned this the hard way . Once , in response to a question , I wrote him three paragraphs . I thought I was comprehensive . Instead , he said : " I only need a one sentence answer , why did you give me three paragraphs ? " I reflected long and hard on this , and realized that that was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Minister , it was critical to distinguish between the strategic and the peripheral issues . <p> Persuasive , but also persuadable <p> On my first overseas trip with Lee , Mrs Lee , ever so kind , must have sensed my nervousness . She said to me : " My husband has strong views , but do n't let that intimidate you ! " <p> Indeed , Lee has strong views because these are rigorously derived , but he is also very open to robust exchange . He makes it a point to hear from those with expertise and experience . He is persuasive , but he can be persuaded . <p> A few months into my job , Lee decided on a particular course of action on the Suzhou Industrial Park , after deep discussion with our senior officials . That evening , I realized that amid the flurry of information , we had not discussed a point . I gingerly wrote him a note , proposing some changes . To my surprise , he agreed . <p> One-man intelligence agency <p> Lee 's rich insights on issues come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reads widely , but he does so like a detective , looking for and linking vital clues while discarding the irrelevant . <p> Once , he asked if I recalled an old newspaper article on United States-China relations . I could not -- this was several months back and I had put it out of my mind -- but a fresh news article had triggered him to link the two developments . <p> I realized that he has a mental map of the world where he knows its contours well . Like radar , he is constantly scanning for changes and matching these against the map . What might appear as random and disparate facts to many of us are placed within this map and , hence , his mental map is constantly refreshed . <p> A senior US leader described this well -- Lee is like a one-man intelligence agency . <p> Every moment about Singapore <p> The most remarkable feature of the map in Lee 's head is the fact that the focal point is always Singapore . I mentioned his favourite word , " So ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " So , what does this mean for Singapore ? " What are the implications ? What should we be doing differently ? Nothing is too big or too small . <p> I accompanied Lee on many overseas trips . The 1998 trip to the US is particularly memorable . Each day brought new ideas and , throughout the trip , I sent back many observations for our departments to study . It might be the type of industry that we might develop or the type of trees that might add colour to our garden city . <p> This remains his style today . His every waking moment is devoted to Singapore , and Lee wants Singapore to be successful beyond his term as Prime Minister . <p> From the early 1960s , he already spoke about finding his successor . During my term with him , as Senior Minister , he devoted much effort to helping then-Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong succeed . <p> He refrained from visiting Indonesia and Malaysia as he wanted Mr Goh to establish himself as our leader . Instead , he fanned out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and investors that Mr Goh 's leadership would take Singapore to new levels of success . <p> As Senior Minister , he worked out with Mr Goh areas where he could contribute , and I will share three key projects that not only illustrate his contribution but , more importantly , how he develops insights and achieves results . <p> Single-minded about results : Suzhhou <p> The Suzhou Industrial Park project was one of the areas in which Mr Goh asked Lee to stay actively involved . Two years into the project , we ran into teething problems : Local Chinese officials promoted their own rival park . <p> Some felt that such startup problems and cultural differences were expected and would be resolved over time . But Lee drilled deep into the issues and held many meetings with our officials . He worked with intensity that I did not expect of someone who was then 75 years old . <p> He concluded that the problem was much more fundamental . China had ( and still has ) a very complex system of government , with many layers and many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interests of the various groups at the local levels were not aligned with the objectives that the central government in Beijing and Singapore had agreed upon . Unless this was put right , the project would not go far . <p> Instead of hoping that time would resolve this , Lee raised issues at the highest levels and made the disagreements public . He was unfazed that going public could diminish his personal standing . <p> He proposed to the Chinese , among others , two radical changes : To swap the shareholding structure so that the Chinese had majority control , and to appoint the CEO of the rival park to head the Suzhou Industrial Park . Lee was proven right -- the changes created the necessary realignment and put the project back on track . <p> Next year , we will be witnessing the 20th anniversary of the Suzhou Industrial Park . From all accounts , it has been a success story , not just in its development , but also in how it has enabled a new generation of leaders from both sides to develop a deeper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for further collaboration . <p> I learned a valuable lesson . If things go wrong , do not sweep them aside . Confront the problems , get to the root of the difficulties , and wrestle with these resolutely . Go for long-term success , and do not be deterred by criticisms . <p> Adversity into opportunity : Financial crisis and reforms <p> My second example , on the revamping of the financial sector , shows how Lee is constantly looking out for how Singapore should change , and how he turns adversity into opportunity . <p> The 1997/98 Asian Financial Crisis hit the region hard . Many analysts attributed it to cronyism , corruption and nepotism . Lee read up on all the technical analyses and met with our economists . I was amazed at how , at the age of 75 , he would delve deeply into the issues . <p> He concluded that the reason was more basic -- investors ' euphoria and the weak banking and regulatory systems in the affected countries had allowed a huge influx of short-term capital . These weaknesses had their origins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but was not the cause . Years later , many bankers would tell me that Lee 's analysis was the best they had heard . <p> Lee was convinced that though Asia 's economic growth would be set back temporarily , dynamism would return . In the short term , we had to navigate the crisis carefully but , for the longer term , we should turn this adversity into opportunities . While investors fled , we should use the crisis to lay the foundation for a stronger Singapore in a rising Asia . <p> Lee took the opportunity to review the long-term positioning of Singapore 's financial sector . With the permission of then-Prime Minister Goh , he met experts from different backgrounds as well as the chairmen of local banks . <p> An act of boldness <p> For years , Lee had believed in strict regulation and in protecting our local banks . While this protected the banks from the crisis , it had its cost . Our stringent rules , while appropriate in the past , were now stifling growth , and the banks were falling behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to change . <p> I was struck by his systematic and calibrated approach . His reputation is that he is impatient for results , and drives a fast pace . This is true , but he is also wise in distinguishing between things that change slowly and things that ought to change swiftly . Instead of one big bang , he was in favour of a series of steps which added up to a significant shift of direction . <p> Lee discussed with and sought Mr Goh 's approval on a broad plan to revamp the financial sector . Mr Goh agreed with the plan , and later appointed then-Deputy Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong as Chairman of the Monetary Authority of Singapore ( MAS ) in January 1998 . Lee Hsien Loong did a review of major policies and reoriented the MAS ' organizational culture . Remarkably , within a few years , the MAS was transformed . By 2006 , when I became Managing Director of the MAS , I inherited an organization with a new set of regulatory doctrines and a deeper pool of talent . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We not only withstood the shock , but also emerged stronger after the crisis . Singaporeans ' savings were well protected and businesses recovered rapidly . <p> If Lee had not initiated the changes in the late 1990s and sought to turn adversity into opportunities , we would not have become a stronger financial center today . To prepare to open up our financial system in the midst of one of the worst financial crises is , to me , an act of great foresight and boldness . <p> Advocate for collaboration <p> My third example relates to how Lee expanded our external space by being a principled advocate of collaboration , based on long-term interests . Today , we are remarkably well-connected , but this did not come by accident . Over the years , Lee has worked hard at this . <p> His strategic world view has projected Singapore onto the global stage and created opportunities for Singaporeans . In all his years as the face of Singapore , Lee also made fast friendships with senior world leaders who appreciate his view of things and respect Singapore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ driven home to me at two meetings . In 1999 , relations between the US and China were very tense . China 's negotiations with the US on its entry to the World Trade Organisation ( WTO ) had failed , there were tensions between the two countries over US bombs that had hit the Chinese embassy in Belgrade , and President Lee Teng Hui in Taiwan had pronounced his " two states " concept . <p> In July 1999 , US Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and Chinese Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan were in Singapore for the ASEAN Regional Forum . It was quite tense , and many of our officials believed there could be a flare-up at the forum . Both figures met Lee separately . <p> Lee gave each side his reading of their long-term strategic interests . His advice to the US was that it was not in their interest to be adversarial towards China or regard her as a potential enemy . To China , he suggested that it should tap into the market , technology and capital of the US to develop its economy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of cooperation , such as China 's entry into the WTO . <p> Sitting in these meetings , I was struck by how Lee approached this delicate situation . He did not say one thing to one and sing a different tune to another . If they had compared notes later , they would have found his underlying position inconsistent . <p> What made him persuasive was how he addressed the concerns and interests of each side . I could see from the way both reacted that his arguments struck a chord , and one of the guests asked a note-taker to write the notes verbatim for deeper study later on . In 2000 , a few months after this meeting , I was very pleased to witness China 's entry into the WTO at the Doha meeting . <p> The pragmatic idealist <p> What is Lee like as a person ? The public persona of Lee is a stern , strict , no-nonsense leader . But deep down , he is energized by a deep sense of care for Singaporeans , especially for the disadvantaged . <p> He does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policies speak louder , and he is content to let them speak for themselves . He distributed the fruits of Singapore 's progress in a very significant way , by enabling Singaporeans to own their flats . Apart from the investment in education , he donated generously to the Education Fund to provide awards , especially to outstanding students from poor families . <p> He is a firm advocate of a fair and just society . But he demands that everyone , including those who are helped , put in their fair share of effort . <p> Many regard Lee as a pragmatist who does not hesitate to speak the hard truths . I think he is also an idealist , with a deep sense of purpose . He believes one has to see the world as it is , not as one wishes it to be . Fate deals us a certain hand of cards , but it is up to us to make a winning hand out of it . Through sheer will , conviction and imagination , there is always hope of progress . <p> Man is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ embraces Confucianism because of its belief in the perfectibility of man . No society is perfect either , but a society with a sense of togetherness can draw out the best of our human spirit and create a better future for our people . <p> He is , to me , a pragmatic idealist . <p> A close-knit family <p> During my term as PPS , the Prime Minister of a Pacific Island nation asked to call on Lee . Given his very tight schedule , I thought Lee would not be able to meet him . To my surprise , he said he would make the time . <p> He explained that this young Prime Minister 's father had been a comrade-in-arms , fighting the British for independence , and he owed it to his father , who had passed on , to offer whatever advice might be useful . <p> Lee and his family are closely knit , and he was particularly close to Mrs Lee . On overseas trips , I had the opportunity to have many private meals with Mr and Mrs Lee . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tooth , and Mrs Lee would , with good humour , keep score on the week 's " ration " . <p> But when it came to official work , they drew very clear lines . Mrs Lee travelled with him whenever she could . Once , in Davos , she came into the tiny room where Lee was giving a media interview . She found a stool in a corner and sat there , listening unobtrusively . Twice , I offered her my more comfortable seat near Lee . She said to me : " You have work to do . I am just a busybody -- do n't let me disturb you ! " <p> Mrs Lee was supportive without intruding -- she was certainly not " just a busybody " , and anyone who had the chance to observe them together would know just how close a couple they were , and how much strength her presence gave to her husband . <p> An unwavering dedication <p> We live today in a different world that demands of us new ideas and approaches . But there is one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to , aspire towards : His unwavering and total dedication to Singapore , to keeping Singapore successful so that Singaporeans may determine our own destiny , and lead meaningful , fulfilling lives . <p> Singapore 's survival and success are Lee 's life 's work and his lifelong preoccupation . History gave him a most daunting challenge -- building a nation out of a tiny city state with no resources and composed of disparate migrants . He cast aside his doubts , mustered all his being and has given it his all . <p> His most significant achievement is to show the way forward in building a nation . There were , and still are , no textbook answers for achieving this . Lee and his team analyzed the issues from first principles and had the courage and conviction to do what was right and what would work for the country . <p> Lee is an activist .

@@4601231 <h> Nam Ron 's Psiko Pencuri Hati : Form over content <p> Nam Ron , a graduate in theatre , made his first feature-length digital movie , GEDEBE : Siapa Bunuh Caesar ? ( Gangsters : Who Killed Caesar ? 2003 ) . It was based on his own stage play that was staged at ASWARA from where he graduated . The film carried the tagline : Suara Anak Mudah Tentang Masyarakatnya ( The Voice of Youth about Society ) . Produced by Amir Muhammad and lensed by James Lee , the film had fledgling actors who are now respected names in the industry : Hariry Jalil ( as Caesar ) , Zul Huzaimy ( Brutus ) and others like Sofi Jikan . The film 's story was an exploration of the numerous controversies ( involving UMNO , Mahathir and Anwar Ibrahim in the late 1990s ) with a premise related to a quote from Mahathir who in turn quoted Brutus in Shakespeare 's JULIUS CAESAR : " It 's not that I love Caesar less but that I love Rome more " . I 'm still trying to figure this out ( ! ) but it was in relation to someone ( was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disagreed with it . <p> The introduction to the story illustrated Nam Ron 's disdain of politicians and their shenanigans . He had two groups of punks and skinheads ( that 's how bad he thinks they are ! ) setting up chairs , then there is a disagreement and a free-for-all fight ensues . It 's not difficult to decipher what chairs here mean . They are related to politicians scrambling to get into parliament using whatever means they may have including violence . <p> Nam Ron followed this up with GADOH ( 2009 ) co-directing it with Brenda Danker . Again Nam Ron introduced new actors such as Zahiril Adzim &amp; Amerul Affendi who have since made it in the industry . The film was a Chinese versus Malay ruckus in a secondary school all due to prejudice arising from misconceptions . Needless to say , it was banned by the Censors . But when it was shown at HELP University to a full-house audience made up of Chinese and Malays , it certainly did not turn out to be ' a threat to national security ' . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after the screening was an intelligent discussion .

It starred Bront Palarae who brilliantly played a paedophile , a condition brought about by childhood abuse . This childhood trauma thingies resurfaces in PSIKO PENCURI HATI -- a case of Nam Ron 's subconscious repressions resurfacing unconsciously perhaps ? <p> His next film JALAN PINTAS ( 2012 ) posed a question , the same one posed by P.Ramlee in many of his films : Why are the Malays who have succeeded not helping those who are struggling ? If it happened in the time when we were colonised , why is it still happening when that we have ( supposedly ) attained to independence ? What are we really independent from and is there something wrong with the system and who is responsible for it ?

Got get it ! <p> With his first cinema feature PSIKO PENCURI HATI now showing in the cinemas , Nam Ron continues to build on his previous films ' ideas and then takes it a little further . His guns ( like James Lee in SINI ADA HANTU ) are now trained on the Malaysian film audience . The clue is in the title itself ( affirming &amp; negating ) and in the final scene of the film a few credits have scrolled up . The hero ( Bront Palarae ) and heroine ( Sharifah Amani ) and the hero 's mystery friend ( Amerul Affendi ) appear in a visual style opposite to that of the film just seen .

@@4601237 generation Honda Accord <p> LAST week , the ninth generation Honda Accord made its debut in Malaysia . It brings to the table a host of new improvements from its last iteration , becoming much more efficient and desirable than ever before . What is more significant is the fact that Honda Malaysia have opted to assemble it locally , pricing it significantly lower than most of its rivals in the process . Does Honda 's new flagship sedan have what it takes to shake up the segment ? <p> IT is now a brave new world when it comes to the D-segment cars market here in Malaysia . No longer is it an exclusive field for Japanese manufacturers , having evolved in just a few short years into a highly contested field . <p> New offerings from Korea and Europe have entered in this m ? l ? e . Prices may vary among the many choices but if there is one unchanged constant here it is the fact that two Japanese-made models will always stand as the most ' default ' of choices in this segment . <p> Naturally , the Honda Accord has always been one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ninth incarnation , the Accord has been around for more than three decades , and it seems to have aged rather well with each new generation . <p> The 2013 model reinforces our statement and it looks ready to compete on a higher level within the segment . As previously reported , the new Accord is now slightly smaller in size having its front-to-rear length shortened by 80mm and wheelbase length reduced by 25mm . <p> It is also sits 5mm wider and 10mm lower than the last , giving that sleek new design a bolder stance as a result . Though the exterior has shrunk slightly in size , Honda have managed to increased space within the cabin , creating more passenger leg and headroom , as well as enlarging the boot space in the process . <p> In our eyes , the car is still pretty big in size , but it is no longer the segment 's largest-sized vehicle , a place occupied by its predecessor . Both the entry level 2.0 VTi and mid-range 2.0 VTi-L variants share the same powertrain , which happens to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SOHC four-cylinder engine . In Thai specifications as we tested here , it generates 153hp and 190Nm of peak torque . <p> Next comes the brand new Earth Dreams Technologies 2.4litre i-VTEC DOHC four-cylinder , powering the range-topping 2.4 VTi-L variant . This marks the first time Honda introduces the Earth Dreams engine in Malaysia , developing a healthy output of 175hp and 225Nm of peak torque . <p> Only five-speed automatics are available for both engine options , but the range-topping 2.4-litre variant is further primed with steeringmounted paddle-shifts . <p> Overall , the powertrain options available had good points and not so good when we drove it around Phuket . Firstly , the 2.0-litre engine has a decent level of power delivery , but it does feel a tad bit sluggish even with the transmission in ' S ' mode and the accelerator floored . <p> In said process , the car 's gearshift smoothness is reduced drastically , not to mention the excessive engine roar intruding into the cabin past the 5,500rpm mark . It feels much more suited on a cruise instead , a typical trait @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ variant on the other hand tells a different story . The larger capacity engine and twin camshafts really make the difference , giving a much more dynamic and effortless power delivery compared to the 2.0-litre variants . <p> Complimenting this further is the transmission 's sheer smoothness during shifts , and the fact that the steering-mounted paddle-shift give much better control over the gears when needed . <p> Though five-speed does not sound like much , we found the transmission ratios engineered for the 2.4-litre mill felt well matched and it wins big points with us for this . Bad traits aside , here are some of the really good ones . <p> Honda claims that the 2.4 VTi-L 's Earth Dreams engine is capable of an average fuel consumption rate of just 8.2 litres/100km as rated by the NEDC . Adding to this further , both the 2.0litre and 2.4-litre are now equipped with Honda 's Econ Mode button and functions , and its driver Eco Assist functions in the instrument panel . <p> Unlike its rivals , we believe it is much easier for anyone to achieve efficient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the clear visual aids from the Eco Assist functions . <p> The same sounds of praise can be said with the way the Accord handles and drives . The car rides on a new chassis featuring front MacPherson struts in place of its predecessor 's front double wishbone assembly . <p> It may sound like a step backwards , but the move has helped reduce the Accord 's overall weight and chassis vibrations , and the results can clearly be felt . Damper settings were optimised for comfort , effortlessly soaking up road bumps and impurities , giving us a very pleasurable drive . <p> If you push this car hard enough , the typical front-wheel-drive understeer will show itself and the car 's body roll becomes more apparent . But for most of the time in regular driving , the standard electronic driver and safety aids keep those in check , making this new Accord an easy car that anyone can drive . <p> Confidence behind the wheel also comes from knowing that the Accord is laced with much of the badge 's signature safety electronics as standard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2.0litre variant 's steering felt too light as if it has no weight at all to it . The fact that it feels very vague , having almost no feedback whatsoever , does not improve it , but it does deserve credits for ease of usability . <p> Meanwhile , we prefer the steering system in the 2.4 as it feels better weighted and possesses a more dynamic trait compared to the 2.0litre 's system , not to mention the decent levels of feedback it gives as well . <p> Yet , we feel that the best of any D-segment car lies in its cabin 's amenities and features . That being said , the Accord seems to check all the right boxes in the right place . First thing to note here is the revamped centre console and dashboard layout , drastically improved from the previous model . <p> It is now much neater and more pleasing to the eye , having the number of buttons reduced . The features list on the other hand has also grown and includes several new highlights . <p> A keyless entry and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , followed by more premium options such as intelligent dualzone air-conditioning with rear seat vents , driver and passenger seat electric adjustment , and a multi-angle reverse camera , just to name a few . <p> However , our favourite item in this premium options list has to be the lane watch camera . Using a camera mounted on the left-side wing mirror , the system displays your blind spot on the i-MID screen and it is triggered every time the left signal stalk is engaged . <p> You could also opt to keep the system turned on constantly instead , and we reckon this will greatly aid in reducing blind spot collisions . We only wished the system was also available for the overtaking or right side of the car as we believe that most blind spot collisions happens here . <p> In terms of improvement , the Accord is light years ahead of its predecessor and has given us a very positive first impression . There are few flaws for us critique and we strongly believe it has what it takes to challenge most of rivals here . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we test the Malaysian-spec car on our roads under our weather conditions . The new ninth generation Accord is now available at authorised dealers nationwide in Malaysia . <p> As it is locally assembled in Honda 's Malacca plant , prices are a relative bargain . The entry-level 2.0 VTi variant retails starting from RM139,800 , a good RM3,000 reduction from its predecessor 's starting price . <p> The mid-range 2.0 VTi-L , on the other hand , starts from RM149,800 , while the range-topping Earth Dreams-powered 2.4 VTi-L costs RM172,800 . <p> Prices include Honda 's five year unlimited mileage warranty plan , as well as its six free service plans alternating with paid services up until 100,000km . Value for money in this segment could not get any better .

The food of her native land was really the food of individual regions that through the ages had been independent , sometimes hostile , and certainly not prone to mimicking their enemies ' cuisine at the family dinner table . <p> She made it her life 's work to preserve and innovate recipes that reflected the best of regional cooking in Italy and in the process introduced legions of Americans to the true foods of her native land . <p> A straight-talking cookbook author and teacher , Hazan died on Sept 29 at her home in Longboat Key , Florida , said her husband @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ failing health for several months . <p> Hazan , who was born in a small Italian fishing village on the Adriatic Sea and moved to New York City in the late 1950s after her marriage , was revered in the food world and beloved by home cooks , who found her earthy advice to be bracing and her recipes to be both doable and delicious . <p> Julia Child once called Hazan " my mentor in all things Italian . " The New York Times ' Craig Claiborne , who discovered Hazan when , as she recalled , " my cooking had been simply of the wifely and motherly kind , " called her " a national treasure . " <p> In 2000 she was given the James Beard Foundation 's lifetime achievement award , one of cooking 's highest honours . <p> Hazan 's The Classic Italian Cook Book , published in 1973 , and More Classic Italian Cooking ( 1978 ) were updated and combined into Essentials of Classic Italian Cooking in 1992 .

Along with Child and a few other serious cookbook writers , he said , Hazan " helped lead us away from the all-too-frequently slipshod and compromised cut-and-paste foreign cookbooks of the post-World War II period . " <p> Hazan gave detailed instructions -- often many illustrated pages long -- on how to turn these ingredients into the ravioli al plin , pork loin braised in milk , risotto con funghi e le mandorle and many other dishes that she remembered from growing up in Italy . <p> Hazan did not believe in masking good food with too much seasoning or heavy sauces , dismissing the latter as " wet food .

She once said that " 80 percent of Italian cooking is done in a saute pan . " Even cooking in an oven put her " at a distance .

The couple met in Italy , and Hazan soon found herself married and living in New York , where she tried to please a husband who adored good food . <p> " Victor can cope with many bad things in life , but he can not cope with a bad meal , " Hazan would say . <p> Using a cookbook by Ada Boni , who then set the standard for Italian cuisine , Hazan honed her skills in a small kitchen . <p> When her son was a child , she enrolled in a cooking class given by Grace Chu , who introduced many Americans to fine Chinese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to teach them Italian cooking . She charged US$80 ( RM260 ) for beginner classes in her apartment , a fraction of what her later courses would cost . <p> Word got around , reaching the New York Times ' Claiborne in the fall of 1970 . When he called , Hazan did not know who he was but invited him to share lunch with her and Victor . <p> She prepared tortelloni di biete ( tortelloni with Swiss chard filling ) , spaghetti all'ortolana ( spaghetti with eggplant ) and artichokes Roman-style . Claiborne included the recipes in the story headlined , " There Was a Time She Could n't Cook .

@@4609230 <h> Why speculation is not the reason for high property prices in Malaysia -- Khairul Anuar <p> Published : 22 November 2013 11:03 AM <p> When the government announced Budget 2014 recently , " property speculation " was the bogeyman everybody blamed for the increase in property prices . The spike in the property prices is also blamed for the high household debt experienced by Malaysians . <p> Is property speculation that bad thing it is made out to be ? <p> I personally think property speculation is being blamed for all the wrong reasons . <p> Not all property speculations and property speculators are created equal . " Property " is divided into so many types and categories . There are residential property , commercial property and industrial property to begin with . <p> Then there are the perennial lands with developers buying them to do land banking in which they will later develop . A property developers can also be said to be a type of property speculator as property developers develop property with the hope what they are developing are attractive enough to property buyers . <p> With so many types of property , property speculation is not easy to master @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of property speculators for different reasons . <p> Even if a property speculator concentrates on residential property to speculate on , there are so many types of residential properties to choose from . There are landed property , strata property , gated and guarded property and high-rise property which can be within a well-developed area or a new township . <p> These properties can be developed by well-known housing or first-time housing developers . Each one has a different risk and a different return . <p> All these factors are not as important as how you finance your property purchase . As it is better to use other people 's money than your own money in property speculation to get a better spread on your investment , property speculators always ask banks to partially finance their property purchase for them . <p> For the past few years , banks were not so lenient in giving property speculators the money they needed to finance the purchase of residential property . This is even before the 70% threshold of margin of financing for the purchase of the third residential property which was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the property speculator has a superb credit record . <p> Banks use property valuers to confirm the purchase price of residential property , even for properties purchased from housing developers . Banks were just being prudent and Bank Negara Malaysia , which supervises banks , is known to be very stringent in enforcing such rule . <p> Banks in Malaysia do not follow blindly the purchase prices stated in Sale &amp; Purchase Agreements submitted to the banks even if the purchase prices were agreed beforehand between sellers and purchasers . <p> Property valuers for banks always factored in the market and transactional values of properties within the area , where the purchased property is situated , before confirming the purchase price . <p> Many times the purchase prices of the purchased property were intentionally overvalued by the seller . <p> I contend that property speculation is not the reasons for the rise in property prices and to proof that point , here are a few other reasons , which are not exhaustive : <p> When the government set the bar for affordable housing to be at the maximum of RM400,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that amount so as not to seem they are selling affordable housing and be in competition with the government itself . <p> As the government promised more than a million of such houses to be built by so many government-linked housing developers within the next few years , most private housing developers thought they might as well cater to those who can afford properties at a higher prices as they would n't want to compete on the same playing field . <p> The cost of raw material and the imposition of minimum wages are other factors for the rise in property prices although I think most housing developers are just using these excuses to raise the price of houses further . <p> I also believe , unless proven otherwise , the cost of both raw materials and labourers for building an affordable property and high-end property are nearly the same . Many housing developers will also use these reasons to raise the price of property further in the new future . <p> Ditto for all the new measures taken by the government to curb property speculations such as itemised property @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ introduction of Goods and Service Tax , even if it is not applicable to the housing industry . <p> Real property gain tax is also just another cost to be borne by property speculators . Real property gain tax is said to be the reason for the rise in property prices especially in the secondary property market . <p> Real property gain tax for the knowledgeable property speculators is easily circumvented , waited out and even reduced . When the rate for real property gain tax was set at 30% for the first year before the year 2007 ( much like how it will be in 2014 ) property speculations were still rife . Even I , who was then still fresh in property speculation , managed to make a few thousand ringgit in profit although I paid my Real Property Gain Tax dutifully . <p> All property speculators know it is not the price that you pay or the price you sell the property for that matters , but it is about how much you spend and how much returns you make that is the key to making profits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every expenditure have to be factored in . Then you lessen your exposure and use your resources to hold the property in your possession . This is known as your holding power . Hence , whatever the price of property is and whatever outside factors affecting your profit , as a property speculator you factor it in when you buy the property so you can still make some profits . <p> The rising price of property is economy at work -- the working of supply and demand . Malaysia does not have enough property for everyone to own one at an affordable house . <p> With the short supply of property and high demand , the price of property can not be lower than certain prices especially property located near the centre of towns . The solution must come from other factors such as a better transportation grid , which is currently being built , and a lower cost of living . <p> In conclusion , property speculation is not the only thing to blame for the rising prices of property either in Malaysia or anywhere else . So many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we strive to be a developed country , we will attract people from other countries with a more sophisticated property investment horizon . <p> We must learn to cope with our " growing pains " as we grow . However , the government did an important decision by curbing property speculation with the few measures introduced in Budget 2014 . If not , Malaysians are phased out totally from owning any property in big cities . -- November 22 , 2013 . <p> * Khairul Anuar Shaharudin is a lawyer , author and entrepreneur . <p> * This is the personal opinion of the writer or publication and does not necessarily represent the views of The Malaysian Insider . <p> Please refrain from nicknames or comments of a racist , sexist , personal , vulgar or derogatory nature , or you may risk being blocked from commenting in our website .

The Thirteenth Tale was a gothic masterpiece of highly rewarding complexity , with a beautifully embroidered narrative , and the power to awe . <p> Seven years is a long time between a smash-hit debut and its follow-up , but it has finally arrived , and with inevitably lofty expectations .

But that 's like saying The Beatles were a fairly good band . You 're not expecting " fairly good " with Setterfield . Not after The Thirteenth Tale . <p> Bellman &amp; Black is as atmospherically dark and brooding as her debut , but it is a less interesting and more straightforward outing into the Goth-land of Setterfield 's imagination ; it 's missing the secrets , twists and turns , and the brilliant narrative trickery of The Thirteenth Tale . <p> Worse , the story is derivative and the characterizations are weak . Reading Bellman &amp; Black reminded me of reading Alex Garland 's underwhelming The Tesseract , which followed his stunning 1996 debut , The Beach . In both cases , I thought : " What happened to the author ? The flame is still there , but why is it so much dimmer ? " <p> After a third novel , also underwhelming , Garland shifted medium and become a screenplay-writer of considerable renown . What does the future hold for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unleashed in 2006 . But back to the present , and to the product in hand . <p> Bellman &amp; Black 's protagonist is William Bellman , who , as a boy of 10 , made a bet with his chums that he could hit a crow with a stone from his catapult . As his missile arced through the air , Bellman realised in a fraction of a second that he did n't actually want to kill the creature . But he won the bet -- unfortunately for the crow , and , as the following chapters reveal , unfortunately for him . <p> This single incident foreshadows the rest of his life -- crows and rooks become reoccurring and ominous motifs through the book . <p> Bellman 's adult life starts well . He marries the girl of his dreams , sires a large loving family , and discovers in himself a natural aptitude for business . <p> Indeed , the Bellman-the-businessman aspect of the book overly dominates , thereby diminishing its entertainment value . Page upon page delivers detailed information on retail transactions , outsourcing , vendor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Victorian England . <p> But this being a Gothic novel , the Grim Reaper is never far away .

Then his own children die . Then his wife . Eventually he ends up with just a single loved one , his favourite child , Dora . <p> As the years crawl by , William becomes a kind of doppelg ? nger of Charles Dickens ' most famous creation , Ebenezer Scrooge of A Christmas Carol . While becoming obsessed with work and the bottom-line , Bellman reminds us of what money can and can not buy . Duly a morality tale emerges , with a fairly simple equation at its core : compassion and love always trump business , profit-and-loss , and financial gain .

These seem to be too ephemeral to really spook . More chilling are the crows that flit through these pages , making us wonder if the young Bellman would have had an entirely different life if he had missed with his catapult all those years ago . <p> In life as in fiction , one random act can change everything forever . This powerful message does add philosophical heft to Bellman &amp; Black . <p> The Thirteenth Tale took Charlotte Bront ?

@@4611239 <h> ' Penang 's RM200m profits from selling govt lands ' <p> But the Penang CM hits back at Chua Tee Yong by saying that the previous BN administration sold more land in the state . <p> UPDATED <p> PETALING JAYA : MCA has hit out at the Penang government for resorting to selling land to amass hundreds of millions of ringgit last year , saying that it was a short-term solution that came at the expense of the state 's citizens . <p> MCA Young Professionals Bureau Chairman Chua Tee Yong said the move not only created unsustainable income for the government , but had also deprived Penangites of affordable homes . <p> " In long term , the state government will be richer but the people will be poorer . This is because state government earns their income from selling land but the people grow poorer as they need to pay a higher price for home ownership , " said Chua in a statement today . <p> He said developers would raise housing prices to cushion the hefty sum they paid for the government land , and this would ultimately force home-seekers in Penang to shoulder the extra cost . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prices in Penang to increase .

Lee Chong Wei tops the bill as expected in the men 's category , with almost US$300,000 in cash while double Olympic champion Zhao Yunlei takes the most lucrative spot in the women 's category thanks to her incredible run in both mixed and women 's doubles events this year . <p> Photos : Badmintonphoto <p> The statistics reveal clearly that the Asians are very much on top of the chart as only one European is in the top 10 -- Christinna Pedersen(photo) , ranked 7th with US$127,596 .

Her partner Joachim Fischer Nielsen stands at #21 with US$72,888 won in 2013 while the first singles European shuttler , Jan O Jorgensen , comes in at #31 . <p> China , as expected , is the country which comes on top of the winnings with 7 players @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with very popular players expected to top the bill -- such as India 's Saina Nehwal ( photo ) , who only pocketed US$43,408 this year and clearly contrasts with the outstanding endorsement contracts reported on in the Indian press .

While it is commonly known that most European players get to keep the total of their prize money ( except for the local taxes which are , of course , not calculated in this chart ) , in Asia , the associations get sometimes part of the price money .

It is known in Indonesia that players have received a lifetime pension , land or a house after a gold medal in the Olympics . The same goes for Korea , where Olympic champions receive monthly pensions of approximately US$1,000 for life . <p> " These numbers are quite striking as one can see what a badminton player can earn in a year in terms or prize money .
