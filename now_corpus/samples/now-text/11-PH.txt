Is that what you put on your Facebook profile ? <p> Yes . ( Laughs ) I was really self-taught . I used to watch other people ( giving waxes and pubic hair cuts ) . When I became interested in doing it myself , I quickly learned how to do it . <p> I did n't realize that you learn quickly if you are a voyeur . A lot of DOMs pala can qualify as pubic hair cutters . Do you plan to expand your practice and cut hair in the other less visible body parts above the waist ? Such as the nose ? The nipple ? The armpit ? <p> No more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I see . <p> Before , I also used to cut hair . <p> Wow , so there is a downward sloping career path in hair cutting . Is there a difference between cutting hair in the North Pole and the South Pole ? Are the hairs in both as equally cooperative ? Do they both respond well to conditioner ? Do they both need to be air-dried ? <p> Not really . They are both still hair . ( Laughs ) It 's just that you have to be more delicate with the hair down there . <p> Why ? Are you scared that your fingers might get entangled in the overgrowth ? <p> If we ( hair cutters ) are already careful when we cut the hair on your head , then we have to be more careful with the hair around your pubic region . <p> Especially if there are any wild creatures hiding in those untamed pubic forests .

You should be careful , you might get pricked . <p> And there is some pubic hair that is so unmanageable that it is almost coarse . <p> You should charge extra for hazard pay . Or at least bring a chainsaw . Are there other services that you have brought from your former haircutting practice into pubic haircutting ? Like do you do crewcuts ? Mohawks ? A bob ? <p> If you get a Brazilian , then you can make some designs . <p> I do n't need a Brazilian to design my hair for me down there , thank you . I think Filipinos can do just as good a job . <p> But for a pubic haircut , it 's just a very straight job . <p> And sometimes it is a job that can curve ever so slightly upward and to the left .

( Laughs , but thinks about it . ) <p> I overheard some DOMs laughing over that last remark , Manang Reggie . Feel free to stab them with discarded razor-sharp pubic hairs . Is there a technique that you employ in cutting pubic hair that makes you stand out from other pubic hair cutters ? Do you use tweezers ? Flame throwers ? Your bare hands ? <p> When you cut pubic hair , you really have to use two hands . <p> As opposed to using three hands ? <p> If you only use one hand , you might end up -- <p> Accidentally circumcising your client ? Do you have a license for that ? <p> Because you need to use one hand to pull the hair . <p> And the other hand to cover your eyes ? So how hard do you pull at the hair ? Can you tell by volume of their screams ? <p> Siyempre , alalay lang ( Of course , with a little precaution ) . <p> I see , so you use your other hand to muffle their screams @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cut male pubic hair , are n't these men usually embarrassed to have their hair cut ? And , when they are embarrassed , does n't that make the job harder for you ? <p> Some of them are embarrassed , but I just remind them " This is just a job " and I am also " walang hiya " ( I have no shame ) . ( Laughs shamelessly ) <p> What a coincidence , walang hiya rin ako ( I have no shame ) ! Maybe I can explore a career as a pubic hair cutter . <p> Before I used to be embarrassed , but I 've already gotten over that . ( Laughs even more shamelessly ) <p> That 's the kind of confidence that you can only gain from pulling and cutting pubic hair . So how long should a man wait until he has his pubic hair groomed ? Do you wait until it starts creeping through your bikini briefs ? Do you wait until little children can swing from them across your knees ? Or do you wait until you step on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on you . <p> Personally , I would like it cut to the point that you can see the tree in the forest . And after creating a manicured forest , how long does it take to reforestation to occur ? <p> About one month . <p> May I ask you a professional question : How much male , ahem , heavy machinery have you seen in your six-year profession as a pubic hair cutter ? <p> I usually cut female hair , so I have only seen a couple of men . Maybe five or six . <p> Whew . I should be so lucky then that you do n't have much of a basis for comparison . Especially since I am walang hiya . But how about the rest of the Pinoys whom you have groomed ? In size ? <p> Katamtaman lang ( Fairly moderate ) . <p> In that case I hope I am not scaring you as well . What do you while away the time while cutting pubic hair ? Do you listen to relaxing music ? Do you make tsismis ( gossip ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? <p> Nothing much . I just make kwento ( stories ) and kwento so that my mind is not focused on what I am doing . <p> So does that mean the longer the kuwentuhan , the more primeval the forest ? <p> It 's awkward when both of you are silent ( during the haircut ) , especially since some male clients tend to be malicious . <p> Manang , please stop servicing Gary Lising . <p> There are a lot of them out there . <p> How do you handle these malicious men ?

However , every time I consider introducing this theory to her , I shrink , knowing she just wo n't believe me . <p> I recall a time when my mother cited a long list of things she found maddeningly unfavorable in my room : she first noted that in my bedroom shower , my sink needed scrubbing and empty sachets of shampoo needed to meet the trash can . Then she commented on the thickness of the dust that lay indecently on the floor , and said that it would n't hurt if I made use of a broom . <p> I have forgotten her exact cleaning pointers , but one thing I will never forget was the puzzlement she expressed over my cluttered desk .

I initially thought the title was weird since " doing hard things " sounded bizarre and way too out of the box . But I soon learned that it was everything but bizarre -- it was what I needed .

For the longest time I have managed to just lifelessly coast along in my everyday affairs , barely taking a stand ; not because I am inherently inanimate or irresponsive to current events , but because I have been feeling no urgency to excel in the things I do . I have long subscribed to the ridiculous belief that as long as I passed my subjects , and as long as I showed up in places I had to be in , I was fine .

Once we have satisfied the minimum requirements , we tend to stop pushing ourselves . " <p> As I progressed reading the book , I seriously could n't believe how relatable Alex and Brett were .

They do n't just encourage us to outdo expectations ; they tell us to live for a greater purpose . Truth is , I am tired of hearing messages that talk about the loss of values , and the death of sanity in this generation . What we need is not a change of mind , but a change of heart . What we need is a revival ! <p> We need God to make genuine change happen . It is God who strengthens us to persevere in and endure life .

Unless a person voluntarily submits or is deemed to have submitted himself to the court 's jurisdiction , no binding decision can be rendered against him without proper service of summons . Service of summons on foreign corporations that do not have an office or agent in the country has always been problematic . The result is that local residents are unable to effectively sue such corporations before Philippine courts either for torts or breach of contract . <p> The reason for this injustice is that our Rules of Court did not contain any provision on service of summons to corporations not registered in the Philippines . <p> AM No. 11-3-6-SC <p> ADVERTISEMENT <p> In an effort to address this longtime problem , the Supreme Court recently amended the Rules of Court and expanded the ways by which service of summons may be done on foreign private juridical entities that are either not registered or have no resident agent in the country . <p> This new rule introduces radical changes to our long-arm statute . Before , our long-arm statute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only where the ( a ) court action " affects the personal status of the plaintiff ; " ( b ) the case " relates to , or the subject of which , is property within the Philippines , in which the defendant has a claim or interest , actual or contingent ; " ( c ) when " the relief demanded consists , wholly or in part , of excluding the defendant from any interest " in any property within the Philippines ; or ( c ) the property of the defendant has been attached in the Philippines ( Section 15 , Rule 14 , Revised Rules of Court ; De Midgeley v. Ferandos , G.R. No . L-34313 , May 13 , 1975 , 64 SCRA 23 ; Cariaga , et al . v. Malaya , et al. , G.R. No . L-48375 , Aug. 13 , 1986 , 143 SCRA 441 ) . <p> As a result of these limitations , the Supreme Court held that extraterritorial service of summons could not be availed of in a money judgment sought by the plaintiff ( Boudard et al @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or in an action for injunction ( Kawasaki Port Service Corp . et al . v. Amores et al. , G.R.

Service of summons may now be done , with the permission of the court , on foreign private juridical entities that are either not registered or have no resident agent through any of the following ways : <p> * By personal service coursed through the appropriate court in the foreign country with the assistance of the Department of Foreign Affairs . <p> * By publication once in a newspaper of general circulation in the country where the defendant may be found and by serving a copy of the summons and the court order by registered mail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ * By facsimile or any recognized electronic means that could generate proof of service . <p> * By such other means as the court may in its discretion direct . <p> Obviously , summons to these entities now go beyond our country 's borders . And , in keeping up with the times , the Supreme Court has allowed service of summons through facsimile or electronic devices . <p> A word of caution <p> The new rule makes our long arm statute more sensible and practical , designed as it is to prevent injustice to local plaintiffs who are disadvantaged vis-a-vis their foreign counterparts in terms of seeking redress against foreign entities in the courts of their own country . <p> Lest we lawyers get excited , a word of caution . We have to consider that a case does not end with the judgment of the court . The court judgment should be enforceable in the country of residence of the defendant or where its properties may be found . In this regard , it is an accepted principle in private international law that a court may exercise personal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and enforceable judgment against it only if there exist " minimum contacts " between the defendant and the forum state . This principle aims to protect the defendant against the burden of litigating in a distant forum even as it ensures that states , through their courts , do not reach out beyond the limits imposed on them by their status as co-equal sovereigns ( World-Wide Volkswagen Corp . v. Woodson , 444 U.S. 286 1980 ) . <p> The presence of " minimum contacts , " often exhibited through defendant 's doing or transacting business in the forum state , is a requirement of due process . As the US Supreme Court has stated , " the Due Process Clause does not contemplate that a state may make binding a judgment in personam against an individual or corporate defendant with which the state has no contacts , ties , or relations . " Doing so would lay " too great and unreasonable a burden on the corporation to comport with due process " ( International Shoe Co. v.
