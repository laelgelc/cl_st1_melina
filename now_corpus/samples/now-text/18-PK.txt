@@22600234 <p> NHRC and SHRC should not watch passively while Indian farmers starve and commit suicide . By Hem Raj Jain <p> Notwithstanding misguiding claims of Government of India ( GOI ) , economically India is such a backward country that here not only about two third of people are dependent on agriculture but farmers ( small and marginal ) in hundreds of millions are starving and 40 of them commit suicide daily . As a remedy farmer are demanding fair and remunerative prices for agriculture produce and freedom from agricultural debt ( the result of non-remunerative prices ) . But it is only one part of the tragedy , which is Hindu majority India . <p> Three other Indian malaises are ensuring that these unfortunate farmers do not get any succor in this matter . First Prime Minister Modi during campaign of Parliamentary elections 2014 promised that he will ensure ruminative price for farm produce that is 50 % above cost ( main inputs ) . But after becoming PM , Modi asked GOI to give an affidavit in Supreme Court of India ( SCI ) in February , 2015 that GOI can not give said remunerative prices . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ publicly giving excuse also of financial constraints in giving remunerative prices to farmers . <p> Second is the fact that these unfortunate starving &amp; suiciding farmers are mostly lower castes of Hindu order Dalits ( oppressed ) , Schedule-castes , Schedule-tribes , Backward-castes , Other-backward-castes etc . Therefore human rights social activists ( even farmer ? s NGOs ) like AIKSCC ( who claim to work for the benefit of farmers ) do not take effective action for bringing relief to these unfortunate farmers though they can easily do it by demanding from GOI to recover Rs 1,000 Trillion of State capital as mentioned at https : **39;102;TOOLONG ... which when recovered will easily remove the financial constrain of GOI while giving relief to these unfortunate farmers . <p> Third problem is that nobody , including National Human Rights Commission ( NHRC ) and State Human Right Commissions ( SHRCs ) , is questioning the GOI that why GOI did not recover black-money of said Rs 1,000 Trillion State-capital from 1 million tax-evaders and instead merely for 3 to 4 Trillion black-money ( that too ultimately could not be realized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ India through de-monetization ( in which farmers , farm-labors and their children working in cities and even in other States too were the worst sufferers ) . The legally highly objectionable apathetic role of NHRC / SHRCs is evident from the fact that the matter of starving &amp; suiciding farmers have been heard in various High Courts and SCI but NHRC / SHRCs never intervened in proceeding of these courts in favor of these unfortunate farmers despite national and international laws . <p> According to ( i ) - National laws , in addition to other provisions of criminal law the public servants of Income Tax Department ( who are criminally derelict and are not recovering said income tax of $ 16 Trillion ) ought to be prosecuted under Section 177 , 181 , 199 , 202 , 217 , 218 IPC read with Section 271 ( 1 ) ( C ) 276 ( C ) of The Income Tax Act and Section 13 ( 1 ) ( d ) 13 ( 2 ) of The Prevention of Corruption Act . Moreover NHRC / SHRCs are legally expected to intervene @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Human Rights Act ( ii ) - International laws expects that under the United Nations Convention against Corruption India takes action against corruption of the public servants who are not recovering this black money of Rs 1,000 Trillion . <p> It is hoped that in the interest of the human rights the NHRC and SHRCs will see to it that GOI is legally constrained ( directly or through Higher Judiciary , if necessary ) so that said State-capital of Rs 1,000 Trillion is recovered from tax-evaders which will provide relief to these unfortunate Indian farmers who in hundreds of millions are starving and 40 are committing suicide daily .

@@22604233 <p> The writer is a freelance contributor on education and has worked with national and international organisations working on education in Pakistan <p> Since 1945 the NGO sector has been growing worldwide . At present , it is said that there are approximately 10 million NGOs worldwide , out of which only 25,000-30,000 exist in Pakistan . Some countries support their expansion and growth by giving them tax benefits and recognising their work whereas others step up monitoring with stringent legal requirements . For the last few years , Russia and China have been trying to stop foreign funding to their respective countries . Treatment of NGOs in Pakistan has been a mixed experience -- supporting and discouraging . <p> In Pakistan , the NGO sector mainly thrives on foreign funding or the country 's expatriates and little donation come from local sources . Whatever little funding that comes from corporate or private entities is selfish and mainly directed for brand promotion . As a result , heavy reliance on foreign aid agencies has undermined the independence and choices of civil society organisations in Pakistan . Despite the emphasis on sustainability in project documents of every NGO , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continued functioning once the funding dried up . This clearly points to the strategic mistake the local NGOs have been making and repeating over decades . As a result , there is a trust deficit between NGOs , beneficiaries and the local population in general , not to speak about the mismanagement and bad governance . Hence , NGOs are spineless , mostly a one-person organisation . <p> Due to the prevailing negative perception , it has been relatively easy for the government to take any unjustified action against the NGOs because the public generally remain aloof and indifferent . Recently , in a bizarre move , the government has advised 21 International NGOs ( INGOs ) to wrap up their operations without giving them any specific reasons . But there has been no reaction from the public -- no hue and cry or protest at all following the decision . There is , however , a split public opinion about it -- some people support it because they believe NGOs undermine the sovereignty of the state whereas others think that these NGOs are not involved in any sort of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contributions towards development of society in Pakistan , hence such a decision is not well-thought out . Irrespective of the public understanding , the real factor that has caused scrutiny of INGOs in Pakistan is Dr Shakil Afridi , then an employee of one of the INGOs , that allegedly helped the CIA in determining the location and identity of Osama bin Laden . He is currently in prison . <p> However , on the basis of just one incident , it is not a prudent approach to start a crackdown on the NGOs . It is unfair to both recipient and givers of the foreign aid . Apart from criticism on the role of NGOs , these organisations have helped Pakistani people in emergencies like earthquakes , floods and droughts , as well as supported a wide range of activities for improving health , education et al indicators . I personally know of BRAC , a Bangladesh-based INGO , which has reached out to poor communities in uncharted and far-flung areas in Sindh , Punjab and K-P to provide them access to schools . It has closely worked with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organisation which has been ordered to close down operation includes the International Relief and Development . The organisation is undertaking an assignment of building 106 modern state-of-the-art child-friendly schools in flood-affected areas of Sindh . Considering the pathetic school infrastructure in Sindh , these school buildings are not less than a blessing for the poor children of Sindh . So , are these activities out of bounds to INGOs ? Instead of over-emphasising documentation compliance , the federal government should have taken stock of the situation on the ground because such a decision is likely to hurt the interest of the most vulnerable segment of the population whose needs have been put on the back burner by the ruling elites . Therefore , the federal government should revisit its decision . <p> Meanwhile , Pakistani NGOs should look at best practices and examples from around the world where civil society organisations have won the trust of communities . They do n't look to foreign donors or the corporate sector for funding but to their volunteers and members . One such example is America . There are around 1.5 million NGOs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strengths of the American society . The US government encourages civil society organisations and individuals by offering them tax benefits . The total contribution the civil society organisations received in 2016 was $390.05 billion . The breakdown of the contributions indicates that three quarter ( 72% ) of the contributions came from individuals , while a meagre percentage of 5% came from corporations . Moreover , NGOs in the US have millions of volunteers who contribute their time for the cause they care about . So , if NGOs in Pakistan wish to grow in influence and importance while remaining relevant to the needs of the communities they have to increase both local funding and volunteers . Otherwise , over-reliance on foreign aid will continue to haunt them in one way or another in the days to come . <h> Facebook Conversations <h> Reader Comments ( 1 ) <p> Great article ; sensibly outlined the arguments .

The decision was announced by the US State Department and will have come as no surprise to the Pakistan government which will have certainly been forewarned by Secretary of State Tillerson during his recent visit to Islamabad . Specifically more has to be done to counter the Afghan Taliban and the Haqqani network . Just how much aid is to be suspended is not known precisely but it would all be military and no civilian aid is to be curtailed . Funding would derive from both the state and defence departments . With the gloves now off it must be noted that none of the monies earmarked for coalition support funding in the 2017 fiscal year has been paid to Pakistan -- what you never had you do not miss . <p> What is going to happen next potentially is going to hurt America more than it hurts Pakistan .

This is very complex to negotiate and ruinously expensive . <p> American frustration is rising , much encouraged by a tweet-happy president . Failing to honour pre-existing agreements is going to inconvenience Pakistan but is not going to significantly damage an already damaged relationship . As far as border security is concerned Pakistan is funding itself to build its own wall -- and rather more effectively and quickly than President Trump is doing on his own southern borders . Military supplies can be sourced other than from the US , and as we have minimal trade with America sanctions this will not bite hard either . Your call President Trump .

@@22871232 <p> As if we needed another reminder of the tenuous control that the Afghan government has over the entire warravaged country , Kabul again fell prey to a deadly attack by the Taliban this week . The latest assault , this time on one of the city 's major landmarks , the Intercontinental Hotel , has come within days of a rare and significant admission by Afghan President Ashraf Ghani that his country 's national army could not last more than six months without international coalition support . Whether or not Ghani 's admission was part of a ploy to gain sympathy for the rag-tag army -- once touted by US forces as a well trained force capable of countering and even defeating the Taliban -- it does prove the long-held contention of security experts that the Afghan National Army was no match for militant groups despite their extensive training by US-led coalition soldiers .

The militants managed to sneak into the hotel despite the fact that Kabul has been on high alert for nearly a week -- in the wake of a US Embassy warning of escalated militant threats in the city . This is why we need to see peace initiatives undertaken by the Afghan government and Washington .

There is a definite requirement for an entity that will hold the responsible bodies accountable , every single one of them , for their failure to protect the children of Pakistan . An immediate national policy needs to be adopted , supplanting the various charters and commissions on child rights that Pakistan is a signatory to , much like the National Action Plan was hashed out to rip terrorists from their hideouts . This new policy critically needs to spell out certain practical matters , such as who pays for DNA testing to determine rape , the confusion over which leaves families and rape survivors and victims hapless . <p> One proposition is for the state or police department to bear this cost because of its failure to protect .

An FIR policy should be adopted where the FIR reporter 's statements are registered truthfully ; a policeman 's role is not to pass judgment on cases and this is a major breach of justice . Along with this , officers require training on the definition of rape and child sexual abuse . Whether or not assault has really occurred , whenever child rights and safety are infringed upon , a case clearly exists . Those who keep child sex abuse cases away from the media limelight are somewhat culpable for obstructing the course of justice . In a country where millions of followers live and swear by their guidance , religious scholars need to speak up . Justice delayed is justice denied and with the delay will come a new breed of child abusers who were once victims themselves , continuing a never-ending loop .

Let 's see what this budding designer has to say about her collection as well as latest trends in bridal wear ... <p> You !

It was challenge for me - not only to have released a bridal collection but also to have done it differently by staying true to our aesthetics - finding that unique balance between traditional yet contemporary . <p> You ! What 's the inspiration behind your debut bridal collection ? <p> H.A : Strong , confident women , who carve their own paths and refuse to be defined by pre-existing moulds inspire me . This collection is homage to and a celebration of women who have broken , and continue to break the moulds holding them back . <p> With this collection , we have given a contemporary nuance to the design ethos of a modern day bridal . An ode , perhaps , to having broken the mould , many times over . <p> You ! How long did it take you to complete your first bridal collection ? <p> H.A : From inception to execution , it took approximately four months . <p> You ! What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ define your collection different from the rest ? <p> H.A : The quintessential Hira Ali design aesthetic is minimal and edgy , whilst being feminine and luxurious .

What type of material and fabric you have used in your bridal collection ? <p> H.A : ' Break The Mould ' invites a selection of fabrics like nets and shimmer organzas as well as various blends of glittering silks . The embroidery comprises of experimental techniques using crystals and nets as well as silk threads and various beads and crystals . The colour palette jumps from translucent terracotta to coal for contrast .

Our culture encourages exuberant displays of wealth , and beauty is mostly defined by all the extra glitter and gold . But these are the very lines that we are constantly trying to break with our designs and mend mentalities and modernise the concept of beauty . <p> You ! Why do you think a bride must wear a designer outfit ?

Be it fashion or interior , trends play an important role in keeping us updated on what 's hot and what 's not . The fact is , decking up a space can be a frustrating job . Whether you are planning to spruce up your place or buy a new house , you want to incorporate decor trends that not only look timeless but reflect your personality as well . However , the trick to decorating with trends is twofold . First , use them sparsely , and focus on the ones you see yourself adopting for a long time . Second , look ahead to the trends that are on their way up , as opposed to the ones that are dwindling - and your decor will feel fresh for longer . <p> Want to know which design movements are coming and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ try , along with a few that are a big NO this year . <p> What 's in ! <p> Say hello to jewel tones : <p> We saw a lot of dark , cosy colours last year , and 2018 is all about jewel tones as well . Think emerald green meets sapphire - both shades are said to be especially invigorating . From deep burgundy reds and burnt oranges to rusty terracottas and murky greens , these warmer colours give off a very cosy feel . The best way to incorporate this trend is to go for vivid velvet sofas in jewel tones or you could also take baby steps with a jewel-toned velvet throw pillow instead . Moreover , lilac - a watered-down version of violet ( Pantone colour of the year ) - is in vogue and gives a snug feeling especially when used in the bedroom . <p> Metal of the moment - brass : <p> Whether you love it or hate it , brass is back and better than ever . The aged finish adorns kitchen cabinets and living room furniture and shines bright @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ According to experts , copper has been hugely popular for more than five years but it has reached its peak and brass is now the metallic of the moment . <p> Curvy styles : <p> Curves are definitely in . Not only have curves been getting love on the runway , but they are trending as far as furniture is concerned . ' 70s-inspired couches with quirky curves will liven up your living room . Curved sofas are not only current , but are a nice alternative to the L-shaped sectional . They divide a room beautifully and look great from every angle . Also , curvy furniture is a great addition to a rectangular room . <p> Go the floral way : <p> When incorporated into furniture in an overt way , flowers are fun and funky . Styled in a casual bohemian way , florals look fresh and appealing . Juxtaposing florals with organic textures and neutral palettes evokes a new kind of elegance that is quirky yet pretty . Experts say that floral prints in bold , contrasting colours will be the ' it ' thing in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well as chairs and throw pillows . Remember , the key to making it work is moderation . Make sure you have some neutrals and basics to balance out the bold floral . <p> Monochrome : <p> Who does n't love the classic combination of black and white ? Well , it is time to use it in home decor as well . Using black and white in interior design is perhaps a way of offsetting some of the season 's more striking styles . Snag some simple linens or go for white sofas with black cushions . You can even add a black and white rug to make your room trendy . <p> Of dark finishes : <p> Earthy tones and dark woods are back . Dark wood is a striking shift away from the blonde woods that have been popular in recent years . An easy way to create impact is by using a larger piece of dark wood furniture , such as a coffee table or a chest of drawer . <p> Natural accents : <p> The natural look of decorative objects made of wood and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rage these days . Hand-turned wooden bowls , concrete vessels , leather drawer pulls and marble lamps can make your room look unique yet classy . <p> Wabi-Sabi - beauty in imperfection : <p> Wabi-sabi is the newest lifestyle philosophy you should embrace in 2018 . The word wabi-sabi is derived from ancient Japanese philosophy of making peace with the imperfections of your home , as well as the unpredictable nature of life . In home design , this translates to handmade or hand-painted items including rough linens and pottery . Embracing the beauty of imperfection of your home results in a deeply personal and organic aesthetic . <p> What 's out ! <p> Say bye bye to all-white kitchens : <p> All-white interiors , kitchens in particular , are on their way out . Kitchens will continue to brighten up , swapping stark white for warm wood tones and new neutrals including cream , blue , and grey . <p> Open shelves no more : <p> Bid adieu to open shelving .

The indifference of parents towards molesters in the family empower them , telling the child that they are all alone and even their parents will not interfere . The predators usually threaten the child warning them if they tried to tell people , no one would believe them ; ' not even your parents , and just think of the shame you will bring on them ' .

So , there is no talk on this most serious social crime that affects children . <p> Breaking the ice <p> Fortunately , sexual harassment , rape and murder are topics that are being discussed openly in Pakistan currently .

Daughters should be able to come to their parents no matter what and speak up , instead of falling deeper into the power of criminals .

If a strong relationship between the parent and the child is made , the child is safer . We tell our children to be wary of strangers - and for good cause too - but it is high time that we warn them to stay away from certain people that are known for their inclination of preying on the young . And if necessary , serious steps should be taken to keep these people from even mingling socially with the young . Families should boycott the offender , making it clear to them that their criminal bent of mind is known and they should be shamed publicly . <p> Such messages spread awareness , especially on social media which is the most powerful platform to inform people and their children to be safe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and reassure her/him that it is safe now .

@@23073233 <p> The writer is a retired lieutenant general of the Pakistan Army and a former federal secretary . He has also served as chairman of the Pakistan Ordnance Factories Board <p> In Pakistan where political parties are locked in a perpetual battle , state institutions are devouring one another and hostility of neighbouring countries has become a norm , vital national issues like madrassa reforms remain grossly neglected . In fact , the entire education sector even though now a provincial subject needs far higher priority if Pakistan is destined to progress . And madrassas should be a major component of the overall educational policy reforms . <p> It was heartening that Chief of Army Staff General Bajwa speaking at a seminar in Quetta emphasised the urgency of widening the scope of education at madrassas . These reforms , if faithfully executed , should raise the overall educational standards of pupils , improve their future employment prospects and positively impact the security situation . <p> Moreover , the content and methodology of teaching also needs to be revisited . The emphasis on learning by rote is highly damaging because students do not develop the habit of thinking critically . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used to advance the militant agenda of certain schools of thought . <p> Attaining high educational standards assumes greater significance when we find only those countries have progressed that had laid great emphasis on quality education . A stark comparison of how the world has progressed can be made from the fact that even a two-year-old child in many countries is demanding an iPhone and feels comfortable while exploring the world while some of our seminaries are content with only giving basic religious education . If the students are not taught science , mathematics and other major subjects that are a part of normal school curriculum along with religious education , how will they be in a position to compete with others and get jobs ? Dim prospects of future gainful employment of these students should be a cause of serious concern . <p> The funding of madrassas by Saudi Arabia and Iran has been justifiably a subject of controversy . These countries have been using madrassas to advance their regional and sectarian agenda . Pakistan had been an unfortunate victim of this policy more than any and the blame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the past our military governments have pursued highly shortsighted policies for few monetary and political gains . For instance , the Saudi funding to Pakistan especially during General Ziaul Haq and later General Musharraf 's period was to promote Wahabi ideology . And its political motive was to counter the influence of Iran and promote anti-Ahmadi sentiment . The Saudi government 's ultraconservative policies fortunately are now undergoing a major change . Meanwhile , Pakistan has taken several measures to ensure that a fallout of Iran-Arab rivalry is reduced . Foreign funding to madrassas has reduced considerably and constitutes only 7% of their overall budget . <p> A majority of madrassas are narrowly focused on promoting sectarianism and this trend has to be discouraged . What is further worrisome is that the madrassas are growing faster than schools and there is little effort at improving their quality . According to the latest government figures , there are 32,000 madrassas , including the unregistered ones , and approximately 3.5 million students are enrolled in them . The highest number being in Punjab . Another weakness of madrassas is the absence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government funds as such should not be subjected to scrutiny defies logic . For all educational institutions , including madrassas , should comply with financial regulations and their curriculum and overall teaching standards meet minimum standards . At present , there is no uniformity in syllabus of madrassas . <p> Despite these limitations with schools already overcrowded and the government unable to increase their number due to limitations of funds and capacity problems , madrassas would remain an important component of the education system . Besides , the general state of poverty is a major contributing factor in parent 's decision to send their children to a madrassa . The government should take a more proactive and supportive attitude towards them in raising their overall educational standards . This will instill greater confidence in the madrassa students , provide them new employment opportunities and a broader thinking paradigm . <p> We need to remind ourselves that madrassas have been in existence for centuries and produced several leaders and eminent persons . President Erdogan of Turkey , President Hassan Rouhani of Iran received their education in madrassas . In Pakistan , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prominent leaders have also received their education in madrassas . So it is not a question of ' we versus them ' . It is a collective responsibility to upgrade our educational system to make our citizens face the world more confidently and as a nation succeed collectively . <p> This would require a more forthright approach by our religious leaders in cooperation with the government to address the weaknesses in our madrassas . A glaring manifestation is a lack of emphasis on educational standards of teaching staff and in-service professional training . This weakness is manifest in many government and private schools as well , but is more prevalent among madrassas . <p> Another aspect that deserves serious consideration is the spread of jihadi trend that has spread across all institutions -- schools , colleges , universities and madrassas . It manifests in the form of narcissism and anti-West phobia among madrassa students and in colleges and universities . Clearly now the greatest challenge is to change the extremist mindset developed over the years due to our history of sectarian strife and involvement in Afghan jihad . Thus the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ battleground between the state and those spreading the militant agenda . <p> Failing to bring in madrassa reforms will have adverse consequences . It has already generated a social division and impacted on their employment prospects . Madrassa students tend to cling together , which is only natural . But their quality and type of education should give them the confidence to be at equal ease in dealing with others . As of now a madrassa student has a different worldview that could be an impediment to actualising his full potential . <p> One hopes that during the forthcoming election campaigns a national discourse on education , including madrassa reforms , will receive due attention by major political parties .

@@23436230 <h> US Nuclear Posture Review <p> On 2nd February 2018 , The United States chalked out a new nuclear strategy , NuclearPostureReview ( NPR ) 2018 . Amid deteriorating prospects of peace and rising tensions at global strategic level , this new doctrine has provoked serious concerns in the strategic thought at both regional and global level . While explaining the core causes , essential elements , and objectives of Trump doctrine , this article endeavors to expatiate and illustrate its gruesome global implications . It also elucidates a way forward as regards the looming threats of a nuclear war , in the milieu of nuclear arms race . <p> U.S. is now relying on nuclear capabilities more than diplomatic means to achieve its foreign policy objectives . NPR 2018 describes that for a credible deterrence U.S. needs to modernise its strategic triad comprising of submarine- launched ballistic missiles ( SLBM ) , intercontinental ballistic missiles ( ICBM ) , and strategic bombers particularly capable of delivering low- yield tactical nuclear weapons . It clearly manifests the role that nuclear capabilities have gained in the U.S. strategic thinking after NPR 2018 . <p> The United States has declared her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tailored nuclear capabilities aimed at countering Russian and Chinese aggressive nuclear threats to her strategic interests . As it reads , " this review candidly addresses the challenges posed by Russian , Chinese and other states ' strategic policies , programs and capabilities , particularly nuclear . It presents the flexible , adaptable , and resilient U.S. nuclear capabilities now required to protect the United States , allies , and partners , and promote strategic stability . " <p> However , realistically speaking , the nuclear up gradation and modernisation proposed by NPR 2018 , which is aimed at countering enemy aggressive designs , as U.S. describes it , would ignite a strong response from adversaries leading to an arms race . <p> In international anarchic structure the security of one state means the insecurity of another state , also called security dilemma . So , U.S. security would mean insecurity of its adversaries that will ultimately endeavor for their survival against U.S. strategic muscles build up . For survival they would have to go either for alliance formation or military build-up to counterweigh U.S. strength . Alliances are never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ security of a state . This struggle for security by strengthening strategic muscles prompts arms race . For example , when U.S. exploded nuclear weapons in 1945 , it started arms race threatening its adversary , Russia , which followed the suit in 1949 just 4 years after U.S. Similarly , other insecure states like Britain , France , India and Pakistan later joined the nuclear club . So , possibility of arms race can not be denied even if U.S. ensures . Therefore , arms race would set the fumes into fire , eventually , leading to a nuclear war . <p> Over a year ago Trump announced : " The U.S. must greatly strengthen and expand its nuclear capabilities until such times as the world comes to its senses regarding nukes ... " when his aides neglected the idea of arms race as a response to U.S. military strengthening , Trump categorically defended in an interview : " Let it be an arms race . We will outmatch them adversaries at every pass and outlast them all . " <p> Though total U.S. budget spending on nuclear modernisation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Obama 's regime amounting to $1.2 trillion ; However , Trump nuclear doctrine differs from its predecessor in including of low yield tactical nuclear weapons in nuclear strategy that could be used in battle field . Henceforth , by lowering the nuclear threshold and enhancing the possibilities of escalation to a full scale thermonuclear war , Trump administration has explicitly threatened world peace . <p> The possibility of a full blown catastrophic nuclear war is inherent in the very genes of Trump nuclear doctrine . As , NPR 2018 states : " if deterrence fails , the United States will strive to end any conflict at the lowest level of damage possible and on the best achievable terms for the United States , allies and partners . " <p> However , there is no denying the fact that war has a slippery road , once launched it does not remain in anyone 's control . No one can dare to make a war limited ; particularly when adversaries also have lethal nukes . Even the low yield tactical nuclear weapons can not ensure restraint in a war . On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of confrontation will escalate a limited war to a full fledge total war . Hence , the better option is to avoid a war given the lethality of nuclear weapons . <p> As regards the nuclear control and disarmament , NPR 2018 contravenes the disarmament treaties . First , Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty ( NPT ) was signed in 1967 to control expansion and modernisation of nuclear arsenal . It also envisaged general and complete disarmament of nuclear stockpiles . However , NPR , which resorts to up gradation and modernisation of nuclear arsenal , clearly violates NPT . <p> Second , two nuclear giants , Russia and U.S. , signed Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces Treaty ( INF ) in 1987 , whereby both powers agreed to eliminate their intermediate range and short range nukes . Though America has alleged Russia to violating INF by deploying low-yield tactical nuclear weapons which triggered U.S. to develop , upgrade and modernise its nuclear threshold . Whatever the causes , U.S. nuclear doctrine is a clear manifestation of INF breach . <p> The U.S. pursuit of nuclear modernization would encourage other states to follow the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peace . Because , battle field nukes would increase the probabilities of nuclear exchange even in a non-nuclear conflict . <p> As regards the global implications , first , NPR 2018 would make the world more vulnerable . The dooms day clock was recently reset to two minutes to midnight , which clearly illustrates a catastrophic event reaching the planet . The scientists have already described current moment as a scariest one in the history of mankind . <p> Humanity has invented overkill capacity ; lethal nuclear weapons . It would prove cataclysmic when used as means to achieve political objectives . Henceforth , there is a dire need for the people at the helm of affairs to ponder upon their strategic thinking and policy formulation . <p> Second , The U.S. reliance on nuclear capabilities to further her political and strategic objectives poses a sever threat to diplomacy and , hence , the passivity of international strategic environment . For peace in the world diplomatic means must be preferred over military means . Military means must be used as a last resort . Given the American threat to diplomacy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policy making . Now when world powers would revise their nuclear doctrines , in the light of American NPR 2018 , rationality demands recognising the importance of diplomacy in the formulation and execution of policies . <p> Third , deterrence works among rational . It is meant for avoiding mutually assured destruction by increasing the cost of war and lowering the benefits . Hence , deterrence can be a tool for establishing peace . However , when emotionalism takes over the rationality in policy making processes , as in NPR 2018 , deterrence does not work . Because irrational adversaries could not perceive the credibility of deterrence . Therefore , now , when world is at the brink of nuclear war global powers must realize the role of rationality in the policy making processes . Rationality can safeguard the humanity against looming threats . <p> In a nutshell , U.S. reliance on lethal nuclear weapons to achieve her political objectives would increase the vulnerability of regional and global strategic environment to nuclear Armageddon by prompting nuclear arms race amongst world powers . Already divided in blocks , Aggressive America , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ambitious Iran are challenging world peace . Furthermore , NPR like strategies would only intensify the problems . In order to pacify regional and global strategic environment world powers must rationalize their policies . Also , they should prefer diplomatic means over military capabilities . Only rational and pragmatic policies would safeguard humanity against looming threats of nuclear Armageddon . So , all the stakeholders must endeavor in its true essence to pacify the whole world . <p> n The writer has completed masters in International Relations from Quaid-I-Azam University Islamabad .

To help the person consider another point of view , use two conversation cues . The first is to ask questions : If the know-it-all is clinging to one side of an issue , you can say something like , " Have you ever seen a situation where the opposite was true ? " Try to get them to rethink their assumptions and look at the situation differently . If questions do n't work , stall for time . For example , you might delay the conversation to gather data that supports your argument . You can say , " Before we make a decision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our people view their service quality . We can meet again next week to discuss it . " Then use that time to consider other options or seek colleagues ' advice on how to change the know-it-all 's mind . <p> ( Adapted from " How to Deal with the Know-It-All in Your Office , " by Priscilla Claman . ) <p> Get constructive feedback <p> Constructive feedback is essential for getting better at your job , but a colleague may hesitate to give it if they 're worried about hurting your feelings . To ease their fear , try three strategies . First , introduce the conversation by giving yourself negative feedback . Say something like , " I know I tend to work quickly and sometimes overlook important details . Do you have thoughts on how I could improve ? " By acknowledging the problem area , you take the pressure off your colleague to bring it up . You can also frame your request as a commitment you 'd like their help with . Tell your colleague that you want to improve in a specific area and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A third strategy is to ask , " What is something you think I could learn from you ? " This gives your colleague a chance to reflect on their talents and skills , which makes people feel good about themselves . <p> We all have tasks that we put off and put off , but actually accomplishing them is rarely as bad as we expect . Sometimes beating procrastination is about just getting over the initial hurdle . Instead of forcing yourself to tackle the entire task at once , focus on the first piece of it . Start by thinking about the task and your resistance to it , and then find a time period that you 'd be willing to commit . Could you focus on the task for an hour ? What about 30 minutes ? Shorten the amount of time to something that does n't make you resist getting started . Then figure out the bare minimum you can do -- writing a few paragraphs , reading a few pages , or whatever wo n't make you return to your procrastinating ways . Once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Working on something , even in small pieces , means you 'll continue to process it , which makes you more likely to resume the work later on . <p> It 's possible to be friends with someone who works for you , but you need to set boundaries . For example , there may be times when you 're privy to information that will affect your friend , but it would be improper for you to share it . To make the friendship work , be transparent about what you can and ca n't share , and emphasise that it 's a matter of ethics , not trust . When sensitive topics come up , be clear about what kind of conversation you 're having . Say something like , " Let 's talk about this in friend mode " or " This is a work topic that I 'd like to bring up . " And check that you and your friend want to have the same kind of conversation . This way , you can maintain your friendship without crossing any lines . <p> Having a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaving you feeling like an active volcano . To prevent an outburst and stay in control of your emotions , physically ground yourself in your environment . One of the best ways to do this is to stand up and walk around , which activates the thinking part of your brain . If you and your counterpart are seated at a table , and suddenly standing up seems awkward , you might say , " I feel like I need to stretch . Mind if I walk around a bit ? " If that does n't feel comfortable , you can do small physical things like crossing two fingers or placing your feet firmly on the floor and noticing what it feels like . Mindfulness experts call these actions " anchoring . " Whatever you can do to focus on your physical presence and your senses will help you stay grounded and get through that tough conversation . <p> ( From " How to Control Your Emotions During a Difficult Conversation , " by Amy Gallo. )

The purpose is to prevent bad spill over effects of private decision-making on the broader depositor base , which leads to stability of the system . <p> In this way , bank supervisors are not only able to prevent market failure but are also able to keep the system stable and running . <p> Besides capital indicators , other methodologies such as liquidity indicators , loan-to-value ( LTV ) ratios and disclosure requirement are also used to ensure the stability of the system . Clearly , some of these are borrower targeted ( e.g. , LTV ) and some are institutions specific ( e , g disclosure requirement ) . <p> How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot on the structure of banking system , and the ability to pursue its mandate . <p> Prior to the Global Financial Crises ( GFC ) of 2007 , these tools were targeted primarily on the institutions ignoring externalities that could arise at a macro level . <p> However , the events that unfolded at the onset of the GFC , showed that market failure could also occur at a macro level . Resultantly , bank supervisors across various jurisdictions are working on macro-prudential policy frameworks to deal with systemic risk more effectively . <p> The ability of the supervisor to carry out supervision may be constrained by a number of factors . Forbearance and regulatory capture top the list . <p> The difference between the two is hard to discern due to the overlapping nature of the two problems . Further , how immensely it features in limiting effective supervision remains elusive . <p> The changing landscape of the financial system and growing influence of technology in banking has augmented negative externalities . <p> It goes without saying that the change and use of technology has immensely benefited consumers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the accompanied risks and vulnerabilities have also grown in size and stature . <p> More challenging is the fact that these risks and vulnerabilities have spread beyond the sphere of influence of supervision , so that developing tools to keep them in check has become more challenging and exhausting . <p> For example , how does a supervisor ensure the risk is appropriately priced in a peer-to-peer lending ?

She is beautiful ) <p> These are the type of comments that I , a newly married bahu , gets to hear whenever my mother-in-law introduces me to relatives and acquaintances in social gatherings . Some people are very straight forward and say it right away to my face , while others pass comments on my looks in their gossip sessions . Though they are making an effort to praise me via these comments , I never take them as compliments . In fact , I do n't like it at all . <p> I feel that everyone in my vicinity is only concerned about my looks ; nobody even has a hint of interest in my personality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in less than a year of my marriage , I figured out that beauty is the only scale on which a Pakistani bahu is judged , whether one accepts it or not . The fault in our system of marriage is very deep-rooted . This is the reason why Pakistani women look for tall , fair and pretty girls when they are searching for potential wives for their sons . There is an apparently invisible competition going on between these women over the beauty of their daughters-in-law ; they compare each other 's daughters-in law and the criterion is wholly and solely beauty . <p> The stages for the bahu catwalk are social gatherings like weddings , milads ( religious gathering ) , daawats ( lunch/dinner parties ) and the likes of such events , where they get a chance to preview each other 's daughters-in-law and rate them on society 's scale of beauty . It is this peer pressure which forces a Pakistani mother to base the selection of the spouse for her son on the girl 's looks . All this just so she can bag @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beautiful girl in town and win the apparently invisible bahu contests . <p> Before marriage , I was not very social when it came to attending weddings or social gatherings where you get to meet relatives and people from your community , so I was quite unaware of the bahu beauty competitions going on at the rear of such gatherings . It is quite common in Pakistan to go to an event , weddings in particular , and come out with a few proposals . Every wedding , gathering or occasion feels like an auction ; women keep a lookout on what pleases their eyes and immediately rush to " bid " on their favourites . A lot of mothers even force their daughters to dress up and look pretty when they go to weddings so that hopefully , their daughters can catch someone 's attention . <p> Do they know how exhausting it is to look a certain best , trying to please them , all the time ? <p> Trust me , I am writing this out of experience .

She wanted to be able to flaunt having the most ravishing daughter-in-law . <p> Similar is the case of other such ladies of her age in my vicinity . They actually discuss each other 's daughters-in law in their gatherings . Please do n't take me wrong as I respect and love my mother-in-law a lot , but at times , I feel that she gets carried away with the useless social thrust . I have no issues in making myself look beautiful in social events but what bugs me is the fact that I do n't want to be recognised in society and community only because of my beauty . <p> Our whole lives , we work hard to make a name for ourselves .

I am sure that does not bode well with many of us . <p> Marriage is not about looks , you can not spend your entire life with somebody 's beauty . It 's about compatibility , understanding and sharing your life together . In this rat race of getting their hands on beauties as bahus , mothers sometimes ruin the lives of their sons and others ' daughters .

@@24515231 <p> On April 29 , big public meetings were organided by five political parties in three out of the four provinces to prematurely launch their election campaign . <p> The only exception was Balochistan , Pakistan 's most under-developed province suffering from a low-intensity insurgency since 2006 following the assassination of Baloch tribal elder Nawab Akbar Bugti in a military action ordered by President General Pervez Musharraf . The pace of politics is usually slow in the province where most politicians , many of whom are tribal chiefs , keep changing political parties to stay close to the corridors of power . <p> There is no doubt that the biggest public meeting on April 29 was staged by the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf ( PTI ) in the shadows of the Minar-e-Pakistan at the Iqbal Park in Lahore . It was a show of strength by the party after weeks of preparations . The PTI Chairman Imran Khan was hoping the public rally would provide his party the kind of momentum that it had received after the mammoth gathering at the same place in October 2011 . That was a watershed moment as Imran Khan was catapulted into a major political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On the same day , the Pakistan People 's Party ( PPP ) ventured into an almost alien territory in Karachi when the party 's Chairperson Bilawal Bhutto Zardari addressed a public meeting in Liaqatabad , hitherto the stronghold of the Muttahida Qaumi Movement ( MQM ) . It would have been unthinkable some years ago that the PPP would dare to organise such a gathering in an area populated by the Urdu-speaking Mohajirs . However , the splintering of the MQM into at least four factions has provided an opportunity to not only the PPP , but also the PTI , Jamaat-i-Islami , Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz ( PML-N ) and other parties to snatch a share of its vote . Being in power in Sindh , the PPP is better placed to attract the floating MQM vote . The Liaqatabad public meeting was organised with an eye on the Mohajirs who would like to return to the mainstream after being put-off by the MQM factionalism . <p> The remaining three public meetings on April 29 were organised in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa . Punjab Chief Minister President Shahbaz Sharif , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President , travelled to Shergarh in Mardan district to speak at a public meeting organised by the local party lawmaker Jamshed Mohmand . Shahbaz Sharif is increasingly focusing on Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in a bid to put Imran Khan on the defensive by criticising the performance of the PTI government . Jamshed Mohmand was elected as an independent MPA in the May 2013 general election and was supporting the PTI-led coalition government until 2017 when he switched sides and joined the PML-N . The PML-N 's federal government rewarded him with gas supply and electrification projects in his constituency to strengthen his prospects for winning the 2018 polls . <p> The electioneering would gather pace until the start of Ramazan , then slow down , and pick up again after Eidul Fitr . It would be a hot contest made hotter by the weather . <p> Unlike Punjab where the PML-N and PTI would be dominating the coming election and Sindh where the PPP would face-off the challenge from an alliance of smaller and weaker parties , the contest in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa would be wide open as the ruling PTI , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the revived Muttahida Majlis-i-Amal ( MMA ) and Aftab Sherpao 's Qaumi Watan Party ( QWP ) are all capable of winning enough seats to be able to demand a share in the coalition government that would emerge after the polls . Even the party with a few seats could bargain to become part of the ruling coalition as the mandate would be split . <p> On April 29 , the MMA held its maiden public rally after its revival at the Railway Ground in Mardan . This was the first time since 2008 when the MMA broke up that the JUI-F and Jamaat-i-Islami shared the stage with each other along with the three smaller parties -- Jamiat Ulema-i-Pakistan ( JUP ) , Jamaat Ahle Hadith and Tehrik-i-Islami . Maulana Fazlur Rahman , the JUI-F leader who is also the MMA head , and the JI chief Sirajul Haq were the star speakers at the Mardan public meeting . <p> The MMA performed well in the 2002 general election and managed to form its government in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and became part of the ruling coalition in Balochistan . However @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years later considering the fact that the issues that ensured MMA 's victory then are no longer valid . The MMA 's revival despite lack of cohesiveness among its component parties is a desperate move to avoid defeat in the July 2018 polls as was the case in the 2008 general election . <p> Also on April 29 , ANP leader Asfandyar Wali Khan addressed a public meeting in Upper Dir in the hope of rallying support for the party in an area dominated for years by the Jamaat-i-Islami and PPP . With the PTI having made inroads in Malakand division , which includes Upper Dir , Lower Dir , Chitral , Swat , Shangla , Buner and Malakand districts , the space for the ANP to make its mark has been shrinking . <p> Perhaps no other party in the province has made such timely preparations for the coming polls as the ANP was the first to select its candidates , bring back the estranged activists into the party fold and finalise the issues to be highlighted during the election campaign .

Eidul Fitr would be celebrated after June 16 and that would leave barely a month before the polling day for the election campaign . The political parties and candidates are trying to make use of the time before the advent of Ramazan to run their election campaign . <p> This was the reason five big public meetings were staged in different parts of the country on April 29 , not to mention the Pashtun Tahaffuz Movement ( PTM ) ' s rally in Mingora , Swat the same day to highlight its demands rather than to seek votes .

A significant number of its population comprises workers who either live at the housing provided at brick kilns or in localities a little away from their workplaces . <p> On any given day , they are seen working at the kilns or the surrounding fields from where they bring mud to make bricks . Many of them are visible to the commuters using roads to reach neighbouring destinations because the brick kilns are built in outskirts and open spaces away from the residential areas . The hazardous smoke the chimneys of these brick kilns emit make them unsuitable for these areas . <p> The most vulnerable are the workers who walk to the brick kilns before dawn and fear the risk of being hit by heavy vehicles on badly lit roads . <p> One reason why there is concentration of brick kilns here is the area 's proximity to big cities like Lahore and Faisalabad where construction activity is going on at fast pace .

The presence of undernourished , untidy , and seemingly ill children in the vicinity of brick kilns in Chaapa Minara strengthens this perception . They are children of brick kiln workers who have been barred by their parents or older relatives from going to the brick kilns . If they are spotted by labour inspectors at brick kilns , it would tantamount to violation of the law that prohibits them from engaging in labour . Their presence at the brick kilns during school time clearly shows that the law is being violated . The onus lies on the parents and brick kiln owners to prove otherwise . <p> Certain initiatives were taken by the government in the past few years to improve the situation and end child labour at brick kilns , and enroll children in schools . A law was also enacted for the purpose , and an incentive of Rs1,000 per child per month was announced for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work . It was in a way a partial compensation for the loss of income to the family due to the non-participation of their children in brick-making .

" <p> The children , Bibi says , leave for the fields as early as 3 in the morning , as they are required to extract mud and soften it for brick-making before their elders arrive . This is safe as they are not visible to labour inspectors at this time . <p> Similarly , the children have to carry food for their parents working at brick kilns . <p> Mahar Safdar Ali of Bonded Labour Liberation Front ( BLLF ) Pakistan is of the view that the issue of child labour can not be resolved until and unless the minimum wage rate announced for workers is ensured , they are given social security cover and exempted from deductions under the notorious peshgi ( payment of advance on exploitative payback terms ) system . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ medical and educational facilities , marriage grants for your daughters etc , the workers will not be forced to engage their children in work .

Besides , the labour works at open places in all sorts of weathers that badly affect their health . <p> Hussain says he has visited many brick kilns and prepared a situation paper on the basis of his observations , interviews with workers , and informal discussions with the staff of government departments dealing with brick kilns . <p> He found that " there is no clean drinking water at the brick kilns , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is no suitable place for garbage waste .

@@24619231 <h> When history and art meet <p> On a recent visit to Paris , we were keen to visit the National Picasso Museum , unaware of the fact that it has dedicated an entire exhibition ( from 27 March 2017 to 29 July 2018 ) to only one painting -- ' The story of the famous Guernica ' , created 81 years ago . Having seen the original masterpiece in its permanent location in Madrid , Spain several years ago , we were intrigued by this show . <p> ' Guernica ' is a true scream of Pablo Picasso 's ( 1881-1973 ) heart as he saw his country embroiled in an insufferable war . On 26 April 1937 , German Nazis and Italian fascist troops bombed the ancient Basque town Gernika ( as the Basque spelled it ) . The town was n't armed at all to defend itself against the sixty planes that attacked it with bombs . Over the course of three hours , they destroyed three-quarters of Gernika , killing and wounding hundreds . <p> The monumental Guernica was painted in 1937 . It is an anti-Franco , anti-fascist symbol , as the infamous Spanish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hitler and he led his Nationalist forces to victory against the Republicans during the Spanish Civil War ( 1936-1939 ) that killed hundreds of thousands of his own countrymen . <p> In the Paris show , the genesis of Guernica is presented in the first section of the exhibition that looks at the mural 's origins ; with various sketches and studies , including works commencing from Picasso 's bullfights from the 1930s such as the " Death of a Toreador " ( 1933 ) . In this , Picasso graphically lays out a horse and a bull , and a dying matador , with the horse 's intestines spilling out of its body . When you view the etching " Minotauromachy " ( 1935 ) there is a bull-headed Minotaur ( Picasso 's alter-ego throughout the 1930s ) that he seems to have adapted two years later in the form of Guernica . <p> In January 1937 Picasso had accepted commission for a painting in the Spanish Pavilion of the Paris Exposition . After the attack on the Basque town , Franco 's troops had occupied it , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the city 's history , whereby protestors marched against that attack . The next day , on May 2 , Picasso all but locked himself in his studio on Paris ' rue des Grands Augustins , and began his outrage for the bursting of the Spanish Civil War . He made several preliminary drawings and in the next ten days he was ready to draw on the huge 11-and-a-half-feet tall by 25-and-a-half-feet wide canvas . Around mid June , Picasso delivered the completed black-and-white ' Guernica ' to the Spanish Pavillion . It showed the suffering of people and animals being gored or burned . History and art thus met each other . <p> We discovered a set of works throughout the exhibition dedicated to the painting 's influence and posterity , evoking how Guernica would have been perceived by other artists . There were large-scale spinoffs by contemporary artists . Hanging over the museum 's main staircase , is a large rendering of Guernica made in 2009 , with dripping paint and slightly smeared symbols by the contemporary German painter Tatjana Doll . The British group Art &amp; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a shifting collaboration among conceptual artists , has created a work called ' Picasso 's Guernica in the style of Jackson Pollock ' , which takes up an entire wall of black-and-white paint splatters . There is also American painter and sculptor Robert Longo 's version , and that of French artist Damien Deroubaix . <p> Another interesting part of the show has 28 photographs by Dora Maar of the Guernica masterpiece being created by Picasso . Henriette Theodora Markovic , better known as Dora Maar met Picasso in 1936 through the French poet Paul Eluard . A surrealist photographer of Croatian origin and anti-fascist militant , she encouraged him to make a public political commitment and captured the making of the mural from start to finish . Apparently , Picasso thought of it as capturing the metamorphosis of a painting rather than simply recording the stages . <p> The publisher Christian Zervos commissioned Dora Maar 's photographs of the successive stages of Guernica in anticipation of a special issue of the Cahiers d'Art journal devoted to the future masterpiece . Cahiers d'Art was a unique journal with striking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writers such as Ernest Hemingway and Samuel Beckett also often contributing to it . From 1930 until World War II it concentrated , among others , on the work of Calder , Matisse , Braque , Giacometti and Picasso . Copies of the journal were also on display . <p> Picasso portrayed very few religious scenes . However , he did create a crucification series at the beginning of the 1930s . With its loud use of colour and contorted shapes , this small panel and the preparatory studies that can be seen in his sketchbook reveal some of the essential elements found in Guernica : triangular composition , screaming mouths , women 's howling faces and dead bodies lying in the foreground . <p> Has Guernica , Picasso'soeuvre of madness and violence transcended boundaries of art and instead become an embodiment of peace , as claimed by some critics ? Then how would one read into some of Picasso 's later works ? I was struck by his 1939 oil on canvas , ' Cat catching a Bird ' for example , which seems like a premonition of even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Picasso turned to ferocious and menacing expressions of the tormentor animal -- the cat -- holding a bird in its jaw .

@@24619234 <p> On March 24 , the world witnessed one of the largest student-led protests in history . What had begun as a platform for the teenage victims of the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting massacre to speak out on , burgeoned into a mass demonstration in support of tighter gun control legislation , whose effect reverberated throughout the world . <p> Electronic and social media became alight with photos of these brave students who had the courage to take their leaders head-on . It was a pivotal moment that led to the acknowledgment of an important force in the field : the voice of the students . <p> To me , seeing the governments , organisations , and ordinary people stopping to listen to the younger generation and giving them a chance to speak out , was nothing short of a hallelujah moment . The jubilance , however , was bittersweet . Back in my own country , things were very different . It was as if the global wave perpetuating a new era of student activism had failed to penetrate my territory . <p> Here , the fear of stepping out from the shadows was as strong as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dared to put a toe out of line . The disappointment was overwhelming , more so because it hit home . <p> In 2017 , I was recruited as a country representative for a non-profit organisation called Global Zero that works to eliminate nuclear weapons worldwide . My induction was followed by a five-day training programme in Washington DC where I was taught the basics of activism . While the experience was enlightening , what I really took away from Activism 101 was the realisation that my voice mattered . <p> I landed back home with an empowered mindset , ready to put my training into effect as soon as possible . What I had not anticipated , however , was the obvious : I was no longer in the US . I was in a country where , if you went against the status quo , you were targetted . In asking people to support me in my endeavour to end the very nuclear weapons that , according to them , were holding India back from finishing us off , I was repudiating state-fed facts that had been ingrained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Since I spoke a ' different ' language , my words did not exist in their dictionary , and so they refused to acknowledge them . I was called a traitor and a tool in the hands of the West , by my very own people . The verbal lashings , meant to discourage me , were no surprise . In a country where the majority hates a 15-year-old for demanding her basic right to education , all because she dares to speak out against the norm , I was asking for the same thing . The only difference being , Malala asked for education , and I was asking them to forego the object of their national pride : nuclear weapons . <p> While the response from the people was disheartening , it did not end there . My role in spearheading the anti-nuclear movement placed me in the eyes of state infrastructure that was very much against the spread of such ideas . As a Pakistani , from a very young age , you are exposed to various tools used by the state in an effort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nuclear weapons . Media and academia are two sources through which the state infiltrates the mindset of the citizens and makes them believe what it wants to . Naturally , when something threatens to unwind its carefully monitored structure , the state tries its best to subdue these forces . <p> I got my first taste of this unpleasant truth when my counterpart in India and a close friend , Vibhana , faced a similar situation . A few days before flying out to DC for training , she was informed via sources that authorities in India had instructed some officials to keep a track of her movements and tap into her phone records in an effort to see who she was interacting with . Back in Pakistan , we were often reminded to be cautious as well . The accompanying feeling of invasion of privacy was not only disgusting but extremely scary . The threat of being hurt by my very own government was perhaps the biggest gamble I have had to take when I chose to continue with my mission . While it did not deter me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the news that Global Zero was indefinitely shutting down its operations in South Asia , reached us . The little hope I had left in me about changing the convictions of my countrymen was being snatched away from me . We were told that the organisation faced funding constraints but inferred that considerations about the repressive political climate had also obviously been taken into account whilst this decision was made . It was a clear indication of the impact of this level of censorship and control maintained by the states in both countries . It was a standing monument marking the evident lack of freedom of expression . Most importantly , it was just another example of why student-led activism in Pakistan is still a thing to be talked about only . The political climate does not allow it ; the people do not allow it . For those of us who wish to one day steer the country towards a positive change , it is still a dream in the distant future to go out in the streets and be heard by the decision-makers .

People with high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them lose extra water should seek medical advice before fasting . <p> Older persons and those that work outside in the sun are particularly vulnerable to dehydration . If the body loses too much water then many bad things can happen . Most common and the most dangerous is that the blood pressure will go down causing the person to faint or get dizzy and fall down . There is no real solution for this problem except that during fasting if the person starts feeling extremely thirsty and light headed or dizzy they should seriously consider breaking the fast . <p> The body absorbs all the water that is consumed from the stomach and the intestines and once the water enters the blood stream it will be used up for normal body functions as needed . Drinking a lot of water in the early morning does not help since the water will be immediately absorbed and used up or removed from the body . <p> There are many strategies that have been advocated for decreasing the chance of becoming dehydrated during the fast . Some that work somewhat are to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around longer in the intestines . Most fluids that have some fat and protein content will serve such a purpose . Diluted milk , diluted yogurt , certain soups ( nihari ! ) , watery fruits are all going to hang around longer and give up their water slowly so that more water stays in the body for longer periods of time . <p> However , it is important to emphasise that those performing manual labour in the heat will tend to lose water in spite of any strategy . The same is true of professional athletes especially if they play in the sun and in the heat . Professional athletes can not perform at peak efficiency if they are fasting and especially if they do not consume adequate amount of fluids . <p> What I said about athletes is undeniable and anybody that says otherwise is incorrect . In my opinion professional athletes have to make a choice between fasting and playing . Perhaps an appropriate ' fatwa ' from the appropriate religious authorities might be in order . <p> There is one aspect of the month of fasting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that are not fasting or are too old , too young or too sick to fast should have public access to food and especially to water . <p> In recent years there were many deaths during the month of fasting that could be attributed to the fact that drinking water is not available to ordinary people especially to labourers working in public spaces . Clearly when the temperature hits the high forties , people working in the open under the sun may need water just to be able not just to keep working but to survive . <p> In a previous article on this issue I had suggested that the mosques all over our cities should take the lead in this matter and provide drinking water to the public during the fasting period . <p> And no , drinking or eating in front of those that are fasting is not an insult to them but a test of the strength of their resolve . <p> The author served as professor and chairman , department of cardiac surgery , King Edward Medical University . 
@@24619238 <h> How the commander got away with murder <p> Would you be interested in reading about a murder case that took place six decades ago in India and which was discussed predominantly in the newspapers of that era ? Yes , considering the murderer and the murdered were high-profile individuals , a Bollywood film Rustom featuring Akshay Kumar was based on the case and its verdict changed the way cases were decided in courts . Interesting , is n't it ? <p> Bachi Karkaria 's In Hot Blood -- The Nanavati Case That Shook India takes you down memory lane when Mumbai did n't have gangsters but socialites who spent their evenings in parties ; when the elite was discussed only by those who were rich enough to be closer to them ; when India was a developing country , immediately after Independence . It discusses intricate details of the famed Nanavati Vs The State case that revolved around the simple plot of a man killing his wife 's lover . However , the man here was Commander Kawas Manekshaw Nanavati , a decorated soldier while the victim was Prem Ahuja , a Sindhi businessman and a known ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contention between the two , sided with her husband but had to migrate later to avoid ' being trolled ' in modern words . <p> You might know a little about the case if you have seen Rustom , but according to this book , the case was altogether different from how it was depicted on the screen . The accused did n't argue his case like the film , there was a mistrial instead of an acquittal and the wife and kids of Kawas Nanavati stayed at her in-laws rather than at her own place . But that 's the one aspect from the point of view of cine-goers ; those interested in history will get to know that paparazzi in India was born with that case as one community ( the Parsis ) supported their man while the others ( the Sindhis ) claimed that it was a premeditated murder instead of self-defense . <p> As soon as you start reading the book , you 'll discover that the case revolved around the life of three individuals -- an honorable husband , an exotic foreign wife and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the author has spoken to all directly involved with the case ( and still alive , that is ) to come up with her own conclusions . It was n't a Sindhi vs Parsi case anymore because the man accused to be the killer claimed to have done it in self-defense and had answers for everything the lawyer threw at him . His wife testified in court and stayed strong despite cross examination , something that many praised during that era and even admire today . <p> The case was contested by the best lawyers in India and became a landmark because the jury found the commander not guilty ; that one verdict changed the way cases were decided in India . It went onto be known as the last case decided by a jury in India and even inspired as many as three Bollywood films including Sunil Dutt 's Yeh Raaste Hain Pyar Ke , Vinod Khanna 's Achanak and Akshay Kumar 's Rustom . The book also talks about the trauma faced by Sylvia , the commander 's wife and how she managed to raise her kids @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she chose to settle abroad once her husband was pardoned . <p> Bachi Karkaria 's book is not like any other murder mystery because it happened in reality ; you get to know how Prem Ahuja 's sister Mamie got the best lawyer to observe the case , how the whole Parsi community stood behind their own , how R. K. Karanjia 's Blitz openly supported Nanavati and even affected the jury 's verdict or how the business community cashed in with their ingenuity . Views from those who were present at the hearing , who were class fellows of the victim 's children , who played an important part in getting a favorable verdict is what makes this book outstanding . <p> The writer must be commended for presenting the viewpoint of both the parties -- in the book Prem is not just the villain and Kawas was n't just the protagonist ; the other side of their life was discussed so as to give the audience a neutral perspective .

" <p> However , this article was published back in 1914 , and even now to be recognised and practice as a nurse , one needs to go through a lot of troubles to fight many social barriers . The age old ideology about the profession of nursing in Pakistan still lingers which does n't regard being a nurse as prestigious as it would for a doctor , engineer , lawyer etc . Specifically in the KP province , nursing is considered as a profession for the lower strata @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both ends meet . The affluent class finds it beneath them to send their children to this particular profession . Also , not being provided with the basic rights , training and education in the field is another de-motivating factor . <p> Every year , International Nurses Day is observed around the world on 12th May which is also the birthday of renowned English nurse , Florence Nightingale - a pioneer of modern nursing , who changed its face , making it a well-respected medical profession . This year as well , the day was observed to acknowledge the role of nurses in the healthcare system . Keeping this in mind , this week You ! brings forward a few success stories of brave nurses from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province , who entered and survived in the profession regardless of hardships they endured . <p> As the American Journal of Nursing suggests , the profession should be given respect because nurses play an integral part in the recovery of patients . They make a patient comfortable in bed . Also , monitoring all aspects of the patient care , for instance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ families of patients are just a few of their prime responsibilities . However , in KP , nurses are facing the problems of gender discrimination , family pressure , stressful work environment and unorganised service structure . According to renowned health journalist , Noman Jan , " Eliminating the stigma of gender discrimination from our society is need of the hour because we ca n't progress in health sector without this . " We must accept the reality that men and women are the basic pillars of the society and it ca n't develop without decreasing gap between the two . It is rather deplorable that nurses are not being given due status in the society . Due to the conventional mindset , nurses face a number of problems during duty hours , including sense of insecurity and harassment on the part of their male counterparts and other people coming to the hospital . " <p> Also according to the sources , their salaries are lower than the nurses of Punjab and other areas , and a large number of them face unavailability of facilitated accommodation at hospitals . Although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Act ( MTI ) , 2015 , still many nurses are unsatisfied with it . <p> As health education among public is unsatisfactory in the province and majority of the common people are unaware of the protocols of treatment at hospitals and health centres , they treat nurses inhumanly while interacting with them . The ratio of nurses to patients is also very low , which is why nurses are unable to provide their services in a professional way . This situation also affects their behaviour and many times patients and their attendants complain against them . <p> Despite all these problems and hurdles in the field of nursing in KP , we have some stories in which nurses have proved themselves successful and are now happy and prosperous . <p> Dynamic &amp; dedicated <p> Anwar Sultana works at Hayatabad Medical Complex , Peshawar , and is the general secretary of Nursing Association .

" There was no concept of education in my family . I struggled a lot to join nursing because of my relatives ' mindset ; however , my father and other family members strongly supported me , " she tells <p> Nurses are expected to play various roles depending on the situation . These include being the caregivers , well-wishers and mentors , but Sultana has something to add , " Our people continue to hold negative views about nurses . Whenever our female relatives are admitted in the hospital , our first priority is to ensure that a female nurse looks after her . The irony is that we do n't allow our own daughters and sisters to join the nursing profession . When will this dual standard end ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , why is it considered dishonourable when a close female relative wants to become a nurse ? " <p> Sultana believes that the presence of a nurse , no doubt , is a ray of hope for a patient and the role of nurses can not be eliminated from the healthcare system at any cost . This is the thought that keeps her going in a profession which is registered by the society in a positive way . <p> The one who broke the chains <p> Ms Mehtab , a senior nurse residing in Bannu district of KP , works at Hayatabad Medical Complex , Peshawar . She is the senior vice president of Nursing Association , Khyber Pakhtunkhwa . Besides doing B.Sc ( Nursing ) , she also acquired Masters in Public Health ( MPH ) and other relevant diplomas .

We decided to help them but soon learnt that they were bonded labour who had escaped from the clutches of their local landlords and preferred living in sub human conditions in the city rather than being victims of the landowner 's tyranny in the villages . They were a mixed community of Muslims , Christians , and mostly Hindus . Regretfully , one of our members , an educationist owning a prestigious school of her own , emphasised vehemently that we should not help people who are n't Muslims and rather help ' our own ' .

Having lived and worked in the area , I was quite astonished by the whole news because the first time I visited the region , it was a different picture . Majority of the population included Hindus but along with Muslims they lived together in harmony . Just like a page from history ... <p> The sight at Tharparkar was pleasant . Living amongst the locals was wonderful with each community respecting the others ' customs and beliefs .

I realised that one could easily fall in love with the place because of the people 's resilience , their ancient culture - unspoilt with the ravages of time - and even the harshness of the desert . <p> Interestingly , there are around two million Hindus - 90 per cent are Sindhis in Sindh province - living in Pakistan . Hindu temples are all over the country , with at least 2 in every major city . In Sukkur alone , I know a minimum of 6 at least . Hindus of Pakistan are very organised , not isolated and spread out .

" <p> In cities where there is education , there is peaceful coexistence for most of the time . There are temples and churches , nicely maintained . Christians and Hindus study with Muslims in schools and colleges . In the enlightened portion of our society , a Muslim would even be pleased to greet and meet people from other religions .

Often , a dispute , unrelated to religion like money etc , will be turned into one by spreading rumours in order to seek revenge . Something similar happened to a poor Christian couple recently . The husband had a financial dispute with his employee . Apparently to seek revenge , the employee used a local Imam to spread rumours that the man had desecrated the Quran .

@@24970230 <h> Seat adjustments <p> Against all the odds and conspiracy theories , Pakistan received good news this week with the announcement that general elections will be held on July 25 , 2018 for the National Assembly and four provincial assemblies . Amidst the preparations for the polls , political parties have been considering the allocation of tickets to their potential candidates . <p> While parties are going through this critical juncture , they should consider limiting candidates to one per constituency . The proposal merits thought as fielding the same candidate in multiple constituencies results in many problems . Such candidates can only retain one seat and have to surrender other seats if they win more than one . This firstly puts an unnecessary budgetary burden on the national exchequer . Secondly , when candidates pick one seat and vacate other seats they won , they reject mandates given to them by voters , which undermines respect of the voters . Thirdly , it can potentially result in loss of party mandates and cause delays in the formation of the government . Let 's explore these arguments further based on the empirical data , where available . <p> In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seat , which involved 49 national and provincial assembly seats . Imran Khan ran from four constituencies and won three seats out of them . Nawaz Sharif won the two seats he contested from . Shahbaz Sharif won one National Assembly seat and two provincial assembly seats in Punjab . Maulana Fazlur Rehman contested on three National Assembly seats while Javed Hashmi ran from Multan and Islamabad for membership of the National Assembly . <p> As per the constitution , they retained only one seat of their choosing and surrendered other seats . Therefore , the Election Commission was required to conduct by-elections on 26 national and provincial assemblies ' seats on August 22 , 2013 . <p> In its report on 2013 elections , the commission shows that it spent about Rs55 million on by-elections to 26 seats vacated by candidates running on multiple seats . The cost was more than double of what the commission spent on by-elections after 2008 -- it had incurred approximately Rs21 million on by-elections for 25 seats vacated in 2008 for similar reasons . This cost could be higher in 2018 elections due @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of polling stations to be established in each constituency as per the Elections Act 2017 . <p> Looking at numbers from 2013 elections , out of by-elections on 11 National Assembly seats , 5 were retained by same parties whose candidates vacated them , whereas 5 were won by another party -- one seat was vacated by an independent candidate . <p> Contesting on multiple seats also affects voters ' representations in elected houses . As electors vote for a particular candidate or a party , when they vacate those seats , it affects their representation as the seat remains vacant until a by-election is held -- for about a period of three months at least ( in 2013 by-elections were held on 22 August whereas , the National Assembly started functioning in early June 2013 ) . The situation can also affect the formation of the government as it can affect the majority of a party or a coalition . Secondly , when a candidate vacates a seat , s/he also rejects the mandate s/he has got from the voters . Voters invest time to make choices and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Therefore , such practices could also undermine the engagement between voters and parliamentarians . Empirical evidence suggests that candidates and parties pay a price for this . <p> Looking at numbers from 2013 elections , out of by-elections on 11 National Assembly seats , 5 were retained by same parties whose candidates vacated them , whereas 5 were won by another party -- one seat was vacated by an independent candidate . Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf ( PTI ) vacated five seats ( two out of three won by Imran Khan , and one each by Asad Qaiser and Javed Hashmi . In the subsequent by-elections , PTI lost both seats vacated by Imran Khan , one each to Awami National Party ( NA-1 Peshawar ) and Pakistan Muslim League Nawaz ( PML-N ) -- ( NA-71 Mianwali ) . <p> Maulana Fazlur Rehman , chief of Jamiat-e-Ulema Islam ( JUI-F ) , vacated two National Assembly seats and lost them both to the PTI candidates in subsequent by-elections . In case of by-elections for Punjab Assembly seats , the PML-N lost two seats to PTI and Pakistan Peoples ' Party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vacated by Shahbaz Sharif and was won by a PTI 's candidate . <p> While there could be multiple reasons behind such loss of seats , some analysts have often argued that voters do not take it well when candidates/parties do not respect their mandate and reject them in by-elections . Due to all these reasons , the proposal to legally limit candidacy to one seat per person remained under discussion in the Parliamentary Committee on Electoral Reforms . However , no legal reforms were made in this regard . But nothing in the legal framework prevents parties from limiting their candidates to run from only one constituency . <p> Can there be reasons for fielding candidates in multiple constituencies ? Indeed there are . As some analysts have argued candidacy of high profile politicians remains vulnerable to conspiracies and they can be disqualified during nomination process or rigged out of a seat . Therefore , if they run from multiple seats , they would have backup options . There is some merit to this claim ; for example in 2008 elections , papers of Shahbaz Sharif and Nawaz Sharif @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But those elections were held under a different regime ; in 2013 this situation was hardly observed against any leading politician , except for General Pervez Musharraf . <p> It also appears that most of these leaders tend to win most of the seats they contest from . So they have high chances of winning the elections even when running from one seat . Additionally , the new election law , Elections Act 2017 , has introduced many safeguards and transparency requirements which could potentially guard against any such apprehensions that parties or candidates might have . Therefore , there are valid reasons supporting the proposal to limit candidacy to one constituency . <p> With such merits to limiting candidates to single constituencies , parties can consider implementing this proposal . By doing so , they will not only reduce the burden on the scarce taxpayers ' money but they will also give respect to the voters ' mandate . It will also contribute towards augmenting engagement between parties and voters and avoid risks for potential delays in the formation of new governments .

@@24970239 <h> Can academic diaspora help Pakistan ? <p> Recently Pakistan Institute of Development Economics had hosted an interesting panel discussion with the theme : Brain and Brawn for Change . During this session , the author along with other panelists argued that for the foreseeable future , Pakistani diaspora will continue to play an important role in national development . However , we have only narrowly looked at the diaspora ; perhaps as a source of remittances from abroad , which help Pakistan 's foreign exchange reserves particularly in times of balance of payments crises . <p> This myopic view has unfortunately not allowed the state institutions to look into strengths of highly skilled workers -- which helped them to move and settle abroad . These strengths relate to the knowledge , experience and overall intellectual power of such persons who are an asset for any country where they happen to reside . Perhaps the most neglected of the types is the academic diaspora which includes intelligent and highly resourceful Pakistanis working abroad in the fields of medical , engineering , law , economics and areas of natural , social and behavioural sciences . <p> This year all political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manifestos . Almost all of them will promise science and technological developments . They will talk about how important it is for the country to now invest in developing an understanding of rapidly changing technologies around artificial intelligence , robotics , and blockchain . Almost all manifestos will touch upon socio-economic benefits of fourth industrial revolution . However , none of these otherwise well-intentioned documents will inform us ' who in Pakistan will deliver all this ? ' <p> Perhaps the answer to this question lies with Pakistan 's academic diaspora . All state institutions requiring ideas and help with implementing some of the above mentioned complex technologies can reach out to Pakistanis abroad . However , such efforts at individual level usually have limited impact on national development . There would be so many vice chancellors , professors and other academicians of Pakistani origin abroad who can lend their knowledge ( e.g. through channels of mentoring ) however such brains need to be viewed as part of the overall human capital of Pakistan . They need to be demonstrated that their advice is respected and implemented for change in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living abroad the government of PML-N had introduced Asaan Remittance Account and M-wallets . But what schemes could be formulated by the next government to attract ideas , knowledge and experiences of Pakistanis living abroad ? <p> To start with , it is important that our foreign office and embassies abroad see academic diaspora as ambassadors who can correct perceptions about Pakistan . Years of violence in the region and resulting law and order difficulties for Pakistan have in turn shaped a doubtful image of the sixth largest population in the world . The foreigners , including potential investors , see several parts of the country unsafe for long term engagement . The recent successes towards achieving peace in the country need to be communicated . Perhaps Pakistanis in foreign think tanks and universities could help . <p> Second , in a survey conducted by the Sustainable Development Policy Institute ( SDPI ) , academic diaspora expressed a deep sense of frustration in light of their past experience in dealing with public institutions . For example , several academics from abroad revealed how time to time Planning Commission had reached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ development plans and sectoral policies . However , despite of significant hand holding provided by such individuals , Planning Commission 's own follow up was weak . On several occasions the policies for which input was provided never saw light of the day . Even the inputs provided were lost owing to lack of knowledge management systems all across the federal ministries and provincial departments . <p> To avoid losing such minds it is important to connect academic diaspora with tertiary education institutions -- known to have better institutional memory and ability to connect with foreign professionals . The role of such diaspora should be clearly defined in national and sub-national innovation policies . <p> Third , the academic diaspora needs to view the government as a credible partner to engage with . This can only happen if top leadership leads the way in this direction . For example , during the first year of Prime Minister Modi in office , he went abroad to meet with the Indian diaspora thrice ; with a key objective to persuade many of them to experiment their ideas in collaboration ( e.g. through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , just like globally reputed universities are known to have alumni offices to coordinate with graduates abroad , both China and India have set up national institutions to coordinate and follow up with academic diaspora . Such a national institution should have a three pronged goal to : a ) act as the first window for engagement with academic diaspora and provide necessary information and follow up services ; b ) continuously strive to strengthen state-diaspora relationship through instruments already available with foreign missions abroad ; and c ) mobilize diaspora 's intellectual capital . This should be easy at least in countries where Pakistani diaspora may already face several types of discrimination . <p> Fifth , the next government should focus on financially supporting networking among academic diaspora . This will provide sustainability to networks and associations set up by Pakistanis abroad ; ultimately giving them recurrent opportunities to come together and identify how they will collectively help Pakistan 's development . China started providing such support several decades back and continues to do so until today . <p> Sixth , to effectively seek sector-specific knowledge it is important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Institutions such as the Overseas Pakistani Foundation may be facilitated by the government to establish a database on such lines . The Higher Education Commission can help in this regard as it already has established contacts with foreign faculty abroad . <p> Seventh , we need to explore the reasons as to why it remains difficult to convince academic diaspora to come back to Pakistan perhaps even for sabbatical reasons . One way to address some of these reasons may be to provide a place ( and effective voice ) to this highly educated diaspora on the policy table . Perhaps Planning Commission and provincial Planning &amp; Development Departments can invite adjunct positions where Pakistanis from abroad could come and deliver their services on short to medium term contracts . <p> As Pakistan completes ten years of continued democracy this month , it is important to recognize the services of Pakistan 's enduring professionals abroad .

These strategies may work and result in temporary gain but they will not help sustain the industry in the longer run . If the cinema business remains unstable , we might witness cinema houses shutting down , resulting in a major decline for our film industry .

The so-called backstop proposal was published after a last-minute wrangle over the wording with Brexit Secretary David Davis , who was reported to consider resigning unless it included a time limit . Brussels has proposed that Northern Ireland stay aligned with the EU until another way is found to avoid customs checks with the Republic of Ireland after Brexit . London has rejected this plan as unacceptable , offering instead a " temporary customs arrangement " for the whole of Britain that would " maintain the status quo for traders in respect of customs processes " .

" Britain is leaving the European Union in March 2019 but has agreed a transition period where its position remains largely the same until December 2020 . The EU 's chief negotiator , Michel Barnier , welcomed the publication of the plan , saying on Twitter that it would be examined with three questions in mind . " Is it a workable solution to avoid a hard border ? Does it respect the integrity of the SM/CU ( single market / customs union ) ? Is it an all-weather backstop ?

" After weeks of the government negotiating with itself , the fudged document they have produced does n't engage with any of the key Brexit dilemmas , " he said . " It is highly unlikely to lead to anything but more gridlock in the ongoing talks with the EU . " May also held separate meetings on Thursday with Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson and International Trade Secretary Liam Fox , both leading eurosceptics .

Between December 2016 and May 2018 , the people of FATA waited for implementation of these reforms . Yet , these reforms were unnecessarily delayed , making the entire process dubious and frustrating the tribal people . However , on May 25 , 2018 , the FATA merger bill was placed before the Parliament and was hastily passed with a two-third majority . <p> The FATA bill was passed with a national consensus . However , there was np consensus of the people of the concerned area . Meaning FATA was merged with Khyber Pakhtunkhawa ( KP ) without going through the appropriate process .

Such an approach against tribal Pashtuns would further aggravate the situation and damage Pakistan ? ? ? s already tarnished image . <p> At this point , the state must rethink its old strategy against such movements in Pakistan . There are massive political , constitutional , social and developmental crises in the tribal areas , meaning this conflict must be resolved before it creates rift within the country that can not be bridged and diplomatic embarrassment internationally . The way out is to rethink this ill-conceived merger and reforms . <p> It is important to address the grievances of PTM by establishing a peace commission @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ensure peace and stability in the tribal areas <p> Conflicts need resolution , and this can only be achieved by addressing all the contentious issues .

PTM has extended the battlefield of problems of FATA to the rest of the Pashtun areas , thus making it more difficult to negotiate . While the presence of the Taliban after so many military operations is also a source of deep concern for the future of peace in FATA . <p> It is thus important to address the grievances of PTM by establishing a peace commission .

It is also important to re-define the terms of agreement between the tribal areas and Pakistan as previously they were defined between MA Jinnah and Bannu Tribal Jirga in 1948 .

But if I remain silent and ignore some of the genuine threats I anticipate , then I worry I may be doing great injustice to my professional responsibilities . <p> Now that the election schedule has been announced and all institutions and departments have given assurances , I have the confidence to highlight some of the threats that could prove dangerous if left unaddressed . <p> First : keeping in view the external and internal security environment , I am worried that the coming election could end up being very violent -- due to Afghanistan-based militants and their supporters in Pakistan . The worry is that these forces will try to disrupt the election with full strength -- not only in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa -- with which Fata has now been merged -- but in other provinces as well . Moreover , I suspect that our enemies will have made full preparations for this . Unfortunately , the Taliban and Isis will look at the next parliamentary election in Afghanistan as a direct target .

@@25341235 <h> Email <p> The 2013 general elections , the tenth since 1970 , had offered the country a reason to rejoice because for the first time in history , a democratically-elected government had managed to complete its tenure and hand over the reins of power to the one elected next . <p> This was no small feat , but the triumph , however , was marred by the fact that despite a successful democratic transition , true civilian rule remained a distant dream . <p> Within months following the 2008 elections , dictator retired General Pervez Musharraf had to vacate the presidency as parliament made no bones about its intention to impeach the former military ruler . But that only drew the curtains on the establishment 's overt rule . <p> They had a lot many invisible tools at hand to distort and subjugate the democratic discourse , and employed all of them unashamedly . The Pakistan Peoples Party ( PPP ) of Asif Ali Zardari managed to make it to the finish line , completely bruised and battered . <p> But the glass-half-full part of the story is that the outgoing parliament was determined enough to pass the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and instituted requisite structures for equitable distribution of resources among the federating provinces . This was by all measures historic , probably as momentous as the passage of the democratic Constitution back in 1973 . <p> The constitutional reforms introduced a unique-to-Pakistan system of caretaker government as a transitional buffer between successive elected governments . The caretaker set-ups , since their introduction by General Ziaul Haq , were used not only to influence electoral outcomes but also to pre-empt and dictate elected governments in important policy matters . <p> The 20th Amendment severed the caretakers ' links with the presidency . They are now not handpicked by the president ; instead the responsibility rests with parliamentary parties . The parliament thus attempted to shut this ' window of opportunity ' for the interventionist establishment . <p> The new system was used for 2013 elections for the first time and though it may not qualify as a perfect solution , it did serve its basic purpose . <p> Extremist violence continued to mar the election environment . In the 40-day period preceding polling on May 11 , 2013 , the country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ average . These were mostly claimed by the Taliban who had declared the ' secular ' PPP , Awami National Party ( ANP ) and the Muttahida Qaumi Movement ( MQM ) as their legitimate targets . <p> While the environment of fear put these parties to disadvantage , it utterly failed to cow the voter . They came out in droves . The turnout in 2013 was a healthy 54.9 per cent ; 10.5pc points more than in 2008 . It was also the highest turnout after the first general elections of 1970 . This can easily be interpreted as a sign of growing confidence of electors in a democracy . <p> Voters in Punjab gave an unequivocal verdict in favour of the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz ( PML-N ) . The party more than doubled its vote bank , compared to previous elections , and won in 129 of the country 's 272 constituencies ; with 120 of these coming from Punjab alone . As 19 independents also joined the PML-N after winning , it easily formed governments in Punjab and the Centre . <p> The PPP was wiped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to reinvent itself in its old bastion , after a setback in 1997 , proved to be futile . Its vote bank in Punjab shrank from six million in 2008 to just 2.5m in 2013 , bringing its seat tally to a humiliating three national and seven provincial victories in Punjab . The party was effectively limited to Sindh where it secured a little over half of the national and provincial seats and formed the government in the province . <p> Also 2013 bid farewell to the ' king 's party ' -- the Pakistan Muslim League-Quaid -- that was cobbled up by Gen Musharraf . It won only two national seats in Punjab . <p> From the rubble of the PPP in Punjab , rose the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf ( PTI ) . Although the new party 's seat tally of six national and 23 provincial wins in Punjab was anything but impressive , it did mop up a good number of votes -- 7.68m to be exact -- of which around five million came from Punjab . This helped it outshine the PPP as the main opposition party in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parliament . <p> The voters in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa lived up to their reputation of being highly susceptible to the incumbency factor -- electing a different party in every election . They gambled over the PTI , giving it 34 of the 94 provincial assembly seats . The PTI formed a coalition government with Jamaat-i-Islami and others , and the province provided the PTI the foothold it needed to stake claims of being the chief opponent of the rulers at the Centre and in Punjab . <p> Karachi remained unsurprisingly beholden to its old choice -- the MQM -- although the PTI came close to threatening its grip over the metropolis . The alliance that had bestowed religious parties with a five-year rule in Pakhtunkhwa in 2002 , likewise , remained elusive . The religious parties , though , sustained their hold over their niche constituencies . <p> Published in Dawn , June 27th , 2018 <p> For more live updates , follow Dawn.com 's official news Instagram account @dawn.today

The remark was made by the former CM while he was addressing the delegations from the Youth Business Forum and the representatives of minorities in Karachi . The existential threat identified for Pakistan in the statement due to dependency on India is particularly in reference to the current issue of water scarcity . For the past few years , the issue of water scarcity in South Asia , particularly Pakistan has been highlighted by various national and international organisations . While the NASA Satellite Data unveiled the fact in 2015 , that the underground aquifer of the Indus Basin is the " second-most stressed in the world " , the issue grabbed public attention in Pakistan particularly in 2017 after Pakistan Council for Research in Water Resources predicted an alarming situation that Pakistan " could run dry by 2025 " if no significant measures were taken and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now looming overhead and the issue of water scarcity has grabbed public attention , many political leaders have highlighted the issue in their agendas and manifestoes in order to turn the public opinion in their favor .

The leaders of both the parties , Imran Khan and Syed Khursheed Ahmed Shah have raised their voices against the inaction and negligence of the government regarding the issue of water scarcity and have vowed to resolve the issue once they come to power . In accordance with this , the attention given to the issue of water scarcity and the vow to construct Bhasha Dam after coming to power , expresses another attempt to turn the public opinion in his favor by addressing an issue which has recently become a widespread common concern . <p> Moreover , the statement which unambiguously expressed the unreliability of India as a fellow indicates a shift in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2013-2017 ) Nawaz Sharif , with the exception of few incidents where the Indo-Pak relations had stooped to the lower ebb ( after the Pathankot Air Base and Uri Attacks ) , has taken significant measures and has pushed the limits to improve relations with India . At times , Nawaz has faced sheer criticism from the authorities for the pro-Indian stance he held and the limits he pushed to improve relations with the neighbouring country . <p> Beginning from 2014 , Nawaz Sharif congratulated BJP for its impressive victory in the Indian general elections , completely ignoring the fact that a major part of the election campaign of BJP was its explicit anti-Pakistan stance . Former PM also went to attend the inauguration ceremony of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi , which was the first time in the history of Pakistan and India since their independence in 1947 .

@@25475238 <h> Dwindling bond liquidity means Italy shock may be just a warning tremor <p> Italy 's recent bond market shock and pricing lurch was at least partly a function of years of attrition in global bond trading -- and it may be a precursor to bigger debt market bust-ups , according to investors . <p> Liquidity -- the ease with which assets can be bought or sold without moving the price sharply -- has fallen across bond markets over the past decade . <p> One reason is regulatory change introduced to prevent a repeat of 2008 's serial banking collapses . Another is intervention by major central banks through quantitative easing ( QE ) -- massive bond-buying programmes . <p> A big concern for years has been that another major world market hiatus would once again expose the vulnerability at the financial system 's core , amplifying any global selloff . <p> Liquidity hiccups have already roiled emerging and junk-rated bonds in recent years . But Italy 's upheaval at the end of May showed that parts of the vast , historically stable market for Western sovereign bonds has also become prone to seizure whenever turbulence strikes . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liquidity comes at a price , " Arnaud-Guilhem Lamy , a fund manager at BNP Paribas , said . <p> Euro zone government bond trading volumes have nearly halved in the past four years to 676 billion euros in June , from 1.29 trillion euros in June 2014 , data from Trax , a unit of bond trading platform MarketAxess , showed . <p> Meanwhile , the bid-offer spread -- the difference between prices investors quote to buy and sell , a common liquidity gauge -- remains low but has widened . Even for Germany 's 10-year Bund , the region 's most-traded bond , bid-offer levels on cash prices are now 15 to 30 cents , compared with 5 to 10 cents from 2013 to 2015 . <p> Some of that slide was caused by the European Central Bank .

There is an urgent need to rectify the situation . <p> Sadly , the emerging scenario if not stalled , may probably cause the labeling of the holding of forthcoming elections as short of accepted standards to our collective chagrin-- the least the country can afford in the face of challenges both within and without . The allegations of interference may reverberate with intensity during the coming days with degree of credibility as the elections dates get closer . <p> This is the time that the Election Commission of Pakistan , the caretaker government including the state institutions , may address the poisonous misgivings flying thick and high . Inaction may pave the way of perception ballooning bigger than reality with inevitable dangerous ramifications . But , the unabated deafening silence is disparagingly irritating . The all-powerful Election Commission may rectify the situation fast because any lackluster response may inflict the ultimate nightmare to the whole electoral process . The nation may not be able to bear the burden of the collateral damage . <p> Chairman Bilawal Bhutto made it abundantly clear to all when he categorically declared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Karachi press Club , ' censored and manipulated democracy is not acceptable ' . PPP firmly believes that democracy is the only way forward to build and progress Pakistan as per vision of the Father of the Nation and the founding father of the Party . This commitment of the Party has been highlighted in the manifesto that may remain in the forefront of its election campaign . Its indispensability is above board because two great Bhuttos sacrificed their lives for the empowerment of the poor masse of the country . The PPP and its workers will preserve the legacy of their great leaders at all cost . Today , Pakistan is heading towards second democratic transition in the country that greatly owes to the sacrifice of Shaheed Benzir Bhutto who successfully marginalized the anti-democratic forces to restore democracy in Pakistan , and thank goodness it is continuing against all odds . <p> Fortunately , Pakistan People 's Party is well- placed in the country 's political arena , holding the balance to suit the principled politics . It has the vision , resolve and commitment to abort pernicious tendencies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relentless movement striving for the political and socio-economic upward mobility of the poor and marginalized people of Pakistan . In the present perspective , the challenge is indeed full of hazards in the face of deeply entrenched forces of status-quo , authoritarianism and extremism . However , these challenges do not scare the leaders and workers of the PPP and instead bolstered their morale to resist the anti-people forces as they are sure of the inevitability of the victory . In fact , the existence of stubborn reactionary forces provides the requisite stimulus to Party rank and file to delegitimize and dismantle the ugly pillars of exploiters who have been fleecing the poor without compunction . The Party leadership seems getting ready finally to urge the ( ECP ) to put its house in order without delay as voices are being raised consistently from myriad directions of wrong doings . <p> The Party election manifesto , 2018 , also flagged the reaffirmation of the commitment to the continuation and strengthening of democracy as the highest priority . Its untiring struggle for steering the national statecraft to the desired direction in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hay ' ( BB 's promise must be fulfilled to save Pakistan ) . The baton for the accomplishment of the mission has been handed over to Chairman Bilawal Bhutto who is the heir of legacies of the two Great Bhutto . He expressed his unwavering commitment during his ongoing election campaign to complete the mission of the two Shaheed Bhuttos no matter the cost . The people of the country have been responding to his call enthusiastically in his election rallies in the province of Sindh and beyond . His message is getting through among the people as was evident from their spontaneous response in the affirmation . <p> The PPP 's manifesto , 2018 , is indeed heavily tilted in favor of the ' voiceless , shirtless and shoeless class of society ' that had been subjected to want and deprivation due to the wrong policies of the PML ( N ) government widening the gap between the haves and have-nots . Totally devoid of social justice was the salient feature of the economic policies of the PML ( N ) government . No serious planning was undertaken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the society while the predatory elite continued to build elevations on the ruins of the god forsaken overwhelming majority . The ill-aboding continued staring in their faces . <p> The PPP stands committed to improve the lot of this section of the society . Its future government , according to the manifesto , will create sizeable job opportunities for the youth in particular for which Employment Bureau will be established . The Party also committed one year internship for all educated youth to provide them breathing space to find suitable job during the given period . The PPP development strategy had always been the creation of massive job opportunities and meeting the imperative of sustainable growth should go hand in hand to make win win situation for the employers and the employees . Employers and employees are indispensable to each other because without employers there can be no employees and vice versa . No other Party of the country understands better this linkage than the PPP . <p> Pakistan has an agriculture economy , and it is flagged as the very important segment of the PPP manifesto . Attaining the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hope without developing full spectrum of the agriculture sector . Fully understanding the importance of agriculture sector , the PPP always introduced famers ' friendly policies as part of planning and development strategy . The last PPP government led by Syed Yusaf Raza Gilani increased the wheat support price almost double leading to not only attaining self-sufficiency in the commodity produce but also surplus was available to maintain strategic reserves . It may be mentioned that earlier during General Musharraf tenure Pakistan had been importing wheat worth millions of dollars to meet domestic food requirements . One decision of the elected Prime Minister of PPP proved as the magic wand . <p> This time if the PPP is voted to power , plans to introduce Kissan Card that will entitle the farmers availability of subsidy on fertilizer without the bureaucratic hassle of any type . The PML ( N ) government 's step motherly treatment to the agriculture sector forced the farmers ' community to resort to back to back protests . The government did too little too late that too half-heartedly at the end of its tenure . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steep fall in our exports . Its snowball impact on the country 's industries especially agro-based industries was devastating . The exports during the last years of PPP government touched the staggering figures of 25 billion dollars while during PML ( N ) government it was 21 billion dollars resulting in trade imbalance and correspondingly hitting the foreign exchange reserves crippling the country 's capacity to meet international financial obligations . <p> The manifesto also underlined the importance of improving relations with neighboring countries to get the country out of the diplomatic isolation that had befallen on the country due to the obvious reasons . It may not be a bit of exaggeration to conclude that Pakistan 's standing at the international level was at the lowest ebb for which PML ( N ) government was responsible that did not even appoint Foreign Minister . How unfortunate that Pakistan today is known for all the wrong reasons ? The placement of Pakistan in the ' grey list ' of FATF spoke volumes of the miserable image the country carries at the world stage . The world wrongly recognizes Pakistan more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suffering huge losses both in blood and treasure . The PPP manifesto unfolds the strategy to take bold and honest strategic initiatives based on clarity to be partner of international community in fighting out the dangers those are perceived potent threat to its peace and security .

" Answer : No . No one including Nawaz Sharif . Firstly , two generations were asked for accountability . Nawaz 's father 's reference was brought about in the case by Nawaz himself and his brother . Secondly , the court proceedings left no room for doubt that massive corruption had been done . Just because Nawaz hid any direct evidence of the crime - neither means they did n't commit the crime , nor that the crime did n't take place .

Both PPP and PML N have lost mandate and like MQM , they have become only regional parties leaving the ground for PTI and other parties to vie for the power .

However , the candidates of mainstream political parties and independents belong to the same class and they have same class interests to exploit the people . Perhaps , in some constituencies , new faces might win but they will not be able to bring any significant change for the betterment of the people .

I feel Allah had chosen this profession for me . Because I have a degree in Engineering , so I never thought I would opt for writing as a profession . I also feel that I did not choose writing , writing chose me . I had this natural inclination towards writing ever since I was in school . I loved writing and creating stories in my head , came very naturally to me . I had written some stories growing up , but just as a hobby . I never got them published anywhere .

Only because I got to spend a lot time travelling to Japan and Italy so I picked up these languages pretty fast . <p> How about poetry ? Have you ever considered giving it a shot ? <p> I doubt if I can express myself writing poetry . Maybe as a child , I must have written a poem or two , but being an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can .

When you were in the process of writing say ? Humsafar , did you expect it to attract so much attention and fandom ? <p> Not at all . And I also feel when you pursue something which is close to your heart , with the intention for it to be a hit and for it to win awards , then you can not be natural . <p> What has inspired you to write these beautiful and acclaimed stories ?

The PTI government will soon be starting the planning process for shaping Naya Pakistan and they need to pay attention to restructuring the prevailing planning machinery , architecture and processes . <p> Gone are the days when only the planning agencies within the public sector used to plan and shape the future of nations . This is now an inclusive and dynamic process . Many agents in their private and social capacity are actively forging the future that makes it an exciting time to be in this country . However , our public sector is too cornered and isolated now to obtain sufficient information about the grassroots-level changes to foresee the future and to plan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world around us is too fast to be grasped by a select group of bureaucrats and politicians . These are the reasons that five-year plans by the Planning Commission of Pakistan become insignificant the day those are unveiled . The public sector should now come forward with the role of an enabler to facilitate a variety of actors to shape a promising Pakistan . <p> The so-called consultative meetings can achieve nothing by only inviting a narrow group of stakeholders . The spirit of designing and implementing a collective action lies in authority , control and partnerships . Public-sector officials mostly hold meetings with the private sector and other actors with strong lobbying influence . But I seldom see public officials ' participation in events organised by the private sector , academic , and/or civil society organisations aside from delivering a routine speech . Hence , the public sector is totally disconnected from the developments happening in society . <p> More often than not , governments engage economists for economic planning without realising that economy is just one piece of the puzzle of socioeconomic development of a society . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and shaping a promising future of the country . Scientists , sociologists , political leaders , entrepreneurs , young voices , minorities , marginalised regions and many other segments of society need to come forward to make planning a dynamic process . It is fair to allow for difference of opinion and diversity , but there needs to be a consensus on broad direction and rules of engagements among the key agents involved in the game . <p> The current bifurcation of sectors such as agriculture , industry and services -- that economists and the public sector alike pursue in the development plans have become irrelevant . This scheme of understanding the economy and its growth is redundant for planning ahead . Education , public health , social justice , cities , science , entrepreneurship , 4th industrial revolution , regional peace , social cohesion and capacity of institutions are some of the key areas where we need to have a national dialogue . <p> The starting point for planning Naya Pakistan will be to transform the planning apparatus in the country which was developed in 1960s and could not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Commission should be transformed into a lean and efficient organisation undertaking approval and monitoring of only key mega projects having total allocations of over 300 billion or so . Below this limit , ministries and divisions should be empowered to undertake in-house approvals and monitoring . Most of the sectoral chiefs and planning staff currently working in the Planning Commission should be posted to the relevant line ministries . Ministries and divisions need to be empowered financially to develop strategic plans for their own operations . The Ministry of Interprovincial Coordination should be abolished , and the mandate of supporting the Council of Common Interests should be handed over to the transformed Planning Commission . Alongside monitoring mega projects and support to the CCI , provinces , the third pillar of the planning commission , should be to evolve as a place of higher wisdom and knowledge hub for Pakistan 's transformation . There is also a need to revive evaluation capacities of the Planning Commission to give better directions to our budgetary priorities and expenditures . This capacity has always been in the Planning Commission but was deliberately undermined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ budgetary decisions of the politicians in power . Finally , the Ministry of Planning , Development and Reforms should also be abolished , and the Planning Commission should work directly under the prime minister .

What does the road from good intentions to actual change look like for the PTI and Naya Pakistan ? <p> We overestimate the impact a leader can make in a society . Our favourite national pastime is to blame all our problems on corrupt leaders but they only deserve a part of the blame ( especially when less than 1.5 million citizens file taxes in a country of 200 million people ) . The truth is that there 's a little of the corrupt inside all of us too but not all of us have the opportunity to be corrupt on a larger stage . The difference between corruption at the highest levels in government and us slipping some cash to the traffic cop for talking on the mobile while driving is in the scale of corruption . Both showcase a moral weakness that is the cause of so much pain in our society . <p> In this context , electing Imran Khan represents a step up for the Pakistani society . If we all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also have a bit of Imran living inside us . He 's self-centered but with a heart of pure gold and good intentions .

There is no better mirror to our society -- with all its beauty and flaws -- than our prime minister-in-waiting . <p> Imran Khan may be a man with good intentions but good intentions are n't good enough to lead a country . Competence is just as important . The absence of corruption ( if we can get there ) does n't automatically translate into development and progress .

Electing an incorruptible leader is the beginning , not the end of this journey . The real transformation in Pakistan needs to happen inside us all . We need a cultural shift where we celebrate paying tax and honesty , versus glorifying the ability to accumulate wealth and power . This is n't on our leaders ; it 's on us . <p> What Imran can do for us is be the spark that brings about this cultural change . One can feel a positive change in the mood of the country since his election . The rupee strengthened versus the dollar and the stock market rose . Even though these are cosmetic moves because the fundamentals of our economy have n't changed , they signal a shift in sentiment . Many analysts are arguing that Imran has six months to deliver . The truth is that Imran ca n't deliver much in six months or even five years .

For 70 years , dishonesty and opportunism has been rewarded in the country while honesty and hard work has been mocked . Being jugaru runs in our blood . We have to rewire our brains much like a drug addict or chain smoker needs to reprogramme his brain to change his life . We need to build new pathways to happiness . In the beginning , we 'll end up paying more tax in Naya Pakistan . We need to celebrate that versus berate our leaders .

Even in such conditions , Mandela maintained his dignity and composure . <p> Mandela spent the last few years of his incarceration in a jail on the outskirts of Cape Town . In his book , Walking to Freedom , he mentions how his every move was under surveillance and he had practically no privacy .

This is evidenced by groups such as the Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan ( TLP ) , which as expected objected to Dr Mian 's appointment , not recognising the disconnect between publicly protesting news of a possible blasphemous cartoon competition and inciting religious hatred towards a particular group for upholding different beliefs . Though , of course , it was not the religious right alone that played the bigotry card ; whatever the PPP 's Shehla Raza might say in terms of an incompetent social media team and fake accounts .

The results of those efforts are showing up in both the ranking of Chinese universities ( 11 of the top 100 globally ) and in scholarly output . " China 's contribution to global scientific output has increased manifold in the last few years . Even if the Chinese quality of research were currently inferior to that of the US with their dogged determination they would catch up in the years ahead . <p> Successive Indian governments have also laid great emphasis on S&amp;T and encouraged their students to benefit from the academic excellence of some of the top universities of North America , such as , Stanford , McGill and MIT , etc . Not surprising that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ students . One has to give credit to the foresight of leaders like Nehru who chose to prioritise on benefiting from the US in education than seeking military assistance as we did from 1950 to the 1980s . <p> India has excelled in the field of IT and ranks among the five top startup countries in the world . America 's leading software giants Microsoft and Google have Indian-Americans heading them . <p> South Korea is another brilliant example of a country where its leaders by prioritising science and engineering became one of the leading economic powers . In the early 1950s South Korea 's per capita income was about the same as that of Pakistan . Now it is nearly six times higher and is a ranking member of G-20 countries with flagship products in the field of electronics , automobiles and civil nuclear plants . <p> An area we seriously need to reexamine is national priorities . The question needs to be deliberated is , can Pakistan achieve a higher level of economic progress , social cohesion and political stability without a sound educational and scientific base ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resources ever liberate us from the debt trap ? Pakistan 's lack of investment in education and all human development has mainly contributed towards the current state of decline . The type and quality of education being imparted does not promote original thinking . In this all governments have been neglectful or shown their helplessness . As economic pressures piled up their emphasis was on wading through the economic mess rather than focus on education . Other weakness is that students are encouraged to learn by rote rather than through critical thinking . This goes against the very spirit of science . <p> While the new government justifiably is focusing on the immediate challenge of handling the impending economic crisis , it should soon address human resource development of which science and technology is a critical component . <p> Falling exports and increasing reliance on imports is a manifestation of Pakistan 's inability to keep pace with technological advancements . <p> The neglect of the Pakistan Steel Mills and several other technical enterprises like the HMC and Machine Tool Factory was a classic case of how successive governments have mismanaged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These entities were also used as parking places for unwanted technocrats and managers , and to accommodate favourites without consideration of their qualifications .

Another reason for the lack of development of science and engineering is how society respects and treats its scientists and engineers . In countries where feudal mindset reigns supreme and where custodians of state authority , whether it is the civil service , police or the military , embody state power and can use it relatively with ease scientists and engineers are pushed in the background . It is not sheer coincidence that leading economic and military powers are countries that have consistently promoted science and technology and value these professions and are continuously engaged in ensuring their excellence . <p> We have only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who were in the forefront of our nuclear programme .

This shows if Pakistani scientists and engineers receive quality education and are provided an amiable environment they could perform as well as their counterparts abroad and contribute to nation-building .

Until there is no justice for violators , women will continue to be soft targets . Unless the judicial system dominated by men is not gender sensitised women will suffer . <p> Engage men in public policies to change laws against violence against women . Since it is men who perpetrate discrimination in workplaces , government and in the fields , they must be part of the dialogue . Conversely , women telling men what to do and how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awareness , but hardly translates into impactful legislation and implementation . Men block them .

In Pakistan , people who hold irrigation ministries , go ahead and run sports or even religious affairs portfolios . I urge the government to put in charge of women , those who have not held , say , waste-management portfolios . Employ leaders instead who certifiably understand the pain of human rights violations . <p> Let there be a revolution of women ? ? ? s rights over their own bodies . Move away from the 10th-century model where women were regulated for having women bodies . Let them love , marry and have children as they please . Don ? ? ? t punish them for changing their minds . Holding women ? ? ? s bodies sacred is immoral because , if men were regulated this way , it would drive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not permitted to be angry . When I say command over bodies , it includes the brain . Let women nourish their thoughts and cognitive concepts as ambassadors of this country . Not as relics . The GDP will go up , honour killings will go down and motherhood , which this society values , will be in its healthiest form . <p> Lastly , abolish and eliminate parallel legal systems and informal dispute-resolution mechanisms that discriminate against women . Think of jirgas or panchayats as the place where women and young girls go to be killed . Hardly is there a decision from these male-only self-appointed jurists that allow a woman to walk away without being gang-raped , ripped off dignity or killed . <p> Once we do some or all of this we can go back to the national debate about cookies , helicopter rides and cheese import bans . <h> Facebook Conversations <h> Reader Comments ( 1 ) <p> Women should hold adult literacy classes for other women .

@@60040234 <p> The government is moving from talking the talk to walking the walk . In previous days there had been much speculation in the media that there would be no unpopular fiscal adjustments prior to the local elections -- and it was incorrect . On Monday , September 17th , natural gas prices were increased by up to 143 per cent in order to recover Rs94 billion from consumers , at a stroke slashing the subsidies of the last government almost to zero . The knock-on effect is going to be an increase in the financial viability of the gas companies , along with a likely increase in headline inflation and a virtually certain increase in the price of numerous commodities . Electricity is going to cost more possibly by as much as 12 per cent , and the effects of the adjustment in gas prices are going to be quickly felt . <p> This is not tinkering at the edges of reform , this is walking with the big boots on and it is a risky move .

The rise for those in the lowest slab is 10 per cent , and it is only those in the highest slab of domestic consumers that are going to be stung for the full 143 per cent , but there are going to be a lot of unhappy customers by the time the next gas bill arrives . <p> The big gas companies had been haemorrhaging money to the tune of Rs152 billion . This will hopefully drop to Rs58 billion but with natural gas reserves depleting fast the future for the industry is bleak in the long term and Pakistan needs to revise and update the entire power sector , a hard reality indeed . A sense of unreality has become embedded across successive governments , where real prices of utilities such as gas and electricity have been masked by ever-more crippling subsidies . This was unsustainable and the buck has finally stopped at the door of the new government . Strong footwear advised .

Following a shock upset of world number one Simona Halep in the first round , the 44th-ranked Kanepi had looked a potential trouble spot for the six-times US Open champion .

But having taken her first set against Williams in five career meetings , there would not be a second . Just as quickly as the momentum swung to Kanepi , it returned to Williams in the third set as the 36-year-old American broke her opponent at the first opportunity and jumped out to a 3-0 lead before cruising to victory . <p> " It was n't easy , obviously , I think one thing she did well was change her strategy and started doing just a completely different game and gave me a different look to her game , " explained Williams , who laid down 18 aces .

Every year there are promises to come back again before the zeal of the first time fizzles away , leaving the event a one time occurance . <p> As far as first time events go , the Madeeha Gauhar Theatre Festival ticks all the right boxes .

A collection of traditional craft , awards and accolades , and dresses worn by the late activist were also presented as the audience showed great interest in the items . <p> For the opening ceremony , a short documentary highlighting the personal and professional facets of Gauhar 's life was screened . Officialy opening the festival , Shahid Mehmood Nadeem welcomed the guests and dedicated the festival to Gauhar , saying she left behind a rich and vast legacy of socially meaningful theatre .

After all , they finished the day at 255 for 3 , thanks to a 205-run opening stand from Mohammad Hafeez and Imam-ul-Haq . They made Australia wait for the opening wicket in the first innings of a Test longer than they 've ever done -- 63 overs , to be precise . <p> And yet , anyone who tuned into the final session would have wondered how Pakistan had amassed those runs , so complete was the Australian bowlers ' command . Pakistan scored 56 runs in 29 overs for the loss of three wickets in that session on an attrition first day in Dubai . <p> Test cricket in the UAE is a game of phases . In other parts of the world , it might be harder for teams to get back into the game once they 've fallen behind , but surfaces here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even as Hafeez , who scored a century in his first Test in two years , and Imam accumulated the fifth-highest opening stand batting first against Australia , the visitors ' bowlers came roaring back into the contest , with a chance of bowling Pakistan out under 350 . <p> It began with Nathan Lyon , expected to grow in importance as the game and the pitch wears on , tempting Imam to cut a ball that was a bit too full , drawing a faint edge through to Tim Paine . At the other end , Peter Siddle bowled a scintillating spell , justifying his inclusion in the side . Vicious reverse swing combined with relentless accuracy slowed down Pakistan 's merry progress . Siddle finally got one to beat Hafeez 's defences , with a beauty that just kept coming in , hitting the opener halfway up his shin , right in front of middle . <p> With both openers gone , Pakistan 's scoring rate almost ground to a halt altogether -- at one stage , they managed 16 runs in 16 overs as Haris Sohail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through to stumps . All that work , however , was undone by a moment of madness from Azhar . Having gutted his way to 18 off 79 , he lofted a drive off Jon Holland , nowhere near middling it as Mitchell Starc dived forward to complete the catch . Nightwatchman Mohammad Abbas and Haris took their side to stumps without any further damage . <p> Pakistan had settled into a formidable position by the first evening on a flat Dubai surface , with both openers still around when tea was called . Hafeez , who scored his tenth Test century was instrumental in pushing the run rate up right from the outset , and ensuring the Australians were always on the back foot . He regularly forced the bowlers to adjust their lines and coaxed Tim Paine into introducing spin as early as the ninth over in the day . He was n't afraid to come down the track against spin , either , without losing control of his shots . <p> The run rate picked up after lunch as the openers shook off any nerves or fears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attack . Hafeez also went after Nathan Lyon , who was the most economical bowler for Australia in the first session . There was a period , midway through , when he lost his focus , playing a series of false shots , displaying the concentration lapses that have prevented him taking the next step in his career and becoming the batsman he could have become . While the sun beat down , lady luck , too , was smiling at him , as a lofted cover drive off Holland was put down at long-off . <p> Imam 's innings , meanwhile , was almost chanceless . He appeared to be mentally ready for the grind of Test cricket in this inhospitable weather . His footwork against the spin , in particular , was excellent , moving back and forward to the rhythm of the pitch of the ball with the deft expertise of a tap dancer . However , It was n't just in service of defensive strokes , with a couple of charges down the pitch against Holland earning him two sixes . <p> Australia bowled well despite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much of the day , getting swing early on while regularly coming close to finding Hafeez 's outside edge . The odd yorker kept the batsmen on their toes , and on another day in another country , he might have finished with a five-wicket haul . Here , he ended the day wicketless . <p> But the day would end on a very different note . Life seemed to have crept back into this pitch , and , by extension , this Test match .

Pakistan 's total debt in 1971 , he said , stood at merely Rs30 billion , a time when the country had witnessed the construction of mega projects like Mangla and Terbela dams as well as other infrastructure projects . <p> Similarly , Imran Khan pointed out , the country 's power sector circular debt swelled to Rs 1,200 billion from Rs 230 billion in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the previous government of PML-N even consumed Rs40 billion from the Workers Welfare Fund as well as the funds for the Pakistan Steel Mills . <p> The previous provincial government of Punjab also mismanaged various accounts and heads , he said .

They are making hue and cry just to save them from the accountability as the huge amount embezzled by them would be exposed after the audit , " he added . <p> Giving an outline of his government 's economic policies , Imran Khan said they were trying to strengthen the trade institutions , helping exporters to make them competitive and attracting investors through a one-window operation coupled with the measures towards ease of doing business in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on increasing foreign remittances through various incentives for the overseas Pakistanis so that they send their remittances through banking channels . <p> The prime minister said his government 's initiative of constructing five million houses for the homeless people would give a big push to 40 allied industries and attract heavy investment besides creating business and job opportunities for the youth . He indicated that in the coming days , he would introduce a special package aimed at curbing poverty and bringing the poor into a safety net .

@@60200230 <p> We 've witnessed a series of unfortunate events these past 10 days . It all started with the Coke Studio version of ' Ko Ko Korina , ' performed by Ahad Raza Mir and Momina Mustehsan and the hell that broke loose on social media in its aftermath . Hira Mani gave a two-part interview to Samina Peerzada , which offended the moralist in everyone , but then her husband Mani decided that he needed to make headlines too and posted the unthinkable on his Instagram page . Nida Yasir 's morning show exposed the worst possible kind of programming by exploiting a little boy and his misbehavior . Mansha Pasha took it upon herself to instruct women in the entertainment industry to learn how to talk better and Sadaf Kanwal -- one of the three people Mansha appeared to have addressed ( she did n't name anyone ) -- bit back . Khalil ur Rehman Qamar made headlines when he said that working with Urwa Hocane was " a scary experience " and Urwa eventually responded , albeit graciously . All that was a lot to digest . <p> This entire scenario confirmed the fact that more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In London earlier this month , I met up with BBC Asia Network journalist Haroon Rashid and having interviewed stars on both sides of the border , he spoke about the one difference that he 'd noticed in every interview . Most public figures around the world knew what to say and when to stop , how to respond and how to refrain from commenting ; that skill still had n't been introduced to Pakistan 's upcoming stars yet . <p> When judged on the spectrum of bad songs , the Coke Studio cover of ' Ko Ko Korina ' was n't even the worst one has heard on the program . It was bad but one can come up with several songs ( on CS alone ) that can be categorized as worse . But we are a nation of over emotional people ; we loved and appreciated Ahad Raza Mir ( perhaps more than merited ) in Yaqeen Ka Safar , and then we hated him with the same passion when he disappointed with his singing skills . If he was okay with the praise he should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opinion in neither situation was balanced . The same applies to Momina . But the hysteria would have died down in 48 hours had Momina and Ahad both refrained from responding and engaging on social media , something they did . It just went on to show how two young stars -- with very little work to their credit -- had become so big in their heads that they could n't tolerate criticism of any kind . Their reaction was perhaps worse than their song . <p> Hira Mani 's interview with Samina Peerzada is an issue that requires an entire column to evaluate independently , so I 'll move on to her husband Mani 's Instagram post , which frankly shocked the human ( let alone feminist ) in us all . Putting up a picture of Tarana Burke , founder of the global Me Too movement , Mani wrote : ' Do n't know who touched her and why . ' I 'm actually at a loss of words to express how offensive this post is ; not only does it reveal Mani as a complete misogynist but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ misogynist would not be reckless enough to shout it out from a rooftop . Mani eventually removed the post and in an apology blamed it on his ' PR guy ' . Even if we believe him , which we do n't , I would like to know who handles Mani 's PR so that someone can be taken to task for flaunting this despicable mentality . <p> Morning shows and their lack of ethics , again , is a subject that merits its own column . <p> What caught my eye and attention was Mansha Pasha 's tweet . She was n't wrong when she said that the women of this industry need to learn to speak better . <p> " From stole my husband from ' my best friend and cheated on my fiancee , to jab Me Too hota hai ussi waqt kiyon nahi boltein ' , to quotes from Uncle Ben and your friendly neighbourhood spider-man , " she tweeted on October 22 . " The women of this industry need to step up and learn to speak better . " Mansha did n't name anyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kanwal and Momina Mustehsan for everything they have been saying . <p> Sadaf Kanwal unnecessarily decided to react and respond and it all became publicity fodder . <p> Mansha was n't wrong , but it was n't very wise or dignified of her to speak of her own fraternity in a derogatory manner . It 's just not something you do . Case in point is Kangana Ranaut in India ; she may be right about many things she says -- especially when it comes to sexual harassment and gender equalities ( these are issues that must be discussed so that working conditions can improve for women ) but did she really need to make personal statements about working with Shahid Kapoor ; she said he had mood swings on set , treated her like she was a suicide bomber and that it was unpleasant to kiss him because of his thick moustache . All this information -- revealed on an episode of Koffee with Karan -- grabbed headlines . <p> " With all due respect , I had a good time doing the film . I 've been working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyone . I choose not to discuss my problems in print . Some discretion is welcome , " the 36-year-old actor responded in an interview with Filmfare .

I do n't believe in publicizing a film or myself through this kind of activity . " <p> I have to agree with Shahid and do n't even think it was mature of Mansha Pasha , or in another case , Khalil ur Rehman Qamar to make personal comments on co-stars . Anything said that has no purpose then ends up as gossip and media fodder . <p> Back to the issue at hand , it 's obvious that most celebrities with international exposure -- Mahira Khan and Fawad Khan especially -- know what to say , what not to say and when not to say anything , especially on social media or to the press . Most of the rest of the industry , it seems , is all too eager @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may do while putting themselves there .

The goal provider Dar jumped in jubilation but in the process dislocated his knee and he had to be carried off the ground . This was a major blow for he was responsible for no less than eight of the total eleven goals scored by Pakistan in the pool matches . A penalty-corner came Pakistan 's way in the second half . As the other penalty corner taker Akhtar ul Islam was already not playing in the match ( debarred for ill-discipline ) , Pakistan 's captain Khalid Mahmood had no option but to call the 19-year-old Munawwar uz Zaman to step forward .

This is not the image of a mother ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have and something sparks them and then it 's a flood of information where we can get all of it off our chest and find like-minded people who are saying the same thing . <p> INTERVIEWER <p> It 's a conundrum , because while the democratisation of the internet is great and people should be able to say what they want , it tends to encourage a sense of vitriol that can be spewed anonymously without any consequences . <p> MAHER <p> Yes , let 's think about something that 's common : how women get attacked for how they dress , how actresses , models and fashion brands post their images online . Where were you encountering that kind of stuff , say , even 10 years before ? <p> INTERVIEWER <p> I guess tabloids , maybe ? <p> MAHER <p> If you saw photographs , maybe it was in magazines , and only if you were buying those magazines , or maybe you saw them on billboards , but not to the extent that you do now . <p> You were n't exactly getting glimpses of how actresses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their vacations . <p> You just were n't getting that level of information and it was something that one only wondered about . <p> INTERVIEWER <p> Are you referring to that awful Daily Mail section with headlines like ' So-and-so actress looks a little worse for wear ' on a night out and horrible before-and-after photos of models and actresses entering a club early in the evening , along with a shot of them from later on ? The person in question might be a little tipsy and it 's horrible . <p> These are suspicions people have and suddenly , when presented with photographs , people will say , ' I knew it , I was right ' , and this is followed by moral outrage where immediately you on your phone can say , I knew all these actresses were sluts . <p> INTERVIEWER <p> Absolutely . In the Pakistani context , some people upload a video with a photograph on Youtube and be like ' XYZ actress is at a dance party wearing sleeveless ' in an attempt to shame women . <p> MAHER <p> It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your conspiracies about how these " liberal " women or men behave and you 're outraged by it . <p> You can say something and actually have a voice , whereas before , you sat around and gossiped about actresses -- and while you know they get up to stuff , you did n't have information beyond rumours . <p> Now , you get a picture , you share it with 10 of your friends , you 're going to talk about it and say , ' tumnay uski photo dekhi thi , woh dekho Mahira smoke karti hai aur usnay dress pehna hua tha ' Did you see her photos ? See , Mahira smokes and she 's wearing a dress . <p> INTERVIEWER <p> Instagram is particularly bad in this context . For example , they have a page called Modern Pakistani Elites where they put photographs of people wearing various items of clothing and the comments section underneath is just terrible . <p> MAHER <p> If you look at Sunday Times ' Instagram , they 'll post a photograph of an actress on a red carpet at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a gown , and suddenly people will be fighting it out in the comments section . <p> It 's interesting , because there 's this constant back-and-forth going on , where some people will say , ' What does it have to do with you ? ' and ' Let them dress however they want to ' . <p> People will be fighting each other , and the pages hosting these photos do n't need to do much and do n't need to intervene because people are just having conversations . <p> A lot of people who think that a model wearing a dress looks like a slut are n't encountering people in their life who 'll turn around and ask , ' What right do you have to criticise ? ' <p> INTERVIEWER <p> Instagram is worse , because there 's no sense of culpability . Instagram comments do n't turn up on a Google search , so as soon as you type a comment it 's lost in an abyss and nobody can hold you to it unless they screenshot it and publicly shame you , which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm fascinated by the stuff we 're doing online . <p> INTERVIEWER <p> It 's terrifying , but coming to Mufti sahab , this self-styled ' sexy man of God ' goes from being the man who publicly berates Veena Malik to someone presents himself as a quasi-liberal maulvi . What was your interaction with him like ? <p> I might be projecting but it initially felt as if there was a mild sense of discomfort when he said , ' qareeb aa ke beth jayen ' Please come sit closer . Maybe , that was just me experiencing discomfort . <p> MAHER <p> Oh no , that was very strange . <p> I do n't think he thinks of himself as a quasi-liberal maulvi , but he wants to come across as sympathetic . <p> He wants to be seen as someone who knows how men think and , specifically , how men think about relationships , sex or their love lives . <p> INTERVIEWER <p> Not liberal but a " frank " maulvi . <p> MAHER <p> Exactly , that 's the word he loved : frankness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most full-on interviews I have done . It went on for around seven hours with this man constantly talking and there were maybe 10 or 15 minutes in between when I was n't with him . <p> It was definitely pretty intense , and when he told me to come sit next to him , you get clues into the kind of person that he is and how you can get him to start talking ; how you can get him to be comfortable and what he thrives on . <p> He thrives on attention and he thrives on women behaving a certain way towards him , women needing him for help or advice , for example . <p> *** <p> Read an extract below from Maher 's book <p> The Sensational Life And Death Of Qandeel Baloch . <p> As the DRF training sessions continued , Nighat started to hear from girls who were attending them . The messages would arrive late at night , on her personal Facebook account and the Hamara Internet account . They were desperate : ' If you do n't reply to me in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' one girl said . These girls were being blackmailed , harassed or threatened online and they did not know whom to turn to . Often , Nighat used her contacts in the tech world or within social media companies to try to resolve problems . She would speak with the girls for days , counselling them or providing emotional support .

@@60268231 <p> The death of two children in Karachi after eating at a popular restaurant and then having sweets at a roadside vendor have once again put into question the role of the government in monitoring the quality of food served to the public . <p> While the police try to solve the riddle of the deaths of the two children , one must question the role played by the Sindh Food Authority , which otherwise seems to lie dormant as restaurants and food sellers seem to sell whatever they want . <p> The facts of this ill-fated case are as follows . A family had dined out at a high-end restaurant , located on Zamzama Boulevard , in DHA Phase V , Karachi , and had later consumed candy from a shop outside an amusement facility on Sea View . The children and their mother reached home around 2am . Their health deteriorated at around 6am , but they did not reach the hospital until after 1pm the next day . <p> Both children had complained of stomach aches and had vomited . It was at this point that their mother , who had also taken ill , decided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the children passed away en route to the hospital while the other died during treatment . One can only wonder what they ate . <p> The Sindh Food Authority ( SFA ) claimed to have found expired meat products from a warehouse that they said was being used to store the inventory of the restaurant where the children ate . <p> The restaurant has been sealed . It seems the biggest discovery by the police has been that meat found to have been imported in 2014 and according to the inscription on the packets and supposed to have been used by February 2015 was being served to patrons . <p> Further investigations reveal that it may have been the milk that the family drank after coming back home that may have been the cause of death . Samples taken by the police have been sent to different laboratories but so far there has been no conclusive evidence to blame one or the other . <p> In all this , one question remains : where was the Sindh Food Authority all this time ? It seems that for most parts this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tragic incidents happen . <p> If one looks at its previous record , its officials seem more interested in settling the case and not doing their job .

Nothing came about of the case and the police buried it . A TV personality was hired by the fast food joint to protect their image and that made it more difficult to seek justice . <p> How long can we continue like this ?

Does the authority not have the mandate to check what restaurants are serving ? <p> Why do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the public to get the food authority to spring into action . It is time for us to examine more carefully how and what we are served at restaurants and public places in the name of food . <p> Various news reports suggest that much of what we eat at public places and restaurants is not fit for human consumption . The focus of the authorities remains on some of the high- profile international chains when its attention should be on the local food vendors and restaurants . <p> Inspectors usually end up lining their pockets instead . There is no accountability on the performance of the relevant departments as we saw in the Kinza case . After the initial hue and cry , the matter was hushed up and the police and the relevant government department made money . <p> How long would it take for our leaders to wake up to this ?

@@60282232 <h> ' SBP to launch standardized financial QR codes by Dec-2018 ' <p> Syed Sohail Javaad is currently serving as the Director , Payment Systems at the State Bank of Pakistan ( SBP ) . He is a career central banker with more than 15 years of experience of working with the SBP . His experience varies broadly , with emphasis in areas of IT systems ' implementation , treasury operations and payment systems , Payment Systems Operators and Service Providers ( PSOs/PSPs ) , and SBP 's Real Time Gross Settlement System ( RTGS ) of the country . In this interview with BR Research , Sohail talks about the regulatory environment for electronic payments , specifically relating to Electronic Money Institutions and the digital on-boarding of retail merchants . Edited excerpts are produced below : <p> BR Research : Could you give us a background to the recently-introduced Electronic Money Institutions ( EMI ) regulations and explain how they are different from the already-existing rules for Payment Systems Operators/Payment Service Providers ( PSO/PSP ) ? <p> Syed Sohail Javaad : We had issued Rules for PSOs/PSPs in October 2014 to develop an environment for efficient , convenient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Those rules had spelled out the entry criteria for prospective PSOs/PSPs , but we adopted a more flexible approach and played an enabling regulatory role to classify the business models of PSOs/PSPs because of the realization that this was an ever-emerging field . <p> PSOs/PSPs were prohibited to hold the customer funds under the rules , therefore the SBP decided to develop a separate regulatory framework for e-money institutions . With the issuance of Regulations for E-Money Institutions , the non-bank market players in the private sector would be able to attract and hold customer funds and channelize payment transactions through digital means . <p> In the case of fintechs especially , we noticed young energetic entrepreneurs and start-ups go out in the market , talk to merchants and industries and come up with solutions . But when they go to the banks , the banks are n't always receptive ; therefore their ideas can not materialize . The EMI Regulations aim to fill that gap , and to authorize e-money institutions that , unlike PSO/PSPs , can actually take money from people and then issue payment instruments against those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ EMIs could compete in ? <p> SSJ : The field is quite open at the moment . They could get into a variety of business areas ; the biggest business appears to be the aggregation of merchants , whether it is online merchants or brick and mortar . They can also do bill aggregations . But the possibility is limitless ; for instance , the SME sector does not have an invoice-processing capability , or they ask schools to issue ' chalaans ' and collect money from parents against a collection fee . The growth trajectory could be such that newspaper delivery boys and milk sellers can collect their bills via digital methods . <p> BRR : Who will bear the cost of payment ? Will it be free of cost as it is in many other parts of the world ? <p> SSJ : The most expensive cost of payment is cash ; in my personal opinion , it 's about 3 percent of the transaction cost . The only difference is that the cost of cash is being absorbed either by the SBP or by the banks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The bank consumer , receiver or payer , does not face the burden of that cost . <p> This changes when it comes to digital payments , where there are elements like merchant discount rate , interchange , payment scheme fee etc . In this case , the cost could range from 1.5 percent to 2.5 percent , under a mechanism which is fairly complex . <p> But to answer your question of whether a free payment can take place , it absolutely can . For instance , if an EMI offers a cash management solution to a merchant or corporate , then it can also earn float income through those cash flows and thereby allow itself the room to provide free-of-cost payment solution . <p> Value-added service concept is also important . In the case of mobile wallet , for instance , the wallet itself may not be the core proposition . The core proposition could be a value-added product or service like network of taxis , bike riders or food stores that could create a wallet for receiving payments against their service . <p> BRR : Some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the start-ups because they are small and can not bring so much money to the table ? How would you respond to those concerns ? <p> SSJ : The Rs200 million capital requirements is set for financially sound and serious entities because this critical business entails money handling and payment processing along with information security and technology . That amount of regulatory capital ensures that robust systems are being used to process huge volume of payment transactions and also ensures security of the system . Besides , no one expects the start-ups to come up with Rs200 million , which is why there are venture capitalists in this world . <p> BRR : Do the rules allow cross-border payments as well ? <p> SSJ : We have not allowed cross-border payments as yet . But with e-money , if somebody has a good business proposal and wants to carry out cross-border payments or bring in remittances , then it could be considered by the State Bank of Pakistan . <p> BRR : Are there any companies that are already looking to launch EMIs ? <p> SSJ : Right now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offer their services under the EMI regulations , but it is premature to name any . <p> BRR : Could you share the kind of value-added businesses or business propositions they involve ? <p> SSJ : They are primarily providers of e-money payment instruments like digital wallets and prepaid cards . Apart from these , there could be network owners who already run merchant networks . <p> BRR : Under the EMI rules , the EMIs can not issue e-payment instruments at a discount i.e. issue e-payment instrument that has a monetary value greater than the funds received by customers . Why is that so ? <p> SSJ : The reason is that we do not want the EMIs to involve in money creation , which is why no interest or discounting shall be allowed to be paid to customers . The EMIs ' objective is payments alone ; they can not do any other banking function . <p> BRR : Can EMIs collaborate with a bank ? <p> SSJ : They definitely can . For instance , if an EMI wants to give a cash-out option to its customer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same . Or , for example , in the case of biometrics , if EMIs do n't wish to keep biometric devices themselves , then they can enter into agreements with other players in the eco-system . <p> We are open for facilitation and collaboration of entities , especially for payment purposes and other value-added services . The whole idea behind EMIs is that there was a need for separate entities that could compete or collaborate with banks for payment services . <p> BRR : Could the payments data maintained by EMIs be used in credit scores of businesses , merchants and individuals under the latest CIB regulations ? Especially in the case of businesses because payments could be a proxy for revenue-book in the absence of properly-maintained books of accounts . <p> SSJ : In my personal view , the way we are used to thinking about credit bureaus will change very drastically for us very soon , because now this concept of data repositories is coming about . Now we can bring about all sorts of data under the radar . <p> There is something called key digital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ digital identity . The second step is the EDIs : electronic data interchanges . How we use that digital ID to collate various datasets existing out there to get a picture of your customer and then accordingly offer him or her services . For example , there are concepts like nano lending , micro lending , quick lending , where a financial service provider may want the payment data of bills because the lending amount is so small that it would just want to know an individual 's spending pattern to assess whether or not a customer is living a regular life . Right now , this is n't prevalent , but going forward it will be . <p> So what you are saying is very likely and I think we should be ready for that as well . Basically , every transaction including buying , selling of commodities and rental payments will be attached to your user ID and then we can see it from various dimensions . <p> BRR : What are other digital enablers ? <p> SSJ : There is something called customer consent architecture , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For example , if I am using an app and if I am standing at some point , I should immediately be able to give you as a loan provider my consent to pull out certain data from those datasets and use that data to determine and establish my credibility and then give me money . It 's a bit too early for Pakistan , but we should be prepared for it . <p> BRR : What else is the SBP working on insofar as digital payments is concerned ? <p> SSJ : We are working on two things in addition to EMI regulations . First , we are targeting merchants where we are simplifying merchant on-boarding process . Currently if a merchant goes to a bank or financial institution and wants to be digitally enabled , it has to follow the lots of procedures to become a merchant regardless of the size of business and volume that the merchant is generating . But now we are working on simplifying the process for merchants through creation of different tiers or categories of the merchants . <p> One way towards that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mobile app and open a basic account . This is for smaller merchants who have been given a small limit , say for example Rs15,000 . At least , they will get into the habit to use e-payments at a micro level . Consequently , if a merchant grows and needs to expand the limit then he could go to a location and get their biometric done to identify them and enhance the limit of their account . And if after that a merchant wants to further increase his limit , then he can go to the bank and fulfill the whole set of requirements to become a full-fledged merchant . <p> BRR : Why do merchants still charge 1 to 2 percent on credit card transactions ? It is a major deterrent toward cash-less economy . <p> SSJ : Let me explain how the system works . When a merchant gets a machine , he pays a fee to his bank that has given him the credit card machine . The merchant 's bank has a payment scheme that facilitates this payment mechanism . <p> The merchant 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , say 2 percent , from the merchant . Of that 2 percent , about 0.2 to 0.3 percent goes to the payment scheme . A bigger chunk , about 1.3 percent , goes to the customers ' bank -- the bank that issued the card to the customer -- in the shape of interchange fee . <p> The interchange on classic card used to be 1 to 1.3 percent . But as the bank gives you a better card with more points and discounts , the interchange increases to 2 percent , which that acquirer bank has to pay to the issuer bank . Our market is an issuer market because of this interchange . Over 20 million debit cards exist . Every time your card is swiped , whether debit or credit , this scheme comes into play . <p> For big merchants who give big business to their banks , the acquirer banks do not charge that 2 percent . They only charge it from smaller merchants , many of whom do n't have enough margins , which is why they try to charge 1-2 percent fees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Should n't there be a solution to it considering that most shops in Pakistan are micro , small , and medium enterprises ? <p> SSJ : The solution is there : QR code . And we are working on it . Instead of the machine , you put a printed QR code and customer take a picture of it from the app and the customer 's bank account is debited and the merchant gets the money immediately . The cost of its interchange is expected to be 0.5 percent which is negligible and can be borne by the merchant . Mastercard and Visa have already launched this platform . <p> So that 's the third thing that we are going to do with e-money and merchants is that we will be standardizing financial QR codes for customers . Right now , we are working on the standardized coding which will be issued by the SBP , using EMVCo QR code , which is a global standard system of QR code , to ensure interoperability of QR payments and promote merchant payments . Once it is rolled out , any customer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it being of any bank or any payment scheme and his or her transaction will be processed . <p> BRR : What are your targeted timelines for these plans ? <p> SSJ : By end of December 2018 , these three things will be issued ; namely EMI , standard QR code and merchant on-boarding . <p> BRR : Does the central bank also have targets for these ; such as XYZ numbers of merchants are targeted to be on-boarded by such and such time ? Can you please share those targets ? <p> SSJ : We have some internal targets which we ca n't share . But on the whole , it is difficult to set such targets mainly because while we want to digitize payment in the economy , we recognize that every payment is actually backed by economic transactions , and majority of our transactions are cash based . Even recording of those transactions are not digital ; for instance , the retailer 's cash-till is not digital . <p> BRR : How can that be fixed ? <p> SSJ : It is beyond SBP 's mandate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of stakeholders from the government and private sector . In Russia , for example , they passed a law that merchants whose business is above a certain threshold must have digital tills . Soon after , the payments of all these merchants became digital .

" This trend is even more pronounced in core inflation , which indicates growing inflationary pressures in the economy , " it said . <p> A disaggregated analysis reveals that this is due to both demand and supply-side factors .

In the present times the same act was repeated by Adolf Hitler through practicing Euthanasia ( the painless killing of a patient suffering from an incurable and painful disease or in an irreversible coma ) . Hitler , during Second World War killed hundreds and thousands of disabled persons applying Euthanasia on them , that he thought a liability on government . <p> This destructive attitude has totally been changed now . It has been acknowledged today that persons with disabilities can contribute lot for themselves and the society at large when empowered with education , rehabilitation and moral support .

All the subscribers who have successfully registered their cell phones with their International Mobile Equipment Identity ( IMEI ) numbers will be able to use them whereas those who have n't done that will have their phones blocked . The said measure has reportedly been taken to discourage smuggling of cell phones and restricting use of phones with fake IMEI numbers , quality specifications below the standards set by PTA . <p> A similar announcement was made in the past and this deadline was extended on the insistence of the Senate Committee on Information Technology . In October , the committee directed PTA to postpone the implementation of cell phone registration system for being too difficult for people to understand and comply with . <p> The mechanism is dependent on an IMEI , which is a unique 15-digit number that identifies different mobile devices on mobile networks . PTA software will use this IMEI number of a phone to verify whether it is compliant , duty paid , according to approved standards and genuine or not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phones that are not compliant but registered with PTA will continue to function but only against the cell numbers of the existing users . This means these phones will not be transferable . Selling them to some other person will not be possible . <p> There is a general perception that most people are still unable to understand the process and therefore refraining from doing what they are expected to . But on the other hand , PTA sources claim it is a very simple process under which the cell phone owners are required to send their phones ' IMEI numbers at a number 8484 . This number will be checked by the Device Identification , Registration and Blocking System 's ( DIRBS ) of PTA and the user will receive a message with certain instructions . The IMEI of the phone can be retrieved from its settings folder or via an sms by dialing *#06# . <p> Fouad Bajwa , an expert on digital security , says there shall be no apprehensions about this move as it is aimed at stopping smuggling and counterfeiting .

Secondly , the seller of smuggled phones has a larger cushion to offer discount to customers and put his rivals at a disadvantageous position . He believes it is time to employ digital and automated systems to detect smuggling and other violations of rules , and replace the conventional manual systems that are not delivering . <p> Bajwa explains that the users who will get the message that their phones are compliant will have nothing to worry about and continue using their sets . Whereas those whose phones are not compliant shall insert the sims they are using in their phones and make calls as per instruction in order to pair their phones with these numbers . One cell phone can be paired with maximum five numbers . The purpose of pairing , he says , is that these cell phones shall work only with these numbers and none others . <p> The pairing of cell phones and sims is important also for the reason that there are thousands of sets with same IMEIs . This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a large number of stolen cell phones could not be blocked because putting one number would lead to blockage of thousands of numbers , says Babar Ali , a deputy superintendant of police based in Lahore . He says as such phones will now be paired with the sims their owners are using and it will be possible to block them in case of theft . <p> Interestingly , this announcement has created an opportunity for some who are charging amounts of money for registering people 's devices . Abdul Hameed , a technician in Kot Lakhpat Area in Lahore , shares it with TNS that some mobile phone service shops are charging around Rs50 to register devices with PTA . A large number of illiterate subscribers seek their advice as they can not either use online option to verify the status of their cell phones or follow the instruction given to them . <p> While users in Pakistan have started complying with these instructions , the international passengers who bring in cell phones from abroad and the overseas Pakistanis who travel back home and hand-carry goods including mobile phones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if they carried cell phones in hand baggage . <p> To clear things , Hammad Azhar , the Minister of State for Revenue , has said that Pakistani expatriates will be allowed to bring in only one mobile phone to the country , per year , free of customs duty as per the new personal baggage rules . A maximum of five phones can be brought under the new regulations in a year . However , customs duty will have to be paid on the extra four handsets to require service in Pakistan beyond 30 days . This means all those incoming passengers with temporary stay plans will be allowed to use their phones without paying duty but only for 30 days . <p> These orders have got response from overseas Pakistanis who demand this limit shall be increased because many overseas Pakistanis come home for two to three months . There are others who question the logic of paying another tax on the mobile phones they have bought from abroad after paying applicable taxes there . <p> Last but not the least , the sellers of mobile phones feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deadline to get their stocks sold off . Tahir Ali , a sales executive at a wholesale mobile shop at Hall Road , tells TNS that many sets with non-compliant IMEIs lying in their showcases and racks will become useless as these could not be paired with any sims . He is hopeful that the deadline will be extended because a huge number of people have not yet registered their phones and will lose connectivity . " They will definitely push the government to give them another chance .

@@60311232 <h> Competing political cultures <p> " Political culture of a nation is the particular distribution of patterns of orientation towards political objects among the members of the nation , " argued Gabriel A. Almond who did ground-breaking work on political culture in his seminal book titled The Civic Culture . The influential American political scientist gave the idea of threefold classification of parochial , subject and participant political cultures . Pakistan has its own mix of subject and participant culture . <p> Political culture is encapsulated in a number of questions . Do people identify with the nation and accept the overall social system ? What is expected of you as a citizen ? What is the appropriate role of a government ? Almond distinguishes among the three types of political culture . <p> Parochial political culture is characterised by the relative absence of expectations by the public from the political system in which there are no specialised political roles such as legislative , executive and judicial . Either centralised order does not exist or it does n't matter . In the subject political culture , a subject , though aware of a differentiated and specialised political system , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less expectation from it . In participant political culture , public , comparatively more aware of the political system , its roles and functions , is an active participant in the political life and has a high level of expectations from the system . <p> The political culture in Pakistan probably combines the values of both subject and participant political cultures . This may have something to do with our peculiar history . There are those who identify with the system and those who do n't . <p> What is the political culture of Pakistan in essence ? <p> Broadly , the two main types of political cultures in the country are either congruent with the existing de jure political structure or its de facto counterpart . One is the hegemonic and undemocratic political culture of nonelected executive type . This culture discourages active participation of the public in politics , especially in instances where the citizens have the temerity to question any ambition of nonelected executive office to act beyond the constitution in our parliamentary democracy . The second type of culture is counter-hegemonic , democratic and constitutional . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might have elements of democratic political culture and vice versa . The undemocratic culture is as much a colonial legacy as is its democratic counterpart . <p> The northwest India , today 's Pakistan , traditionally served as the British security state . Here the colonial administration considered inimical to its interest the extension of representative government . Security concerns , those emanating from Czarist Russia and Afghanistan to the then Indian northwest , triumphed over the notion of political and civil liberties unlike in the rest of British India , today 's India , where British had primarily economic and commercial interests that did not impede the development of democratic ideals there . Pakistan inherited the political culture of supremacy of security over liberty and , by extension , executive over legislature . <p> Even when democracy was conceded some space , every possible step was taken to control and guide it . In its first decade of democratic experience , at least six prime ministers were the minions of forces behind the scenes . <p> From August 1947 to the launch of the first military coup in October @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Except in the case of Liaquat Ali Khan who was assassinated on October 7 , 1951 , rest of the prime ministers were mainly changed through manipulation and behind-the-scene manoeuvrings engineered by power-hungry and ruthless manipulators , the unelected executives in the form of retired bureaucrats . <p> After the assassination of Liaquat Ali Khan , civilian leaders lost initiative to the powerful triumvirate of Governor General Ghulam Muhammad , defence secretary and Pakistan 's first president Iskander Mirza and Commander-in-Chief Ayub Khan who ruled Pakistan from October 1958 to March 1969 . Democracy was at the mercy of ruthless and overambitious ruling clique that had no qualms about imposing its will on the nascent democratic process . <p> Much like our security obsessive , undemocratic culture , our de jure political culture is also a British legacy . Though oppressed , this culture has millions of subscribers who resist and challenge any act that is not permitted by our constitution or parliamentary traditions .

In its first decade of democratic experience , at least six prime ministers were the minions of forces behind the scenes . This trend was only ossified and reinforced but not without some resistance . <p> It is here that our subject and participant political culture combine comes in to play its due role .

But the bad guy does n't stay imprisoned for long .

Unlike the first film , which cleverly used Newt 's alien creatures as an attack on Trump 's anti-immigration policies , the sequel concentrates on building up Grindelwald as a budding Voldemort and Newt as his unlikely nemesis . Redmayne , acting with a bouncy mop of hair and a charming squint , still seems eons away from becoming the conquering hero .

You 'll need a paddle to negotiate the tidal wave of characters and plot developments . But the scope of Rowling 's imaginative reach can not be denied .

Fine for Pottermores , but a trial for us Muggles . Rowling drops intriguing hints that suggest livelier Beasts chapters to come .

Those expecting Cumberbatch to add a little Dr. Strange to his take on Dr. Seuss will be sorely disappointed . Directors Scott Mosier ( making his feature debut ) and Yarrow Cheney ( The Secret Life of Pets ) play it safe straight down the line . Yes , he will dress as Santa Claus to steal all the goodies . But how to make a whole movie out of that ? <p> You do n't , so the script by Michael LeSieur and Tommy Swerdlow brings on the padding . The Grinch gets a backstory to explain how he got grinchy .

@@60311235 <p> Apart from the flair with which he 's played some great characters on the silver screen , Ranveer Singh will always be remembered for his sense of style , albeit as strange as it may be . Bizarre fashion choices aside , he is a veritable dream come true for designers for his ability to carry off simply anything with confidence . And whose dreams was he bringing to fruition lately ? Lahore based designer , Mohsin Naveed Ranjha who launched his fledging brand four years ago . <p> Ranveer Singh wears MNR 's designs on the cover of the December issue of Filmfare magazine ; he shared a photograph on his Instagram and the designer 's phone has n't stopped buzzing since . Even for a king 's ransom -- for that is what it must have cost -- it must have been no easy feat to land the coveted Ranveer Singh . Mohsin says he had been in touch with the actor 's team for the past two years and luckily for him , their plans worked out closer to the #DeepVeer wedding . <p> " I wanted to shoot it for a Pakistani magazine but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brand ambassador for multiple Indian brands and eventually Filmfare came on board , " the designer shared . " There was a long back and forth on what we were going to make and his team did such extensive research on my work as part of a background check . They found pictures of things that even I had forgotten I had made . " MNR really had luck on his side with Ranveer 's upcoming nuptials and the fact that the whole world currently has their eyeballs glued to his social media . The Filmfare team further pushed forward the release date " as it 's a big time for Ranveer " . <p> On the day of the shoot in the summer of this year , Ranveer came on time and was very keen on getting his best angles and the right locations . " He wanted to get the best content out of the shoot , even more than I did , and was a thorough professional about all of it . We even discussed the food in Lahore , Imran Khan , Ali Zafar and Teefa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come to Lahore one day . " Ranjha shared that he would only feel like he was shooting with a celebrity of that caliber when Ranveer would step in front of the camera . Everything seemed to fall into place . <p> " We ( Ranveer Singh ) even discussed the food in Lahore , Imran Khan , Ali Zafar and Teefa in Trouble and he shared that he 'd love to come to Lahore one day , " shares the designer . <p> The actor 's style though , is quite divisive -- his wife now , Deepika mentioned ( on Koffee with Karan ) that his fashion choices are something she merely ' tolerates . ' What were Mohsin 's reasons for planning the shoot with Ranveer for two years straight ? " He 's young , he 's edgy and his personality is such that he can pull off everything . My company and I could n't afford him but we did it because we knew we wanted to have him represent our clothes . " One has to admit that he can pull off a sherwani @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a unitard . <p> The designs that Ranveer wore were edgy and cool but unlike designs that MNR usually puts out . He reveals that the actor 's personal stylist Nitasha Gaurav wanted something quirky and colourful but he was firm about that clashing with his brand identity . " I personally wanted him in something classic with a blend of the east and west along with some embellishment , which is the strongest part of our brand and culture . " In the end , the designs that made it to the cover had textured fabric , strong cuts and a little bit of embellishment . " We are getting a lot of queries on the shoes and jackets and I think people 's curiosity is piqued . " <p> Since the cover 's come out , congratulatory messages have been pouring in and Ranjha is riding high on the energy that comes from Instagram appreciation , from the likes of Deepika Padukone , Sonam Kapoor and Tiger Shroff . However , everything on social media comes with a bang and goes away with a whimper if one does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ move on to the next big story fast . Naysayers say that the reason the brand is making headlines is because Ranjha has paid for it but investing money in the right place , at the right time is not something every brand has done either ; it 's definitely not a bad thing . <p> " I feel that the responsibility on the brand has increased and now people will expect more from me . Now that I 've shot with Ranveer , people will not expect even the slightest error on my part . If my sherwani does n't fit impeccably people will ask me if I could dress Ranveer , why could n't I get this right ? " He feels that peoples ' expectations have increased and he has to make sure to not disappoint them . <p> The designer 's BCW showcase is coming up early next month but he frankly shares , " It 's going to be a very commercial collection with bridal pieces and nothing out of the box -- I need to recover the money I 've invested .

The People 's Liberation Army Air Force , or PLAAF , tends to copy , while China 's missile and space programs are more frequent innovators . Unlike the US military , China 's strategic missile forces act as their own service . <p> The Rand Corp . report was originally shared with Air Force leaders in September 2017 , but was made publicly available this month . <p> In it , researchers documented the restructuring of the PLAAF and the technological innovations the country is looking to develop as it cruises towards a possible confrontation with the United States . The PLAAF is one of five branches within the larger People 's Liberation Army , the name given to China 's armed services . <p> China 's power projection strategy appears to be built around the development of precision-strike ballistic and cruise missiles , supplemented by a dense web of surface-to-air missiles and advanced fighter jets . <p> " The main driver for Chinese military aerospace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be prepared to deter and , if necessary , defeat the United States in a high-end clash , " the Rand report reads . <p> The report added that the PLA tends to copy foreign military technology , organizational designs and operational concepts where it suits them , but is not incapable of innovating its own solutions when needed . <p> PLAAF writings often cite the US Air Force as a model for their transformation into a " strategic air force , " which they define as one not bound to defending China 's air sovereignty but capable of supporting China 's national policy objectives .

As a further consequence of the later , the courts and tribunals are more engaged with regard to jurisdictional issues rather than the determination of the actual controversies on merits , said law and justice ministry . <p> The ministry also claimed that at present there are about 30 per cent service cases pending in the high courts and once the proposed amendments are passed , they will be relieved of this heavy burden and would be able to focus on other cases . <p> The Service Tribunal also spends years before it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new amendment , we suggest that the service tribunal may have two divisions .

The order of the original division will be appealable before an appellate division of the tribunal comprising the chairman who has been or is qualified to be a judge of SC . There will be other members also . <p> Under the new law , it is proposed that all matters of fitness for holding a post , including promotion matters , be dealt with by the tribunal and not the high courts .

The court only then focuses on the stay application which takes many years to decide the stay/injunction . The main suit remains in a state of inertia . A new concept of a two tier-system has been proposed in the amendment . Two different judges will hear the entire suit . In the first tier , the main case would be heard by one judge without interruption till the finalisation of the proceedings . Stay and other miscellaneous applications would be heard in the second tier by another judge .

This would not only reduce corruption but also render a more accurate judgment since nothing beats personal first-hand knowledge of the judge .

His aim is to mitigate accidents and harm to human life , primarily by imparting adequate training to workers .

Vocational training in the country tends not to include a safety component whereas it should be the very first type of information given to new workers .

But it was a natural outcome of a decade-long mismanagement in every sphere of economic activity . Contrary to Khan 's earlier declarations of not compromising on the nation 's pride and the country 's sovereignty with a begging bowl , the government was probably left with no other choice but to approach the IMF to help Pakistan bail out with some relief to sustain the national economy . <p> However , it was not desirable to approach the IMF with empty coffers . It would have left Pakistan in a weak negotiating position . The government , therefore , decided to first seek help from some close allies , including Saudi Arabia , the UAE and China . Riyadh gave commitment for a six billion dollar relief package over a period of three years . The Saudis have already deposited one out of the first three billion dollars with the SBP to help immediately resolve the balance-of-payments crisis .

With these bailout packages in the pipeline , Pakistan is definitely in a better position to negotiate with the IMF . It can now resist the tough conditions the Fund may offer as part of its assistance .

The way we raise chicken -- and to a great extent cattle -- in Pakistan is putting the health of the country at risk . The widespread use of antibiotics both directly ( through direct injections in the guise of growth promotion efforts ) and indirectly ( in the feed and water ) is increasing antibiotic resistance . This widespread , unhinged , uncontrolled use of antibiotics means that the meat that comes on the table is riddled with antibiotics that we end up consuming . This widespread use is also leading to the animals not being healthy in general . We are consuming these unhealthy animals directly . This is only a part of the problem . The fact is that a large amount of antibiotics fed to the chickens go through their system into the environment and ends up in our water streams and hence in our diet directly or indirectly . All of this is further complicated by the poor regulation of drug quality , and there is good reason to believe that a number of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contain impurities and are just substandard . <p> The problem is certainly not only in Pakistan , but is a global concern .

Researchers in the antimicrobial resistance community have shown that poultry and dairy farmers in low and middle-income countries continue to use high volumes of antibiotics ( of uncertain quality ) , and there is little reason to expect them to change their behaviour . And while there are things that we should learn from China , the use of antibiotics in the animal sector is not one of them . Practices in the Chinese farms have been some of the worst in terms of antibiotic use and have started to put the health of people in and outside China at risk -- a problem that China is now increasingly recognising .

@@60318239 <h> Why Pakistan is a theatre of hybrid war <p> The writer is a political , economy and security analyst and a governance and public policy practitioner . He can be contacted at email protected <p> Of late , our military leadership has identified that Pakistan is faced with a hybrid war as the enemy is trying to take advantage of every social , cultural and political fault line within the country . In this connection , the argument of Chief of the Army Staff General Qamar Javed Bajwa that Pakistan is facing religious , sectarian and ethnic versions of hybrid warfare is quite noteworthy . <p> Hybrid warfare can be conceived as a military strategy that primarily employs political or psychological warfare and is a blend of conventional warfare , asymmetrical or irregular warfare and cyber warfare . The strategy also employs methods such as disseminating fake news , intrusive diplomacy , foreign electoral intervention , etc . The enemy combines kinetic operations or sudden attacks while in movement with subversion and sabotage efforts in order to avoid attribution or retribution . The strategy results in confusion and disorder as vitriolic information exacerbates the perception of insecurity within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war is that the enemy does its utmost to pit political , social and cultural identities against one another . Traditional militaries find it hard to respond to hybrid warfare . <p> The ever-deepening confusion and increasing feeling of insecurity within our society can be seen through the prism of strategy and methodology of hybrid warfare . Here it is important to note that the Pakistani society is very much suffering from a state which eminent French sociologist Emile Durkheim called ' anomie ' . The term was introduced by Durkheim in his study of the phenomenon of suicide . He believed that one type of suicide ( anomic ) resulted from the breakdown of the social standards necessary for regulating behaviour . When a social system is in a state of anomie , common values and common meanings are no longer understood or accepted , and new values and meanings have not developed . According to Durkheim , such a society produces , in many of its members , psychological states characterised by a sense of purposelessness , emotional emptiness and despair . Striving is considered useless because there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's society today , one fears , is suffering from such a sordid state . Enemy through hybrid warfare wants to exploit this situation and condition of the society and individual members . <p> The growing feeling of insecurity in Pakistan is quite fearsome because there is relative political stability and improved security situation today . A popular , democratically-elected government is in the saddle , which symbolises the continuity of representative system of government in the country . This is the third time on the trot that an elected government has successfully assumed state power in Pakistan . So the fundamental problem in contemporary Pakistan is not at the state level but at the societal level as it has lost direction and its members their sense of purpose . This is evident from the fact that a huge wave of terrorism engulfed the country perpetrated by locals , but there has been no collective societal response to that wave of terrorism . Same has been the case of financial corruption . So the enemy -- sensing that it can not physically defeat the Pakistani state , as is evident @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resorted to the hybrid war . <p> As explained above as a method a hybrid war , social and cultural identities are pitted against one another . In this context , the growing Baloch nationalist movement and the rise of the group known by its title Pakhtun Tahaffuz Movement ( PTM ) are the highest manifestation of the hybrid war . With regard to the PTM , whose main agenda is safeguarding the Pakhtun rights and identity , it can be observed that Pakhtuns of Pakistan have never been much threatened physically , culturally and socially than during the TTP and affiliated groups insurgency between 2007 and 2015 . Surprisingly , during that period the PTM did not emerge and its leaders did not realise that the Pakhtuns need to be protected . Therefore , the rise of the PTM after the return of relative normalcy to the Pakhtun regions of Pakistan raises many questions and eyebrows .

Modern-day governments face acute challenges in taking the population on board so that resources could be mobilised effectively . In this regard , e-governance is considered as an ultimate solution to this problem of swift delivery of services to the common man . <p> A good-to-go strategy towards e-governance is the establishment of ' Pakistan Stack ' . The stack should have several open APIs which should be designated to perform specific functions . Due to several layers of APIs compiled as one single stack , it should be termed Pakistan Stack . The first and the foremost step in this direction is to utilise the massive database of NADRA which holds identities of the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ identities can be used for several purposes . One important function of the digital identities will be related to financial institutions . With the help of this digital identity , one will be able to open bank accounts . The four kinds of transactions namely deposition , withdrawal , money transfer from one account to another and checking the account balance will be carried out with the help of these digital identities . So gone will be the days when you would have to be present in person to carry out such transactions . Further requirement of physical wet signature will also be eliminated . Digital signatures will perform the job from the comfort of your home . <p> The potential usage of digital identity is not just limited to banks , with the help of e-sign that is the fingerprint of the user , one will be able to put his or her sign on any document without being physically present at the place . In this way , authentication will be done by the holder without any paperwork . Furthermore , authentication and attestation of your important documents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ digitally by government entities . <p> Another important system in this proposed stack will be to provide an online storage for important documents . These documents will then be shared with the consent of the possessor upon requirement . This consented data sharing can not only save time and energy but will also ensure that only authentic documents are being shared with complete confidentiality . <p> Pakistan is a country where tremendous amount of work is required to provide people with as basic necessity as health . An important function of Pakistan Stack will concern with the health department . Hospitals across the country will be given access to the stack mechanism . Your whole medical history will be attached with your digital identity . The data generated through them will also help the government in measuring the demand for medicine supply required to fight endemic diseases like polio , dengue , etc . <p> Credit Rating System of the US is well known . The credit history of an individual maintained through Social Security Number ( SSN ) ensures that people are complying with the law . The more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get . Crediting is connected with your SSN and can be seen by anybody through holder 's concern . There are a number of factors which are responsible for the increment or decrement of the credits . For example : if you fail to pay your utility bills within the due date , your credits will decrease . <p> This model has been followed by the developed countries since ages . I am not suggesting that this is the only way to develop civic sense among people . However , it can play a significant role in doing so . Pakistan Stack will also help in establishing this credit rating mechanism to make people socially and financially responsible . <p> Furthermore , filing of tax can also be associated with digital identity . This way the government will be able to know whether the person is paying tax as per the income earned . This year the government launched ' Tax Amnesty Scheme 2018 ' through which people across the country were given a chance to file their returns declaring their foreign and domestic assets . The response was quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rupees were added to the economy . Taxation system associated to digital identity can help government in pin-pointing the non-filers and taking due action . <p> Credit history through Pakistan Stack will also facilitate the recruitment procedure across the country . Besides hiring competent candidates , companies will be able to fill the vacancies with socially- and financially-responsible people . Further to this , people will also be obliged to act responsibly while on job as it would affect their credit ratings . <p> An important aspect of stack is its layer-ability . This means to make sure that not all the work is done by a single system . For example , the authentication system of the stack should only deal with identification details of the user . It should not have any knowledge or concern with the transaction activity of the same user . This means to have function-specific model at work which in the simplest of words means all the systems/layer should be designated with specific functions . <p> The completion of the first 100 days of the PTI government has been a mixed plate . Where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hue and cry over ' unfulfilled ' commitments , not acknowledging the positive steps of the new government , few of which are also quite surprising and bold , will be utter injustice . Moving forward with the same spirit , the government , especially the Ministry of Information Technology &amp; Telecommunications , should take steps towards the establishment of Pakistan Stack as the only viable solution to the ever-complex problems of today 's modern world is the apt utilisation of information technology .

He went on to declare the TLP leaders as patriots who cared about Pakistan . Whatever his definition of a patriot , all citizens are duty-bound to respect the Constitution and obey all other laws .

Mufti Rehman did not stop at seeking clemency for TLP leaders . He urged the government to reconsider its decision in the Asia Bibi case with the threat he could give a protest call for Friday .

At no time , either when banning it , or at the time of the frequent lifting of the ban , have the factors that make it dangerous been systematically examined and addressed .

The handcuffs and chains speak the plight of an ignorant nation . Hopefully , these chains will soon be unlocked with the passage of time and reformation of the justice system . It needs to be ensured that the prisoners should not be deprived of their rights and their ill-treatment should be averted . A nation which does not treats its prisoners with respect and dignity can not be expected to become a welfare state .

And while both acts of violence must be condemned in equal terms -- it remains the duty of the state to stem bloodshed . Not , as in this case , to arm those seeking revenge with the names and addresses of homes and businesses owned by Muslims .

For while profit remains in the hands of a few -- unrest will be sure to follow . This was the lesson of Brexit that was fought along the false battle lines of anti-immigration .

Here journalists are mostly threatened , harassed and killed by influentials who are annoyed by exposition of their wrongdoings . A quick glance at the incidents of journalists ' murders in Punjab shows most of them were district/tehsil correspondents of media organisations who had tried to expose the influential politicians , criminals , gangsters etc . There are others , too , who died due to excesses by invisible forces or terrorism in Punjab , but their numbers are very few . <p> However , regardless of the type , one finds that the fate of these cases is similar . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compensation to the heirs , role of the employers , there is a strange resemblance with the extraordinary happening in a few cases . <p> To start with , one can discuss the cases of Saleem Shahzad , whose body was recovered from a canal in Mandi Bahauddin , and Ejaz ul Haq , an employee of City 42 , shot dead by Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan ( TTP ) terrorists in Lahore . <p> Saleem Shahzad worked for Asia Times Online based in Hong Kong and Italian news agency Adnkronos ( AKI ) and was killed on May 10 , 2011 . Reportedly , he had been kidnapped from Islamabad while he was on his way to the office of a TV channel to take part in a talk show . The global rights body Human Rights Watch claimed Saleem had informed them about threats received from the country 's premier intelligence agency as he had been writing sensitive stories not acceptable to it . This could not be proved during investigations as well as by the judicial commission formed for this purpose . Though , the commission did not clearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how to avert similar incidents and proposed monetary compensation for Saleem 's family , employment for his wife , and state-funded education for his children . <p> I contacted Zubair Akhtar , the Station House Officer ( SHO ) of Sadar Mandi Bahauddin Police Station to get an update on the case . The SHO informed that the case had been closed because of lack of evidences . He was also not aware of the current status of the case and could not recall anybody from the family approaching him for this purpose . The SHO seemed to be in a hurry to end the call and denied having knowledge of the whereabouts of Saleem 's family . ( You can get the contact details from FIR or PFUJ , please talk to them ) . Police is reluctant to provide copy of the FIR and President of PFUJ Rehman Bhutta says PFUJ does n't have any record of the slain journalist 's family . No one is ready to talk on the issue . <p> Saleem Shahzad 's wife , Anita Saleem , has given an interview to AKI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interview , she disclosed , the family has not received any support from the government or any other source . She said , " We will never know who killed Saleem , and why . " <p> On May 28 , 2010 , during a terrorist attack on Ahmadi community 's worship place in Garhi Shahu , a journalist Ijazul Haq was killed when he was giving live updates on his cellular phone to his TV Channel City 42 . At least 98 people were killed on the spot and 120 got severely injured in this terrorist attack . <p> According to Amir , a technician in City 42 , a colleague and friend of the slain journalist , Ijaz was very humble and a hardworking man . He said after his death , Mohsin Naqvi , the owner of City 42 , extended financial help to the family . The family , residing in Lahore at that time , was given Rs 0.5 million by the PPP government which also announced free education for his children . <p> Another colleague of his who does not want to be named @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abroad . According to him , it was alleged that he was an Ahmadi and his family received support from the community and settled abroad . <p> Coming to the cases of journalists falling victims to enmities developed with individuals or groups , we take up a couple of cases for discussion and analyse them . For example , Amir Wakeel , correspondent of daily Awami Inqlab , was killed by unknown assailants in Rawalpindi on January 23 , 2009 . He left behind four kids who immediately moved to their ancestral area of Karak , KPK , after his death . His brother Kamal Asfar was an active journalist who had contested for National Assembly seat from Rawalpindi but disappeared from scene after pursuing his brother 's case for some time . <p> Abdul Waheed Anjum , Secretary Rawalpindi-Islamabad Press Club , says some journalists believe the brother of the slain journalist was also threatened by unknown men and warned not to pursue the case . Footprints of unknown killers were reportedly traced back in tribal areas of KP but not a single killer of Amir Wakeel has yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afternoon , Amir Wakeel was killed at Committee Chowk in Rawalpindi by unknown killers . He was shot at and two bullets hit his head . He was shifted to District Head Quarter ( DHQ ) hospital Rawalpindi where he died . <p> Similarly , on April 22 , 2014 , Shahzad Iqbal , who was affiliated with Sama TV as a correspondent for six years in Mianwali district , was killed . Reportedly , the killers included Shafaullah Khan , Shabbir Khan and Irfan Khan . They shot fire at Shahzad and his brothers Sajjad Iqbal and Sikandar Iqbal when they were riding motorcycles . The assailants intercepted them in Nai Abadi Mianwali . All three of them received serious injuries and were shifted to District Hospital Mianwali where Shahzad was pronounced dead . <p> After one week , the killers were apprehended by police and presented before the court . The case continued for one and a half year . Later , the family settled the dispute with the accused and pardoned the murderers on May 26 , 2016 . Now , the accused are free . According @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the organisation and Press Club Mianwali did not cooperate with the family . While defending the settlement , he explained that the family did not want to promote enmity . When inquired about the blood money in exchange of this pardon , he did not answer in affirmative . Sajjad was also injured seriously in the armed attack and this act of pardon appears quite unnatural . He was killed over an old enmity . <p> Muhammad Aftab Alam , a lawyer based in Islamabad , shares that the cases of journalists ' murders are taken like any other murder by the police and are not registered under any special law . Though a provision to invoke Article 7 of ATA has been taken and incorporated into substantial law , there is no supporting amendment in the procedural law that defines procedures to implement laws and award punishments . <p> Aftab believes that murder of a journalist is homicide as well as a curb on freedom of expression which is a constitutional right . Therefore , such cases must be treated under special laws . At the moment , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they have to get things moving in a highly non-cooperative environment .

@@60390231 <h> A lament for a city <p> The author gives the reader a list of names by which our beloved city of Lahore has been referred to in times passed by , by travellers , poets and saints , kings and warriors , and settles on one of them as the title of his somewhat post-modern novel : Lohawar . By choosing that as a title , he turns lament into a tribute and vice versa . <p> The novel begins with references to Lahore 's existence in medieval and colonial literature and to the narrator 's friend Najeeb , ' of exalted station , of noble orientation ' , who has entered into a state of emotional coma , probably voluntarily . Najeeb seems like a subconscious protest , symbolising the eminent writers whom the author quotes to shore up his case in favour of Lahore having been a great city once . The author even shares a royal decree by none other than Akbar the Great , who once stated that Lahore 's land and its monuments belong to the inhabitants of Lahore . All rulers believe their words would always remain the law . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belong to the narrator , his personal struggles , family , and love interest . The middle section , which is bigger than the other two sections put together , belongs to Najeeb . It begins as the narrator enters his friend 's room . There he detects what he calls " order in chaos " which becomes the heart and body of the novel . The room is littered with books , articles , pictures , cuttings , Najeeb 's diary , interviews of other people , all contributing to a dismal , depressing , deteriorating picture of a great city . <p> The middle section takes up almost ninety percent of the novel and is full of extracts , clippings and digressions , some interesting characters and others less so , such as Chacha Quba and Satwant Kaur and later on Dr Ajaz Anwar or Kausar . While it somewhat succeeds in painting a panoramic portrait of a city in pain , it decimates the narrative and freezes the frame . But there are things about this slim novel that keep it alive , above water , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Perhaps that is Ejaz 's main gift as a writer of prose . <p> One such thing is the narrator 's love interest Safina and her mother 's complex and compromised autonomy , her husband being in the army and away most of the time on military operations ( we never learn of his rank though it seems like he 's not a commissioned officer for that could risk the novel being banned ) . While the mother defies patriarchal rules and norms , Safina teaches the narrator a bit about courage with regards to things one loves , in contrast to slipping into a self-inflicted wound/vow of silence . <p> The other element that piques the reader 's interest , even if the narrative often slips into non-narrative , is Chacha Quba 's character who acts as the second self of Najeeb , especially when he blurts out , " eh kitthon da insaaf aey ? " The entire novel seems to balance itself on this minute but crucial point : the absence of justice in Pakistan for the vulnerable ones . The novel seems to hint at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scream ' hovers at the back of the reader 's mind . <p> I am hearted to have read Lohawar for it points towards a surging self-confidence among the new generation of Punjabi writers as they tackle new techniques and subject matters . <p> This brings us to the central thorn of the novel : the construction of the Orange Line Metro Train in Lahore whose construction is having a two-fold effect on Lahore and Lahoris . <p> On one hand , the narrator , his romantic interest Safina , and others are direct victims of Metro Train project as their houses are being demolished , and on the other , the project is being carried out at the cost of endangering archaeological and historical landmarks such as Shalimar Garden and Chauburji . The author succeeds in gathering the readers ' sympathy but at the cost of turning his fiction didactic and bereft of character development . A point can be made , however , that the real character of the novel is actually the city of Lahore . <p> The most creative or artistic part of the novel appears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ describes the instance where he sees the city crying aloud while it is being dug up and ripped apart , and compares it to a patient who is stricken with tuberculosis . I had to read the whole section at least three times to make sure Najeeb is wading into the city 's emotions , and not a person 's whose name I might have missed . It is at this point the city turns into an allegory for the suffering of its ordinary citizens . But for the novel to rise above its own ordinariness , despite its courageous attempt at post-modernity , it needed more meat , more psychological and intellectual depth . <p> Post-modern novels , the ones with a fractured narrative or non-narrative or multi-narrative are harder to write . Yet I am hearted to have read Lohawar for it points towards a surging self-confidence among the new generation of Punjabi writers as they tackle new techniques and subject matters . I still hope that the younger generations in Punjab take up the habit of reading modern fiction written in Punjabi .

@@60390232 <p> No matter what way you divide the past , there still will be years , months and days that are remembered for changing the direction of art . The most recent example is the unforgettable date , 9/11 , that altered the practice of many visual artists . 2018 , the year of general elections , may also have an impact on the art in this country . Elected on the slogan of a ' New Pakistan ' , the new government has announced the conversion of state residences into museums and art galleries . If implemented , this has the potential of changing the structure and system of art , ' public art ' in particular . <p> 2018 also witnessed a major art event -- Lahore Biennale 01 -- that was held in March and included major local and international artists like Amar Kanwar , Ayesha Sultana , Bani Abidi , Nadia Kaabi-Linke , Naeem Mohaiemen , Shahzia Sikander , Shezad Dawood , Shirin Neshat , Waqas Khan and others . Organised at several sites in Lahore , including the Lahore Fort and Lawrence Gardens , it attracted a large audience , many of whom were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ housewives and street vendors . <p> Wardha Shabbir . <p> However , in the present age , the concept of ' public space ' has also transformed . One does not have to go to the old part of a city , park or street to view the works . Today , Instagram or any other social media page is a form of public space , seen by thousands across cities , countries and continents . Interestingly , like the original nature of art at a public site being temporary , art posted on social media is also transitory , soon to be replaced by a new entry . Yet some of these images leave a lasting effect and stay longer in memory . For example , the news of Rashid Rana 's Red Carpet series # 1 fetching a record highest price for a Pakistani artwork by any living or dead artist , amid the auction of Arif Naqvi 's Collection at the Bonham 's , London in October . Rana 's digital print was sold for 200,000 pound sterling , equal to 33.4 millions in Pak rupees . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it fetched in the market , but also because it affirmed the triumph of Pakistani art , and for that matter contemporary art . The work is not a hand-painted canvas , a carved stone , a bronze statue or an intricately executed miniature ; it is a piece created through computer and printed digitally . <p> This year also witnessed recognition of another Pakistani artist Rasheed Araeen who uses a formal language to construct his sculptures and two-dimensional items . His retrospectives are on view at BALTIC Centre for Contemporary Art , UK ; Van Abbe Museum , Holland ; and Mamco , Geneva , Switzerland . Araeen has been living , working , almost struggling in the UK for years . His work addressed marginalisation by the British ( misleadingly called ' mainstream ' ) art world and thus he was considered , and ultimately assumed the role of , an outsider . It is only now that his worth and rightful place is recognised with these shows ( a continuation of Araeen 's inclusion in Documenta 14 , last year ) . Though it has started with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conceptual and political works would soon follow . <p> With the opening up of borders in the art world , a number of Pakistani artists are not standing on the ' periphery ' anymore ; they are ' insiders ' ; for instance , Wardha Shabbir 's art on display from June to November at the V&amp;A Museum , as part of Jameel Prize Exhibition . Her works , reinterpretation of imagery , sensibility and ideas of traditional miniature painting , in a minimal tone , suggest the way an artist views the past , investigates and turns it into a personal and private affair . A similar sensibility was witnessed at her solo show in November at the Canvas Gallery , Karachi . <p> Other exponents of traditional vocabulary of miniature painting like Waqas Khan and Aisha Khalid were prominent in all corners of the globe . Khan held his solo exhibition , History , Memory or Geometry in September at Galerie Krinzinger , Vienna while Khalid is included in The 9th Asia Pacific Triennial of Contemporary Art , inaugurated in November at the Queensland Art Gallery , Brisbane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ works of two other Pakistani artists , Ali Kazim and Naiza Khan , reveal diversity in terms of approaches as well as a yearning to connect with a land that offers a peculiar history -- almost a diffused and destroyed history . This is a blessing in disguise because it can be manipulated for the sake of art . In any case , art and history are like twins since the two assert to be original but are devoid of this trait . Both insist on being authentic but , after some years , this claim is considered suspect . Both document reality but reflect the personality of the author . <p> There have been efforts to question the state of history in art ; as was seen in the solo exhibition of Hasnat Mehmood in November at the Taseer Art Gallery , Lahore . The artist , trained in the discipline of miniature painting , dismantled the construct of history and art history : from ancient artefacts to modernism , from writing on high art to the making of ordinary pottery . His exhibition informed how an artist thinks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time ? ) . <p> Waqas Khan . <p> Another exhibition , with alternative of a different nature was held from August 31 to September 11 at the Canvas Gallery Karachi . Basir Mehmood brought forth an unusual dimension of reality or parallel facts . In his photographs and video , mediums usually believed to be ' true ' , he twisted immediate settings to convey another phenomenon : not ' factual ' but a blend of contradictions , conflicts and confusions , and hence haunting . <p> Carefully crafted works refer to a subtle divide between art and reality . This was experienced in the exhibition of Haider Ali Naqvi on the culmination of his Vasl Residency in August at the Karachi Arts Council . Here the art and debris , images of buildings in the city , and rubble of the space ( to be restructured ) were mixed ; thus the demarcation between art and life was imperceptible . <p> This was also witnessed during the Mansion Artists ' Residency , Lahore in March/April where artists worked at a specific location -- a house -- but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into high art . Much like what Iqbal Geoffrey did at his talk at the Residency , when/where he transformed a simple material , ' conversation ' , into a work of conceptual art . In a sense , listening to him was like walking through the corridors of a Museum of Conceptual Art in Lahore ( its address varies , depending on the latest location of Iqbal Geoffrey ! ) . <p> 2018 was a prolific year as anyone could have imagined . With the turning of each new leaf of history , we are entering into the unexpected , extraordinary and exciting world of Pakistani art . Just what Graham Swift said while talking about writing : " a single , peaceful house . In the house would be a room , with a desk , in which absolute , monastic calm would reign . But in this room would be a door , and it would lead to a nightclub " .

Her work makes use of a mixture of broad and stunted strokes to illustrate a city that fluidly melds into its people as they do into its environment , and so forth . Marketplace scenes are appropriately put under a painted layer of disturbance , of aesthetically opposing and disrupting forces and colours layered upon the strong skeleton of a bazaar . <p> The scattered , overpowering foreground of Mir 's work called to mind the technique of Mashkoor Raza . It is exciting and propels you to question : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Lahori pollution ? Fortunately , it may be both to its audience . <p> Huma Maqbool explores a similar scatter through her pieces . Her artist statement reads : " Uncertainty that arises in the disclosure of a reality inherent is what I am trying to capture in my work . " She views this with skepticism . Her paintings depict withering or broken concrete corners of roofs and buildings . <p> This dialogue of the industrial urban space with its dishevelled , discordant observer seemed to serve as a prominent theme in this year 's show . Saif Ali Siddiqui characterised it in his work through elaborate , mishmash patterns that melt into one another , other objects , or members of the city -- from people to structures , and arguably , a lot that is uncertain in between . Siddiqui attributes the inspiration and content of his art to the nexus of his surroundings and his " post-colonial concerns . " With his thesis display , he aims to incorporate his signature patterns into the historic spaces and images of his environment . Here too , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " that an urban city like Lahore confronts regularly . In the city 's postcolonial origins and its moulded development under a world submerged in imperialist culture , politics , and taste , Lahore is subject to these anxieties of contradicting aesthetics , ideologies , and futurisms superimposed on one another without much deliberation and care . <p> Hina Muhammad 's take on the topic is far more extreme ( and perhaps , as much real ) . She mixes the mediums of painting , sculpture , and photography to construct life-like representations of " experienced spaces " -- walls contaminated and inhabited by moss , broken stones , and half-completed restorations . Her work is morbid , and her opinion on our urban condition is poignant and incisive . <p> To an observer , the exhibition may provide a pertinent ( and unfamiliar ) moment of reflection . What constitutes Lahore today ? How does the city 's history interact with its present ? What forces are responsible for implementing this present on the vast but decaying greenery of Lahore ? <p> Of the remaining artists , Noor-Ul-Huda and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our social reality and domestic cloisters . Huda 's work charts the private space and its leaking into the public space to develop the map of Pakistan 's socio-political dialogue and its impacts . The faces in Huda 's work are distorted but confident . Her style is unique and disarming , but often leaves an uncomfortable room for curiosity . In its most remarkable element , the eyes of Huda 's characters stand out and speak up . Her concentration is on the identity consequences of Pakistan 's political reality , using " hidden details that speak to the societal and cultural influences on us , particularly ones that came from being a woman . " While some audiences ( like myself ) may be more susceptible to finding themselves ignorant to the subtleties of Huda 's work as it pertains to gender , the work seems often too defiantly obtuse and elusive . <p> Mughal 's pieces attempt a similar , but more invasive , analysis of men and masculinity . His work explores masculine facial expressions to expound upon the silent conversations of hierarchy that exist unquestioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sinister negative spaces : his critique remains inwards . Ramzan Jafari , on the other hand , does not shy away from making his criticism macro-political , open , and direct . He targets in his voice the national issue of missing persons and enforced disappearances in Pakistan . He masterfully uses fabric , bukrams , aprons , and bones as proofs of missing people 's existence and burnishes ( and sometimes , burns ) these objects within layers onto each other . It is evocative and disconcerting , as artistic representation of an issue that merits it . <p> Lahore is seldom afforded the opportunity to reflect on itself through the expansive and intelligent channel of art , media and literature . In this dearth of creative and cultural showcases , the NCA annual Visual Art Degree Show provides to the onlookers of our city a unique but reliably consistent window into its heart and soul . 
@@60390237 <p> Women starting from early teens till menopause kicks in in their mid-40s , undergo the natural process of menstruation . Regrettably , with us , this is a taboo subject , and even women discussing it amongst themselves consider it rather shameful ; all of which often results in not knowing much about hygiene , and resorting to unhealthy practices . <p> This is especially true of people from the lower strata of society , particularly in rural areas where girls do not have access to information . <p> Prompted by her own experiences and observations in Okara , Sadaf Naz founded ' Her Ground , ' an online shopping portal that offers sanitary products to women at their doorstep . Additionally , she took up the challenge to educate young girls in schools , colleges , and universities on personal and menstrual hygiene . <p> A pharmacist by education , Naz began in 2017 in her hometown where she connected with the educational institutions with relative ease . She has so far reached out to over a thousand girl students in three different schools in the city . Her message is safe and hygienic handling of periods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in old cloth that can cause serious infections . <p> She told TNS , " We are living in the 21st century and sanitary napkins are readily available at almost every pharmacy in Pakistan , but girls are still using rags during their menstrual cycle . " <p> Sharing the reason for starting the project she said , " I was in ninth grade when my menstruation cycle started ; no one had told me about the changes that my body was to undergo , so on the first day I thought I 'm about to die . My mother asked my elder sister to guide me , who gave me a cloth to use . " <p> Sadly , mothers too often do not educate their daughters on how to keep themselves clean as the subject is brushed under the carpet . Rags are washed and kept out of the view of men in the house , and used repeatedly . Often , more than one female members use the same rags thinking these are ' sanitised ' after a wash . As a result , infections are easily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moved to Faisalabad for further studies that she came to know about sanitary napkins through her classmates and her life changed for the better . <p> In most grocery stores and pharmacies , there is a separate section for women 's items of personal use where no one can miss the paper bags or black shoppers . These bags are supposed to keep the product inside them from the eyes of the men around , whereas actually this makes things all the more conspicuous because everyone knows what is in them . <p> An interesting part of the outreach programme is asking the girls to write down their experience as " My First Period " which is shared on social media where some audio messages are also uploaded . <p> Through Her Ground , the ladies can have sanitary napkins delivered at home . " The items are packed in ordinary-looking parcel boxes so the ladies do not feel embarrassed receiving them from the postman , " she said . <p> The portal offers a variety of sanitary napkins including tampons and other items of female use like hair removing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ladies order online and pay cash on delivery . Online shopping saves them from any awkward stares or situation that they might have to face if they went out to shop for the same . <p> Her Ground takes a " 5 percent cut from each order which goes to a pool out of which we procure and sell sanitary napkins at subsidised rates to school girls in Okara , and help in the initial stages of outreach in schools in Lahore . " <p> An interesting part of the outreach programme is asking the girls to write down their experience as " My First Period " which is then shared on social media where audio messages are also uploaded . This helps the viewers relate with others ' experiences . It also creates a better understanding of the need to change to hygienic methods . <p> Naz 's journey has n't been without troubles . When she went to the public schools in Okara , she was n't welcome . " People thought I was spreading vulgarity , " she said . " Some even said , ' Khud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' ( you 've become shameless , do n't try to influence our daughters ) . " <p> However , she persevered , and managed to convince the head mistresses of at least three schools to give her a chance . <p> Many myths are attached to the issue . Naz was told that if she touched plants in her ' impure ' state they would wilt . In many backward areas , the girls are shut in their rooms for the entire length of the week . <p> " Girls asked me various questions ranging from not taking a bath during periods to touching food -- to whether they were ready for marriage . I 'd respond to these with scientific explanations . " <p> There was another issue that Naz had to address : " Girls from lower to middle-class did n't know there are cheaper brands available in the market ; their idea of sanitary napkins was what they had seen in TV commercials . <p> " Hence , we arranged nondescript cardboard boxes with eight napkins in the three schools in Okara which the girls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ replenished every month so that the stock is always available and girls do not fall back to using cloth . " <p> Naz believes it is time to break the taboos attached to the subject : " Women in Pakistan face all sorts of issues during their monthly cycle but hardly anyone supports or guides them . They even suffer from Premenstrual Syndrome ( PMS ) yet are not sensitised on the issue . <p> " Even though my brother is younger than me , he has come to understand the importance of my work and even helps me with things . <p> " While we need to educate women , men too need to be sensitised , in order for change to occur , " she added .

Our story , therefore , must begin with organic album releases . <p> Strings released six songs from their newest studio album , 30 , each accompanied by album artwork and a music video . For the first time in their careers , Pakistan 's longest running band worked on releasing an album , not through the backing of a massive record label or a corporate entity but by embracing the digital format . <p> Adil Omar released his first full length record called Transcendence ( accompanied by a film ) putting pieces of himself in the record like never before ; there were some delicious collaboration(s) to go along with it . <p> Music super-groups like Chand Tara Orchestra , featuring Omran Shafique , Babar Sheikh , Sherry Raza , Rizwan Ullah -- joined on the record by multiple drummers/artists -- unveiled their genre-bending debut album . The band released singles like ' Makki Madni ' , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Rung De ' prior to its December release . <p> Another super-group Mughal-e-Funk , featuring Rakae Jamil , Kami Paul , Farhan Ali and Rufus Shehzad has also just released their debut instrumental album , Sultanat . Both records are radically different yet equally beautiful , containing songs that will stay with you for years to come . <p> Jimmy Khan is in the processing of doing it , having unveiled two ( at the time of writing of this article ) of the five songs that make up his first live folk album titled Tich Button , which has an extensive line-up and is produced by the incredibly talented Zain Ahsan . <p> Janoobi Khargosh 's Cpt . Space , Natasha Noorani 's five-track EP Munaasib , TMPST 's ( Asfandyar Khan ) new four-track EP Unravel are just some of the best representations of independent music . <p> Unveiling several songs in 2018 such as ' Cereal Killer ' , ' Preacher ' and the title track , ' Almost Tuesday ' so far , the band is hitting what looks like its best album to date @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has other singles in the pipeline . <p> A big mention to True Brew TV , the brainchild of Lahore-based music producer Jamal Rahman has to be made . The initiative released dozens of songs this year with the likes of Zoe Viccaji , Saakin , Janoobi Khargosh and many more . As Jamal pointed out in one interview with Instep , a platform like True Brew TV deserves more media coverage for the sake of the many artists who appear on it , many of whom do n't have full-length albums . If True Brew TV can provide a platform to young , diverse , eclectic artists , why do n't they get as much coverage as a corporate-backed entity ? These are important questions and 2019 is therefore just an equally important year for music . <p> Live music festivals <p> Jamal Rahman , Zoe Viccaji and Kami Paul on True Brew TV . <p> Music festivals continued their run in 2018 with Lahore Music Meet 2018 and the third edition of Lahooti Music Melo being the most interesting of the lot , not just for the music @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the panel discussions about the past , present and future of music that were debated upon . <p> If LMM presented folk sessions with the likes of Saeen Zahoor , Attaullah Esakhelvi and Tahira Syed , it also presented the music group Sikandar Ka Mandar ( SKM ) , a much-loved music group to a packed-house ; their performance earned them a standing ovation . At Lahooti Melo 2018 , inclusion and diversity was consistent throughout and people were presented with various forms of music , including some beautiful folk . <p> Learning from the past , paying attention to what is happening in the present is the only way to pave way for future music generations and these two festivals reminded us that it is possible to be a community of artists . <p> Other events such as Mad Decent Block Party , held in Islamabad , brought international names such as Major Lazer ( featuring Diplo ) , Valentino Khan , Chrome Sparks and local boys SNKM ( Talal Qureshi and Adil Omar ) , Shamoon Ismail and Lyari Underground , among others . Barring Lyari Underground and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing so , MDBP co-curators Adil Omar , Talal Qureshi and Brendan , managed to shine a light on some of the music that is being made in Islamabad . The event needed to be better organized since the turnout was in the thousands . <p> The role of corporate investment <p> Corporate investment and what its role should be remains a subject of discussion as Coke Studio 11 ( produced by Zohaib Kazi and Ali Hamza , for the first time ) , Pepsi Battle of the Bands season 3 , Cornetto Pop Rock 3 , all made a comeback . Nescafe Basement is also said to be in the pipeline . <p> Coke Studio 11 , for its flaws and criticisms , introduced a new module called Coke Studio Explorer that served as a prequel to the main show and was about unearthing voices , cultures , languages and pure talent . It got four of the five episodes just right . <p> Speaking to Instep about Coke Studio Explorer , co-producer Zohaib Kazi told Instep in a 2018 interview : " It is meant to inspire people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broader conversation behind all of it is that for us , beyond a consumer , it 's a human being first .

It is not the product we 're creating . Our focus is on exposing people and starting a conversation where people have a better sense of identity and feel proud about Pakistan . Coke Studio Explorer is the starting point , which will lay that foundation . " <p> Introducing five artists via Coke Studio Explorer , Coke Studio 11 was unveiled and though the show earned its fair share of criticism ; it also brought some of the folk element back . It gave the likes of already established bands like The Sketches ( with an extended line-up ) and Khumariyaan a chance to be part of the line-up , both of whom delivered two of the best songs of the season in ' Daastan-e-Moomal Rano ' and ' Ya Qurbaan ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Nami Danam ' ) and Mughal-e-Funk ( ' Aurangzeb ' ) utilized their much-earned spot on Coke Studio 11 to unveil their respective records later this year . <p> Coke Studio found a star in Natasha Baig who co-sang Allama Iqbal 's ' Shikwa/Jawab-e-Shikwa ' and went toe to toe with Fareed Ayaz Qawwal and Brothers . <p> The other major corporate music production , Pepsi Battle of the Bands 3 saw a change in judges with Strings ultimately co-judging with program judges Fawad Khan and Meesha Shafi . The show , however , managed to highlight strictly average bands , apart from runner-up band Xarb . Bayaan , the other group to make it to the top two slot , ultimately won but its Xarb who seemed to have the most potential . <p> Fortunately , the band 's second album and the first since getting on Pepsi Battle of the Bands 3 is being produced by Zain Ahsan , so we expect great things . <p> On Pepsi 3 , in terms of performances , particularly from the judges , Meesha Shafi took the number one spot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investment also came in the form of Coke Festivals , across multiple cities , that provide the public with a variety of food and a slew of performing artists . <p> Other examples include Peak Freens Sooper , who joined forces with Geo TV to present the comeback of Junoon , which entailed a music video and a huge concert in Karachi . <p> Clearly , corporate investment in music is not going anywhere but it must be said that this investment should also go to artists who can then record multiple albums . Branding also needs to be looked into as it 's getting bigger and bigger but is not always aesthetically pleasing to the audience or in accordance with the artists and their aesthetics , music , and narrative . <p> 2018 was also the year of Salt Arts , the Karachi-based company that managed to hit the landmark feat of having executed more than 50 live shows since coming into existence .

@@60390239 <p> Mickey Arthur unleashed his anger at the Pakistani batsmen soon after it became evident that they had handed the opening Test to South Africa on a platter at Centurion last week . His criticism of the Pakistani players was justified . But it was also a classic case of pot calling the kettle black . <p> The South African coach is equally responsible for Pakistan 's meek surrender at Centurion . Ever since he has taken over as Pakistan 's coach , his team in whites has rarely shown any spine . What happened to Pakistan 's batting in the first Test was n't a one-time disaster . It 's been a pattern . And it seems highly unlikely that things would change for the tourists in the remaining two matches of the Test series in South Africa . <p> The writing is on the wall for Sarfraz Ahmed as his Test captaincy has been on the line for quite a while now . The way he and his team have performed in the five-day format in recent times ( especially in a 1-2 series loss against New Zealand in the UAE ) , Sarfraz should be sacked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ team 's other coaches including batting coach Grant Flower ? Where do they stand ? <p> Sarfraz 's sacking wo n't serve any purpose if that 's the only change made by Pakistan in their Test squad after the series against South Africa . Then there are players like Azhar Ali and Asad Shafiq . The senior duo were supposed to fill the vacuum left by the exit of Misbah-ul-Haq and Younis Khan . Both of them have utterly failed to do that . I agree that their job is n't an easy one , especially in South Africa . I also agree with Dean Elgar who said after South Africa 's triumph in the opening Test that his country is the toughest place in the world to bat . But that 's what professional cricketers are supposed to do . They have to perform in all conditions . From where I see it , if less experienced batsmen like Imam-ul-Haq and Shan Masood can score runs then why ca n't more seasoned ones Azhar and Asad . They need to be asked tough questions . Maybe they need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do the job . But can we trust batters like Harris Sohail , who have been equally inconsistent ? <p> It 's one of the many questions that need answers as Pakistan end 2018 on a sorry note . The year began with a 5-0 thrashing for the Pakistan in an ODI series in New Zealand and ended with a defeat in the Boxing Day Test at Centurion . There were some happy outings in between but most of them came in the Twenty20 Internationals . Pakistan 's complete domination of the game 's shortest format was the only saving grace for Sarfraz and his men . <p> As we enter 2019 , a year which will see the ICC World Cup taking place in England in the summer , we know that if Pakistan are to climb the top of the Test and ODI mountains they will need to find a new Sherpa . Sarfraz might be Pakistan 's Tenzing in the T20 format but he has been unable to really guide them in the other two formats . I know that under his command , Pakistan swam against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ results in ODIs are a proof that the team somehow punched above its weight in England last year . It has since been cut down to size . Pakistan could only manage one solitary ODI victory in 2018 against teams other than Hong Kong , Afghanistan or Zimbabwe . It played like a disjointed unit in the Asia Cup in the UAE and even struggled against minnows like Afghanistan . <p> If Pakistan are to climb the top of the Test and ODI mountains they will need to find a new Sherpa . Sarfraz might be Pakistan 's Tenzing in the T20 format but he has been unable to really guide them in the other two formats <p> The Asia Cup debacle was one of the lowest points for Pakistan . Another low point was the collapse in the opening Test against New Zealand in Abu Dhabi . In a match they were supposed to win comfortably , Pakistan lost six wickets for 24 runs to crash to a four-run defeat . They went on to lose the series . <p> The high point for Pakistan came in May at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under new captain Sarfraz . Many hailed the win as a new beginning but unfortunately it turned out to be a false dawn . <p> There was , however , nothing false about Pakistan 's T20 conquests during 2018 . The men in green consolidated their position as the world 's number one team in the T20 format , winning 17 of the 19 matches they played during the year . They won 11 series on the bounce , including against West Indies ( three ) , New Zealand ( two ) , and Australia . <p> The one big question that comes to mind is why are Pakistan so good in T20s and quite bad in the other two formats ? The simple answer is that they rely too much on their bowlers to win matches . Pakistan are very much a single-dimensional team -- a great bowling unit that is often carrying the dead weight of an unreliable batting line-up . It 's easier for bowlers to win matches in the shortest format of the game . They can even defend smaller totals like 120 in a T20 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matches if your batsmen are n't even crossing the 200-run mark . That 's what happened at Centurion where Pakistan scored 181 and 190 . Things could have been different had Pakistan managed to add 100 odd runs to their aggregate total in the first Test . <p> It is important that Pakistan work out a plan to tackle the many problems facing their Test and ODI squads . They need to find Sarfraz 's replacement but perhaps more importantly they need to scrutinise the performance of Arthur and his support staff . Unless that 's done and remedial measures are taken it would be quite unlikely that 2019 would be any better for the Pakistan team than the current year . 
@@60390240 <h> On the follies and failures of secular convictions-I <p> My mid-September essay in the TNS titled Beyond Religious Bigotry and Secular Freedom has elicited some critical reactions that I wish to briefly respond to here as a way to clarify my argument , and to hopefully further the conversation around the interaction of religion , secular power , and minority suffering in Pakistan and beyond . <p> Written in the context of the deplorable episode of renowned Pakistani-American economist Atif Mian 's forced expulsion from the Economic Advisory Council as a result of the backlash that emanated from his association with the Ahmadiyya community , the thrust of my essay centered on the following argument : such moments of minority injustice can not be reduced to a battle between " religious bigotry " and " secular freedom . " Rather , the minoritisation of particular religious communities and concomitant majoritarian violence are inextricable to certain irresolvable contradictions afflicting modern state sovereignty , and its ineluctable entanglement with political secularism . <p> Drawing on the magisterial work of anthropologist Saba Mahmood , I had argued , " religious inequality is enshrined in the very organising logic and structure of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its attempts at religious neutrality , the political and legal structuration of the modern state necessitates its involvement in and production of religious difference . While the precise texture and trajectory of such inequality certainly differs from the US to Egypt to Pakistan , no modern state -- Western or non-Western , purportedly secular or religious -- can escape an underlying paradox : even if the state " aims to make religious difference inconsequential to politics , " it can not help but embed " majoritarian religious norms in state institutions , laws , and practices " ( Tareen 2018 ; Mahmood 2015 : 206 ) . <p> The larger conceptual argument that anchors this line of thought has to do with a point that is now well-rehearsed in the field of what might be called Critical Secularism Studies , but that is still perhaps less familiar in some other academic and non-academic circles . That point is this : rather than the inverse or opposite of religion , the secular is better understood as a form of power that constantly manages and regulates what religion in the modern world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to liberal political rule . <p> At the outset , before I get to addressing some of the critiques my essay espoused , a clarifying comment is in order : critiquing secularism or exhibiting a less than enthusiastic embrace of the fantasy of religious equality it purports to deliver does NOT amount to an endorsement of religious fundamentalism . Bigotry of any sort , including that issued from actors marked as religious scholars , is condemnable ; the question at hand is whether recourse to the always deferred promise of secular freedom represents our only or best alternative . It is precisely a view and worldview that thrives on the **25;1484;TOOLONG binary , that sees the former as the antidote to the latter , that the field of critical secularism studies has sought to disrupt and question , by showing the conceptual contradictions and exclusionary political operations that mark secularism as an idea and ideal . <p> Critiquing secularism or exhibiting a less than enthusiastic embrace of the fantasy of religious equality it purports to deliver does NOT amount to an endorsement of religious fundamentalism . <p> Now turning to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TNS titled Atif Mian and Postsecular Anxiety represented a wholesale dismissal of the field of Critical Secularism Studies as what she termed a " diasporic academic indulgence " that in her view is politically and philosophically fallacious , while also irresponsible . The irony involved in casting the sledgehammer of exclusion as part of a conversation on minority exclusion is lost on Zia . There are several excellent academics based in Pakistan who draw on and are inspired by the work of scholars like Talal Asad , Saba Mahmood , Humeira Iqtidar ( among others ) who I suspect will take strong exception to Zia 's characterisation of engagement with this important body of scholarship as " diasporic indulgence . " <p> The implied message in this vacuous description of course is that interrogating the machinations of secular power is some elite ivory tower preoccupation with no relation to conditions on the ground in settings like Pakistan , and is thus only of interest to far removed diaspora scholars . Leaving aside the problematic ( shall we say fallacious ? ) binary here posited between the theoretical and the practical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plainly obvious her less than a reassuring understanding of this field of study . Notice for instance this sweeping claim of hers : " Based on the works of Habermas , Taylor , Casanova , Asad and others , postsecular theory runs on the premise that secularism is not the opposite or antidote to religion . " This pithy sentence is quite revealing of Zia 's inadequate grasp over the thought of these scholars , especially that of Talal Asad . <p> To begin , though in fairness Zia is hardly the only one to commit this mistake , her description of " postsecular " for the work of a scholar like Asad is misplaced for at the heart of his scholarly corpus is the attempt to trace the enduring workings and shadows of the " powers of the secular modern " ( NOT postsecular ) in varied domains of life . Moreover , lumping Asad with Habermas , Taylor , and Casanova as part of a common scholarly project is profoundly troubling . <p> Among the interventions of Asad 's thought has been precisely to unsettle Habermas 's celebration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discourse and debate by highlighting the power differentials and imbalances that inform the logics and rationalities governing such spaces .

And even an elementary understanding of Charles Taylor 's magnum opus A Secular Age makes abundantly obvious the major differences between his and Asad 's approaches to and conclusions regarding secular power , as the latter 's commentary on this book clearly shows . Zia has not done her homework before so cavalierly dismissing an entire field of thought . Perhaps " indulgence " in some readings , with an open mind and less polemical attitude , might do her a world of good . <p> In her essay , Zia also charged that I had engaged in what she called " humpty dumpty logics " while commenting on secularism . This is an intriguing category the lineaments and purposes of which are not so clear to me . Much like her essay as a whole , this category left me at once amused and bemused , almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on what this means only shows her own incapacity to think more creatively than what imprisonment to the religion/secular binary would allow . <p> Take for instance her following charge : " Tareen considers the agents of religious discrimination and hate for Ahmadis to be the liberals/secularism and not the defamed mullahs/Islamisation . " This is an absurd reading of my argument , nourished by the equally absurd Manichean assumption that the goodness of secularism or the wickedness of the mullah are the only two options we have available . Such unflinchingly fundamentalist faith in the salvational powers of secularism that proscribes even the hint of any analysis that sheds doubt on the purity of that power is sure to put many a religious fundamentalist to shame . As I will have occasion to repeat , the point of my essay was not to blame " secularism/liberals " but to shed some doubt on the conceptual and political soundness of reading moments of minority injustice such as the Atif Mian episode as the certain product of a naturally irreconcilable standoff between secular goodness and religious bigotry . <p> To close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charitable description ) of Zia 's presented recurrently in her essay : namely that I had " privileged majoritarian pain " by highlighting the intimate entanglement of modern state sovereignty , political secularism , and minority suffering . This , again , is a bewildering claim . The entire point of my essay was to push for an analysis of minority discrimination that thinks carefully about the very political conditions and discourses that generate the division of humanity into such categories as " majority " and " minority . " <p> Clearly , the story of such enumerated identities can not be divorced from the event and legacy of colonialism , and the perpetuation of that legacy , albeit through new and varied mechanisms , in postcolonial settings like Pakistan . How does such a conceptual stance equate to privileging " majoritarian pain " is rather beyond me.

@@60393233 <h> Email <p> It is tempting to start this essay with the sensationalist claim that the election of Imran Khan as prime minister is part of a process that may end the world as we know it . Apart from everything that is wrong with sensationalism , the statement may unfairly blur causation and correlation . In any case , the route to change will be long , coursing across the rapids , gorges and watersheds of political science and will be fed by various tributaries of international relations before meandering into history . <p> The process is well under way with the latest advent of populist politics that is sweeping across the western world . Examples range from the election of Donald Trump as the president of the United States , the successful Brexit referendum in Britain to leave the European Union , the electoral victory of Victor Orb ? n in Hungary , the rise to power of the Five Star Movement in Italy and the strong political showing of such right-wing ultra-nationalist parties as the Alternative for Germany , Marine Le Pen 's National Front in France and the Freedom Party in Austria . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the West though . Closer to home , we have seen the Bharatiya Janata Party and its bhakts come to power in India and Rodrigo Duterte becoming president in the Philippines . And now we have Imran Khan as prime minister in Pakistan . <p> There are , of course , huge differences between these examples but populist politicians and parties , whether of the left or the right , all share a set of tactics or styles . For instance , instead of seeing politics as a process of competing interests , populists present it as a struggle between the forces of good and evil . They claim monopoly over morality and make difference of opinion with them a marker of immorality . They deny the very legitimacy of their opponents , pitting the ' pure ' masses against a ' corrupt ' elite . They shore up anger and disgust against their political opponents , bureaucrats , journalists , non-governmental organisations and dissenters , calling for their removal from jobs and even for their imprisonment . They , in short , brand themselves as leading a revolt against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Other hallmarks of populists include : highly personalised styles of leadership ( asking people to vote for the leader and not for the candidate ) , cultivation of a strongman saviour persona , emphasising upon a direct relationship between the leader and the people ( awaam in our local parlance ) , the use of coarse language and manners ( such as oye , geeli shalwars , etc ) to challenge the established political culture and a push for popular but unsustainable policies ( for instance , bringing back 200 billion US dollars of corruption money allegedly stashed abroad or building five million houses for the poor ) . <p> The intended consequences of these tactics and policies are increasingly becoming obvious across the globe . Populists everywhere are undermining whatever trust citizens have in the institutions and procedures of representative democracy . <p> Authors of Going to Extremes , a study published in 2016 in the European Economic Review , state that such trust deficit often follows economic upheavals . They looked at 800 elections in Europe across 140 years and found that , after every financial crisis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political polarisation intensified . <p> The current wave of populism could be more of the same -- a result of the financial crises in many countries . It is also entirely possible that it is not : that we are witnessing something qualitatively different from the panicked bursts of populism of the past . Here is why . <p> There are some common denominators in the content of the current surge of populism . In Europe , it is the fear of and aggression against migration and minorities and insecurities over cultural identity ; in the United States , populism is targeted against immigrants and the globalised world economy and it stands for economic nativism ; in India , it is about culture , religion and minorities ; and in Pakistan , Imran Khan 's political rise owes it to his clarion calls for protecting Pakistan 's sovereignty and his mass mobilisation on the notion of national honour ( qaumi ghairat ) threatened and undermined by interventions from outsiders ( though he has appreciably spoken in the favour of minorities and refugees ) . <p> Whether it was financial assistance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States inside Pakistani territory or civilian-centric American aid promised under the Kerry-Lugar-Berman Law in return for specific restrictions on terrorist organisations -- he portrayed each of them as national humiliation and surrender . <p> Taken together , this listing of immigrants versus locals , linguistic , religious and racial homogeneity , impermeable national borders , protected economy , sovereignty , national honour and national identity are all the characteristics of a single entity : the nation state . <p> The problem is that each of these is unraveling . <p> In Naara desert in Sindh , a woman told me about her son working as a driver with an oil and gas exploration company in its Islamabad office . What she said was : " Woh mulk mein naukri karta hai . Saal mein aik dafa watan waapis aata hai . Mein yahaan apni qaum ke saath rehti hoon " ( he works in the country , comes back to his homeland once a year while I live with my community , or tribe , here ) . <p> Her formulation was as curious as it was revealing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sindh was motherland and her own tribe was her nation . For her , mulk , watan and qaum were separate enclaves within the geographical boundaries of Pakistan . Nobody in her community found her phrasing jarring . <p> Where does this leave the nation state ? <p> The nation and the state were not always synonymous . A state is a political entity comprising institutions of governance that operate within demarcated geographical borders . A nation is a group of people who believe they have a common origin , shared history and a collective culture , language and/or ethnicity -- commonalities that make them distinct from other groups . A nation state , thus , is a space inhabited by a relatively homogenous group of people who are governed by the same set of political , legal and economic institutions . Essentially , each nation gets its own state and , conversely , each state has one nation living in it . <p> In theory , therefore , a nation state makes political and geographical boundaries correspond with psychosocial ones . In actuality , the story varies . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the aftermath of the Thirty Years ' War in which more than five million people died across Europe in religious and sectarian conflicts . The war ended with the ' Peace of Exhaustion ' that resulted in the Treaty of Westphalia . The treaty stated that the ruler of each realm would decide the official religion of their domain , limiting the role of the church and the Holy Roman Empire in this regard . This is how the idea of worldly sovereignty was born in Europe -- as opposed to divine sovereignty bestowed by the clergy . <p> The creation of nation states gained momentum in the 20th century when independence movements coalesced around nationalism against the colonial powers of Spain , France and Britain . Between 1944 and 1984 , 90 new states were created . As of now , the world is divided into 193 states . <p> Prior to the 20th century , there existed many other forms of political sovereignty . The world was dotted with city states , princely states and principalities , unclaimed land and multi-ethnic empires with no checks on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the British Empire , the Russian Empire and the Austrian Empire , among others , were hereditary monarchies , each of them populated by diverse ethnic , linguistic , religious and racial groups . <p> Nations , on the other hand , are socially constructed . This bears repeating in the context of Pakistan where many see the Pakistani nation as a natural and even a divinely ordained entity -- a manifestation of our collective destiny . <p> Nations are ' imagined communities ' , as political scientist Benedict Anderson put it , and nationalism is a way of creating such imagined communities . Medievalist Patrick Geary has described modern nationalism ( which includes movements for ethnic nationalism and sub-nationalism ) as a myth and a pseudo-science . He calls modern history as something created in the 19th century as an instrument of nationalism . There is consensus among scholars ranging from Eric Hobsbawm to Andrew Gellner that nations do not make states and give birth to nationalism but the other way round . <p> Consider a counterfactual : what if the whacky proposal of Choudhry Rahmat Ali ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proposed Pakistan as just one of the many ' stans ' to be carved out of India -- -- the others being Siddiqistan , Haideristan , Farooqistan , Usmanistan and Bangistan . Or consider the map he bizarrely titled , " Pakistan at the Dawn of History " , in which he included the whole of Iran , Afghanistan and Turkmenistan as being part of a prehistoric Pakistan . In both of his versions of the country , self-perception of what constitutes the Pakistani nation would have been entirely different . <p> The idea of a nation is primarily based on distinctions between in-groups and out-groups , on who qualifies as a member of a nation and who does not . Who is included , what the inclusion criteria is and what ties a nation together -- these are fundamental issues because status and rights in a nation state are determined by them . <p> Most postcolonial states have multiple nations living within their boundaries that have been drawn up by their erstwhile colonisers . Innumerable conflicts have arisen in these countries because of the fact that political boundaries do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ones . The most obvious deviation from the ideal of ' one nation , one state ' is the presence of minorities , which differ in significant ways from majority communities , in almost all of these countries . The whiplash to these minorities has ranged from the on-going persecution of Rohingyas in Myanmar , expulsion of the Roma in Europe , forced assimilation of indigenous groups in the United States and Australia , communal violence and riots in India and genocide of the Tutsi tribe by the Hutu tribe in Rwanda as well as of Bosnian Muslims by Serbs in ex-Yugoslavia . In Pakistan , it led to the dismemberment of the country through a civil war in 1971 as East Pakistan fought for and attained independence as Bangladesh . <p> A forced contouring of a nation by defining who rightly belongs to it and who does not , thus , is a problem genetically embedded within the nation state model . <p> What has changed now ? <p> Every few years , some people start predicting the end of the nation state while some others dismiss these predictions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clashing opinions , however , do not hide the fact that the trends that weaken the nation state are accelerating . The notion of sovereignty -- a state 's jurisdiction for governance -- is increasingly being constrained due to several factors given below . <h> Global movement of capital <p> Globalised markets erode the power of national governments over the trade of goods . National borders also can no longer control the flow of money . International trade agreements limit the power of nation states even over domestic markets , thereby reducing their ability to offer protection to domestic manufacturers from foreign competition . Global financial institutions impose conditions on governments that seek financial help from them , including on where a government should earn money from and what it should spend it on . <p> Transnational corporations , with annual sales higher than the gross domestic output of many individual countries , leverage their position to gain access to cheap labour , to benefit from tax breaks , to seek exemptions from local laws and to expand their financial influence . Citizens do not need much more than a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of national governments into offshore accounts or to invest elsewhere and financial elites can increasingly escape national allegiances and national political authority . <p> A globalised world economy has also led to high levels of inequality both within and among the nation states and , as many scholars have pointed out , political leaders resort to nationalism in times of high economic inequality . They use nationalism as a diversion from economic realities and to generate solidarity otherwise threatened by unequal distribution of wealth and resources . <h> Communication technologies <p> National borders are also becoming increasingly meaningless in the face of communication technologies . Information flow is now instantaneous , easy , cheap , decentralised and , barring a few exceptions , unregulated . The Internet and social media sites have broken the stronghold of national media and the total users of such Internet and social media giants as Facebook , Google and YouTube outnumber the population of every individual country , including India and China . <p> The Internet has also created a space for complex social interactions , including political ones , which are not determined by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back of information and communication technologies is creating new identities and associations such as the MeToo movement . <p> Non-state actors launching cyberattacks in far off places also show how keeping national politics a closed-border affair has become all but impossible . The 2016 elections in the United States provide a vivid example of how sovereignty , which is essentially the power of a state to stop others from interfering in its internal affairs , was seriously compromised by troll farms operating from Russia and Macedonia . <p> Information and communication technologies are also giving rise to new dynamics in income generation and wealth distribution . After artificial intelligence and 3D printing become commonly available , the ability of national governments to create low-skill jobs will be seriously eroded . <p> It is hardly surprising then that the main form of inequality in the next few decades will be access , or lack of access , to the Internet . Being called as ' digital exclusion ' , it is fast becoming synonymous with economic inequality in academic literature . <p> Indian Prime Minister Narender Modi on the right Reuters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ electronic cash and cryptocurrencies that move around without a nod from central banks and national financial regulators -- illustrates how the state 's authority is disappearing even in spheres that were once considered its exclusive domain . <p> The rapid rise of information and communication technologies is overriding another fundamental function of the nation state : to keep an eye on its citizens . Big data companies have started supplanting the state even in this sphere . <p> Populist nationalism is emerging as a reaction to these developments . As other contenders for power emerge and the state 's authority diffuses , these are mirrored in the need for populist ' strongmen ' leaders who can assert authority and control where control seems to be fraying . There is a longing for an idealised , pure past -- -- whether it is a caliphate for the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria ( ISIS ) , the ' state of Madina ' for Imran Khan , a Hindu homeland for Hindu fundamentalists in India , or the need to ' make America great again ' in the United States . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the past . <h> Human mobility <p> Human movement from one territory to another has been a constant across millennia . But it no longer involves just the occupation of unclaimed territory or a movement to areas which have low population density and/or low levels of regulation . One million asylum seekers , mainly from Asia and Africa , landed in 2015 alone in the member states of the European Union . Though their number has decreased to a quarter of that in the following years , it is still enough to spark a political and humanitarian crisis . <p> Analysts explain the rise of right-wing populist parties across Europe -- as well as Brexit -- mainly as an effect of the fear of being flooded by migrants who would stretch the host states ' resources thin and could also change their cultural and racial make-up . <p> We also know that two countries , Maldives and Kiribati , will be submerged by rising seas in the coming decades , requiring all their citizens to move to another state . Estimates from a World Bank study show that climate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> These figures are apart from and in addition to the routine emergence of economic migrants and conflict refugees across the world . What will happen when hundreds of millions of people move across nation states ? This question becomes even more salient when people from the global south wonder why citizenship -- an accident of birth -- should act as a lifelong quarantine when other barriers linked to birth such as class , caste and even gender can be and have been surmounted . <h> Interdependence <p> The nation state was the classic provider of security and fundamental rights in exchange for loyalty by citizens . It is increasingly unable to guarantee both . Specialised regimes of international law have been instituted in arenas that were previously the exclusive remit of the nation state , such as trade regulation and enforcement of human rights . <p> Environmental emergencies are similarly making single-country responses unhelpful , if not entirely useless . Carbon emissions in one country wreaking havoc in another , for instance , necessitate fundamental changes in the distribution of natural resources across state boundaries . Calling it " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ climate change is more a crisis of culture and imagination than a natural hazard . <p> The other monumental contemporary crisis that is beyond national jurisdictions to address is that of terrorism . While terrorists operate across countries and regions , law enforcers and security agencies are obstructed by unwieldy jurisdictional issues and competing national interests . An immediate example of this is the Pak-Afghan border . The Islamic State in Iraq and Syria ( ISIS ) , a terrorist entity in western Asia , also offers an interesting case study in this regard . It publicly stated that it would right the wrongs done by the Sykes-Picot agreement that divided the Arab provinces of the Ottoman Empire between Britain and France after World War I in order to protect the economic interests , including oil supplies , of these two European powers . It later set up its own territorial jurisdiction that contravened imperially carved nation states and their borders . <p> If nothing else , this action has been a direct challenge to the artifice of the nation state . <p> It is useful to reflect on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -- to understand how and why the current global dynamics and trends are working as a centrifugal force on the nation state model . Nations are created through narratives -- histories and stories of origin contoured with invented traditions , rituals and grafted meanings . <p> The nation state itself was made possible largely through the advent and advancement of communication technologies . American historian Elizabeth Eisenstein has shown how the printing press enabled the emergence of a common language , standardised education and shared national sensibilities . <p> In the absence of these developments , most nation states would not have even come into being . When France became a nation state after the French Revolution , half of its population did not speak French . When Italy was unified , less than 15 per cent of its people spoke Italian ; many did not speak the language until television sets became common in the 1960s . Pakistan , therefore , was not unique in having a national language that only a small part of the population initially spoke . <p> Propagandist or mythologised interpretation of events as national @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many states in nation-building . But where these did not permeate fully into the collective ethos , the nation state model continued to hover a few feet above people 's heads , allowing identity wormholes such as the one occupied by the woman I met in Naara desert . <p> The use of media and its various platforms for information dissemination and as a tool for control of public opinion was critical for national elites to create national narratives . Many of them are now struggling to keep doing that . <p> Chinese President Xi Jinping has talked about cyber sovereignty , claiming that all countries should have the right to regulate the Internet within their own borders . Many online social networking platforms , including Twitter , are not available in China . Pakistan has also attempted to control new media by , for instance , banning YouTube ( but people figured out ways around it in less than a week ) and keeping many other websites out of bounds . Our government is also trying to set up a military-led telecom system that will give the state extensive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can not impose Section 144 in virtual space . <p> Donald Trump at a campaign rally AP <p> While there have been times in the past when the flow of information suddenly picked up speed , latest advances have not just impacted the speed of communication they have also reduced the cost of transmitting information . So , while the Guttenberg Press demystified for common people what the powerful were talking about , current advances have broken the fourth wall , creating an affordable and accessible two-way information highway that can generate its own velocity and intensity . <p> Traditional bureaucracies have banked on monopolising information and political elites have relied on monopolising the means of political engagement . By allowing those with a computer and an Internet connection to curate and disseminate information and to engage politically , digital media platforms are changing the very nature of power . <p> Consider political realist Joseph Nye Jr 's definition of power : it is the ability to affect others to obtain the outcomes you want . When the nation state rose to dominance during the industrial age , governments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of citizens through what theorist Michel Foucault called " biopower " . In the information age , biopower alone can not guarantee the desired outcomes . " Success , " as Nye Jr points out , " depends not just on whose army wins , but also whose story wins . " <p> This statement also encapsulates the problem that derails any overarching analysis . While the nation state 's ability to dictate the market of stories is increasingly constrained , its armies and security apparatus continue to increase their ' hard power ' destructive capacities as well as resources for monitoring and surveillance . It is hard to predict how the nation state model will recalibrate this internal asymmetry of power which , in another manifestation , is also increasingly allowing many states to deploy for propaganda the same Internet-powered , citizen-driven media that was once expected to bring about democratisation of public dialogue . <p> There are no linear progression patterns as far as the future of the nation state is concerned . <p> My niece recently had a class assignment to draw an alien from a fantasy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ class drew figures of various shapes and colours but all those figures had eyes , noses , mouths and limbs of varying numbers . If the imagination of 10 year olds is already captive to what is familiar , the older ones can not even begin to imagine . The nation state as an idea is hegemonic . Those whose identity is synchronised to fit into a defined nation struggle to even conceive an ' outside ' . <p> Earlier issues faced by nation states , such as secessionist movements , furthered their logic and did not challenge them . Those movements were launched by various groups/communities who were themselves aspiring to become nation states . The concept of a nation state based on a manifested geographical reality or territory is now being tested in new ways . As money , information and people zoom across the world , or even across cyberspace , without requiring senders and recipients to leave their homes , many things -- economic activity , citizenship , human relationships and cultural identities -- are becoming de-territorialised . What geography itself means is changing . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ madcap ventures like seasteads -- - people trying to create permanent dwellings in international waters outside the jurisdiction of any government ; cities floating in high seas . Others seem like viable precursors to a new world . Estonia , for instance , has introduced e-residency , giving digital citizenship to people anywhere in the world whereby they can register and run businesses and access public services in the same way as those born and living in Estonia can . <p> Maybe the ancient idea of city states , aligned in confederations of sorts , will come back with a digitised vengeance . Or , in spite of the fact that the European Union is faltering right now and the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation ( Saarc ) seems to be a dead elephant , perhaps regional governance bodies are the way forward . <p> The nation state may well survive all this by adapting . To avoid the typical aggravating Pakistani sign off : will it be this , or will it be that , only time will tell , let us segue into the metaphysics of identity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a ship belonging to the mythological Greek king Theseus has its parts replaced over the years . Does it still remain the same object after all its parts have been changed ? What if all except one of the original planks are changed ? What if they are changed at the same time ? What if they are gradually changed one by one over decades ? What if the design is changed in the process of replacement ? What if the ship 's purpose changes ? Is it still the Ship of Theseus ? What if another ship uses its discarded parts ? Will that ship , then , become the Ship of Theseus ? <p> If countries adopt a civic nationalism with allegiance to laws , institutions and rights -- instead of relying on imagined historic affinities -- or embrace multiple nations in an expanded identity , allow roving populations to stake citizenship claims , permit regulation by international authorities , or redefine sovereignty or territory , will they still be nation states ? <p> The debate about the future of the nation state may be less critical for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the world . The nation state model has never managed to create an airtight overlapping of identity and geography here in the first place . But the debate will remain critical for the state itself . The woman in Naara desert simply pointed towards the divergence between the people and the state which officialdom has attempted to paper over with concepts such as national interest and the ideology of Pakistan . <p> Pakistani establishment , that has historically resisted the transfer of power to domestic civil authority , now has to contend with the diffusion of power to international markets , supra-state governance bodies and people 's agency across the globe . Just when it is expanding its ability to impose its writ , the very notion of the writ of the state is under global fire . But these emerging challenges can not be firewalled and insulation from it is not possible . We can not be inoculated against global change . <p> The rise of populist politicians and parties seems to be a pushback against changes in the nation state model that are inevitable in any case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at varying gradients , causing much damage and collecting much debris along the way . <p> Legends tell us that all forms known to us emerge from such metaphoric primordial waters .
