@@90105231 <h> Compliance reform by trust companies under tightened regulation <p> By December 2021 , the transition period for new asset management regulations was nearing its end , and trust companies have made remarkable progress in planning their transformations .

The Provisional Measures for the Administration of Equity of Trust Companies set out management requirements for the full process of regulating company equity , penetrative inspections of shareholder equity , administration of shareholder behaviour , etc . <p> ( 2 ) Regulating the organisational structure of trust companies .

The Notice of the General Office of the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission on Matters Relevant to Rectifying the Departments of Trust Companies Established Elsewhere ( Draft for Comment ) requires trust companies to relocate their middle and back-office departments back to their places of registration within one year , to reduce the risk of accumulating latent risks arising due to the lack of effective management and control over departments located elsewhere and affecting the transmission and implementation of regulatory policies . <p> ( 3 ) Enhancing oversight of the use of trust funds .

Since 2021 , 16 trust institutions have been penalised , with total fines and forfeitures exceeding RMB60 million . The main causes for penalties include illegal use of trust funds to pay land premiums , failure to timely disclose information as required , and lax pre-loan and post-loan reviews leading to the proceeds of large trust loans flowing back to the borrower 's account at another bank , causing inconsistency between the use of the loan proceeds and provisions of the trust loan contract . <p> Noticeable results and improved profits .

@@90535238 <h> What can a lessor do when the lessee is in bankruptcy ? <p> In a financial lease , if the lessee goes bankrupt or enters reorganisation due to insolvency , the lessor is certain to be adversely affected . To uphold its own interests , the lessor should carefully assess the status of the lessee and leasehold , and take the initiative if necessary <p> In recent years , due to macroeconomic trends , national policies and raised legal awareness , courts have been accepting a notably increasing number of corporate bankruptcy cases . Meanwhile , the likelihood of financing and financial leasing companies ( the lessors ) encountering bankruptcy reorganisation of lessees during the lease term has likewise multiplied . Based on the authors ' legal practice experience , we have summarised the following key advice for lessors when dealing with the bankruptcy reorganisation of lessees . <p> Where the lessee risks bankruptcy , strengthen post-lease management , keep abreast of the state of the lessee and the leasehold and , if necessary , resort to litigation without delay . If the lessee is found to have paid rent late , diverted assets , brought in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reasonable cause , been involved in a large number of litigations , or had negative public opinion on its creditworthiness , it would indicate that the legal risks of the lessee defaulting or even going bankrupt are accumulating rapidly . <p> The lessor is advised , first and foremost , to step up post-lease management , inspect the leasehold , ensure that its title is publicly disclosed , and that the lessee did not dispose of the leasehold on its own accord . The lessor should further check whether the information on the leasehold specified in the financial lease contract is consistent with its actual state , and for any defects in the specialisation of the leasehold . In case of any issues , the lessor should remedy them to the extent possible . <p> Additionally , the lessor should consider bringing legal action against the lessee and the guarantor , if litigation was the specified method of resolution . Pursuant to articles 20 and 21 of the Business Bankruptcy Law , if the lessor initiates litigation in the agreed competent court before the bankruptcy application of the lessee was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the claim and vesting of the leasehold , it would be able to avoid litigation at a later time in the local court of the lessee , thereby reducing uncertainty . <p> Timely and accurately declare creditors ' rights , monitor the use of the leasehold and consider exercising the right of recovery . If the lessee has been ordered to go through reorganisation , the lessor should promptly and accurately declare its creditors ' rights , submit requisite documents evidencing the claim , and actively communicate with the administrator in terms of the amount and nature of the claim , as well as disposal of the leasehold . <p> The lessor must continue monitoring the use of the leasehold . If the administrator decides to continue using the leasehold to sustain the basic production and operating activities of the lessee , in respect of the debts arising from such continued use , the lessor may consider claiming it as collective debts in accordance with the first or third paragraph of article 42 of the Business Bankruptcy Law , which is likely to advance the claim in terms of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bankruptcy Law , the following debts incurred after court acceptance of a bankruptcy application are deemed collective debts : ( 1 ) debts generated from a contract , the performance of which both parties concerned fail to fulfil on the request of performance raised by the bankruptcy administrator or debtor against the opposite party ; ( 2 ) debts generated from the negotiorum gestio ( management of business ) of the debtor 's assets ; ( 3 ) debts generated from ill-gotten gains ; ( 4 ) the labour cost for the continuance of business operations , social insurance premiums , and other liabilities as incurred ; ( 5 ) debts generated from the damage that occurs in the performance of functions and duties by a bankruptcy administrator or other relevant personnel ; and ( 6 ) debts generated from any damage due to the debtor 's assets . <p> If the administrator decides to cease using the leasehold , although the lessor could consider entrusting the administrator to dispose of the leasehold in the course of the bankruptcy proceedings , such proceedings can be quite lengthy , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not promptly disposed of . The lessor should consider the feasibility of exercising its right of recovery as soon as possible , and appraise the leasehold to contain losses . <p> Furthermore , with respect to dismantling , transport , appraisal , auctioning and other expenses incurred in the retrieval and disposal of the leasehold , the lessor should consult the financial lease contract , and determine whether the lessee can be required to bear such expenses , and claim them as bankruptcy expenses or collective debts afterwards . <p> Apart from its own creditor rights , the lessor should examine the claims of other major creditors . Pursuant to articles 57 and 58 of the Business Bankruptcy Law , the administrator will register , bind and examine the claims declared by the creditors , prepare a form of the creditors ' rights , and submit it to the first creditors ' meeting for verification . In the course of verifying the claims , the lessor should pay attention to not only the administrator 's examination of its own claim , but also the inspection results of other creditors , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should promptly raise any objection that they may have , or even institute legal action , to avoid impairing the solvency of its rights as creditors . <p> Maintain necessary contact with other creditors of the same class when formulating and voting on the reorganisation plan . In the course of the administrator 's formulation of the reorganisation plan , the lessor , as a financial institution with a relatively strong capacity to bear losses , may suffer certain impairment of its interests . Accordingly , it is imperative for the lessor to maintain necessary contact with the creditors of the same voting class for the draft reorganisation plan . The parties ought to strive for common interests and prevent the adoption of a reorganisation plan that materially harms their lawful rights and interests .

" <p> The Chinese government launched an infectious boomerang in late 2019 when it covered up a viral outbreak in Wuhan that turned out to be Covid-19 . That boomerang has returned home with a mighty thwack , threatening to slow China 's economic rise while undermining its global reputation . <p> Two and a half years into the pandemic , Covid restrictions made it illegal to eat inside a restaurant in Beijing , seat of the Chinese Communist Party . In Shanghai , China 's premier commercial centre , tens of millions of people were not allowed to leave their homes . Many of them went hungry .

Many governments bungled their responses . But it 's hard to deny that much of the blame falls on Beijing . For two and a half years , Chinese officials have proactively exacerbated the pandemic . This reveals much about China 's authoritarian style of governance . <h> How has China responded to Covid ? <p> China 's Covid-19 response has involved several overlapping and frequently self-reinforcing features , all of which have made the problem worse for the world . The government 's actions have ranged from arresting Chinese doctors and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spreading propaganda in news reporting , expelling foreign journalists attempting to learn what is going on , retaliating against local and global critics , and using diplomats to distort perceptions and refute criticism . <p> One of the initial features of China 's Covid-19 response was to cover up the outbreak . This may have been an attempt by local officials to avoid blame , but very quickly official denial went national . The government classified Covid-related research as politically sensitive , requiring researchers to get official permission before sharing what they knew . The National Health Commission silenced institutions with knowledge of the virus . The Covid-19 genome was mapped quickly by Chinese scientists , but they were ordered to keep silent . When they defied that order , their laboratory was closed . <p> Covid-19 under an electron microscope .

The best-known example was Wuhan doctor Li Wenliang , who was forced by the Public Security Bureau to apologise for " false statements and disturbing public order " after he alerted his colleagues to the virus . When Li was killed by Covid-19 , the government initially obstructed attempts to mourn his death . <p> The domestic Covid-19 strategy has changed little since the initial Wuhan outbreak , when severe restrictions were imposed on people 's movements . It seems to have worked quite well for earlier variants of the virus , although it 's impossible to know for certain about the number of Covid-19 infections and deaths in China due to the opacity of its official health statistics . The current Omicron variant has proved to be much more difficult to subdue . <p> Some international observers , not least in the WHO , initially parroted Beijing 's self-congratulation for the effectiveness of its strict controls on movement -- even as Chinese officials decried foreign governments for closing their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subsequently do to theirs . Two and one-half years later , as Omicron spread widely throughout the country , China imposed its own restrictions on Chinese travellers , not to protect other countries from being infected by them but to prevent them from bringing Covid back to China . <p> The single most effective long-term strategy for coping with Covid-19 seems to be the universal use of effective vaccines . China 's approach to vaccines has been to pour scorn on foreign-made varieties while distributing and playing up the benefits of home-grown versions that are substantially less effective , especially compared to Western mRNA technologies , in preventing transmission , symptoms and deaths . Even 30 months into the pandemic , Beijing still refuses to authorise use of the most efficacious vaccines , apparently for purely political reasons . <p> Chinese and Pakistani officials gathered on June 24 in Beijing to witness a donation ceremony organized by the #China Centre for Promotion of SME Development , offering to donate oxygen concentrators and face masks to help #Pakistan combat the COVID-19 epidemic. **42;1346;TOOLONG <p> Early in the pandemic , China used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the former offering personal protection equipment ( PPE : medical masks , disposable gloves and the like ) and the latter selling Chinese vaccines ( almost universally at high prices compared to other countries ' jabs ) to friendly countries , while withholding them from unfriendly ones .

When Hong Kong suffered a massive wave of Omicron , one of Beijing 's responses was to ship in huge quantities of TCM , despite its dubious efficacy . The local government in turn sent boxes of TCM to every household . If my elderly indigenous neighbour 's reaction is anything to go by , most of that TCM ended up in Hong Kong 's landfills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he refused and pointed to the nearest rubbish bin . <p> China has been extremely prolific in its use of Covid-related propaganda and obfuscation ( a.k.a. " fake news " ) . This has been manifested in ministry press briefings , diplomatic protests , Chinese official " news , " and social media , including Twitter and YouTube ( both of which are banned in China ) . This campaign has sought to put a positive spin on China 's Covid response and refute , condemn and punish anyone who criticises that response . It has involved suggestions that the virus originated in other countries . For example , in March 2020 , a Chinese foreign ministry spokesman tweeted that the US Army might have brought the virus to Wuhan . <p> China has implemented a worldwide campaign to cover up its Covid-related failings .

One consequence has been an economic slowdown that not only affects China but is having knock-on effects around the world , contributing to global inflation . According to James Palmer , deputy editor of Foreign Policy , the zero-Covid policy is unlikely to change anytime soon due to the " political sensitivity for Chinese President Xi Jinping after two years of trumpeting the zero-COVID strategy as a personal achievement , as well as a Chinese Communist Party ( CCP ) success . " Xi seems unlikely to allow a relaxation because " he wants to use China 's success in containing the virus to prove that its top-down governance model is superior to that of liberal democracies .

" There are fears that the policy is the harbinger of a return to a planned economy . Lockdowns across China have resulted in marked falls in consumption and production . Even when the current outbreak is brought under control , the political obsession with maintaining the zero-Covid policy could cause the entire country to be " stuck in a costly cycle of outbreak and lockdown , " as Palmer put it . <p> While China 's propaganda has triumphantly proclaimed the continued success of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " rage , frustration and despair " that may be testing the perceived legitimacy of China 's leaders , at least if widespread expressions of discontent on social media , nightly banging of pots and other protests in Shanghai and other Chinese cities are any indication .

International criticism is also growing . A week after President Xi doubled down on the zero-Covid policy , the director-general of the WHO described it as " unsustainable " given the infectiousness of Omicron , and WHO 's director of emergencies questioned the policy 's negative impacts on human rights and the economy .

Chinese officials are not inclined to reveal outbreaks . Doing so might imply that they have failed in their jobs . The knee-jerk political response is to cover things up , first from superiors , then from citizens , then from the wider world . As Washington Post columnist Josh Rogin argues , the Chinese government 's " defensiveness and overall lack of concern for things such as truth and transparency are part of its character .

This has been manifested in the government 's failure to accept new Covid-19 epidemiology and technological innovation , for example by refusing to approve Western mRNA vaccines .

This inclination to believe one 's own propaganda , or at least to behave as though it is believed , has resulted in China repeating the failures for which it so vociferously attacked Western countries . For example , both Shanghai and Hong Kong failed to vaccinate enough of their elderly residents to avoid unnecessary casualties . At one point the latter city had the highest Covid death rate in the world . <p> Like other authoritarian regimes , China 's is fulsome in self-praise when things go well , and well-practiced in using propaganda and media manipulation to turn what might otherwise be bad news into good news . When things go especially well , or are perceived to do so , senior leaders are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and redrafting reality becomes problematic , those same leaders avoid the limelight . After hailing his country 's response to Covid-19 in 2020 and 2021 , President Xi has been notable for maintaining his distance from the setbacks of 2022 . <p> China 's global Covid propaganda campaign is part of a larger initiative , stepped up markedly since the advent of Xi , to win respect for the country 's authoritarian style of governance and " cast the Party and its leadership in the best possible light " nationally and internationally . China 's propagandists also seem to be motivated by the political logic that has dominated Hong Kong in recent years : attributing all problems to mysterious external actors . This was demonstrated when Beijing blamed unnamed " foreign forces " for inciting people in Shanghai to protest at their treatment during Covid lockdown . In Hong Kong , one " patriotic " legislator suggested that those advocating a " live with Covid " alternative to zero-Covid policy could be in violation of the city 's National Security Law . <p> Photo : GovHK . <p> Covid-19 has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or any country , that questions or pushes back against its official narrative . In China , everything is political , at least potentially . To challenge the leadership 's Covid policy would risk political suicide , so few officials are willing or able to propose alternative approaches . Indeed , questioning official Covid policy is considered disloyal and has been shown to lead to arrest . China 's opposition to allowing Taiwan to engage fully with the WHO 's pandemic response mechanisms , and its criticism of other countries for sending vaccines to Taiwan , shows that Covid is firstly a political concern for Beijing and only secondarily a concern about human life . <p> Another thing the Covid-19 pandemic has revealed is that China 's leaders can never resist an opportunity to use events to justify , at least from their own perspective , cracking down harder on what remains of personal liberties and freedoms . According to James Palmer , " The zero-COVID policy has been a boon to the security state , extending the range of tools and the normalization of surveillance . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that its governance system is not as effective and efficient as official accounts suggest . From letting the virus run riot around the world to being unable to vaccinate the elderly -- or even to ensure that they are properly fed while in lockdown -- China 's response has been far from exemplary . That may not prove that China 's political system is inferior to others . After all , many governments have dealt badly with Covid-19 . However , surely China 's actions are evidence that its system is hardly a role model for other countries , possibly even those ruled by regimes that care little about human rights . <h> China 's Covid response affected its power and influence ? <p> In recent years , China 's reputation and influence around the world have suffered from its progressively authoritarian policies at home and its increasingly aggressive behaviour abroad . Beijing 's denials of responsibility for the pandemic , alongside its obfuscations and vaccine missteps , have further undermined its international reputation . If its Covid-related propaganda was intended to improve its standing in the world , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early in the pandemic . Its coercive use of PPE in 2020 made other countries question its reliability as a source of vital supplies . Preconditions set by Beijing before selling its home-grown vaccines to other countries , such as requiring fealty to its foreign policy positions and excluding any country that has diplomatic relations with Taiwan , were hardly conducive to bolstering its global influence . It did not help that Beijing refused to be transparent about testing data related to its vaccines , and that it pretended nothing was amiss when its vaccines proved to be less efficacious than the Western ones that its propaganda machine sought to trash . Indeed , China 's style of vaccine diplomacy did not just fail ; it was counterproductive , leaving China diminished in the eyes of much the world . <p> File photo : Gov't EU . <p> In Europe , China 's behaviour has garnered derision and increased scepticism of Beijing as an international partner . Several Chinese ambassadors in Europe openly criticised national responses to the pandemic and spread conspiracy theories about the origins of Covid-19 . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investigation of Covid 's origins , Canberra was pushed more tightly into the geostrategic orbit of the United States . The worries of other countries observing China 's extreme reactions were understandably heightened . <p> Until recently Beijing could at least claim success in suppressing the virus within China . However , with widespread outbreaks of Omicron across the country in recent weeks , and the growing ramifications of the zero-Covid policy for the national economy , it can no longer do that with much credibility . From abroad , at least , the perception seems to be that China has bungled Covid-19 . As columnist Bret Stephens asks , " Does anyone still think that China 's handling of the pandemic -- its deceits , its mediocre vaccines , a zero-Covid policy that manifestly failed and now this cruel lockdown that has brought hunger and medicine shortages to its richest city -- is a model to the rest of the world ? " It appears that Covid-19 is cascading disaster for China 's global image . <p> A possible exception to China 's declining international reputation is in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has served as a framework for them to use health concerns as justification for deepening censorship and repression . Joel Simon and Robert Mahoney argue that China 's response to Covid-19 " provided a playbook for information repression that spread around the world alongside the virus ... facilitated by the narrative , created and spread by China , that authoritarian governments were better equipped to respond to the pandemic ... because of their ability to control and manage information . " <p> Photo : WeChat screenshot . <p> But this advantage may be wearing thin even at home . Rigid enforcement of zero-Covid is undermining Chinese citizens ' and legal experts ' trust in the rule of law . There is worry that the government is drawing on its playbook from Xinjiang -- strict surveillance of people 's behaviour and routinised restrictions on their movements -- when implementing its zero-Covid policy . The norm in Xinjiang may become the norm across China . <h> The casualties of Covid-19 <p> In the early months of the pandemic in 2020 , official counts of cases in Wuhan and other cities were several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the number of daily cases , based on China 's own reporting ( which undercounts actual cases ) , reached tens of thousands per day . By the government 's own measure , two-plus years of " zero " Covid has resulted in infections that are at least ten times as prevalent as when the pandemic began . China seems to have been successful in keeping deaths from Covid low compared to several other countries . That said , we will never know how many people in China have died from Covid-19 or from all the Covid-related restrictions . It is likely that not even the government knows the true casualty figures . As most other countries return to normal while China implements more draconian restrictions , its Covid-19 response hardly seems worth trumpeting . <p> China will eventually join most of the world in " living with " Covid-19 . That may happen after Xi has been inaugurated for his third term in office . One assumes that by then more vulnerable people will have been vaccinated . The government will surely take credit for things that go well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . To be sure , the Chinese government is not unique in taking credit and rejecting blame ; governments everywhere do that . But Chinese officials surely win the prize for brazenness ( now that Donald Trump is out of office ) . <p> Internationally , the pandemic is knocking great chunks off the patina of China 's model of governance . Every casualty of Covid-19 is ultimately tied to decisions and actions taken by China 's leaders that failed to prevent and stop the initial outbreak in Wuhan . Around the world , about 15 million people have died due to the pandemic , with many more deaths certain to follow . Every one of those deaths could have been avoided if China 's political system were not reflexively tuned to hide , obfuscate , contradict , propagandise and deny truths and facts . The more people die from Covid-19 , the more tainted the China model seems to be .

@@92213231 <h> Risks of importing Russian LNG during war in Ukraine ( Part 2 ) <p> As mentioned in the previous article in this series , the war in Ukraine has seen the US , EU and other Western countries and regions impose a stream of economic sanctions against Russia , greatly affecting the international trade in liquefied natural gas ( LNG ) upstream and downstream . The sanctions not only constrain trade in Russia-related LNG sources but also add to the uncertainty faced by Chinese enterprises in their LNG trading , inevitably affecting those having entered into long-term purchase and sales contracts . This article looks at how Chinese enterprises can respond to changes in upstream supply sources , as well as their sanction and export control compliance obligations in the changed situation . <h> CHANGING SUPPLY SOURCE <p> The Office of Foreign Assets Control of the US Department of the Treasury placed Nord Stream 2 on the sanctions list on 23 February . On 8 April , the EU announced a fifth round of sanctions including restrictions on the export of heat exchange equipment to Russia , indirectly affecting the operation and production of the country 's LNG @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Interior and Administration announced it was placing Russian energy companies such as Novatek and Gazprom on its sanctions list . <p> More broadly , on 8 May , the G7 declared its members were committed to phasing out their reliance on Russian energy . Under such circumstances , Chinese enterprises that have entered into long-term LNG purchase and sales contracts under which supply sources include Russian LNG projects may face the risk of the seller changing the source of supply or , in worse cases , failure to supply LNG within short order . <p> Usually , the long-term LNG purchase and sales contracts executed between Chinese enterprises and upstream sellers specify the supply source , including one or more fields in the seller 's resource pool from gas projects around the world such as Australia 's Gorgon , Russia 's Arctic LNG 2 , Qatar 's Ras Laffan and Indonesia 's Tangguh . If sanctions explicitly restrict enterprises from the US or other regions from procuring Russian LNG , it is likely the seller will switch to supplying gas from a substitute source , without necessarily securing the buyer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the authors advise that after receiving notice from the seller of a change in gas source , a Chinese enterprise should first check whether the specification of the substitute source satisfies the requirements of the domestic LNG receiving terminal and downstream users . Second , Chinese enterprises should reasonably plan gas consumption in advance and maintain close contact with downstream users to respond to any potential supply shortage from the seller and avoid the risk of breach of contract in downstream trade . <p> For a contract still at the startup or negotiation stage , Chinese enterprises should closely watch the gas field resources included in the seller 's resource pool and expressly specify in the contract that if the seller changes the supply source for a reason not attributable to the Chinese enterprise , it is required to secure prior written consent . This will ensure , to the greatest extent possible , the compatibility between the domestic terminal and the delivered LNG . <h> SANCTIONS AND EXPORT CONTROL <p> In recent years , an increasing number of long-term LNG purchase and sales contracts specify the parties ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to give undertakings in respect of sanctions , anti-corruption and compliance . Such contractual provisions frequently require the Chinese enterprise , or both parties , to comply with sanction and export control laws , regulations and policies of the US , EU and other countries and regions . These provisions can prohibit the re-export or transfer by other means , directly or indirectly , of the natural gas acquired under the contract to any enterprise , country or region listed on any sanctions list or in any policy . <p> Generally , compliance undertakings involving sanctions and export control require the buyer to satisfy compliance requirements on an ongoing basis during the term of the contract . Accordingly , the Chinese enterprise will bear an obligation to closely follow compliance developments . If the Chinese enterprise commits a violation of the sanction or control requirements issued by any country , it will be deemed in breach of the obligations to which it committed . <p> The seller could then file a claim against the Chinese enterprise for such a breach , or even go as far as terminating its performance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incur financial losses , affect its reputation and trading position in the international LNG market , and indirectly affect the performance of the contracts between the Chinese enterprise and downstream users . <p> In view of this ongoing risk and given the flood of sanctions issued against Russia , the authors recommend that Chinese enterprises comprehensively review their existing contracts to determine whether the places of registration and main business of both the buyers and sellers involve a sanctioned region , supply source or distribution of main assets , specify the compliance control level of upstream and downstream partners , improve their sanctions compliance risk identification systems for sensitive countries and regions , and track international sanctions developments in real time . <p> For a contract still in the startup or negotiation stage , if the seller requests more stringent compliance obligations , the authors advise the Chinese enterprise to prudently control its own risks by considering the implementation of similar rights and interests and , where the entire supply chain system commercially permits , include a compensation mechanism passing on the compliance obligations back-to-back to the downstream buyers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clause in their downstream sales contracts , etc. , to avoid bearing excessive compliance obligations . <p> In general , due to the risks faced by Chinese enterprises in importing LNG during the current unstable international political situation , the authors recommend that professional advisers are engaged to study the sanctions policies and trading precedents , take into account professional legal and financial advice , and fully consider potential changes in the international situation and project requirements in order to arrive at more prudent , well-rounded business decisions .

@@92411238 <h> Confronting the growing drought risk <p> Drought may be an ancient scourge , but it is getting worse . No region or country today is immune to its effects . Southern Europe is in the grip of a severe drought -- the worst in 70 years for Italy . In the western United States , the past two decades have been the driest in 1,200 years . Chile is in its 13th consecutive year of drought , and Monterrey , Mexico 's third-largest city , is now being forced to ration water . <p> In the Horn of Africa , Ethiopia , Kenya , and Somalia are recording their fourth consecutive year without rains , and the situation has grown increasingly dire for people , livestock , and the ecosystems that support them . Owing to a lack of adequate nutrition , children are dying from diseases they would ordinarily survive . Even camels -- which typically survive longer than people or other animal species -- are dropping dead in large numbers across this region . <p> This suffering evokes traumatic memories of my own first encounter with drought in Mauritania . I was barely 12 years old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , livestock , and their livelihoods . Unable to provide for their families , many adults took their own lives . The experience has stayed with me , motivating my efforts to ensure that no more children have to live through what I did . Sadly , many still are being traumatized by drought , and many more soon will be : Scientists project that climate change will increase the frequency , duration , and geographic spread of droughts , with three out of four people affected by 2050 . <p> Areas across all regions are becoming drier , and while there is not yet a consensus on where exactly the most acute drought conditions will emerge , scientists agree that land degradation exacerbates the problem . Worse , the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 's sixth assessment report warns that we are not making sufficient progress to reduce greenhouses-gas emissions and avert even more severe conditions in the decades ahead . <p> Together , recent traumatic experiences and the latest scientific projections should convey a sense of urgency , compelling everyone to build resilience against future drought risks . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become a natural disaster . Land degradation can be mediated at least partly with better land- and water-use decisions and land-restoration initiatives . <p> In a recent report , the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations and the UN Convention to Combat Desertification ( UNCCD ) identify successful examples of systems that have reduced drought risk among vulnerable populations . In Brazil , Ethiopia , India , and Tunisia , a combination of water harvesting and sustainable land-management practices are being used to reduce the impact of droughts . While it may take time , all countries can adopt similar strategies to help move their people from water scarcity toward water security . <p> A major shortcoming of the current approach , however , is that it is based on national systems , even though droughts do not observe political boundaries . Proactive planning across sectors within countries is essential ; but without international collaboration , the effects of drought eventually will reach other countries . Common knock-on effects include conflicts over diminished water resources , soaring food prices or shortages , wildfires , mass wildlife and livestock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forced migration , and civil unrest . <p> Collaborative arrangements to anticipate and respond to droughts quickly can avert or reduce the scale of these outcomes . Australia and the US , for example , have long had policies and planning protocols in place to ensure that affected communities can endure droughts with dignity . <p> Building such resilience globally will take time and political will . Fortunately , even in the world 's most vulnerable regions , policymakers already have foundations that they can build on . For example , Africa 's Sahel has a regional drought-risk system , set up 50 years ago to bring together a broad range of stakeholders , from producer associations to political decision-makers , and benefits from the pooling of scientific and technological capabilities at the regional level . <p> India has adopted an even more comprehensive approach that includes drought management as part of its national disaster-management plan .

We still believe that equities are not yet priced for the deceleration in macro data , which will likely unfold over the coming 12 months . While the market correction has been quite pronounced so far , it is still less severe than it was during past major downturns .

In most cases , only the shallow recession in 1990 is in the same range , while other recessions have seen more pronounced sector pullbacks . <p> The sectors which stand out are tech-heavy sectors , such as tech , consumer discretionary and communication services , all of which have already seen more pronounced downturns than in two out of the last four recessions .

More interesting is the fact that the recession-sensitive sectors such as energy , financials and the cyclical segment of the market have pretty much yet to see adjustment to earnings expectations . It 's not unusual to see the market top out well ahead of the peak in earnings and bottom out well before the trough in earnings , but it would be unprecedented for the market to reach bottom before downgrades kick in .

" <p> Arman Bigazin , a partner at Haller Lomax in Nur-Sultan , Kazakhstan , points out that traditionally Chinese companies have been interested in subsoil use operations in Kazakhstan such as oil and gas exploration and production , and acquiring companies with subsoil use contracts . <p> Of late , however , " there has been some interest in banking services -- the Bank of China and Industrial and Commercial Bank of China have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ However , we think they mainly work with Chinese companies operating in Kazakhstan and facilitate export-import operations between the two countries . <p> " Recently we saw the relocation of Chinese crypto-mining business into Kazakhstan .

Uzbekistan has announced plans to bring the annual volume of Chinese investment to USD5 billion by 2025 . <p> In the past five years China has ranked as the biggest trading partner of Uzbekistan , with a share of 17% to 20% of the country 's total annual trade .

" China 's share of Uzbekistan 's exports is about 13% , which is mostly agricultural products , minerals and natural gas . <p> " The main investment activities of enterprises with Chinese capital are production of building materials ( including cement , glass and facing materials ) , oil and gas , chemicals , pharmaceuticals , textile industries , transport , construction and telecommunications . Chinese companies are investing in areas such as telecommunications and industry , as well as in agriculture , water management and logistics .

Chinese companies are often involved in projects financed by international financial institutions .

" <p> El Hage says that while Qatar laws allow foreign firms and individuals the possibility to directly invest in almost all economic sectors with 100% capital ownership with the pre-approval of the competent authority , Chinese companies do face challenges that are perhaps common to investors in Qatar , including : meeting the legal and regulatory requirements for incorporation and setting up ; keeping up and complying with changes in legislation ; obtaining licences to bring in labour and employees in accordance with the applicable labour and immigration laws ; and recent mandatory insurance coverage for all employees and residents . <p> He says there are also issues relating to contractual performance delays , payments , extensions of deadlines , variation orders , bank guarantees and environmental regulations . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cultural differences are another issue that many investors face .

" Establishing internal compliance and controls may be an important factor to mitigate risks . We have helped clients mostly within the litigation and arbitration context . Good understanding of the client 's business and knowledge of local practices allows us to properly articulate the client 's position .

When it comes to the solutions , to legalise the documents , we work with the Kazakhstan Embassy in China to ensure a faster and easier legalisation process . " <p> AEQUITAS ' Manayenko says the long consideration of approvals for transactions by state authorities is worthy of mention , but this issue is always resolved . " In case of difficulties in interaction with state bodies , the issue is often solved by complex structuring of transactions and the introduction of intermediate Kazakhstani companies into the structure , " he says . <p> Azizov says Uzbekistan , has its own unique set of challenges . " The first problem is the lack of a strong judiciary , which is often replaced by a significant role for administrative bodies , " he says . " The second problem is the lack of simple and accessible information about the procedures and rules for making investments , for example , a very complex system of benefits and preferences , and an even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lack of stability in the investment regime , complicated access to bank financing , an over-regulated market for basic commodities , and ongoing administrative procedures are other issues investors face . " But it should be noted that in the past three years , the state has managed to significantly simplify the procedures that have accumulated in the past 25 years , " he says . <p> " The main interest of Chinese companies entering the market under such projects lies in the legal support of their temporary presence in the country until the completion of the project . These are traditionally requests for permanent establishments , labour imports , licensing and regulatory advice . <p> " The number of such requests grew steadily before the pandemic , but in the past two years the dynamics of investment projects have somewhat decreased . We hope that the interest of Chinese companies in investment projects in Uzbekistan will be restored . " <p> Hoshimov , of Centil , says the Tajik government guarantees equal rights and protection of investment to local and foreign investors . " The major challenge for Chinese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business culture in particular , " he says . " Local regulations are quite similar to regulations throughout the Central Asian region . " <p> Ishmatov , of Tajikistan 's ABG , says most of the challenges faced by Chinese investors are due to their late appeals for legal support . " Chinese companies try to resolve any challenge appeared firstly by themselves , and they only contact legal firms when there is a dispute and/or problem , " he says . This may occur for reasons including a lack of knowledge on local laws , absence of an in-house lawyer in the company , and language challenges , and can lead to the imposition of penalties by state authorities , which might lead to misunderstandings . <p> " Our Chinese partners should consult with local law firms and get legal support during their whole operation , " he advises .

This article discusses key points that distinguish legal due diligence issues of gas M&amp;A projects from other industries . <h> GAS BUSINESS LICENCE <p> Article 15 of the Regulations on the Administration of Urban Gas stipulates that " the state implements a licensing system for gas operations " . In other words , enterprises engaged in gas business are required to obtain a gas business licence from the gas administration department of the local people 's government at or above county level . <p> When verifying such a licence , special attention should be given to the scope , region and validity period of the franchise stated in the licence . In addition , based on actual business activities , it should be judged whether there is any out-of-scope operation , out-of-term operation , operation before obtaining the gas business licence , or other such violations . Importantly , gas business activities are actually carried out by holding a hazardous chemical business licence , typically in the form of LNG ( liquefied natural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ due diligence , enterprises should therefore focus on whether the gas is sold as fuel or industrial raw materials , and whether the activities involve only sales conducted by way of bills , or also include self-processing , storage , transportation and terminal operation . Since the devastating Shiyan gas pipeline explosion in Hubei on 13 June 2021 , tragically resulting in 25 deaths and 138 injuries , gas administration departments nationwide have intensified inspection of illegal gas operations , especially single-point direct-supply stations . <p> Considering that single-point direct-supply stations remain justifiable for historical reasons and can meet certain market demands , attention should also be paid to changes in regulatory policies during due diligence . For example , both the municipal government of Tangshan and provincial government of Zhejiang issued notices on special rectification of single-point direct-supply stations in 2021 . <h> LOCAL FRANCHISE <p> Judging from article 2 of the Administrative Measures for the Franchise of Municipal Public Utilities and article 2 of the Administrative Measures for the Concession for Infrastructure and Public Utilities , franchising of gas supply is not mandated at state level . Therefore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is necessary to check relevant laws and regulations of the province , city and county where the target company is located , and business operation is located , to ascertain whether local franchising of gas supply is mandatory , and accordingly whether a franchise is required to carry out gas supply business in a particular area to verify legal compliance of a business operation . <h> PIPE NETWORK ASSETS <p> Due diligence on gas pipe network assets primarily concerns two issues -- ownership and use of special equipment . <p> In terms of ownership , it should be noted that although article 19 of the Regulations on the Administration of Urban Gas stipulates that a gas operator is responsible for the operation , maintenance , repair and renovation of gas facilities outside the proprietary construction area of owners within the building zone , article 274 of the Civil Code provides that " other public places , public facilities and property service rooms within the building zone shall be co-owned by building owners " . <p> By definition , this means that courtyard pipe network facilities , namely those within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ owned by building owners , and unless ownership of these assets is transferred to the gas operator by owners ' meeting or owners ' committee , the gas operator can not naturally own such assets . <p> As for pipe network facilities within the building zone for non-resident users , namely industrial and commercial users , it is necessary to first determine if there is agreement on ownership of such facilities in the contract signed with the gas operator . In the absence of such an agreement , as stipulated in the above-mentioned Civil Code article , ownership of such assets belongs to the non-resident users . However , if non-resident users contractually agree that ownership of such assets belongs to the gas operator , such an agreement is deemed as the owner 's disposal of them , and is legal and effective . <p> In terms of special equipment , according to the Special Equipment Safety Law , the state implements catalogue-based management on special equipment .

Therefore , during due diligence it is crucial to ascertain whether the target company has obtained this certificate of use registration . <h> QUALIFIED OPERATORS <p> In terms of personnel , due diligence requires establishing whether the company has qualified special equipment operators and production safety management personnel , as well as operation , maintenance and emergency repair personnel . <p> According to the Special Equipment Safety Law , operators of special equipment and relevant management personnel ( collectively , special equipment operators ) may engage in corresponding operation or management having only passed the examination of special equipment safety supervision and administration , in accordance with relevant state provisions , obtaining the national unified-format Certificate of Special Equipment Operator . It is necessary to check whether the company 's special equipment operators have this valid certificate . <p> According to the Regulations on the Administration of Urban Gas , persons in charge and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as operation , maintenance and emergency repair personnel , should receive professional training and pass examinations . <p> In addition to the qualification of special equipment operators , due diligence must also attest to qualification of production safety management personnel and operation , and maintenance and emergency repair personnel including , but not limited to : the qualification certificate of production safety management personnel ; the certificate of production and operation unit managers ; the training certificate of full-time safety officers ; the certificate of gas appliance installation workers ; the certificate of gas appliance installation and maintenance workers ; and the qualification of gas transmission workers . 
@@92721234 <h> Anti-monopoly regulations on resale price maintenance <p> Resale price maintenance is a type of vertical restraint regulated by the Anti-Monopoly Law , which is set for revision with clarified guidance this year for the first time since it came into force in 2008 . <h> CURRENT LEGISLATION <p> Based on article 14 of the current law and administrative enforcement and judicial practice , resale price maintenance mainly refers to conclusion and implementation of agreements between undertakings and downstream distributors to " fix the prices for selling commodities to third parties " and " restrict minimum prices for reselling commodities to third parties " . <p> However , it is not clear whether agreement falling within such prohibitions necessarily also has the effect of " excluding or restricting competition " , as determined unlawful in article 13(2) . Besides , it is not clarified whether " excluding or restricting competition " implies a subjective motive or an objective consequence , or both . <p> From observations of the authors of this article , such legislative ambiguity may lead to different law application and analysis approaches by courts and administrations , which in turn may lead to different penalties or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the automobile industry as an example , the authors searched penalty decisions by national and provincial anti-monopoly enforcement authorities since 2014 on resale price maintenance cases of seven automobile brands and one auto parts manufacturer ( Shanghai Hankook Tire Sales ) -- and found more or less the same logic in administrative penalty decisions for the eight cases . <p> In the Hankook Tire case , the former Shanghai Price Bureau first held that the agreement concluded and implemented between Hankook Tire and its distributor constituted monopolistic conduct of setting a minimum price for reselling commodities to a third party , as listed in article 14 , directly concluding that this led to exclusion and restriction of market competition -- but neither conducted specific analysis on the consequence itself or the causal relationship between the conduct and consequence , nor recognised the consequence as a constitutive element of the illegal act . <p> These decisions basically adopted the analytical method and principle of " Illegal per se " , which is also the main principle currently adopted by anti-monopoly enforcement authorities in determining illegal conduct of resale price maintenance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ price maintenance is different , as can be glimpsed from China 's first , highly contentious administrative litigation case of resale price maintenance in 2017 . Initially , the Hainan Provincial Price Bureau determined that Hainan Yutai Technology Feed violated the provision of article 14(1) of the Anti-Monopoly Law based on the principle of illegal per se , and subjected it to administrative penalty . The complex case proceeded to Haikou Intermediate People 's Court which , based on the principle of rule of reason , held that for determination of resale price maintenance , it was necessary to consider whether Hainan Yutai 's conduct had led to exclusion and restriction of competition -- and revoked the price bureau 's decision . <p> In the second instance , the Hainan High People 's Court next held that determination of a vertical monopoly agreement by an anti-monopoly enforcement authority did not require causing " excluding and restricting competition " as the constitutive element -- and thus revoked the first-instance judgment . <p> In the retrial , the Supreme People 's Court ( SPC ) finally corrected Hainan High People 's Court @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of exclusion or restriction of competition was not the same as " the effect of excluding or restricting competition " , let alone " causing actual loss " . The SPC also held that a resale price maintenance agreement was a typical vertical monopoly agreement , which often had a double-sided effect of both restricting and promoting competition . <p> At the current stage , if anti-monopoly enforcement authorities were required to conduct comprehensive investigation and complex economic analysis of vertical monopoly agreements , in practice it would greatly increase the cost and reduce efficiency of law enforcement , while still falling short of their current needs . <p> Upon confirming resale price maintenance in their investigation , law enforcement authorities may conclude on the monopolistic nature of agreements -- without the burden to prove the " the effect of excluding or restricting competition " . Undertakings may , however , overturn the presumption of " excluding or restricting competition " by presenting evidence . <p> The SPC pointed out that the criteria for judging a law enforcer 's determination of vertical restraint is different from determining vertical restraint in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , support for the plaintiff 's claim must be premised by certain losses suffered as a result of the undertaking 's monopolistic conduct ; a direct embodiment of its effect of excluding or restricting competition . <p> The ruling clarified for the first time the different criteria for determining resale price maintenance in administrative law enforcement and civil litigation , as well as its reasons and policy considerations , which is of great referential value before amendment of the Anti-Monopoly Law . <h> NEW AMENDMENT <p> The amendment draft of the Anti-Monopoly Law was officially promulgated on 23 October 2021 , with the addition of article 17(2) ( article 14 of the current law ) that " for agreements provided for in subparagraphs 1 and 2 of the preceding paragraph , if undertakings can prove that the agreements do not have the effect of excluding or restricting competition , they shall not be prohibited " .

@@92721235 <h> Main legal issues of equity family trusts <p> The domestic family trust business is diversifying as it matures amid surging demand , favourable regulatory policies and comprehensive upgrading of services . But insurance trusts , fund-based family trusts and other standardised family trusts can no longer meet the demands of high net worth clients with complex needs , making it imperative to customise family trusts that can accommodate various types of property . <p> For this reason , equity family trusts have begun to attract the attention of a growing number of high-net-worth clients as an important tool for preserving and inheriting family equity assets . <h> COMMON STRUCTURE <p> At present , mainstream equity family trusts adopt the structure of " fund trust + limited partnership special purpose vehicle ( SPV ) " . Specifically , the settlor delivers its funds to the trustee to set up a family trust , and the trustee , as a limited partner , sets up a limited partnership with the settlor , or person designated by the settlor , as the general partner . The limited partnership receives the equity of a company held directly or indirectly by the settlor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the company through the limited partnership . <p> Listed companies , companies planning to be listed , and limited liability companies without listing plans may all design the shareholding structure of an equity family trust . It is worth mentioning that the Shanghai Stock Exchange has for the first time clarified trust shareholding under control in the Review of the Issuance and Listing on Star Market ( Issue 1 in 2022 ) , providing clearer guidance for companies to be listed on the Star Market on how to plan a family trust shareholding structure in advance . <p> In addition to companies to be listed , the settlor of an equity family trust may be either the majority or minority shareholder of a company . In a limited liability company , the settlor -- whether majority or minority shareholder -- should reach agreement on the family trust shareholding arrangement with other company shareholders in advance . <p> If the company is listed and the settlor is its actual controller , attention should also be paid to such issues as whether the shares to be put into the family trust are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrangements and information disclosure , and should first fully communicate with the stock exchange on the proposed arrangements . <h> KEY ISSUES <p> Tax issues are the most prominent when establishing . In an example where the transferor of the equity is the settlor , the settlor 's transfer of the equity to the limited partnership SPV is a " private equity transfer " , which should conform to relevant provisions of current laws and regulations on individual income tax . The balance of equity transfer proceeds , after deducting the original equity value and reasonable expenses , should be the taxable income , with individual income tax payable based on " property transfer proceeds " . <p> At present , the transfer of equity held by the settlor to the family trust does not " justify the low transfer price " . Therefore , if there is a large difference between the original investment by the settlor for acquiring the equity and the existing value of the equity , the settlor may face a high tax burden . <p> To alleviate the tax burden in establishing the equity family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the equity held by the settlor to the limited partnership SPV , or the family trust acquiring part of the company equity by way of capital increase through the limited partnership SPV . <p> Boundary of trustee 's management responsibility in trust duration is a common concern for both settlor and trustee . Under the structure of " fund trust + limited partnership SPV " , the trustee generally only manages affairs corresponding to the limited partnership shares it holds at the trust level , while the general partner exercises the right to manage the equity . <p> Although the trustee does not participate in the operation and management of the limited partnership SPV and the company , in order to protect the interests of the family trust the settlor should guarantee the trustee 's full right of information on important matters , and not step over the boundaries agreed upon when the trust is established in important decision-making . As the fiduciary duty provided in the Trust Law is relatively principle-oriented , the trustee should clearly define the scope of fiduciary duty in the equity family trust project , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Disposal and distribution scheme of equity assets on trust termination should be fully designed during establishment . The stability of the trust and the trustee 's discretion to make decisions should both be taken into consideration in setting the termination events . If a major risk or negative public opinion event adversely affects the company , to protect its interests the family trust will withdraw from the company and the trustee will transfer the property share of the limited partnership SPV or the equity of the company it holds to the settlor , or person designated by the settlor . <p> In extreme cases , if the settlor can not co-operate in the transfer , the trustee may select to dispose of the equity assets by distributing the property share of the limited partnership SPV to the beneficiary after terminating the trust . <p> To avoid any obstacles to distribution in the future , the trustee should fully consider all possible situations of withdrawal and distribution when designing the trust settlement documents , and fully communicate with the settlor 's family .

In 2021 , the Information Technology ( Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code ) Rules , 2021 ( IT rules ) , were issued , introducing accountability for social media platforms and other internet intermediaries . It was soon evident that the IT rules were flawed , with social media platforms , journalists and others bringing constitutional challenges against them . The Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology recently proposed amendments to the IT Rules ( draft rules ) to address these deficiencies . <p> Two proposed changes , in particular , cause concern , first , content moderation by , and safe harbour guarantees for intermediaries , and second , grievance redress and government oversight . Under present law , intermediaries are neither required to review material submitted on their platforms nor do they have their own authority to detect and prohibit the hosting of infringing content . Their liability is limited to requiring users to agree to their posted terms and conditions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ position has developed under existing IT rules 3(1) ( a ) and ( b ) read with section 79(2) ( b ) of the Information Technology Act , 2000 ( IT act ) and the decisions of the Supreme Court in Shreya Singhal v Union of India and the Delhi High Court in Kent RO Systems Ltd v Amit Kotak &amp; Ors . <p> The draft rules propose new accountability demands on intermediaries by adding the phrases " and ensure compliance of the same " and " shall cause the user " in rule 3 ( 1 ) ( a ) and rule 3(1) ( b ) respectively , requiring intermediaries to monitor and screen all user-provided content before it is posted or uploaded . This puts intermediaries in a dilemma . Under section 79 of the IT act , safe harbour guarantees are available only if the intermediary does not in any way interfere with the posting of content and merely hosts the platform on which the content is uploaded .

Under the present IT rules , this period is a more realistic 15 days . The intention appears to be to prevent such content going viral but it is unreasonable and impractical for intermediaries to deal with such complaints in this timeframe given user traffic and the number of grievances likely to be made . A 72-hour window may result in intermediaries making rushed judgements , and perhaps removing content without proper examination merely on a complaint .

But behind this seeming governmental benevolence is an overenthusiastic regulatory state , as can be seen by the draft rules , that threatens to destroy constitutional protections of freedom of speech and expression .

@@94099235 <h> Regulators looking to rate ESG rating providers <p> Environmental social and governance ( ESG ) factors are increasingly important both globally and in India . ESG investments are now a separate investment class and private equity and venture capital investors often require ESG compliance by their portfolio companies . The law on ESG compliance in India is evolving ; the Ministry of Corporate Affairs has issued voluntary guidelines for ESG compliance while the Securities and Exchange Board of India ( SEBI ) has mandated ESG-related disclosure for the top 1,000 listed companies . <p> As most Indian companies are not subject to ESG requirements , investors often rely on third-party ESG rating providers ( ERP ) to determine ESG compliance by portfolio companies . ERPs assess performance on ESG parameters based on the portfolio companies ' initiatives , disclosures and reports , and by directly carrying out due diligence . ESG ratings are new to India , with the first ERP being established in January 2021 . As a result , ERPs are presently unregulated . <p> ERPs do not appear to use uniform assessment criteria and attach different weighting to environmental , social and governance indicators . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For example , Thomson Reuters expresses ratings variously as numerals , alphabets and percentiles , and risk assessment is based on a weighting of 34% for environmental indicators such as resource use , emissions and innovation , 35.5% for social indicators including workforce , human rights , community and product responsibility and 30.5% for governance indicators like management , shareholdings and corporate social responsibility strategies . CRISIL , on the other hand , rates companies on a scale of 0-100 with a weighting of 35% assigned to environmental indicators , 25% to social indicators and 40% to governance indicators . Ratings may also be influenced by the ERP 's perception of government data and sector-specific parameters . <p> While some ERPs score listed and unlisted companies differently , especially in regard to governance factors such as disclosures , board gender diversity and board independence , others fail to take into consideration the regulatory landscape in which the companies operate and apply a uniform standard . <p> In its final report on Environmental , Social and Governance Ratings and Data Products Providers , the International Organization of Securities Commissions recommended that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ERPs , thereby enhancing the reliability , comparability and interpretability of ESG ratings . Over the last year , SEBI has been taking steps towards mandating ESG compliance and , in January 2022 , issued a consultation paper proposing a regulatory framework for ERPs that rate listed companies . The consultation paper listed , among other matters , the lack of transparency in methodology and rating , potential conflicts of interests , and the lack of India-specific considerations as reasons for the proposed regulation of ERPs . <p> SEBI has proposed that ERPs be SEBI-accredited and that only credit rating agencies and research analysts be eligible for such accreditation . Further , SEBI has proposed criteria for the accreditation of ERPs including net worth , knowledge , sustainability , infrastructure , quality of staff and technical know-how . SEBI has proposed two categories of ratings , namely impact rating and risk rating , which will not assess environmental and social risks , while providing that ERPs may also offer other bespoke rating products . To mitigate potential conflicts of interest , SEBI has proposed disclosure requirements regarding the staffing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , SEBI has recommended that ERPs adopt a subscription payment model to ensure their independence . <p> The subject of ERP regulation has now been referred by SEBI to an advisory committee on ESG constituted in May 2022 . <p> The proposed regulatory framework for ERPs is a promising move to increase the reliability and transparency of ERPs . However , given the nascent stage of ESG compliance , SEBI has deliberately refrained from spelling out methodologies for producing ratings . It is unclear whether the regulations if implemented will do so . If not , it may be expected that the issues relating to the comparability of ratings and the risks of greenwashing by companies will persist .

In 2018 , the value of commercial disputes to which the act applied was reduced to INR300,000 . Section 12A was added to shorten the list of cases before commercial courts and to promote mediation as an alternative to adversarial litigation . This section mandates mediation prior to the filing of a suit unless the plaintiff is seeking urgent interim relief . However , as the language of section 12A was ambiguous , high courts took differing views on whether pre-institution mediation was mandatory . <p> The Supreme Court , in Patil Automation Private Limited and Ors. v Rakheja Engineers Private Limited , recently held that pre-institution mediation under section 12A of the act is mandatory .

Where a high court has already held pre-institution mediation to be mandatory , any case filed without first participating in mediation will be liable to be rejected , either on application or objection being taken by the defendant or by the court . <p> Considering the huge backlog of cases in the country and India 's endeavour to improve its position in the Ease of Doing Business index , the judgment is a step in the right direction .

The increased appointment of subject-matter experts as mediators , if requested by the parties , or where the nature of the case warrants it , will strengthen the mediation process . The appointment may be subject to the concerned individuals receiving appropriate training . <p> As the judgment observes that section 12A applies only where no urgent interim relief is sought , another consequence , though not one highlighted by the court , is that parties will indiscriminately file applications for urgent interim relief to avoid pre-institution mediation .

There is no guideline for how long should be spent teaching sex education in the framework . <p> " If there 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for sex ed , I think schools would have more incentive to do that and squeeze time for teaching sex ed , " said James Chan , senior policy , research and training officer at EOC . <p> In post-questionnaire focus group studies , many teachers reflected that " everything is competing for time , " Chan added , saying that the priority of sexuality education was comparatively low . <p> The watchdog also admitted it was an uphill battle to make education officials , schools and parents place more importance on this aspect of education . <p> Hong Kong students .

It also suggested authorities provide incentives for teachers to receive training or take development courses . Subsidies for schools to hire external parties , such as non-governmental organisations to provide such sexuality education would be important too , the watchdog said . <p> Schools meanwhile , should set up a designated post of sexuality education coordinator , to oversee matters related to the subject .

The daily bulletin of how many new cases is no longer meaningful when most of them can recover at home after a few days . <p> Beijing 's green light to let its zero-Covid policy vanish is creating room for Hong Kong to take bigger and bolder steps to open up . <p> It may be ironic but mainland cadres , once given the political green light , will move more quickly than SAR officials can imagine . <p> So , let 's stop pondering on the little bits of " reverse isolation " and focus on a full exit roadmap.
