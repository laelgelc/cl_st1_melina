Rescue workers recover a mock victim during an earthquake response exercise at the army headquarters in Fort Bonifacio on July 10 , 2008 . File photo by Joseph Agcaoili/AFP <p> MANILA , Philippines -- With a major Metro Manila earthquake due in the next 50 to 200 years , international earthquake experts say the best preparation is to ensure buildings in the megacity are structurally sound . <p> " By far the greatest thing we can do to prepare for earthquakes is to build buildings that will not collapse , " said Dr Gerry Gibson , president of the Asian Seismological Commission ( ASC ) on Tuesday , November 18 . <p> With the concrete jungle that is Metro Manila , monitoring compliance to the National Building Code and National Structural Code is no small task .

( MAP : Strongest earthquakes in the PH ) <p> Recent experiences with such earthquakes have led to boosted efforts to update and enforce their building codes . <p> This is because a majority of deaths from earthquakes are caused by the collapse of buildings and other infrastructure , if not by the tsunami that follows the quake . <p> Dr Domenico Giardini of the International Association of Physics of the Earth 's Interior ( IASPEI ) cited Turkey as one of the countries that has developed resilience against earthquakes . <p> In the last major earthquake to hit eastern Turkey , he said only 1% of buildings collapsed and casualties amounted to only 1% of the local population . <p> " This is extreme resilience . The same country 20 years ago would have probably had 10% casualties of local population .

If you decide not to fix it , the house would be sequestered . The city will then easily build it or fix it and then they will sell it .

They even have special teams that run tests on the quality of cement in each construction site for a new building , said Giardini . <p> It was also the standard of buildings in Japan that may have led to relatively small earthquake damage in 2011 . Most of the damage and casualties were due to the tsunami , said Gibson . <p> Is Metro Manila ready ? <p> In the event of a 7.2-magnitude earthquake in the West Valley Fault , also known as the Marikina Fault , around 10% to 13% of mid-rise and residential buildings are likely to be heavily damaged , said Renato Solidum , director of the Philippine Insitute of Volcanology and Seismology ( Phivolcs ) . <p> " That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ focus our attention .

With the full support of this Kapamilya TV network , the show gained a lot of viewers because of its educational value imparted in the form of enlightening and entertaining drama anthologies of cases decided by our Supreme Court .

The episodes are produced by a team of dedicated , hardworking and capable production staff of the network 's TV production head , director Lauren Dyogi , specifically business unit head Ruel S. Bayani , production manager Rizza Ebriega , executive producer Celeste Lumasac , head writer Arlene Tamayo , Associate producers Louver Asuncion and Minelle Espiritu and a pool of well trained and experienced script writers . The show is co-hosted by my son Jopet Sison and myself . <p> Ipaglaban Mo actually renders public service because it informs the Filipino people down to the grassroots level , of the various laws of the land applicable to their everyday lives as depicted in actual cases already decided by the Supreme Court , thus enabling them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ society .

Now do n't get me wrong , I have no illusion that defense is really seriously played during All-Star Games . But this year 's midseason contest ( I wo n't even dare call it by its usual nomenclature " classic " ) takes the cake in terms of utter disregard for defensive effort . <p> Look , this year 's All-Star Game set a plethora of records on offense simply because this year 's All-Stars set their minds to not playing defense . At the end of the first half alone , the West already broke the mark for most points in a half with 89 , beating the old record of 88 set by the West itself in 2012 . A measly four fouls , meanwhile , were called on both teams . No wonder a total of just seven free-throw attempts were made . <p> In the end , the game finished with not a single block being recorded , a total of 21 fouls being called , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ records were being broken : most combined points ( 318 , shattering the old mark of 303 set in 1987 ) , most points by one team ( 163 by the East , breaking the 155 the West scored in two overtimes in 2003 ) , most combined field goals made ( 135 , smashing the old standard of 128 in 2007 ) , most field goals made by one team ( 70 by the East , breaking the previous mark of 69 by the West in 2007 ) , most combined three-pointers made ( 30 , replacing the 26 set in 2012 and 2013 ) , most three-pointers made by one team ( 16 by the West , resetting the 14 made by the East in 2012 and by the West in 2013 ) , most combined three-point attempts ( 100 , breaking the 71 attempted in 2013 ) , most three-point attempts by one team ( 56 by the West , bumping off the 39 by the East in 2013 ) , most combined assists ( 88 , resetting the 85 in 1984 ) , most field goals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shattering the 17 by Wilt Chamberlain , Michael Jordan and Kevin Garnett ) , and most three-pointers made by one player ( eight by Carmelo Anthony , replacing the six by Mark Price and LeBron James ) . <p> The game itself went through an interesting enough storyline , with the West taking an 18-point , 123-105 lead in the third quarter before the East , perhaps with a little more motivation after having lost the last three editions of the contest , finished the period with an 18-3 burst to cut the deficit to just three . The East , led by Paul George 's five free throws and the last of Anthony 's record three-pointers , then closed the game out with a 10-0 blast to win going away and give the East a 38-26 overall lead in the series . Kyrie Irving , Cleveland 's peppery point guard , won MVP honors as he keyed the East 's strong second half with 24 of his 31 points while adding 14 assists and five rebounds . <p> It was not , however , nearly enough to make up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the years , as attested to be a survey made by ESPN , where 48 percent of more than 22,000 respondents said they watched none of the All-Star events and 30 percent did only parts of it .

Photo by Erik S. Lesser/EPA <p> The slam-dunk contest alone , which used to be the showcase event on the eve of the All-Star Game , confused even the players with the new format implemented to supposedly spice up what 's become a moribund event . Instead of the purely individual format that it 's supposed to have , organizers featured a team concept of East and West dunkers , with the East 's 6-foot-4 Wall eventually emerging as the champion after fans combined with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Dave Cowens , to give him the award after his East team beat the West . <p> But though this year 's contest marked the first time since 1988 that three All-Stars -- Paul George , Damian Lillard and Wall -- competed in the event , it 's obvious that the way the league 's supposed biggest names , LeBron James , Kobe Bryant and Dwyane Wade among them , have spurned the contest has a lot to do with its eventual decline and failure to generate excitement . Remember when Michael Jordan never minded risking embarrassment by almost annually entering the contest and competing against the likes of Dominique Wilkins ? There were no prima donnas at the time who were thinking they were too big for this All-Star Game sidelight . <p> Erving , for one , thinks James should reconsider his stance and enter the contest even once . At 29 , LeBron he says still has what it takes to win it , citing the fact that he himself competed in his last dunk contest when he was about to turn 34 . Question is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> In the end , the league should realize that it 's still the substance of the game that counts , and sells to fans , not the form which it has unfortunately gotten fixated with , as demonstrated by this year 's colorful socks and sneakers worn by the players in an effort to pay tribute to the host city 's Mardi Gras festival . No , not even some of the biggest musical names that are called upon to stage a concert in the middle of the All-Stars are gon na do it . Basketball is still the name of the game , and the sooner the NBA does something about the quality of its midseason contest and its side events , the better its showcase weekend will be . <p> Mount Rushmore fallout <p> LeBron James reportedly received a stinging rebuke from Bill Russell in this year 's All-Star Game when Russell thanked him for leaving him out of his mythical Mount Rushmore . James had earlier said in an interview aired this week that he would " for sure " end up among history 's top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but while working on that resume named the players he thought should be up there now before his time to bump off one of them comes -- Michael Jordan , Larry Bird , Magic Johnson and Oscar Robertson . <p> As I said in our previous column , it would be a tad awful not to put any of the greatest big men in history in there , and so we did insert Russell alongside Michael , Larry and Magic . He , after all , is generally regarded as the greatest winner in all sports history , winning 11 NBA championships in 13 years for the Boston Celtics by revolutionizing defensive play in his sport . And he used as platform his stature as an athlete to fight for equal rights for blacks at a time when racial prejudice reigned . <p> Russell , who turned 80 last February 12 and was serenaded with the " Happy Birthday " song by the All-Stars and the crowd , was reported to have met James before the annual midseason contest and gave him a piece of his mind about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , LeBron James was talking to Bill Russell and Bill said , ' Hey , thank you for leaving me off your Mount Rushmore .

I won back-to-back state championships in high school , back-to-back NCAA championships in college , I won an NBA championship my first year in the league , an NBA championship in my last year , and nine in between . That , Mr. James , is etched in stone . ' " <p> Sager did n't say how James reacted to Russ ' diatribe , but the 6-foot-8 forward later told Bleacher Report 's Ethan Skolnick : " Well , obviously , ( I have ) the utmost respect for Bill Russell , and what he 's been able to do . Not only just on the floor , but off the floor , too . Being a pioneer that helped me get to this point , he paved the way for myself and guys who came after him .

" <p> LeBron James relaxes on the floor while conducting a post-game interview after the 63rd NBA All-Star Game . Photo by Paul Buck/EPA <p> It 's obvious , though , that LeBron does n't fully get it . Russell was a pioneer , all right , but it 's not about being a pioneer ; it 's about his real worth as a player . Heck , George Mikan was a pioneer , too , and is a great player himself , but nobody discusses the great Minneapolis Lakers center among the very best of the greats . And when James says he hopes to continue to pave the way for guys who come after him , what is exactly his idea of paving the way , as Russell did ? It 's simply because , honestly , he has n't done anything to advance the welfare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , after considering running for president of the players ' union last year when Derek Fisher 's term expired , decided against it in the end , saying he was not sure he had the time for it and that the union was going backwards and was " not in a good place right now .

" I do n't think he 's had any dialogue with anybody since the ( 2013 ) All-Star break , but it is what it is . To make that statement about where we are as a union right now , he was misinformed . " <p> Obviously , James ' idea of paving the way for his fellow players is different from that of Russell 's . <p> James also turned defensive when he was asked about his declaration of himself among the top four ever when he 's through . " It 's a true statement , " he says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That 's what I believe in myself . Once again , these are my personal goals . I do n't care where no one puts me as far as best ever , or analysts , or so-called gurus of basketball place me when I 'm done . These are my personal goals . I believe I could be one of the best , if not the best , to ever play this game . And that 's my personal goal . If someone wants to throw dirt on my personal goals , then they have a problem , not me . " <p> Not to argue with LeBron , but the context of his earlier statement was certainly not about goals , but rather a definitive statement that he 's " for sure " going to be up there on the NBA 's mythical Mount Rushmore . " I 'm going to be one of the top four that 's ever played this game , for sure , " that 's what he actually declared .

" <p> Such audacity has , in truth , accounted for the perception that James , for all his greatness as a player , does not exactly merit a place among his sport 's true ambassadors , unlike other greats like Jordan , Bird , Magic , and , yes , Russ who have rightfully earned universal acclamation not only for their exploits on the court but also for their maturity , class and demeanor beyond .

But one gets the feeling that LeBron was again caught with his foot in his mouth in this particular case . <p> This is if one bases the argument on what he did upon joining the Heat . At the time , James paid tribute to Jordan by deciding not to wear the latter 's No. 23 -- which Heat president Pat Riley retired anyway in honor of MJ despite His Airness not having played a single minute with the franchise -- and instead opted to wear No. 6 . If he really wanted to lend substance to the tribute he paid Jordan , he should have also discarded the No. 6 that he now wears to pay a similar , well-deserved tribute to Russell , who by the way has handed to him the Finals MVP trophy bearing his name the past two years . <p> Is n't it presumptuous to pay homage to one legend and not do the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even greater because of his civil rights history -- in stature ? But this again shows James has bitten more than he could chew on occasions , as the faux pas simply demonstrated his limited knowledge of NBA history . <p> " There is a lot of irrational LeBron James hate around here , " John Karalis of Red 's Army says . " But he does n't do himself any favors either . Intentional slight ? Nah , probably not . It 's probably more lack of historical awareness . Still , these are the things LeBron does to fuel the hatred . A lot of what he does happens because he 's never had anyone tell him ' no ' once he became a basketball phenom .

It is this interconnection that created the cyber world , a community in virtual space that enables instant communication across all hitherto existing borders and hierarchies . <p> The Internet has placed at the disposal of anyone who has access to the Internet -- and that is practically everyone with a mobile device and an Internet connection -- all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ storage , retrieval , and dissemination of vast amounts of information .

The recipients of information have a passive role ; they could neither contradict nor quickly react to the information they receive through the mass media . <p> ADVERTISEMENT <p> Newspaper publishers and broadcast network owners wield the power to decide whether and when to accommodate rejoinders from readers and viewers . This is why existing laws and ethical codes hold the mass media accountable for any error in the news or any defamatory comment made in print or broadcast against persons . The power of mass communication is such that governments have not stopped enacting laws to ensure its responsible use . In addition , the profession of journalism has created its own code of ethics to guide its practitioners . <p> But all this is changing .

This , by any measure , is an enormous amount of power that is today potentially in the hands of every individual . Given its complexity , this system can not easily be controlled or regulated . The ease with which anonymity , for instance , can be maintained through layers of fictitious accounts has lent to this wonderful facility an unlimited potential for abuse . But the same freedom it allows has also empowered countless individuals to express themselves in the most exquisite ways possible , without fear of ridicule or ostracism . <p> As with any invention that has become part of the daily life of almost everyone on our planet , the gap between norms and practice tends to widen every day .

In contrast , the latter try to neutralize its deployment as a tool of oppression and exploitation by using technology to create greater transparency . Their hope is that the system will in time evolve its own regulatory mechanisms . I doubt if , short of dismantling it , any government can ever fully control access to the Internet . <p> Yet , remarkably , the Internet would have found very limited use by itself . What made it the revolutionary tool it is today were the phenomenal advances in digital technology , microprocessors and integrated circuits .

Instead we send e-mail , or cryptic text messages , and post photos of the food we eat . We try to stay in touch by " updating " our profiles and sending ready-made signals to people we meet in virtual space . We have no patience for carefully wrought ideas , preferring the easy form of thoughtless and impulsive commentary . We accumulate more friends , discover more relatives , and find more classmates than we can meaningfully interact with except through the off-the-rack greetings that we are urged to click . <p> Yet ironically , we bare more of ourselves in these encounters than prudence might counsel .

She was co-founder and executive director ( 2001-2005 ) of Womenlead Foundation Inc .

After all , not many young women or girls nowadays are warmed by the thought of feminism or feminists . I hear it every term from women 's studies majors who say they value equality but would rather not be labeled a feminist and so I am no longer surprised by the sentiment . It could be that the popular stereotypes ( the ones that always existed anyway ) are what most people think feminists are - bitter and disagreeable women who dominate all and lord over everyone ( especially men ) . Every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it a reboot and feminism becomes cool again for about fifteen minutes or at least after the number of downloads and re-tweets hit the target . <p> I remember when I first read the word . There was nothing special about the word itself . It did n't grab me and turn my insides out . It was just a part of the story I read : Marilyn French 's " The Women 's Room . " The story , however , did turn something in me . The book belonged to my mother and I knew she thought I was too young to read it so I did . That 's how she got me to read a lot of stuff . It was a strange experience , starting to see , becoming aware all of a sudden that to be female in the world was not just a role one assumed nor an identity , but rather a place and a body with parts that often got more attention than the whole . <p> In college I heard college boys use the word to describe me . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I also sensed fear and it was like they unintentionally gave me a clue : They were afraid of feminists . They considered them a threat . That 's good , I thought . I like that . I think I 'll be a feminist . That will get them off my back , or so I thought . By the time I was in law school of course it got worse ( or better , depending on how you look at it ) . Despite the overwhelming number of women in law school in the 1990s , law was ( and still is ) a male dominated institution . Pretty soon I found a medium for my feminism and became a legal researcher for a women 's NGO . Looking back I think that was pretty much the time I really started taking feminism seriously . It was n't just a label anymore or a persona to assume . It was then that I think I finally understood feminism as a political claim . <p> A funny thing happened on my way to feminist politics though . I got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even before Professor Halley suggested it might be a good idea .

The work brought me to far-flung places in parts of the Philippines I never imagined I would ever be able to visit . The oddest ( and most precious ) thing that I cherish about my tour of duty , as a lawyer for indigenous communities is that while I seriously doubt that I did anything socially transformative , I sure had a lot of fun doing my job . I met so many wonderful people and have tons of fabulous memories . It was a humbling experience for the most part and I learned to recognize aspects of my privilege as a lawyer ( not to mention an education steeped in the Western tradition ) . I always like to think that the lessons I learned there served me well in my later foray into feminist legal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ today ? I do n't get upset anymore when I hear young women say they do n't prefer the label because when I listen to them , most of them seem to like the idea of having feminists around anyway . One student told me that all her role models are feminists . She just is n't sure she can be called one at this point . Many of them ( male and female ) agree with most of feminism 's claims about equality and respect and I suspect that for most , the point of hesitation is identity politics . Owning the label does seem to bring with it a host of commitments and perhaps living up to a label ( or purporting it to be a coherent ideology ) should n't really be what feminism is about . To be sure the grip of identity politics does make feminism and being feminist seem more like a persona and a fashion statement and less like a broader social and political movement and commitment - not that the two do n't ever overlap .

It makes me curious what they think feminism is and I wonder whether they imagine me like those college boys probably did , wielding a battle-axe and frothing at the mouth . A doctor from Tibet who works with the UNDP once told me ( after I spoke about gender equality at a conference ) that he never would have suspected I was a feminist until I acknowledged it . He said that I did n't look like one . This made me laugh so much but instead of wanting to knock his teeth off ( which I suspect would have been my initial reaction as a younger feminist ) , I wanted to hear about what he thought feminists were so we talked about it .

The crucifixion is the most painful and shameful punishment a person can ever have and the Son of God was made to take and suffer . When one is crucified , it means death .

@@2429232 <p> Welcome to Rappler , a social news network where stories inspire community engagement and digitally fuelled actions for social change . Rappler comes from the root words " rap " ( to discuss ) + " ripple " ( to make waves ) . <p> Bianca Gonzalez needs no introduction . You may know her as a host , a model , an endorser , an advocate , a columnist , or all of the above . <p> Gonzalez , for her part , describes herself as a " storyteller " in her Twitter bio . She explained , " I love being the medium for which other people get to share what they 've learned or how they overcame certain things in their life . " ( READ : Bianca Gonzalez : Be the Twitter user you want to follow ) <p> " First on TV to share stories of people ranging from PBB housemates to the hero taxi driver who returned a maleta suitcase of cash , then on Meg Magazine to share stories of people that may help that struggling yuppie find who she is , and then on the Philippine Star to share 10 things about all these inspiring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such fields , it 's clear that she has the " soft skills " that people often say are essential to success . These skills include good communication , leadership , and diligence . <p> And so while Gonzalez works in show business and media , what she had to say is directly applicable to other fields , including entrepreneurship . In fact , in the realm of business , a person 's soft skills are often as important as their technical ones . <p> I collated her advice into a number of key points : <p> 1 . Set goals , but be open to new paths . <p> As businesspeople , we may get frustrated when we do n't meet our initial goals . In our frustration , we may inadvertently close ourselves off to other opportunities . <p> That 's why it 's important to keep our eyes open to new opportunities , even if they are not what we originally envisioned . There is no better illustration of this need than Gonzalez 's own career . <p> Gonzalez said , " I took up Communications to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way a door opened , and I ended up working on cam . All I wanted was to keep a personal blog , but somewhere along the way , a door opened and I got the great honor and opportunity to have my own column in Philippine Star . " <p> " There are specific TV shows I 've dreamt of hosting but never got , but instead I was surprised to have been included shows that were even better for me . I wrote about it in my blog before , and titled it ' The Accidental Everything . ' " <p> She went on , " Most of what I have ' achieved ' were not my own plan nor dream . I had other dreams that did not work out , but like I mentioned , along the way , other doors were opened , I took the risks , and they eventually paid off . " <p> She concluded , " So I guess what I would say it that it is great to set goals , it is wonderful to have a dream that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blessing to even know from the start what it is you want . But also be open to the humps and bumps along the way that may lead you to another path . I love that saying about life being 10% what happens to you and 90% how you react . That is so true in my case . " <p> 2 . Seek diversity in your network . <p> As businesspeople , we may try to surround ourselves with only other businessmen and entrepreneurs . This approach denies us the company of people who may not be business-minded , but have insights to share . <p> Gonzalez has taken the opposite approach : She is open to meeting anyone and everyone . When asked how she mindfully chooses whom to network with , she had this to say : " To be perfectly honest , I do n't ' choose ' who to befriend or network with . May sound false to some , but I really do n't . Another thing I thank my upbringing for . I truly am very accepting of all types of personalities . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ create conflict and therefore result in resolution and progression . " <p> Gonzalez continued , " What I mean to say is , whether ' good ' or ' bad , ' there is something to learn from everyone . I believe that we are the sum total of every single person we meet . If we meet someone awesome that we get along with , they become our friend and confidante . If we meet someone so annoyingly self-absorbed , we realize even more how much we do not want to be that way . If someone wrongs us , we learn from it . " <p> She added , " So yeah , I really ca n't say that I mindfully choose , it just happens organically that my collaborations happen with like-minded individuals , and no collaborations happen with those I do n't share the same vision with . " <p> 3 . Motivate yourself by knowing where your passions truly lie . <p> In our pursuit of entrepreneurial success , it may be easy to simply choose any venture to launch . The world , after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> When asked what seems to provide her with limitless energy for all her endeavors , Gonzalez 's response serves as reminder that we should think as much about what truly inspires us as much as we usually tend to do with what will make money . <p> She replied , " I 'm not really sure , and though I truly believe in the clich ? that ' when you love what you do , it does n't feel like work at all , ' I really have to credit my family for my upbringing . " <p> She continued , " As far back as I can remember , my parents constantly enrolled us in gymnastics class or swimming class or art class or any class , that instilled in us this thirst to want to do more and to pursue a wide range of interests . Both my brother JC and sister Aissa found what they love to do early on in life ( and I mean college ) and that influenced me to find and focus on what I am really passionate about as well . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> In our eagerness to achieve our professional or entrepreneurial goals , we may over-work ourselves . We may neglect our need for downtime and our personal relationships . <p> This approach is shortsighted , given that happy people are almost always more motivated and productive . <p> Large corporations like Google , which stops at nothing to make their employee 's lives easier , have known this for years . <p> Gonzalez emphasized similar sentiments . She said , " Another great way to stay motivated is to keep a work-life balance . Yes , much easier said than done but when you are happy at home ( or with friends ) and happy at work , it keeps you motivated and inspired and driven , instead of making you feel exhausted or frustrated . " <p> Gonzalez believes that professionals and business people should be highly accessible on social media . Photo courtesy of Roy Macam . <p> 5 . Be accessible on social media . <p> Within a few minutes of Tweeting Gonzalez to request this interview , she got in contact with my editor at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Given the impressive speed with which she responded , I asked her how important it was to one 's professional success to be this accessible on social media . <p> Gonzalez said , " Extremely important . I can not even stress how important . It all happened so fast . In the span of 5 years , everything exploded . It is such a new form of media that I ca n't even grasp my head around yet , but we all know that everything is moving to the digital / online / social world . " <p> She continued , " A lot of people are hesitant to put themselves out there like that , to be so public , to be put in a position of vulnerability , to have one ( or 2 or 3 ) extra accounts to maintain everyday , but really , just be on it . It is odd to have a sort of ' double presence ' in the world now , you real life self and your online self , but that is today 's reality . " <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but at least be on it , " Gonzalez concluded . " Some people are on Twitter and tweet every hour . Some have an account but just ' lurk ' and read other 's posts . Some people love retweeting and favorite-ing posts . We all use it differently and there is no pressure to be on it and active . <p> There is pressure to be on it however , because like you shared , everything now is instant , and those not on it can definitely get left behind . " <p> 6 . Stay true to who you are as a means of personal branding . <p> As business people , we are increasingly asked to be the face of our company , our organization , or our non-profit . Many entrepreneurs and businesspeople are thus concerned about their personal brand . <p> Gonzalez had this to say in regard to personal branding : " I am so lucky to have a manager who believes in me and believed in me from the very start . When I said all I wanted to do was ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were coerced to ' sing , dance , act , too , ' Tito Boy Abunda supported me in my decision . You may have heard him say , ' stay true to your core ' - that is the best advice I can give anyone , whether as life advice or career advice . " <p> She continued , " I ca n't say I know much about personal branding because I never really ' worked on ' branding myself , but I know that if you do stay true to your core , whoever you are will show and shine through . You ca n't pretend to be someone you are not and succeed ( at least for the long run ) . Who you are - play up your strong points and downplay or even laugh at your weak points - is who you are . <p> " Not to say that you wo n't try new things because you ' are true to your core . ' You can try new things , while staying true to your core . I 'd say if manang ka @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is ; or if geek ka , wag mong baguhin sarili mo , be a geek that stands out If you 're conservative , do n't be ashamed , be the best person that you can be ; or if you are a geek , do n't change who you are , be the geek that stands out . <p> The ' personal brand ' will follow , I think that is something you ca n't proclaim for yourself , I think other people will just see it naturally in you . " <p> 7 . Be the person that other people want to be around . <p> In our eagerness to make our companies successful , we may neglect the fact that most business -- especially in the Philippines -- is relational . That is , it 's built on relationships . <p> Gonzalez emphasized the need to not only be cordial in the professional world , but to distinguish yourself in how you treat and enliven those around you . <p> She said , " I think something working people tend to overlook in general is how to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but also focus on being good to your workmates . It is easy to be good at your job - you put in the work , you do n't do short cuts , you put in the hours , you give your best . " <p> She added , " But to be a good workmate , as in to be someone your workmates love hanging out with , to be the one everyone would love to work with again , to be the one that makes your workmates laugh or smile , to be that magaan na katrabaho easy to work with that in turn make people feel more magaan comfortable that is priceless.

Superstition even has it that wishes would be granted upon completion of a Visita Iglesia . <p> Stations of the Cross may also be held during church visits .

Among them is of early Christian communities of the Roman Empire commemorating the suffering and death of Jesus in 7 parts . <p> When Christianity became the official religion of the Roman Empire under Emperor Theodosius I , the practice evolved to its current form of visiting 7 churches . <p> There were 7 major basilicas founded in Rome which were believed to hold the tombs of prominent martyrs like St. Peter and St. Paul . A pilgrimage to all 7 basilicas then developed among the faithful . <p> OLD ST . PETER 'S BASILICA was one of the basilicas visited by pilgrims in Rome . Picture from Wikimedia Commons <p> The practice then spread to other parts and cities of the Roman Empire , and became associated with the Holy Week when they were made to honor the Blessed Sacrament . <p> Following the fall of the Roman Empire , the practice slackened somewhat until during the first Jubilee of the Catholic Church , when the church visitations were revived by Pope Boniface VIII . <p> Spread to the Philippines <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ islands via Spanish colonists , particularly through Augustinian missionaries in the 1560s . <p> Doing the Visita Iglesia was initially difficult during the early Spanish Period .

For example , in some poor and remote rural communities in the country , one way to hold Visita Iglesia without going to the city is by entering , praying , and re-entering the local church at least 7 times . <p> THE MANILA CATHEDRAL is one of the destinations of Manila-based Visita Iglesias .

@@2452231 <p> MELBOURNE , Australia ( MindaNews / 23 April ) -- The current administration of the Autonomous Region for Muslim Mindanao ( ARMM ) has given its full support behind the Framework Agreement on the Bangsamoro ( FAB ) and its Annexes as well as for the speedy enactment of the Bangsamoro Basic Law . This is certainly unexpected given that the immediate effect of the creation of the Bangsamoro government is the demise of the ARMM . Indeed , protestations and arguments against the establishment of this " new " regional government from ARMM officials would have caused no surprise at all had this been the case . But clearly , those holding government positions in the region do not see this regime change as a cause for panic and alarm . <p> One possible explanation for this openness and even eagerness being displayed would be the perception of the current ARMM governor , Mujiv Hataman , as a favorite in assuming the leadership position in the new regional government . Of course , the political clout of the Moro Islamic Liberation Front ( MILF ) to contest for the top job can not be discounted . Nonetheless , I reckon there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ARMM because there is a distinct possibility that the public will see their faces again in the projected Bangsamoro government . <p> Curiously , even local executives in the ARMM have openly expressed their complete support for the FAB and its Annexes even though there is a patent lack of clarity as to their place in the proposed governance structure of the Bangsamoro government . Both the FAB and the Annex on Power Sharing provide that -- <p> " The privileges already enjoyed by the local government units under existing laws shall not be diminished unless otherwise altered , modified or reformed for good governance pursuant to the provisions of the Bangsamoro local government code . " <p> This provision basically repeats the uncertainty of the status of local government units ( LGUs ) within the autonomous region presently found in Section 3 of Article III of Republic Act No. 6734 or the Organic Act of the ARMM which also lack decisiveness as to its purported mandate , to wit -- <p> " Section 3 . The Regional Government shall adopt a policy on local autonomy whereby regional powers shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , That until a regional law implementing this provision is enacted , the local Government Code shall be applicable . " <p> Ostensibly , both the ARMM law and the FAB provide that the powers and functions exercised by local governments within the designated region shall be respected and retained. 1 This means that the creation of the regional government does not abrogate the local autonomy enjoyed by the territorial and political subdivisions within Muslim Mindanao. 2 Interestingly , the ARMM enacted a local government code for the region that was fundamentally a facsimile of the Local Government Code of 1991 ( LGC ) . 3 Local autonomy within this designated region thus becomes complex because of the presence of two similar autonomy legislations . On the administrative level , the overlapping functions have compromised accountability and effectiveness in the delivery of basic services. 4 On the policy level , duplication of particular powers has led to more confusion than cooperation . Pertinently , LGUs inside the autonomous region have lagged behind in terms of socio-economic development because those outside the region ( not all of course ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LGUs in the LGC. 5 <p> This disparity with the application of local autonomy is just one of the political deficiencies sought to be addressed by the FAB . There is no doubt that the scale of autonomy implemented by the FAB and its Annexes is unprecedented . I actually see this revolutionary mode as a clear challenge to the way decentralization is understood under the LGC . In fact , I would even venture to say that other regions in the country could also demand to have the comprehensive and far-reaching autonomy mandated in the FAB and its Annexes . The most imminent group who could ask for decentralization with this depth and scope would be the Igorots of the Cordillera region . It would not even be farfetched if the Ilokanos further north would organize themselves ( joining Norte and Sur together ) and claim that they too deserve such kind of regional autonomy . Metro Manila , barring the political squabbles within , could also be a likely candidate for this new mode of decentralization . <p> But while it is true that the expanded decentralization in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ socio-economic progress , there is a lesson to be considered from the country 's experience under the LGC and the ARMM . The Transition Commission ( TC ) , which is now tasked with urgency to draft the Bangsamoro Basic Law , must indeed give notice to the paradoxical impact of both these pieces of legislation in light of its avowed purpose of implementing local autonomy . <p> Indeed , more than twenty years on and concerns about decentralization under the LGC continue to be relevant . The evaluation of the current administration of the implementation of this law has highlighted a disappointing feature of decentralization in the Philippines , to wit : <p> " Despite almost two decades of implementation of the 1991 Local Government Code ( LGC ) , however , local governments still face various challenges in the exercise of their devolved service delivery functions .... A majority of the local governments still lack the ability or the will to raise adequate local revenues . LGUs have become unduly dependent on Internal Revenue Allotment ( IRA ) transfers from the national government and have failed to manage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the LGC , as well as the lack of capacities of local governments in assuming devolved functions , national government agencies ( NGAs ) continue to deliver certain services despite the transfer of these services to the local governments . The confused and overlapping performance of functions compromises the lines of accountability for local services . " 6 <p> The IRA mentioned above is in the nature of a " bloc grant " and absolutely no condition is attached for its remittance to the local governments . Furthermore , the IRA must be released automatically every fiscal year . More importantly , the disposition of this fund is totally within the discretion of the local government unit and in theory , utterly free from any kind of influence from the central government . But sadly , the IRA system has actually bred a " dole-out mentality " among the local executives. 7 In fact , a majority of the local governments in the country have become highly dependent on the IRA as their primary source of revenue. 8 Thus , despite their fiscal autonomy under the LGC , local @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government. 9 <p> The story of the ARMM does not paint a better picture of decentralization either . In spite of the significant power and funding extended to this regional government , all of the five provinces in the ARMM are still among the poorest in the Philippines according to the Mindanao Strategic Development Framework 2010-2020. 10 Of course , this can be partly explained by the fact that successive administrations of the ARMM regional government have been less than forthright in their accounting of their funds. 11 <p> Notably , according to the esteemed scholar , Patricio N. Abinales , the " MNLF leaders who took over the regional body fell victim to the virus of weak bureaucracies , and would themselves be brought to its dark side . " 12 Apparently , Nur Misuari and his cohorts , while respected revolutionaries , were clearly not prepared for the business of governance. 13 And therefore , the leaders of the region became ( more ) susceptible to corruption and have become practically useless in addressing the problems of Filipino Muslims . President Benigno Aquino III in his Third State @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best articulates the sorry state of the ARMM . The pertinent portion thereof is quoted verbatim as follows : <p> While we are on the subject of peace , let us talk about a place that has long stood as a symbol of frustrated hopes . Before our reforms in the ARMM began , what we had were ghost students walking to ghost schools on ghost roads , to learn from ghost teachers . Some of the apparitions that haunted OIC Governor Mujiv Hataman : Four schools found with ghost students ; we are also investigating the teachers whose names do not appear in the list of the Professional Regulation Commission , as well as the government workers not listed in the plantilla . Fifty-five ghost entries have been taken off the payroll . The previous scheme of regraveling roads again and again just to earn money has been outlawed . To avoid abuse , we have ended cash advances for agencies . Now , the souls of the ghosts in voters lists can rest in peace . This is why , to OIC Governor Mujiv Hataman , we can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buster. 14 <p> Interestingly , decentralization , both under the LGC and the ARMM , was instituted with a single legislative stroke . The decentralization process commenced in full at precisely the moment the LGC and RA 6734 respectively became law , thus entrenching both administrative and fiscal autonomy in the local government apparatus simultaneously . There was neither a trial phase nor a break-in period for the local leadership . And as discussed above , the lack of preparation among the local leaders upon assumption of such powers has led to undesirable results . For the LGC , the continued dependence of local executives on the central authority , whereas for the ARMM , well , the words of the President cited above speaks for itself . <p> Indeed , the way decentralization was implemented in both the LGC and in the ARMM is a peculiar fact which I believe must be taken into consideration by the drafters of the Bangsamoro Basic Law . In this regard , a theory propounded by a noted scholar on decentralization that runs contrary to the Philippine experience warrants further examination . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decentralization comes before fiscal decentralization , there is a chance that local governments will not be able to fully and properly exercise the additional powers transferred to them through decentralization . The reason for this is that the local government will be predictably overwhelmed by the burden of delivering public services of which it is not accustomed to . <p> The other side of the theory posits that if fiscal decentralization comes first , the " capacities of subnational politicians and public officials " will be enhanced and thus making them more ready for the next phase which is administrative decentralization . This sequence will in the long run give a better chance for the decentralization process to be successful . <p> The situation of decentralization in the Philippines falls to some extent in the first category . Local leaders in the country did not have the chance to learn the ins and outs of decentralization during a trial or training period . They were immediately thrust into a position of power and responsibility without absolutely any preparation . It is worthy to note that at the time of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ removed from a 20-year dictatorship . Many Filipino leaders at this time , both local and national , were still recovering from years of subservience and dependence on an extremely powerful central authority . At that moment , there truly was a prevailing " culture of dependence " in the state 's political consciousness . <p> The abject failure in the execution of administrative decentralization under the Philippine set up can not be denied . With regard to the ARMM , the local leaders in Muslim Mindanao were clearly not ready to govern the region . The effects of this inability are quite apparent in the current state of the region . In the case of the LGC , this breakdown is best evidenced by the fact that the health system has yet to be put fully under the authority of the LGUs . The reality is , subject to a few exceptions , a significant number of LGUs are still unable to fund and administer its own health system . And therefore , despite the very clear command of the LGC that this public service should be devolved to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the national government . <p> Accordingly , decentralization under the Bangsamoro Basic Law need not follow the same route of the LGC and the ARMM . The grant of administrative and fiscal autonomy does not have to be at one single moment but could be implemented in a sequential manner . The law could direct that the roll-out of fiscal autonomy should come first before administrative autonomy . During the first five years from the establishment of the Bangsamoro regional government , the focus could be on building up the capability of the Bangsamoro government in revenue collection . Giving precedence to strengthening fiscal autonomy is certainly advisable considering the extent of the revenue-raising power afforded to the new regional government under the Annex on Revenue Generation and Wealth Sharing . <p> Corollary to the deliberate and complete attention given to fiscal decentralization , the new regional government can also concentrate on the normalization process during this initial period . Putting this on top of the agenda can facilitate a smoother transition from the ARMM to the new Bangsamoro regional entity . The Annex on Normalization hit it right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ normalization process because only through this undertaking will communities in the region " achieve their desired quality of life , which includes the pursuit of sustainable livelihood and political participation within a peaceful deliberative society . " <p> The consequence of putting fiscal autonomy first before administrative autonomy , at least during the first five years of the new regional government , is that the exclusive powers enumerated under the Annex on Power Sharing will be withheld during this period and responsibility for such functions will be retained by the national government . The list of exclusive powers is extensive and suspending the transfer of the same may elicit protests . Additionally however , the law can designate this period as a transition phase in which the national government shall gradually turn over the pertinent functions to the Bangsamoro government . Again , such a scheme can only improve the transformation of governance in the region from the ARMM as we know it now to the new and improved Bangsamoro regime . <p> Upon the termination of this five-year period , the Bangsamoro government can then assume full authority over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . By this time , it is reasonable to expect that the regional bureaucracy is fully capable of implementing fiscal autonomy . Moreover , the situation in the region would have considerably normalized . Therefore , Filipino Muslims in the region can look forward to the mandates under the FAB to be properly carried out by their elected leaders . In this scenario , there is a good chance the community would not be suffering another ARMM regime even if the faces they see in the new Bangsamoro government are old ones . <p> Needless to say , the enactment of the Bangsamoro Basic Law will still be traversing a long and winding road . Although this article covers a crucial element of the proposed law as if the passage of the latter is forthcoming , there can be no denying the imminent Constitutional obstacles this piece of legislation must overcome . Ominously , one of the tasks of the TC is to " work on proposals to amend the Philippine Constitution for the purpose of accommodating and entrenching in the constitution the agreements of the Parties . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not bode well for the swift and smooth passage of the Bangsamoro Basic Law given that both leaders of the Senate and the House of Representatives have cautioned that they will not stand for provisions in the law that are contrary to the Constitution . Right now there are provisions in the FAB and its Annexes that could invite scrutiny from our Constitutional law experts . If neither party relents when these constitutional issues are brought to the fore , a head-on collision between the President and the TC on one side and Congress on the other seems likely to happen down the track . <p> I conclude this short article with these two points . First , in drafting the Bangsamoro Basic Law , it behooves the TC , and Congress as well , to avoid the mistakes of the past . Taking the cue from the disastrous experience of the ARMM , having an incremental implementation of decentralization in the region can be beneficial to the projected Bangsamoro government itself . Making the turnover of fiscal and administrative powers gradual can give ample time to the regional leaders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ governing with such expanded powers . It would not be a case of " learn-as-you-go " like the ARMM . The sequential application of decentralization can ensure the proper assimilation of the powers provided in FAB and its Annexes among the leaders who will be elected to govern the region . In turn assuring the complete delivery of all the public goods mandated therein to the benefit of the Filipino Muslim community . <p> Second , the FAB and its Annexes have initiated a change in the way local autonomy is to be understood . It has introduced a mode of decentralization that is structured differently from the system established by the LGC . Although further study on this discrepancy is called for , my initial evaluation on this new autonomous infrastructure is that it is a more potent tool for socio-economic development . I am not exactly sure what will happen to this revolutionary governance arrangement for its realization is still a long way ahead . But the possibility of this new level of autonomy being applied in other regions in the country is definitely worth exploring . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lawyer .

But I have not taken one since this morning , " she said . <p> Karapatan -- Southern Tagalog called for the immediate release of Torres . <p> " We do not want another woman to suffer the fate of Andrea Rosal whose newborn died because the government persecuted her . Like Andrea , there is no reason for Torres ' continued detention especially since the charges against her are baseless .

I , and the rest of the political prisoners here , would look after her .

" <p> In a statement , Marie Hilao-Enriquez , chairperson of Karapatan , said joint elements from the Criminal Investigation and Detection Group and the Southern Luzon Command in Barangay Ilayang Iyam in Lucena , Quezon arrested Torres without a warrant . <p> " The government is such a power tripper that it would rather persecute and attack people who it suspects of working against it even those who are in most vulnerable conditions such as Andrea Rosal and Maria Miradel Torres rather than address the root causes of dissent among the people , " Hilao-Enriquez said . <p> " The BS Aquino government is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to arrest another bleeding pregnant woman , " Hilao-Enriquez said , adding that the inhumane treatment that Torres experienced violates her human rights as well as national and international laws and instruments regarding the treatment of prisoners . <p> These laws include : the Philippine Constitution , the Anti-Torture Law ; and international instruments such as the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights , the Convention against Torture and other Cruel , Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment , The Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners , and the Rules for the Treatment of Women Prisoners and Non-Custodial Measures for Women Offenders . <p> Rev. Sediarin said , " The unabated attacks on political activists send a chilling message that those who genuinely serve the people are the ones most vulnerable to political persecution and state fascism . The continuing arrest and filing of trumped-up charges against activists only validate Aquino 's tolerance for human rights abuses in the country . "

This is not to cast aspersion to Department of the Interior and Local Government ( DILG ) Secretary Mar Roxas II who earned this fond moniker when he was still a senator . <p> Roxas delivered in June , 2009 a privilege speech on the floor of the Senate during the 14th Congress to denounce purported attempts of the previous Malaca ? ang occupant to ram through Charter change via Constituent Assembly ( Con-Ass ) . He came to the session hall wearing a necklace made of garlic , a spice locally called " bawang , " over his neatly pressed barong Tagalog . <p> Our local folklore associate garlic with its pungent odor that could ward off " aswang , " a creature who preys on the living .

But as fate would have it the late President Corazon Aquino passed away on August 1 and it changed the course of Mar 's destiny . Roxas had to give way to his LP partymate , then Sen.

Cynthia Villar blamed the manipulation by unscrupulous traders for the soaring garlic prices . " There is really manipulation because the cost of garlic at production cost is P40 per kilo while imported garlic is pegged at P17 per kilo with duty .

With original stories like Transcendence bombing at the box-office , film execs are often forced to revive existing properties to ensure ticket sales . Unfortunately , the prequel and reboot route does n't always lead to quality entertainment . <p> Thankfully , the newly resuscitated Planet of the Apes franchise is a master class on how prequels can be done right . But even with the franchise 's restored credibility , the series ' continued success is hinged on its ability to build on the goodwill earned by its predecessor .

For Caesar and his clan , however , it 's a matter of retaining theirs .

Christianity in the Global South is also characterized by the aspirations of many of its followers for upward mobility , which explains their discipline and resistance to a wasteful lifestyle .

Present in over a hundred countries , it is now among the fastest growing Christian churches in the world . While it has its national headquarters in Quezon City , INC has already established main offices in London for its European outreach and in California for the US . <p> But something is significantly different with these projects .

Senator Antonio Trillanes IV calls for a Senate investigation into the alleged overpricing of Makati buildings and other " anomalies " of the Binays . <p> MANILA , Philippines -- " Shocking , outrageous , and unconscionable . " <p> Senator Antonio Trillanes IV filed a strongly worded resolution calling for a Senate investigation into the alleged overpricing of a Makati " parking building , " an older city hall building , and " related anomalies " under the leadership of Vice President Jejomar Binay of the country 's financial center . ( See resolution below . ) <p> The senator from the Nacionalista Party ( NP ) filed the resolution on Monday , August 11 , in a move the Binays immediately branded as a ploy to boost his chances for higher office in the 2016 elections . <p> Trillanes drew attention to the plunder complaint filed against father and son Binay , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high-end commercial and residential skyscrapers in Makati . " The former Navy officer said another old city hall building built in 1990 cost more than soldiers and policemen 's housing project . <p> The Vice President was mayor of Makati from 1986 to 2010 , except for 3 years when his wife took over while he observed the term limit . His only son , Jejomar Erwin " Junjun " Binay Jr , succeeded him in 2010 . The construction of the building began in 2007 and was completed in 2013 . <p> The senator wants the Senate blue ribbon committee to look into various allegations , including the Binays ' supposed violation of procurement laws : <p> the alleged P1.601 billion overpricing of the " 11-storey New Makati City Hall II Parking Building " <p> the reported overpricing of " the 22-storey Makati City Hall Building at the average cost of P240,000 per square meter " <p> " Related anomalies " allegedly committed by former and current officials of the City of Makati <p> Trillanes said the inquiry would be " in aid of legislation to recommend amendments to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the proper use of public funds . " <p> The resolution comes after the filing of a plunder complaint before the Ombudsman against Binay and his son . <p> " The New Makati City Hall II Building , located along F. Zobel Street in Barangay Poblacion , Makati City , is a ' parking building ' and is officially designated by its contractor , Hilmarc 's Construction Corporation , as such ( i.e. , Makati City Hall Parking Building ) because the majority of its floors are intended for parking purposes . It is described as a 11-storey Building with Roof Deck with 1 Level Basement and 5 Floors Parking Area with a total area of 31,928 square meters , " stated the resolution . <p> ' More than 3,000 classrooms ' <p> The Binays also cited a February 2014 report of the Commission on Audit ( COA ) that the contract price was " reasonable . " Still , Trillanes mentioned the same report to question the project . The COA auditor was among those charged with the Binays . <p> " Per the COA Report of 17 February @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 31 December 2013 already amounts to a total of P2,367,679,633.95 , with the construction contract split into 5 contracts in violation of the existing procurement law but which were all miraculously won by one and the same contractor , " Trillanes said . <p> " Hence , the City of Makati actually spent around P 2.4 billion for the said building , thus , placing the actual cost at around P75,000.00 per square meter , with the total overpriced sum in the amount of P 1.601 billion . " <p> Trillanes said the " parking building " cost 3 or 4 times more than the following : <p> the 46-storey Shang Grand Tower , the 19th tallest building in the country which was completed in 2005 at the cost of P2 billion only <p> the 57-storey The Residences at Greenbelt , San Lorenzo Tower , the 11th tallest building in the country which was completed in 2009 at the cost of P2.8 billion . <p> Like the complainants , Trillanes cited data from the National Statistics Office ( NSO ) to argue that the building was overpriced . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buildings in 2007 was only P7,691 per square meter , but the project cost was P75,000 per square meter in 2013 , or " a staggering overprice equivalent to 875% . " <p> " In order to highlight the gravity of this apparent anomaly , if the perceived overpriced amount of almost P 1.601 billion was instead utilized to build classrooms for our school children , more than 3,000 classrooms inclusive of toilets and furniture could have been built using the money , " Trillanes said . <p> Going beyond the plunder complaint , Trillanes also raised allegations about the old city hall built in 1990 , saying it was " even more scandalous . " <p> " The average cost of P240,000 per square meter for a building built in the 1990 's is clearly shocking , outrageous , and unconscionable , especially given the information that the responsible local officials were somehow able to ' dodge the bullet ' and escape responsibility for said anomaly , " he said . <p> Citing various news reports , editorials , and blogs , Trillanes urged the Senate to also investigate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officials : <p> reports of the use of local government funds for programs to boost the national campaign of a former local executive by funding his trips and hosting visiting local government executives <p> an alleged P230 million infomercial campaign which started in 2009 using Makati funds <p> supposedly bogus projects and ghost employees <p> " blatant and brazen overpricing and bid rigging . " <p> ' Bring it on ! ' <p> In a statement , Mayor Binay said the city government is ready to face investigation . He again cited the COA report to defend the project . <p> " The Commission on Audit has already cleared the project of overpricing allegations in an intensive audit in February . The findings underscore our position from the start that these allegations by our political opponents do not have factual and legal basis , " he said . <p> Binay previously quoted the COA report as saying that the project required the cost spent because of factors like " unstable soil conditions " and the quality of materials . " <p> " The report cited the construction of the main @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' Based on research and available data , ' the soil structure was found soft . ' Hard strata at this area was reached from 13 meters to 15 meters elevation from the ground , ' " stated an earlier press release of Binay . <p> Mayor Binay took a swipe at Trillanes for alleged politicking . " Our political opponents are desperately grasping at straws , and are intent on destroying our credibility through these malicious , false and baseless accusations . But we have nothing to hide . The building was constructed in accordance with the government procurement laws and processes , and we trust that all relevant transactions will bear close scrutiny . " <p> A member of the Senate blue ribbon committee , Senator Binay said she will inhibit herself from the probe out of propriety . <p> Chairman Teofisto " TG " Guingona III announced that Senator Aquilino " Koko " Pimentel III will lead the investigation . <p> Incidentally , Pimentel is a former ally of the Binays who bolted UNA and joined the administration in 2013 after the opposition coalition refused to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Senator Juan Miguel Zubiri , from its Senate slate .

Thus BusinessWorld interviewed established and emerging theater groups such as the Philippine Educational Theater Association ( PETA ) , Repertory Philippines , Tanghalang Pilipino ( TP ) , 9 Works Theatrical , and Red Turnip Theater in order to know how their business side operates . <h> " Some people ... think that they are investing in themselves and in their children by seeing plays and taking their children to see them . Or they believe that buying a theater ticket is a good investment for the kind of community one wishes to live in. " -- Joy Virata <p> REPERTORY PHILIPPINES : BOLSTERED BY SHOW BUYERS " No one in his right mind invests in theater . Actors do , but then actors are often not in their right mind , " said Phylita Joy G. Virata , board member and artistic director of Rep 's Theater for Young Audiences ( TYA ) , in an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do think that they are investing in themselves and in their children by seeing plays and taking their children to see them . Or they believe that buying a theater ticket is a good investment for the kind of community one wishes to live in . A few have the capacity to sell shows to earn money . " <p> Those brave few who invest in the theater are called show buyers . They initially make a 10% down payment to reserve the date of the show they are buying and to get all the tickets for Rep 's 800-seat venue Onstage at Greenbelt One in Makati , and then they pay the rest in three installments . <p> The seats are sold to the show buyers wholesale , then the buyers earn money by setting the price for individual tickets and selling them to a captive market . <p> For Rep 's Theater for Young Audiences , the show buyers are from schools and organizations . For other productions , show buyers are mostly from charitable organizations who are doing some fund raising . <p> " We always caution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or have the capacity to sell tickets , " Ms. Virata said . " A large organization can distribute two to four tickets to their members , which does n't make too big a dent in their pocketbooks -- especially when these are mostly for charity . Also , our productions are really entertaining and of the highest quality and that makes selling tickets easier . " <p> The challenge of selling theater tickets lies in the attitude of Filipino audiences . " From our almost 50-year experience , Filipinos do not want to go to theater box offices and must have the tickets practically placed in their hands , " Ms. Virata said . " We can not afford a marketing structure to do this , so we make the show buyers our marketing arm . Companies like TicketWorld are helping to change this and are making some progress but we still need to get the tickets into theatergoers ' hands . " <p> Sponsors can help theater companies with their finances , but the current state of support has gotten worse . " We used to have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ companies , manufacturing companies , banks , cosmetic companies , retail sale companies , etc . Now , however , cash sponsorship is practically nil , " Ms. Virata said . " No one seems to think that theater is worth an investment . It does not pay either monetarily or in exposure . Theater companies like REP can not compete in exposure value with the imports -- Phantom of the Opera , Mamma Mia , Wicked and the like . <p> " However , there are individuals who support the theater by buying blocks of tickets for friends , family or employees . We call this our Corporate Subscription Program , " Ms. Virata said . " Each individual or corporation buys 12 tickets for each play of a given year at a discount . Some individuals also buy tickets to treat orphanages and other charitable institutions for children . <p> " Sometimes a generous individual will donate a piece of equipment . <p> National Book Store , for example , donated a projector for our production of Seussical the Musical . " <p> Ms. Virata also cites sponsorships @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Sometimes we get donations in kind , for props or costume items , " she said . <p> Despite the challenges facing the theater scene , TYA shows usually have a full house -- a straight play ( or non-musical ) is 20% filled if it is n't a " sold " show , and is almost full , of course , if it 's a " sold " show . Musicals benefit from having 30% to 50% walk-ins . <p> Besides selling tickets -- the proceeds making up 95% of the company 's funds -- Rep earns from interest on savings , costume rentals , and acting workshops . <p> These funds cover expenses like actors ' fees ( from a surprising , let 's just say , P800 to P6,000 for a play 's entire run ) and directors ' fees ( P30,000 to P100,000 ) . The fees depend on " actual stage experience with Rep and out of Rep , " Ms. Virata said . The cost of a set can range from P300,000 to P2.8 million , with the most expensive being Peter Pan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a " fly director . " In terms of marketing , Rep used to spend about P1 million , then brought it up to P2.5 million . But because there was " very little difference in sales , " Ms. Virata said the company has been " rethinking " its marketing budget . <p> PETA : KEEPING WITH THE TIMES " Being market-sensitive does not necessarily equate to being market-submissive , " said Julie Bautista , marketing director of PETA , in a paper she presented last year at the National Theater Festival of 2013 , a copy of which she e-mailed to BusinessWorld at our request . <p> " We always try to know what the audience is looking for , what kind of products they buy , what kind of product hits the news , what do they talk about , what do they blog about , where do they take their friends to on a Friday night , what will make them get out of the house on a Sunday afternoon , how much can they pay , how much will they pay ? Soon as we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we choose which cards to play . " <p> To be able to sell the shows , the marketing team must be familiar with all the aspects of a given production . That 's why the marketing arm consults with the artistic team even before a play 's first reading . During rehearsals , the marketing people continue to be there and they pay attention to how PETA 's original plays morph and develop . With such knowledge , the marketing team can " cook up and revise the brands and slants " that they will use for their promotions . <p> Sometimes the play 's content and marketability go hand in hand . For William , PETA 's musical about Shakespeare , rap and hip-hop were integrated into the show to attract young audience members . What 's more , marketing made the characters popular by associating them with certain identities whom young people can relate to , and so the characters were not just known by their name but were referred to as TJ the bully , Richard the Leader , Sophia the Kikay , etc . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right for the intended audience . <p> This is what happened with PETA 's Caredivas . PETA is used to having students fill its theater , but this was n't the target market for a show about five transvestites who are caregivers by day and " care divas " by night . <p> Realizing this , the marketing team switched gears and began courting well-known personalities , theater practitioners , and the " pink " crowd . <p> When these influential people began endorsing the show , " Tickets sold like pancakes , " said Ms. Bautista . <p> Generating conversation is an important part of PETA 's marketing strategy . " We ask ourselves , ' Anong pwedeng tsismis What are people talking about that we should check out ? ' " Ms. Bautista said . " Then we identify which channels to use . " <p> PETA goes to Facebook if the target market is young . It taps celebrities or well-known personalities for the adult crowd . Broadsheets , news and morning programs are channels that parents pay attention to . PETA is also active on Instagram @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tap its members , their friends , and their followers , and make them engage with social-media posts . <p> These promotional strategies in the current cyber-era are fascinating to note , in the context of PETA 's historic place in Philippine theater . This was the company , after all , behind such landmark productions as Nick Joaquin 's Larawan -- both the late 1960s and 1970s adaptations directed by PETA veteran Lino Brocka -- and the stage version of Minsa'y Isang Gamu-Gamo . In its glory years , PETA featured such distinguished screen-stage performers as Lolita Rodriguez and Nora Aunor . <p> TANGHALANG PILIPINO : CCP 'S RESIDENT COMPANY Tanghalang Pilipino ( TP ) knows that there are perks to being the resident theater company of the Cultural Center of the Philippines ( CCP ) . <p> " Tanghalang Pilipino receives a subsidy from the CCP which also includes the office space and use of venues for performances , " said Carmela Manuel , company manager of TP , in an e-mail to BusinessWorld . Now and then , TP receives grants from art institutions like the National @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the United Nations Children 's Fund and World Health Organization . <p> As CCP 's resident company , TP avails itself of the 200-seat Tanghalang Huseng Batute ( Black Box/Experimental Theater ) and the 400-seat Tanghalang Aurelio Tolentino ( Little Theater ) . TP is required to put up five productions every season and a total of 86 performances . <p> Compensation is not that high among TP 's actors , many of whom also work in television and film -- not a few of them already established names in the indie scene . " Since TP is a non-stock , non-profit theater company , we can only afford to pay our actors a humble amount every performance plus rehearsal fees , " Ms. Manuel said . " Some of the factors we try to consider with the rates are : working budget , actor 's credits , role , previous TP rate . " <p> As to how TP attracts audiences , which are usually from the South and Manila area , TP 's plays , besides having Saturday sold-out performances , find traction during performances in the last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do things the last minute , " Ms. Manuel said . <p> RED TURNIP : WHEN FRIENDS GO INTO BUSINESS When five friends -- theater veterans Jenny Jamora , Rem Zamora , Topper Fabregas , Ana Abad Santos , and Cris Villonco -- decided to form a theater company of their own , Red Turnip Theater , it was important that each of the co-founders were equally invested in this endeavor , both in terms of passion and finances . And so each of them contributed the same share to Red Turnip 's capital . It was inevitable that some partners were more liquid than others . But even if one partner took a loan from another , it was paid back with interest . The setup was " very professional , " said Mr. Zamora , who , together with Ms. Jamora , was interviewed for this story . <p> This arrangement , if you will , among these partners shows the solidarity evident in theater . Would it be embarrassing for them to be reminding each other of their obligations ? Mr. Zamora said the solution is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out a memo or putting it in the agenda of their meeting . Sometimes , Ms. Jamora said , the partner who wants to collect a debt asks another co-founder to remind their friend of that obligation . " We help each other to be accountable , " she said . <p> It sometimes takes a while for a co-founder to be able to contribute to the company 's capital . But they find ways to deliver , like putting in more legwork to promote the shows , said Mr. Zamora . <p> Their initial financial nest-egg was used to building the brand , pay for the launch , secure rights to their first production ( their adaptation of English playwright Patrick Marber 's Closer ) , do photo shoots , come up with brochures , and hire a PR person . <p> During its first season , Mr. Zamora said , Red Turnip got sponsors by finding out what they needed , then contacting people who could help them in those areas . They would also ask friends if they had contacts in company they were seeking out as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they were planning to approach so that person could put in a good word . <p> Sponsors either responded by giving cash or goods that helped cut down costs like props for the set , items for press kits , and food . <p> Slowly , Red Turnip attracted sponsors . Closer had four , Cock had five , and Rabbit Hole had 13 sponsors . Mr. Zamora attributes the increase in sponsorship to the success of the first season . There were times when he would call a potential sponsor , who would say , " Yes , we heard so much about you .

We are happy with the trend , but I think in the next few months it is going to accelerate . <p> InterAksyon : What do you think accounts for your growth here in the Philippines ? <p> Marco : I think Viber offers a lot of ways to interact and Filipinos love to interact . In the Philippines we see a lot of people doing text messaging and also voice , and I think Viber is a tool which allows you to do these two things very well . <p> It 's not just about messaging , not just about voice , but it gives you a very nice combination of these things in a very fun way . It 's also the localization , it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think fits well with the Philippines and the fact that you also have a lot of overseas workers . <p> InterAksyon : How does the Philippines compare to your other markets ? <p> Marco : Localizing requires a lot of resources so we do not localize at the level that we have done in the Philippines in most markets . This is one of the markets where we invested the most in localization , both in terms of having boots on the ground as well by doing local partnerships and creating local content . So if you compare this to the rest of the world , there is more local content here in the Philippines than anywhere else . I ca n't think of any country that has more local content than the Philippines . There 's no other country where we did as many events as in the Philippine by far . <p> So , there have been a lot of parties and Viber is creating and getting this sort of image that is fun . It 's fun because of the app itself , which is colorful , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ InterAksyon : Could you describe your public campaign strategy ? <p> Viber stickers <p> Marco : We 're pretty much focused on giving back and letting the users experience us as a brand . Something that 's more memorable than an advertising that you forget after a few seconds . <p> InterAksyon : Is that approach unique to the Philippines ? <p> Marco : It differs by market but generally we do n't do TV advertising . But we do TV advertising in some places , like in India . <p> InterAksyon : Why ? <p> Marco : It 's because of a few things . One , we look at the competition , and we see that they did it and it 's not really helping and we 're still significantly bigger , so if you do n't have to spend a dollar then why bother . We feel that this is more effective . Putting it all on TV is more mechanical . We want people to interact with us . <p> InterAksyon : What 's your take on the multibillion buyout of your competitor , WhatsApp ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In many markets it actually helped us . For example if you look at markets where WhatsApp is relatively strong like Brazil , we saw a significant boost in usage on speculations that this is going to have an impact on privacy . Because if you look at us versus the competition , Viber has been carrying the banner of privacy , of the right of people to communicate in a safe and private way , and I think people understand that , especially in markets where users are privacy-aware . So from a business standpoint , this acquisition in some markets helped us . At a personal level , good for them . <p> InterAksyon : How would you characterize average Viber user here in the Philippines ? <p> Marco : For the Philippines , they are still generally young , and they use it to communicate with their closest friends and families . <p> From a messaging standpoint , the fastest growing trend is all really groups , groups , groups . It 's global but it 's accelerated in the Philippines . And you can understand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Philippines .

Among them is Diary ng Panget , a series of romantic comedy novels written by college student Denny and published by Viva-PsiCom Publishing Corp . It eventually became the country 's bestselling book and a top-grossing movie . <p> So far , nearly a dozen movies based on Wattpad stories have been released or are in production stage . <p> Lau , who has been to the Philippines a number of times as an IT consultant before he established Wattpad , was born in Hong Kong and studied at University of Toronto 's Electrical Engineering program .

" Every single Filipino has a mobile phone and Filipinos are very social on the Internet . They are very active on social networks . Wattpad is a community that connects readers and writers . It is a social place for readers and writers . The combination of mobile , social and serialized stories , where writers upload stories chapter by chapter , that increases the opportunities for the readers to interact with the writers . Writers have the opportunity to interact with the readers , every time they upload . Because of that , it fits really well for the Filipino culture , " he says . <p> On why Wattpad became big , not only in the Philippines , but globally , Lau says it changed people 's reading experience . He says Wattpad is the first platform that gives the readers and writers the direct connection . " If you look at traditional reading , it is a very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You do it all by yourself .

" That 's our main differentiator , " he says . <p> The rise of smartphones played a big role behind the success of Wattpad , Lau says . He says 85 percent of Wattpad traffic comes from mobile devices . " We are both web and mobile , but overtime , the percentage of mobile traffic has become greater and greater . Now it is 85 percent , and that percentage is still growing , " he says . <p> Wattpad also gives writers the flexibility to publish stories as they write them . " Writers upload chapter by chapter .

But in the bus , they can use those 15 minutes or 20 minutes during their commute to read a chapter of the story that they love , " Lau says . <p> How Wattpad began <p> Lau is an engineer by profession and an avid reader . " I am not a writer . The reason I started this is because I read a lot . In a way , I designed this for readers . I am trying to do something to solve my own problem . The problem I tried to solve in the past is that because I was so busy , I wanted to bring the reading materials with me on the go . That 's why I started this company , " he says . <p> " The idea started in 2002 . I was born in Hong Kong but moved to Canada to attend university University of Toronto . I have stayed there ever since . I have lived there for over 25 years now . I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is my third company , " he says . <p> Lau says the first company he established was a mobile gaming publisher . " " We published our own games , but we also helped other companies like Disney or Sony to publish their games . It was like 12 years ago when I started that company . But I am not a gamer . I do n't play games . So that 's one of the reasons why I started this Wattpad idea , way back 12 years ago , " he says . <p> " My background is mobile , professionally and my passion is reading . I want to combine the two together and that 's why I started this idea . But in 2002 , as you know , the most popular phone was Nokia phone and its screen size was this small . It was very hard to read a book on the phone . I knew the timing was n't right , " he says . <p> Lau says while he had the prototype as early as 2002 , he was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had my own company at that time and number two , I knew the time was n't quite ready for this . Then fast forward to year 2006 . By that time , the most popular phone was the Motorola Razr . Its screen size was not this small anymore and it was this big . So reading a book on the Razr was quite comfortable . But of course , compared to the screen that we have today , that was quite primitive . But it was okay , " he says . <p> " I resurrected the idea that I had in 2002 . I started to develop the application on my spare time again . Interestingly , a good friend of mine , Ivan Yuen , who used to work for me in my mobile gaming company and was my employee number one in fact , he left that company and moved to Vancouver in 2006 , " he says . Yuen was also born in Hong Kong but grew up in Canada , where his family moved when he was six . <p> " In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instant messaged me , saying he was launching a new product and asked me to check it out and give him some feed back . I clicked on that link on the instant messenger and when I looked upon , wow , he was working on a mobile reader app as well . Same idea as mine , but he went a step ahead of me . Not only did he create a mobile reader app , he also created a website for the readers and writers to share , " Lau says . <p> That became the predecessor of Wattpad , he says . <p> Business plan <p> " A few days later , I flew to Vancouver to meet with him Yuen at Vancouver airport . We spent a few hours at the food court of the airport . We wrote the business plan on a piece of napkin and then , we were so excited , we decided to start the company . That 's how we started , " Lau says . <p> Lau and Yuen , being both engineers , built the Wattpad app . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lau says . " It was not quite ready to launch in October 2006 , so we spent some moment . Officially , we launched the product in January 2007 , right after the Christmas holiday , " he says . <p> Lau became the Wattpad chief executive and Yuen the chief technology officer , in charge of developing and improving the platform . <p> " We knew in the beginning the scale would be large , because there was nothing in the Internet where people can share the story in long text format . We want to build a global Internet company . We kinda knew it can become very big , but now seeing how it can become , of course the feeling is very different , " he says . <p> Wattpad started sharing classic literature , but it was not until new writers came in when growth became extraordinary . " As a community that connects readers and writers , one problem we had in the early days is that even with many readers , no one would share the content . Without any content , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a chicken and egg problem .

We went to different phases in the evolution . The first year was slow . It was only classic books that attracted a group of readers . When we got some readers , the writers felt comfortable to share with what they write . Only in end of the second year 2008 did we start to see sharing of content , " he says . <p> " We saw the first writer sharing content on Wattpad and that writer was very social .

I really do n't have anyone but I can tell you what I am reading right now . I just started not too long ago reading Conspirations of the Universe . I am reading chapter 3 right now . It was written by a male Filipino writer . It was a combination of romance , adventure and a bit of science fantasy , " he says . <p> " My reading taste is very mixed .

My main motivation is seeing people interact with me . I can speak for millions of people out there , " he says . <p> Opportunities for writers <p> Writers sharing free stories and becoming popular on Wattpad have the chance to get the attention of book publishers and even film studios . <p> " Because they retain the copyright , they are free to work with any publisher they want or choose . We are supportive of that as well , " says Lau . <p> Wattpad now has about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ based in Toronto , in the same office .

She 's very fluent in Tagalog and English as well . We have many staff like her in our office . We have someone who is fluent in Turkish . We have a lot of staff like this and that really help us to grow globally , internationally .

We have 30 million users , five million of those are from the Philippines . The Philippines is one of the top countries , but we are seeing the same thing in Spanish-speaking countries as well , " he says . <p> 1 billion users goal <p> Lau says Wattpad focuses on growing its membership .

As soon as they can read and write , we want them to be Wattpad users . " <p> He says while Wattpad has over 30 million users , the goal is to increase it by at least 30 fold . " Sounds 30 million users is very large , but our goal is to become a billion user company and build a billion user community that focuses on reading and writing . On this planet , there are five billion people who can read and write . There are close to 3 billion Internet users . That number is going to grow to 5 billion Internet users in the next few years . So the combination is there are a lot of people in the Internet who can read and write . Our goal is to capture a lot of them and make sure they will become Wattpad users . Our goal is to grow another 30 times and become a billion user community , " he says . <p> Lau says it is very hard to project when this goal will be achieved . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ user company in five to 10 years , " he says . <p> " In the past few years , all our focus has been on user growth . But now with the scale and user base , we can enable some very interesting business models . Before you have the scale , some of the ideas may not be quite relevant . But now , we have 30 million , we can try that . One thing we are putting focus on is native advertisement , " he says . <p> Movie adaptations <p> " So , for instance , we have been working with movie studios . One of the popular movies in the past summer is the Fault in Our Stars . We were working with the movie studio and they ran a campaign on Wattpad . We helped them to commission a few writers to write a number of Wattpad stories that are related to the movie . The movie as you may know is about extraordinary love . As a reader , I do n't feel I am bombarded with advertisements . I am reading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story , I am aware of the movie . So we are helping the movie studio to generate brand awareness for the movie . That has been successful , " he says . <p> Wattpad also provided income opportunities to writers . " As I mentioned , not everyone 's motivation is to make money , but for those who want to make money , we can help them to generate revenue , using Denny author of Diary ng Panget as an example . The best selling book last year in the Philippines originated in Wattpad . She obviously generated a lot of income . It was the best selling book in the Philippines and it was also adapted to movie and that movie was at the top of box office , " he says . <p> Lau says whether Wattpad will plan an initial public offering at the stock market or entertain acquisition offers will come later . " We did not spend time to think about it . Our philosophy is we do n't have to think about that type of opportunity . Whether someone will buy the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that type of opportunity would come automatically , if you built a successful company . Our focus is on building a billion user company . When we get there , the financial opportunity will come , " he says . <p> Lau says Wattpad has helped spread the culture of reading globally . " I believe the Internet has done a great job . We are helping people to read and write more . Everyday , we are seeing close to a quarter of a million uploads on Wattpad . Each upload represents a chapter .

@@2811240 <h> FOCUS Philippines in a new era of global uncertainty , Part 1 of 2 <p> ( Editor 's note : Cesar Polvorosa Jr . is a business school professor of economics , world geography , and international business in Canada . He is also a published writer in economics , business , and literature . This is a significantly revised and extended version of the article that originally appeared in The Canadian Business Strategist Magazine entitled Business Strategy in a New Era of Uncertainty . His two-part article on the Philippines and India was published by Interaksyon last June 15 and 18 . ) <p> There is a growing sense that the world is at a major crossroad . Critical global trends and developments indicate that the path ahead will be fraught with challenges of sluggish economic growth and geopolitical uncertainty . <p> The much anticipated global economic recovery had been anemic and the Great Recession had degenerated into " secular stagnation " and " Greater Depression " - these terms recently used by renowned economists Lawrence Summers and J. Bradford DeLong respectively attest to the pervading air of pessimism . <p> The persistence of the economic malaise has cast doubts on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now in place for several years . Keynesian policies are making little headway in restoring growth and reducing unemployment . <p> In the meantime , the Arab Spring has morphed into the Autumn of upheavals and internecine strife with ISIS emerging as a new and deadly peril . The crisis in Ukraine heralds years of confrontation between EU and NATO against a resurgent Russia . There 's also the Ebola threat in West Africa which is growing exponentially in virulence and scope . <p> The West Philippine Sea and the East China Sea are wracked by tension over the territorial disputes between China and Japan , the Philippines and Vietnam . What is the significance of these developments in a global geopolitical and economic context ? <p> The current global economic and political uncertainty stands in stark contrast to the prosperity of the late 20th century and much of the first decade of the 21st century . The 1980s were comparatively benign and the rapid economic expansion in the 1990s lulled especially North American managers and technocrats into complacency . In the boom years of the 1990s , the main @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the vigorous US market , the transition economies of East Europe , investment opportunities in China , and the advent of the Internet . <p> The demise of the business cycle was one view gaining traction . Many young managers and professionals of that period had no memory or appreciation of a recession . The Philippines specifically during the administration of President Fidel Ramos had been proclaimed as the next Newly Industrialized Country ( NIC ) in the making . The global economy would stride into the new millennium with sustained growth and rush headlong into a future of peace and prosperity guided by free markets and advanced technologies . <p> The new normal <p> Uncertainty or volatility is not a novel experience for the world economy which had been historically characterized by business cycles or the periodic ebb and flow of economic activities . Indeed , the 1930s was the era of the Great Depression . <p> The eminent economist , Joseph Schumpeter proposed the idea of a " creative destruction " or the process where economic progress is achieved through the creation of new and better technology at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ historically been confronted by the challenge and opportunities of the emergence of new technologies and disruptive effects of innovations . Thus , a manufacturer of pagers that do not adapt to the era of cell phones is doomed to extinction . Economic progress under Capitalism is therefore necessarily disruptive . <p> The dotcom bust at the turn of the 21st century was a rude awakening and the 9/11 attacks came as an unprecedented traumatic shock . Though economic recovery returned , there have always been the heightened national security fears about terrorist plots . <p> Finally , the prolonged Great Recession ended any semblance of business normalcy for while the expansions and contractions of the business cycle occur periodically , the economic weakness and uneasiness since late 2007 had been unusually long and severe . The unsettled environment has become the new normal . We have entered a new era of global uncertainty . <p> How can the Philippines cope ? <p> How different is this new era of uncertainty ? Profound and extensive interconnectedness engendered by globalization and advanced telecoms indicates greater potential for depth , breadth , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Internet and IT , external shocks will rapidly ripple across global markets intensifying the potential for panic and knee jerk reactions . Financial risks are magnified due to over leveraging in response to the wave of deregulation . The spread of globalization has created fierce and more numerous competitors . <p> It may be tempting to dismiss the relevance of the feeble world economy and the role of global uncertainty for the Philippines as the country had been achieving heady economic expansion since 2010 . But the Philippines can not decouple itself from the state of the global economy in terms of the country 's engagement with world trade , investments , OFW deployment , reliance on remittances , and the prevalence of conflict and instability may eventually curb the country 's economic growth . <p> How can the country cope with the greater uncertainty ? In general , a country 's economy reduces its risks in an unstable environment by adopting more prudent financial and economic policies . We can analyze the necessary responses from both micro and macroeconomic perspectives . Let 's start with the micro @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> How are businesses affected and how would they cope with the highly uncertain business environment ? A sudden bout of volatility will reflect in a decline in stock market prices . A company stock will be hit as part of a general negative market sentiment and the perceived specific adverse effects on the company through the operations side or the costs of doing business ( CODB ) and via the output side through their revenues and markets . <p> On the operations side , the CODB that are most susceptible to short run , violent fluctuations are foreign exchange and interest rates -- factors that trigger rapid increases in prices of oil and raw materials and depreciation of the domestic currency . Inimical effects on firms depend on their sensitivity or vulnerability to changes in these specific variables . Interest rates would affect credit costs which impact all firms . For exchange rate fluctuations , the most vulnerable would be firms dependent on raw materials imports , semi processed products etc. used in their supply chain and exchange rate losses from off shore operations as well as companies that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investors react as the turmoil moves from the financial markets to the real sector i.e. from Wall Street to Main Street . <p> On the output side , turbulent economies and politics can severely impact the market of the company . Thus , Greek companies got a double whammy not only from the domestic fiscal crisis but the tanking of demand for shipping and tourism services -- the two major pillars of the Greek economy as Western European economies went into a tailspin . Across the Mediterranean , some MNCs operating in Libya and Syria had been forced to leave when those countries were wracked by civil war . The Canadian company Bombardier 's planned JV to manufacture airplanes in Russia is on hold due to the deterioration of relations between Russia and the West . <p> The airline industry illustrates a business that is buffeted by the headwinds on both input and output side . Battered by the free fall in air travel from the post 9/11 period , airlines then stalled from a confluence of both high oil prices and the Great Recession . Meanwhile , the industry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legacy carriers . <p> What can Philippine businesses do in this new era of uncertainty ? <p> 1 . A strategic mindset : acceptance <p> In the new era of uncertainty expect the unexpected . Managers and professionals need to recognize that rare , major , unforeseen events or " black swan " events as conceptualized by statistician and scholar Nassim Taleb can occur . The classic event to illustrate the black swan event had been the massive tragedy of 9/11 but they can also refer to the emergence of disruptive technologies such as the computers and Internet . The acceptance of the likelihood of black swan events facilitates the planning and response process as it pushes the organization to be dynamic and open to changes . The organization needs to accept that incorporating seemingly irrational scenarios is a rational exercise . The strategic mindset of acceptance of black swan events is an impetus to undertake an uncertainty preparation framework for the organization . <p> 2 . Effective environmental scanning <p> Knowing that the firm is operating in a new era of uncertainty encourages the organization to undertake a thorough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black swan events ( e.g. 3/11 tsunami in Japan ) but there will also be developments whose possible outcomes can be incorporated into various scenarios such as the trajectory of the Eurozone crisis , the rise of mobile devices , Chinese economic growth , the Syrian and Iraqi crisis etc . <p> 3 . Due diligence and analysis <p> Having engaged in a meaningful environmental scanning , the company can examine in greater detail , analyze and evaluate various scenarios . Thus , the company can use sensitivity analysis that focuses on assuming a wide range for specific variables to assess their consequences on the firm . The strategic mindset of acceptance of the improbable becomes relevant as e.g. while oil prices may reasonably reach a high of $150 per barrel , incorporating an unknown extreme event may mean assuming a maximum of $175 per barrel and gauge how it may affect the firm . <p> 4 . Strengthen the business <p> While management should try to strengthen their company at all times , it becomes an imperative in an era of uncertainty . A firm with a stronger balance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to be simultaneously opportunistic such as Apple Computers with cash of $159 billion in 2013 . Such a staggering cash hoard is a defensive strategy to insulate the company from a liquidity crisis but it is also an arsenal to empower the company to engage in necessary strategic acquisitions . <p> A prudent , realistic expansion program is vital especially in the current era of uncertainty . For example , the downfall of the iconic PanAm can be partly explained by the acquisition of too many 747s . It ended up with a lot of empty seats when the oil shock of the mid 1970s struck- certainly a black swan event . Other measures include a tighter monitoring and review of both suppliers and customers to determine those who are most vulnerable to financial shocks . <p> 5 . Enhance competitive advantage <p> Whether the challenge arose from market contraction , the urgency to supply a new market , a huge spike in the CODB or a convergence of various elements , the dynamic company seeks its competitive advantage as the basis for its sustainable position in the economy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even as it operates in the era of uncertainty . The nimble firm can act speedily and decisively in responding to quickly unfolding black swan events . Firms can restructure to become flatter organizations . Often , the lines of authority and decision making are difficult to reform as they are embedded in the corporate culture . When Toyota had to grapple with major quality issues in its cars it was criticized for its slow response though this was in accordance with the Japanese management practice of consensus management ( ringisei ) . Consensus is time intensive and while it may be optimal during stable periods , it may become a stumbling block during periods of rapid developments , uncertainty and volatility . <p> Some companies rely on subcontracting , outsourcing , and offshoring to keep costs down . However , improper implementation can hamper the formation of a dedicated in-house pool of experts and lessen control on the production process e.g. supply chain issues delayed Boeing 's 787 project because of over-reliance on subcontractors . <p> 6 . Stay the course but be flexible <p> With unexpected changes it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if not its very mission itself . However , unless there 's a fundamental change in the business environment that adversely affects the competitive advantage of the company it is best for it to stay the course . The challenge for management is that such clarity of adhering or changing strategy may only come after some period as the contours of the fluid environment becomes definite . An optimal approach for the company can be to adopt an " emergent strategy " which as propounded by business scholar Henry Mintzberg means being flexible and opportunistic while continuing to stay the course on its main path for as long as a " game changer " has not occurred .

Combined fuel consumption has been reduced by almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the previous 8.2 l/100 km , cor- responding to CO2 emissions of 79 g/km . The previous model emitted 193 g/km . <p> The drivetrain has already proved itself in the Panamera S E-Hybrid , but it has been adapted for use in the Cayenne S E-Hybrid . The Cayenne now also offers an impressive electric dri- ving experience that the driver can control intuitively . This is enabled by an accelerator pe- dal with a pressure switching point which the driver can use to precisely regulate the elec- tric motor 's power development and activate the combustion engine . At 416 hp ( 306 kW ) , the combined system power output of the supercharged three-litre V6 engine and the electric motor coupled with a combined system torque of 590 Nm enables performance at sports car level : 0 to 100 km/h in 5.9 seconds and a top speed of 243 km/h . The electric top speed is 125 km/h . The Cayenne S E-Hybrid is networked via Porsche Car Connect ( a standard feature ) . It is used to access information such as the state of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heating/air conditioning . This cools and heats the ve- hicle interior when the ignition is switched off -- in order to reach the desired temperature before setting off whilst the vehicle is still connected to the electrical supply . The energy nee- ded on the road is reduced and the electric range is increased . <p> Details of a perfect plug-in hybrid concept <p> The lithium-ion battery has the same housing as in the Panamera S E-Hybrid , and it is also accommodated under the luggage compartment floor . However , it features advanced battery technology and uses cells with a larger energy capacity -- 28 Ah instead of 24.5 Ah . <p> The vehicle comes with a 3.6 kW charger as standard . An integrated charger with higher power output of 7.2 kW is available as an option ; it charges the Cayenne S E-Hybrid twice as quickly as with the standard charger -- assuming that an appropriate electrical connection is available . For example , in Germany the vehicle is charged in less than an hour and a half instead of just under three hours . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ S E-Hybrid . A slight positive pressure of 0.3 bar in the tank ensures that evaporated fuel does not escape to the outside , and this improves the car 's emissions footprint . During refuelling , the tank is depressurised by pressing the fuel flap release button , and the evaporated fuel is neutralised via an activa- ted carbon filter . Needless to say , the Cayenne S E-Hybrid complies with the Euro 6 emissions standard . <p> High level of hybrid expertise at Porsche <p> Porsche is the leading supplier of premium hybrids . As the first plug-in vehicle in the luxury class , the Panamera S E-Hybrid set standards when it was launched in June 2013 . The Cayenne S E-Hybrid now carries this forward-looking technology to the premium SUV seg- ment . With its record-breaking time on the Nu ? rburgring in September 2013 , the 918 Spyder demonstrated in impressive style that even super sports cars can attain new dimensions in performance with hybrid technology and are clearly able to leave conventional drive systems behind when it comes to driving dynamics and efficiency . <p> In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ race car that Porsche uses in World Endu- rance Championship ( WEC ) competition -- plays a pioneering role as a high-technology vehicle . It is a research laboratory on wheels for further developing hybrid technology with the aim of achieving maximum dynamics and efficiency . Its drive combines a charged V4 petrol engine that drives the rear axle with two energy recovery systems . In addition to braking regeneration , a generator driven by the exhaust-gas flow generates additional electric energy . This energy is stored in a water-cooled lithium-ion battery , and during acceleration it is fed to an electric motor which drives both front wheels via a differential . This means that the 919 Hybrid has all-wheel drive at times . The coordination of all drive components is extremely complex and has the aim of making every second on the racetrack completely predictable whilst driving with maximum precision and speed . Independent of race results , Porsche gathers knowledge and experience with every kilometre that the 919 Hybrid races , and this will help give future generations of sports cars a competitive edge . <p> Incidentally , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : the 1899 Lohner-Porsche " Mixte " designed by Ferdinand Porsche combined a battery-electric drive with a combustion engine . <h> Get Inquirer updates while on the go , add us on these apps : <p> Disclaimer : The comments uploaded on this site do not necessarily represent or reflect the views of management and owner of INQUIRER.net .

Nearing the 14th anniversary of the attack on the US destroyer , the US Navy unveiled a technology that allows the use of unmanned patrol boats to defend warships like the USS Cole . AFP FILE PHOTO <p> WASHINGTON - The US Navy says it will soon use armed , robotic patrol boats with no sailors on board to escort and defend warships moving through sensitive sea lanes . <p> The technology , adapted from NASA 's rovers on Mars , will transform how the American navy operates and is sure to raise fresh questions and concerns about the widening role of robots in warfare . <p> The Office of Naval Research on Sunday released the results of what it called an unprecedented demonstration in August involving 13 robotic patrol craft escorting a ship along the James River in Virginia . <p> In a simulated scenario , five of the robotic patrol boats guarded a larger ship , while eight others were ordered to investigate a suspicious vessel . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " target , " enabling the mother ship to move safely through the area . <p> The demonstration , conducted over two weeks , was designed to " replicate a transit through a strait , " naval research chief Rear Admiral Matthew Klunder told reporters in a recent briefing . <p> " It could be the straits of Malacca , it could be the straits of Hormuz . " <p> The demonstration was a " breakthrough " that goes far beyond any previous experiment , he said , adding that similar robotic patrol craft likely will be escorting US naval ships within a year . <p> The patrol craft , 11-meter ( yard ) long vessels known in the military as rigid hulled inflatable boats , are usually operated by three or four sailors . But outfitted with the robotic system , a single sailor could oversee up to 20 of the vessels . <p> Humans in the loop <p> There were no shots fired in the demonstration but Klunder said the robotic craft can be outfitted with non-lethal equipment , such as lights and blaring sound , as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fire on an enemy ship if ordered to do so by a sailor . <p> " We have every intention to use those unmanned systems to engage a threat , " the admiral said . <p> " There is always a human in the loop of that designation of the target and if so , the destruction of the target . " <p> For the demonstration , researchers had fail-safe systems in place to avoid any mishaps . <p> If communications with the patrol craft broke off , the vessels would go " dead in the water , " said program manager Robert Brizzolara . <p> And if the boats malfunctioned in some way , there were two separate communications links that could be used to halt the vessel . <p> Unlike drone aircraft , such as the famed Predator and Reaper planes , the robotic boats are more autonomous and can carry out directions without having to be operated by a human at every step . <p> " The excitement about this technology is it is autonomous , " Klunder said . <p> " So we 're not talking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The boats move in sync with other unmanned vessels , selecting the best route while sensing obstacles . <p> The US military sees the innovation as saving sailors ' lives and strengthening the navy 's edge . <p> But skeptics have warned of the dangers from the spread of armed robots -- without sufficient rules and debate about their use . <p> The technology , which the navy has dubbed CARACaS , or Control Architecture for Robotic Agent Command and Sensing , is " very low-cost " and can be installed easily on the patrol boats or other ships , Klunder said . <p> " We 're talking thousands ( of dollars ) . We 're not talking millions to adapt what we already have -- existing craft in our fleet , " he added . <p> " So we 're not going out and buying new patrol craft .

Their immediate challenges have to do with land consolidation and physical security in the fertile hinterlands of Mindanao . Banana is threatened by diseases and pineapple by insect pests . These are pre-competitive industry-wide concerns and ought to be addressed by private sector industry associations . The state universities ( UP Los Ba ? os , University of Southern Mindanao and Central Mindanao University ) can be mobilized to help in basic research . <p> Our mango industry with its superior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no turpentine taste has its own niche market . Unlike most export varieties which are seasonal , we are able to produce Carabao mango year-round thanks to the flowering technology developed by National Scientist Ramon Barba at the Institute of Plant Breeding ( IPB ) in UP Los Ba ? os . There is significant room for expansion as fresh fruit as well as dried and processed into slices , purees , juices , smoothies in cans , plastic cups in the export market . The Department of Agriculture ( DA ) should work closely with local government units , the private sector processors and exporters on a focused integrated national mango program organized around small mango growers . In the medium term , we should breed an improved Carabao variety with longer shelf life ( thicker skin ) and with a little red skin blush to make it more visually attractive . <p> Abaca is a near monopoly . Our only competitors , Indonesia and Ecuador , are not doing much . The most pressing problems are plant viruses . On-going plant breeding programs using both conventional and genetic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Development Authority of the Department of Agriculture should expand its program on mass multiplication of first generation virus-resistant materials . Farm gate price of abaca fiber is only half the mill gate price of the six abaca pulp mills .

The Department of Science and Technology ( DOST ) and the Department of Trade and Industry ( DTI ) ought to engage in more product development work to further diversify uses and markets of our natural eco-friendly abaca fiber . <p> We are minor players in coffee , cacao , rubber and oil palm vis- ? -vis our ASEAN neighbors . As long as we stay at that level and target domestic consumption and niche markets , we should be competitive .

However , coconut supplies only 3 percent of the world market for vegetable oils and ranks 8th after palm oil , soybean , rape seed , sunflower , cotton seed , peanut , and palm kernel . The immediate challenge is lowering cost of production to hold on to our market share by farm fertilization ( immediate ) and replanting with hybrids ( long term ) . We can create more value-added and employment in the countryside by exploiting all parts of the coconut through village level coconut processing depots built around wet processing of coconut directly into virgin coconut oil and coconut flour .

And we need more high standard dressing plants , slaughterhouses and cold chains . <p> Our rice and sugar industries will be under a lot of pressure from inexpensive rice and sugar from Vietnam and Thailand . With tariffs significantly moderated , the only barriers holding these products back are quantitative import restrictions . We should sue for time to prepare our rice and sugar farmers for the competition ( which we should have done 10 years ago ! ) Large scale adoption of hybrid rice and mechanization of transplanting , harvesting and threshing should make well-irrigated rice farms competitive .

Rappler comes from the root words " rap " ( to discuss ) + " ripple " ( to make waves ) . <p> More than 2,000 years ago , the Greek physician Hippocrates , regarded as the Father of Medicine , gave us medical doctors this essential reminder : <p> " Whoever would study medicine aright must learn of the following subjects . First , he must consider the effect of the seasons of the year and the differences between them . Secondly , he must study the warm and the cold winds , both those which are in common to every country and those peculiar to a particular locality . Lastly , the effect of water on health must not be forgotten . " ( Airs , Waters , and Places , 400 BCE ) <p> Indeed , the changing environment impacts greatly on human health , and that is why we in the health sector strive to make health systems more resilient and prepared in responding to emerging health challenges . For instance , we investigate the causes of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prevent lung disease , diarrhea , and toxic chemical poisoning . <p> We are also putting in place robust surveillance systems that monitor disease trends as well as their environmental determinants . Another thing we do is strengthen the delivery of health services at the community level and equip our health workforce so that they can manage diseases resulting from dire environmental conditions . <p> Doing no harm on people and planet <p> But more than treating illnesses , Hippocrates also left us with perhaps the most important commandment of medicine , which is embedded in the oath that bears his name and that we doctors recite at the beginning of our career : First , do no harm . <p> This is also the mantra of our organization , Health Care without Harm ( HCWH ) , and we believe that this tenet applies not only in the direct provision of care to patients , but also in the entire health sector 's interaction with the surrounding physical environment . Therefore , our organization 's goal is to transform the health sector worldwide into one that does no harm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

Photo from the author <p> For nearly two decades , we have been working with health professionals and healthcare institutions , as well as governments and inter-governmental organizations around the world to help eliminate harmful practices such as poor waste management , use of toxic chemicals , unhealthy food choices , and reliance on polluting technologies , and encourage them to shift to safer and healthier alternatives . For example , one of HCWH 's major achievements is the total elimination of mercury in healthcare settings . <p> Climate change and human health <p> We are adopting this similar " Do-No-Harm " approach as we bring the issue of climate change to the health sector . <p> The British medical journal The Lancet called climate change " the biggest global health threat of the 21st century . " Sadly , the health effects of climate change are already being experienced in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spread to increasing burden of disease and injury as a result of extreme weather events , such as Super Typhoon Haiyan which hit central Philippines almost exactly a year ago and claimed more than 5,000 lives . Indeed , the health sector is one of the first to bear the brunt of climate change and its consequences . Ultimately , people do suffer and human lives are lost prematurely and unnecessarily . <p> Global evidence , as documented in the reports of the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) , clearly demonstrates that climate change is the product of a fossil-fuel driven economy . The health sector , however , can not remain in just treating its signs and symptoms , and instead should play a critical role in the elimination of its root causes . Fortunately , some health organizations from different parts of the world are setting an example , as they begin to veer away from short-term cures and rather turn towards more preventative measures . <p> Handing off from fossil fuels <p> For example , in June 2014 , the British Medical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transfer its fossil fuel investments to clean energy .

They are currently deploying renewable energy technologies to its network of facilities . <p> Gundersen is also part of another of HCWH 's flagship projects , Global Green and Healthy Hospitals , which is a worldwide network of nearly 9,000 hospitals and health centers that have committed to reduce their carbon footprint through doable alternatives in the management of chemicals , wastes , and water , among others . <p> Several hospitals in the Philippines have also begun adopting sustainability as a key principle in healthcare .

In 2011 , the GCHA launched the Doha Declaration on Climate , Health , and Well-being , which laid down the health case for global climate mitigation and adaptation . <p> Today , its members , including HCWH , are engaging with national healthcare organizations in order to begin negotiations with other sectors for the protection of health in the face of climate change .

@@4790230 <p> MANILA - With several senators warning of " landmines " in terms of lump sums and huge allocations to the Department of the Interior and Local Government for tasks outside its mandate , the United Nationalist Alliance and militant groups on Wednesday pressed the alarm button over what they consider the inordinate rush to pass the national budget for 2015 . <p> UNA interim president Toby Tiangco said that the rush to pass the proposed 2015 national appropriations bill is meant to conceal funds intended as pork barrel and other insertions , which he described as part of the Liberal Party 's campaign kitty for 2016 . <p> Tiangco said the proposed 2015 General Appropriations Act ( GAA ) contains " many objectionable features " that were waylaid in the budget of the Department of Interior and Local Government ( DILG ) . <p> Among these objectionable features in the budget , Tiangco said , is the revival of the unconstitutional pork barrel system under the guise of so called " lump sum grassroots items " . <p> Relatedly , stalwarts of the Bagong Alyansang Makabayan , led by Renato Reyes Jr . and former party-list Rep. Teddy Casino , said Senator Miriam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last Mondaythe proposed 2015 budget as something riddled with pork barrel funds . <p> Based on the version approved by the House of Representatives as previously revealed by Rep. Antonio Tinio during the budget debates in Congress , pork barrel allocations for congressmen rose by 32% from P20.76 billion in 2014 to P27.39 billion in 2015 , said a press statement from BAYAN . <p> This means , said BAYAN , that each congressman will get around P94.44 million in congressional pork in 2015 , which is higher than the traditional PDAF allocation of P70 million per congressman . <p> DILG favored - Tiangco <p> For his part , Tiangco claimed the budget heaps a lot of pork on a few favored national agencies , led by the DILG . <p> " There are P37.3 billion in lump sum funds under five departments , aside from the revival of savings taht they can use in the manner of the DAP , " said Tiangco , referring to the Disbursement Acceleration Program created by Budget Secretary Florencio Abad as an economic stimulus scheme . <p> Tiangco pointed out that besides the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 2015 budget bill allows the Executive " to freely overrule the will of Congress . This is done in bad faith , to circumvent the Supreme Court 's ruling on the unconstitutionality of DAP , " he said . <p> Both the lump sums and the savings re-definition had been denounced by budget watchdog groups led by ex-national treasurer Leonor M. Briones . They were denounced by Senator Santiago in last Monday 's privilege speech , although the Senate finance committee chairman , Sen. Francis Escudero , explained that it 's the House version that carried the Abad-proposed features , especially the re-definition of savings . <p> Tiangco asked on Wednesday " For what are the DILG funds that were listed for projects outside its mandate " like housing and water ? Obviously , he added , these are meant to boost the campaign of the DILG secretary who is the " presumptive LP standard bearer of LP in 2016 . " Santiago had described the 2015 budget as having been " cleverly crafted " by Budget Secretary Abad to boost the chances of his partymate Mar Roxas in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , in response both to Senator Santiago and to criticisms made by Sen. Ferdinand " Bongbong " Marcos , who chairs the Senate 's local governments committee . <p> Between 2011 and 2013 , the DBM released close to P11 billion in DAP funds to 116 congressmen and 22 senators , who were mostly members of the ruling party and closely identified with Malaca ? ang . Critics had said bulk of the DAP releases to lawmakers were not meant for economic stimulus but as " bribes " to oust then Chief Justice Renato Corona , who was impeached by the House , and then ousted by the Senate in a 20-3 verdict at the close of a five-month trial . <p> LP 's huge ATM machine <p> " That is why it is imperative to check thoroughly the 2015 national budget , otherwiseit will become just a huge ATM machine of this administration and its allies in the 2016 national elections , " Tiangco said . <p> According to Tiangco , DBM records showed that congressmen , governors , mayors and vice mayors , allied with LP @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ local government units " which were not authorized under the GAA . <p> " They are obviously rushing passage of the 2015 national budget so the Senate will not be able to notice pork barrel funds tucked in there for 2016 campaigns and other insertions , " he added . <p> Such rush betrays the real intent , in the teeth of strong denials by Secretary Abad about the presence of pork barrel in the 2015 budget , Tiangco stressed . <p> While passing the annual national budget on time is in principle a good thing , it is not good when it deprives lawmakers enough time to thoroughly review and discuss it , the UNA leader and Navotas congressman explained . <p> The rush has become a habit , Tiangco said , because the President had repeatedly certified to the necessity of immediate enatcment of all the budgets of the Aquino administration from 2011 to the 2015 GAA . <p> " This is not the first year that this has happened . In fact , for five consecutive years , Section 26 paragraph 2 of the 1987 Constitution has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passed by either House shall become a law unless it has passed three readings on separate days , and printed copies thereof in its final form have been distributed to its Members three days before its passage , except when the President certifies to the necessity of its immediate enactment to meet a public calamity or emergency ' , " he said . <p> " We have argued that this certification of necessity must be to to meet a public calamity or emergency . But in all these certifications , no public calamity or emergency was stated to be addressed . It is illogical also to use this reason since , the following years budget can not be used to address a present public calamity or emergency . It can be used only starting January 1 , " he explained . <p> " So ang nangyayari sa Congress is , we get copies one hour before voting . How do you read 4,010 pages in one hour ? So , the intention clearly is to discourage reading . This 2015 GAA is more illegal because Abad is making the insertion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 269 pages ? Definitely 269 pages is not a typographical error . But in the end , the numbers win and we lose in the vote . It 's a good thing that Senator Miriam Defensor Santiago raised this issue , " Tiangco said . <p> Miriam is right , 2015 budget riddled with pork - BAYAN <p> BAYAN said the pork is tucked-in as line item budgets in the following departments : <p> Just like the PDAF , these funds are pre-allocated to each district and party list group and their release are subject to referrals or recommendations by the congressmen . This discreet system is their way of going around the Supreme Court decision which essentially abolished PDAF as an item in the national budget , noted BAYAN . <p> The bulk of the pork barrel goes to the Executive , estimated to be around P958 billion in special purpose funds , unprogrammed funds and lump sum appropriations whose release is upon the sole discretion of the President and his appointees . <p> Worse , with the redefinition of savings as proposed by Malacanang and approved by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barrel since he will now be allowed , DAP-style , to declare billions in savings in the middle of the year for realignment to his or his allies ' pet projects . <p> Sounding the alarm , BAYAN has invited Filipinos to protest " against unbridled government corruption and other crimes of the Aquino regime on November 30 , Bonifacio Day .

He and SEA Games champ Kreeta Shintawacheewa of Thailand have surpassed the 2013 winning jump of 5.15m this year . " I have jumped 5.21 and Kreeta ( Shintawacheewa ) has done 5.20 , so it will be an even battle , " said Obiena , who placed fourth in the 2013 Games . <p> Obiena began the year at 4.95 meters but after he came back from his two-and-a-half month training with the coach of former world and Olympic champion Sergey Bubka in Italy , everything came together . <p> First , clipping the 22-year-old national mark of 5.01 held by Edward Lasquete with a 5.05 meter leap in the weekly relays late July . Then , he matched Kreeta 's winning jump of 5.15 meters in the weekly relays in August and later won the Singapore Open in a new national mark of 5.20m . It is the best performance by a Philippine track and field athlete this year . <p> Obiena 's feat is rare in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poles and there was only one landing pit ( in Rizal Memorial ) . Now , there are quite a lot of poles and training has improved , " said former national coach Jojo Posadas , now UE coach , in a phone interview with Rappler . <p> Posadas said his former FEU teammate , Dario de Rosas , who became pole vault king in the mid-1980s , had to make do with one pole . <p> Obiena 's two-and-a-half month training in Milan has done wonders . As Obiena told Rappler.com in an interview last July : " " He taught me a lot of things . I have to be aggressive on the approach and on planting the pole but have that control , " <p> There is no break for him as Singapore looms . " After this week , it 's back to training next week , " Obiena said . -- Rappler.com <h> Would you like to share your vote ? <p> Welcome to Rappler , a social news network where stories inspire community engagement and digitally fuelled actions for social change .

He said the current ILP commitments will suffice to cover for the projected power capacity shortfall by summer next year . <p> " After 2016 we will have surplus power with 600 mw coming on stream , " he said .
