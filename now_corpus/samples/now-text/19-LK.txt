A student in the Junior School Certificate class was leaving after school , as part of his daily routine back home , a walk to Maradana railway station ; he stops near the second-hand bookman on the pavement .

" Five decades later , as a respected public figure and a retired teacher to thousands of physicians , he enrolls in a Buddhist faculty of a state university for reading for a master 's in Buddhist philosophy , he wrote for his dissertation on ' The Contemporary Relevance of the Kalama Sutta ' . Kalama Sutta is the Sutta No. 65 of Anguttara Nikaya , Mahavagga . <p> " The Blessed One is thus skillful , enlightened , endowed with knowledge , peerless , sublime , knower of the world , teacher of divine and humans ; by himself he has clearly understood through direct knowledge " <p> The Dhamma requires each individual to work out his/her own emancipation from misery through insightful understanding of the true nature of things .

In this context I am inclined to take the view that the wise men and women of our time are the natural scientists endeavoring to figure out how the world works and have been remarkably successful in the enterprise . In other words , for me what modern science has to say about the natural world that has greater credibility than what is taught in religion or philosophy .

Now , the country is only a step away from introducing tough legislation to discourage the menace . <p> Panduka Keerthinanda , the Legal Adviser of the Ministry of Sports , is back in the saddle <p> The process was accelerated against the backdrop of match-fixing and corruption allegations which caused the International Cricket Committee ( ICC ) investigators to start inquiries . The probe is ongoing . A few have been charged and one has been banned . The new law to be passed in Parliament will make it legally possible to try them in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The Bill on Prevention of Offences Relating to Sports has been gazetted after months of deliberation by the Sports Ministry , Attorney General 's Department and the Legal Draftsman . It now awaits passage in Parliament to make all sports-related corruption , particularly match-fixing and illegal and betting , criminal offences . <p> The gazette was issued on August 23 , 2019 . The law carries jail terms and hefty fines to deter potential criminals . <p> Once passed , Sri Lanka will be the first Asian country -- following in the footsteps of South Africa , England , Australia and New Zealand -- to introduce such a law . It covers every aspect of corruption including engaging in betting , gambling , match-fixing , providing inside information for benefits , financial or otherwise , and any action that brings the sport into disrepute . It gives power to charge suspects under Sri Lanka 's judicial system . <p> " As there were no laws in Sri Lanka , we could not try anyone before the rule of law , said Panduka Keerthinanda , Sports Ministry Legal Adviser @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hope to deter would-be corruptors from engaging in such activities .

We are not going to do that . But the law will deal with illegal betting and related corruption , like bribery . " <p> Keerthinanda , a lawyer , was instrumental in drafting the new bill , along with officials representing the Attorney General 's Department . He called it a major victory in Sri Lanka 's fight against cancerous match-fixing and corruption in sports . <p> The ICC is currently carrying out a major investigation into match-fixing in Sri Lanka , a country it believes is one of the worst offenders .

These include a jail term of up to 10 years , a fine not exceeding Rs 100mn , or both fine and imprisonment for the offence of match-fixing ( covering spot fixing and pitch fixing ) , offence of corruption in sports , offence of unlawful betting and aiding , abetting and conspiring in the commission of any offence . <p> " Punitive reasons apart , there are exemplary reasons too , " he said . " Young players can not be allowed to begin their careers believing that they can ' get away ' by doing anything . This is the main reason why match-fixing laws are important .

Failure to cooperate in relation to any corruption-related investigation has also been made a criminal offence and those found guilty will receive up to one year in jail or a fine not exceeding Rs. 100,000 or both . <p> A failure to maintain confidentiality by a service provider and making false allegations against anyone are offences which entail a fine , a jail term or both . <p> Inquiries will be carried out by a Sports Investigation Unit ( SIU ) to be set up by the Minister of Sports , consisting of senior police officers above the rank of Assistant Superintendent of Police ( ASP ) who will probe and initiate legal action . The suspects will be charged before the High Court of Sri Lanka .

In the unlikely event of the latter happening , the NEC 's almost ' indecent hurry ' to have a presidential election , would have been defeated . <p> The NEC was smarting over the fact that its straining of every sinew to have provincial elections held , yielded no result . The NEC 's voluble chairman even went to the extent of saying he would resign if they were not held . <p> Fortunately , he did not walk the talk . So , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NEC rushed to announce dates for the presidential election once news came that an emergency Cabinet meeting and backdoor talks were hurriedly in progress to bring in legislation to abolish the executive presidency . The Cabinet shot the proposal down . <p> The abolition of the executive presidency is a much debated issue . In fact , it has been the subject of national debate for decades . That it has suddenly been taken up in the national agenda may not necessarily be for altruistic reasons . On the contrary , it appears it has politically motivated undertones and after a long time , the President and the Prime Minister are on the same page . <p> Just a fortnight ago , we said in this space , that desperate attempts to do away with the executive presidency betray ulterior motives on the part of the country 's ruling troika -- the President , the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition , " but if the final goal is something for the good , the means towards that end is arguably , irrelevant " . This time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instigate the emergency Cabinet meeting . <p> The once burning issue of the executive presidency seems to have been jettisoned as top priority in the post-Easter Sunday scenario with national security ranking as the number one issue in the country , even displacing economic issues . That ' national security ' drum is been beaten particularly to benefit one would-be presidential candidate who has a good track record on that front . <p> The JVP introduced the 20th Amendment to the Constitution for all intents and purposes , to abolish the executive presidency , but there was feet-dragging by all parties at the time . Suddenly there is a political ' emergency ' declared and some want to jump on the 20A bus . <p> Political connotations arise from the Speaker of Parliament coming forward this week to formally throw his hat into the Presidential ring saying he is prepared to contest with the one purpose of abolishing the executive presidency within a year . He has immediately earned the support of civil society groups that backed the incumbent President who came on the same platform with the same solemn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done since 1994 . The public may therefore view the Speaker 's promise with some cynicism , unfair though it may seem . Now , the Speaker may have second thoughts . <p> The Speaker would have had to contend with receiving his party 's ticket to contest the Presidency while his party 's deputy leader is already in the ring , though seemingly not too hot on the abolition of the executive presidency . The latter is reported to have said there has been no scientific survey on whether the people want to abolish , or continue with the executive presidency . This may not be so , as there have been several informal surveys on the subject . Unlike the Speaker , however , he has left his options open saying it depended on what the people want and criticised the last minute moves to abolish the system . The main Opposition , SLPP , says it is for the abolition byt wants to do it the " correct way " . <p> The country 's first Executive President J.R . Jayewardene adroitly introduced the executive presidency without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the 1977 general election titled ' Towards a Free and Dharmishta Society " referred to this , and the party 's overwhelming victory was as good a mandate as it could be for the introduction of the executive presidency . On page 11 of that manifesto it said ; " Executive powers will be given to a President who is elected by the people from time to time ... The parliamentary system will be protected under the new Constitution ... " . <p> He then introduced a mere amendment to the 1972 Constitution with his 2/3rd majority in Parliament , and it was only thereafter , in the 1978 Constitution , that he brought in the provision of a referendum ( of the people ) which is now required in addition to a 2/3rd majority to abolish the executive presidency . <p> Whether the Government can get the required 2/3rds and the approval of the people at a referendum before a presidential election , now fixed for November 16 , is clearly out of the question . However , the President will remain in office till January 8 next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2020 unless a vote of No-confidence is brought against the Government . <p> In these circumstances then , there still is time to implement such a decision , which will then make the forthcoming presidential election of lesser importance , and the newly elected President a virtual lame-duck . That probably is the worry of those pushing for their choice of presidential candidates . <p> Since the introduction of the referendum provision into the Constitution , there has only been one held , and that too an utterly controversial one in 1982 to extend the life of that 1977 Parliament . <p> One of the reasons for the reluctance to go to the people for direct consultation through referendums has been the cost factor . Moreover , they are non-binding in that a Government can always choose to ignore the results if it goes against its position . In the UK , a referendum on whether to leave the European Union has thrown the country into a spin with calls for a second referendum on the footing that the people may not have originally understood the gravity of the question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ framing of the question at a referendum . But with the issue of whether to continue with the executive presidency or abolish it , a very real one , and on the nation 's agenda , and also , considering the cost of having a separate ' election ' to decide the issue , the Government may well consider , together with the Opposition , asking the people that very question at a referendum which could be done simultaneously on November 16 . At a US presidential election voters also vote on a number of other Federal and State related issues together with voting for a President . <p> Many more questions can also be put to the people ; for example if Provincial Councils need to continue ; or whether SriLankan Airlines needs to be sold ; or whether the Death Penalty should be re-introduced . Because we do not have electronic vote counting yet , the counting of those votes can be after the presidential election count . Thereby , they will ascertain the ' vox populi ' on the executive presidency -- and other burning questions in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The Ceylon Chamber of Commerce launched a working draft of its 2020-25 Economic Acceleration Framework at the Sri Lanka Economic Summit held this week .

One important issue is that the market is too small to accommodate too big fellows . <p> Small is dangerous <p> The biggest problem of the Sri Lankan stock market is its " small " size @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it can sometimes be " dangerous " too . The small size can make the market vulnerable to manipulations . <p> According to reported data , the Sri Lankan stock market has only 297 domestic companies listed ; the value of all the company shares traded , which is called the market capitalisation , amounts to $16 billion only . A smaller country -- Singapore has 482 companies with $ 687 billion market capitalisation . A poorer country -- Bangladesh has 593 listed domestic companies with $ 77 billion market capitalisation . <p> These figures make the Sri Lankan stock market the " smallest " among the Asian stock markets ! <p> The problem is that someone who has a sizable amount of money in hand has the ability to buy low and drive the prices up , then sell high , and get out ! This act may put all other investors in trouble , and even the economy in trouble . <p> A monkey at $250 <p> On top of that came the biggest fellow who has absolute powers to shake the market -- the government , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may argue that the government can boost a sluggish market by entering into it benefiting the economy . True ; but at the same time , it is also true that it has the ability to help someone to sell the monkeys at $250 each , and get away . <p> After all why the domestic companies are fewer in number and smaller in size is not an issue that can be sorted out within the boundaries of the stock market . It is a policy and political issue that has to be dealt with separately . <p> ( The writer is a Professor of Economics at the University of Colombo and can be reached at sirimal@econ.cmb.ac.lk ) .

I am also writing to let you know that in a few weeks , the Blue party which you founded is very likely to die a natural death . <p> Your motive for founding the Blue party may not have been purely altruistic . Those days , DS was in charge of the Greens . With son Dudley and nephew John in the Cabinet you knew that you would be an ' also ran ' for any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and formed the Blue party . <p> The Blue party you founded did even better than the Greens in keeping the leadership in the family . Your widow Sirima was the boss for decades after your demise and then passed on the baton to your daughter . Sadly , your son and heir never made it to the top , passing away after a stint with the Greens . <p> Then the leadership passed from the ' Bees ' to the ' R 's . What a change that was . Sirima was accused of nepotism when she had only Felix by her side but the ' R ' brothers made a fine art of nepotism . One was the big boss . Then , the Speaker , a Minister and the Defence Secretary were all from the ' R ' clan ! <p> The ' R 's would have taken absolute control of the Blue party and run it like their family business for the next fifty years , like your family did for the first fifty years , if not for a mild-mannered farmer from Polonnaruwa who had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a hero and cheered him on . <p> That was four years ago , SWRD . This chap , Aiyo Sirisena , is the reason why the Blue party is on its death bed now . He came to power with the help of the Greens . He promised everyone that he will do away with the top job . The Greens thought he will stay neutral and allow them to run the government . <p> Instead , this chap took charge of the Blues , not realising that he had no mandate to do so because he was elected with Green votes . Most Blue MPs rebelled against him . They took shelter in the shadow of the ' R ' boss , Mahinda maama , who was streets ahead of Aiyo Sirisena in playing this dirty game . <p> The Green were also happy because they believed that , with the Blues now divided , that alone would be enough to get them re-elected . So , instead of exposing and punishing those responsible for the misdeeds committed during Mahinda maama 's time , they allowed those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and annoyed by Aiyo Sirisena being in charge of the Blue party , Mahinda maama formed his own party . It is known as the ' pohottuwa ' party because its symbol is a flower bud . At the last major elections , it swept the board and sadly , your Blue party came a distant third . <p> Now , Aiyo Sirisena is trying every trick in the book to hang on to power , if only for a few more days . Last year , he even appointed Mahinda maama as his PM betraying the Greens who got him elected . He was then rapped on the knuckles by the big court and told that what he was doing was illegal . <p> After ignoring his promise to scrap the top job for four years , Aiyo Sirisena has suddenly remembered it now . Just the other day , he called a sudden meeting of his ministers and wanted to do so , a day after dates had been set for the big race . With such a man in charge , everyone is deserting the Blue party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arms . Some will cross over to the Green camp . A few fellows are still hanging on to Aiyo Sirisena but there is nothing really left of your beloved Blue party now , except its name , its history , what it achieved in the past and of course , the ' hand ' symbol . <p> Aiyo Sirisena did have ideas of running the big race again , teaming up with Mahinda maama . The latter was too smart for that . He quickly appointed his brother as the candidate . That was when Aiyo Sirisena realised that his time was up and that his days are now numbered : fifty-six , to be precise . <p> It will be the first time the Blues will not have a candidate at the big race . If nothing drastic happens -- such as Mahinda maama returning to resurrect the Blues . It will also mark the demise of your Blue party as a political force in Paradise . Sadly , your daughter Satellite can only watch from the sidelines . <p> You can still be happy , SWRD , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Greens . It held power in Paradise for longer than any other party . You will always be remembered as its founder . Aiyo Sirisena will go down in history as the man who put the final nail in its coffin ! <p> Yours truly , <p> Punchi Putha <p> PS -- There was a time when the Blues were in charge when September 26 , the day of your demise was a national holiday , Ceremonies were broadcast live from Horagolla . That will not happen again . Still , SWRD , we may have live broadcasts again to commemorate ancestors , this time from Medamulana !

This was a time when English reigned supreme . Not coming from an English speaking family and equipped with only a little fluency in the language , I used to admire his manner of speaking the King 's language . That was in 1945 when we were fellow students in the fifth standard . <p> There were the three of us Wilfred Jayasuriya , Carlo Fonseka and I performing well in the term tests in that order although in the final government examination the order changed to the reverse order as in the Biblical aphorism that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time of Carlo 's demise on September 2 only the three of us remained in Sri Lanka as almost every one else in that class of 30 students led by that deeply religious teacher Leonard Obris had passed away from our midst . One of the other two old timers is the playwright Ernest McIntyre living Down Under and the other Lionel Abeysekera , a food technologist , living in Canada . <p> Due to Carlo 's skill as an elocutionist he was the class representative in the school 's elocution contest . <p> Carlo was the eldest in a family of four boys , two of whom became medical doctors . His father was an Apothecarist in private practice after retiring from the government service . <p> In the following year , 1946 , the two of us met at St.Joseph 's College in Maradana while Wilfred joined us a few years later . In the fullness of time we joined the University , me one year earlier to the Arts Faculty and Carlo to the Medical Faculty having performed brilliantly in the two biology subjects . Medical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Science Faculty in Colombo . Being intellectually and culturally a multi faceted persona , Carlo formed a close association with the Professor of Mathematics , the versatile Douglas de S. Amerasekera which could have disrupted his smooth educational career . Carlo rounded up his medical studies by earning a first class in the final examination in 1959/1960 . <p> Soon after his internship in the General Hospital he joined the Colombo Medical Faculty from where he proceeded to Edinburgh for a higher research degree which he secured doing research on , if I am not mistaken , the functioning of the pancreas . <p> He was a Marxist by conviction from his schooldays and a card holding member of the LSSP . The Rector , Fr Peter Pillai was aware of his Marxist affiliations but he did not punish Carlo the way he punished Carlo 's classmate and kinsman , the late Oscar Panditharatne by throwing the latter out of the school boarding . <p> As an honest Specialist medical practitioner he did not earn money to enrich himself . In fact he treated the patients who sought his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was honest to a degree that it became an irritant to his fellow specialists as was evident from the confession he wrote as an article published in the newspapers titled " To err was fatal " . I understand that this piece was published in the British Medical Journal . Even in the matter of the death of the Ven . Sobitha Thera Carlo 's expiatory piece published in the Island drew an inquisitorial response from some specialists . <p> He had his other lay detractors . Someone wrote to the media about alleged illicit earnings in a European country to which he responded satisfactorily in defence . Then he had a running intellectual battle with another Professor of Mathematics on both matters of science and culture.With respect to this feud in an article published in the Island I compared the two intellectuals to Plato and Aristotle . As a rationalist and anti-superstition promoter/propagandist , Carlo had received many challenges and threats from charlatans for their hocus pocus only to be quickly and devastatingly exorcised and their mumbo jumbo demystified by him . As Dr. B.J.C. de Silva mentioned in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could explain intricate scientific matters in simple language . This is what the Nobel Laureate Feynman had said to the effect that if a teacher could not explain a difficult concept in simple terms then he has not understood the matter himself . <p> Carlo was the first of that trio of schoolboys of 1945 to earn a doctorate while Wilfred was the second to do so on a subject related to English literature and I the last , writing on finance . <p> One of the unexpected exhilarating honours thrust on Carlo could be the invitation he received to preside at the annual prize giving in his old Catholic school , St Joseph 's College where under strict orthodox Catholic tradition a Marxist would not have been welcome . This was many years after the time of the rectorship of Fr . Peter Pillai . <p> At one time , after his retirement , he wore three hats concurrently as the head of three public institutions , the Sri Lanka Medical Council , the Arts Council and the National Narcotics and Tobacco Control Board . This was , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The last occasion I met him was when he visited me at my home in Pelawatte , Battaramulla about four years ago to hand over his autobiography , Essays of a Lifetime , to me .

About a year ago I sent him by post another book of mine , " The Story of Chemistry " , a bilingual publication meant for the general reader in the cause of popularization of science , to which Carlo made a great contribution throughout his professional career . <p> Dear friend , let me end with the words of Virgil , the poet , suitably changed ' Dulce et decorum estcorpus suum pro scolatradere ' .

Senaratne <p> Dr. S.P.F Senaratne , Social Anthropologist , passed away at the age of 87 years on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Senaratne in November 1972 as Survey Assistant at the Marga Institute ( Sri Lanka Centre for Development Studies ) which was established in April 1972 , to conduct research studies on social and economic problems and communicate its findings to the government and general public . He was then the Acting Director , Museum and joined the Institute as its first Director of Urban and Rural Studies . He was one of the original subscribers to the formation of the institute and also , the elected member of its first Board of Management . <p> Dr. Senaratne developed and presented a new approach and a conceptual framework as a Social Anthropologist to identify , formulate and analyse development problems in the country . For example , his approach to the first study of " work motivation " in business organisations ( 1972 to 1982 ) was quite different from traditional organisation studies . The study was to examine the roles and relationships of personnel at all levels of the organisational structure and its linkages with the society within which it functions . The relation between the business organisation and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The business organisation was considered as a social system , characterised by its roles , relationships between roles , norms originating from both within and outside the organization bearing upon relationships , and actual behaviour which either conforms to or deviates from these norms . With this understanding it is possible to examine the distribution of power and the ideology in the organization which upholds the system . Using this framework the next step was to identify differences among organizations and to identify key variables for detailed studies . <p> We used this framework to study 13 organisations in the private and public sector as an exploratory study using participant observation , in-depth interviews , case studies etc . The similar framework was used in the second study to examine the linking mechanism between the villages and the capital city and how the intermediate centres link the areas of trade and commerce , politics , administration etc. in the two major settlement areas in Anuradhapura and Ampara district . <p> During this period under the guidance of Dr. Senaratne we learnt basic sociology , social anthropology and more importantly qualitative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in-depth interviews , and analytical framework in research studies . He conducted informal training sessions on Social Anthropology , research methodology and the research framework to be used in **28;120;TOOLONG research and field studies . I worked under his guidance as a young graduate with no previous research experience to do social research and field studies . <p> We encountered Dr. Senaratne for the first time in our career in development , working with him with his background of academic studies and international research experience at a foreign university . He was not a boss as such and always very friendly and commanded high respect from all of us in the division . He was not interested in undertaking and making money in research studies and was only content in doing in-depth and analytical research studies at the institute . <p> Although Dr. Senaratne left the Marga Institute in the late 1970 's we had contacts occasionally and I nominated Dr. Senaratne as the elected member of the Faculty Board of Humanities and Social Sciences , Open University from 1996 to 1999 when I was the Head of the Department @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ academic staff members to develop their research proposals and field studies . <p> After retirement I met Dr. Senaratne again at the evening discussions on development problems , organised by Lalitha , his beloved wife , and daughter , Dr. Sunari at his home at Nawala . Our former colleagues at the Marga Institute organised a get-together in November 2017 and 2018 and he participated at both events with his wife and daughter who were always behind the success of his career and also were there all the way , supporting him in all his endeavours . We all miss him . Dr. Senaratne lived such a good exemplary life and always expended his knowledge in support of and for the benefit of others . <p> Dr. Amarasena Gamaathige <p> To a wonderful teacher with love <p> Rani Perera <p> In my memory of hundreds of dear departed , Rani Perera occupies a special place as a kind and understanding lady who dedicated a large part of her relatively long and well-spent life in the teaching of English to schoolchildren as their second language .

Her rather elite background apart she remained simple and gentle in her disposition and had an aura of serene calm about her . <p> She was very fortunate to have a devoted husband in Neil and two sons Ranil and Varuna and daughter Nilmini who are all doing well in life.They together with their spouses and grandchildren did their best for her in her evening of life up to her last breath . <p> May her after-life anywhere in this infinite universe and in infinite formations be as comfortable as it had been during her life on this earth .

Another 48 percent travel by private vehicles and the remainder use rail . " Right now , we have seen the beginning of what we call ' exponential growth ' , " he observed . " And we foresee , according to the modelling we do , that public transport will continue to come down to less than 30 percent if we 're unable to make a change to this rapid motorisation . " <p> The story is common to many developing countries , both low and middle income , Prof Kumarage said , calling for Governments across the globe to manage rapid motorisation . <p> The conference -- called EASTS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from 30 countries and 130 local participants . The motor vehicle changed the face of the20th century . Today , there are an estimated 1.4 billion vehicles globally , averaging just under one per household . <p> Motor Vehicle ownership is often used as an indicator of economic prosperity and prestige and therefore driven by powerful political , social intentions and business interests promoting a large global automotive industry . <p> Vehicles have positive aspects , such as access to remote places , mobility at higher comfort , the convenience and freedom of on-demand supply of mobility , speedier travel , interaction across large geographical spaces and a huge industry in terms of employment and tax revenues . <p> " It has also become a symbol of social pride to own a car , to own a better car , maybe to own the best car , " Prof Kumarage said .

They stratify people by the cars they drive .

" That 's a large area of very important commercial land .

" And , then , people ask us what went wrong so I 'm in a way thankful that there is congestion so that we can solve the bigger problem of rapid motorisation . " <p> " A lot of wealth produced in terms of gross domestic product is now being used for motorisation , ' he said . " It could be used for many other things that make life richer and more meaningful . " <p> The world currently loses around 1.45mn people a year due to road fatalities .

If we disaggregate the local sown extent into the dry , wet and different agro-ecological zones , there may be areas where farming is profitable , " Thibbotuwawa said . <p> Sri Lanka has 46 different agro-ecological zones with differing profiles based on elevation , precipitation and soil fertility . <p> " So , the policies to propose would be to evaluate the profitability of different regions and invest only in areas where we have a comparative advantage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Land in other areas should be diverted to competitive , high-value , diversified crops .

" <p> A key learning in economics is that long-term subsidies and protection for mature industries reduces their competitiveness , as locals lose touch with the reality of market forces . <p> Sri Lanka started the fertilizer subsidy in 1962 , with the ' green revolution ' to increase rice yields with newer rice strains which required fertilizer , compared to the traditional varieties which did not . <p> " Then , fertilizer use was very low , and the government wanted to improve usage . With higher fertilizer , yield levels went drastically up to 4 metric tonnes per hectare . But now we are using more than the recommended level of fertilizer , " Thibbotuwawa said . <p> In Sri Lanka , farmers always believe that more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fertilizer is reducing soil fertility . <p> " Most recent yield levels indicate that yield levels have flattened from the earlier growth and is now around 3.5 metric tonnes per hectare .

@@40482240 <h> Risks and regulation of algorithmic news in the era of artificial intelligence <p> 2019-01-10 10:45:54 <p> 0 <p> 609 <p> The news communication industry is highly dependent on technology , and every new technology will take its transformation . Although the algorithmic news has just started , it has set off a revolution in the global media industry . KistianHammond , the Co-founder of " Narrative Science " which is a leading company in the field of algorithmic journalism in the Unites States , has predicted thatmore than 90 percent of the news will be generated by algorithmic robots in 2025 . He further mentioned that , robots will soon win the honor of receiving the Pulitzer Prize which is traditionally awarded for human journalists . <p> There is no definition for algorithmic news . Some scientists name it Robot Journalism or Automated news and some even call it Data-driven journalism or Computational Journalism . However , in this article will refer to it as " Algorithmic News " since it highlights the core position of the algorithmic program in providing guidance for the news to be produced by the robot efficiently . <p> For traditional news , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ news . Journalists and editors rely on professional journalists ' perceptions , experience , experimental judgments and value preferences to select specific information and publish the appropriate news . For the algorithmic news , robot becomes the controller of the process . The news is generated by means of algorithmic tools and Big Data or large volume of Data which can generate new content automaticallyand helps to make the process more efficient . <p> Features of algorithmic news When compared with the traditional ways and means of producing news , algorithmic news are comprised with three basic characteristics . Firstly it is the leading edge of algorithmic technology . Whether it is robot news or data-driven news , the core technology is still the algorithm . It is the continuous improvement of the algorithm technology that makes the robot writing ability more and more close to human conventional level , producing news with high readability and gaining recognition from the audience . <p> Secondly it is the basic resource of the data . Algorithmic news is highly dependent on the data resources , especially on the quality , accuracy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take the lead in the field of weather forecasting , stock market , sports events and so on . <p> Automated operations can be achieved in both release and promotion . A cost-effective and zero-cost breakthrough has been achieved in terms of cost . In summary , in the operating system of algorithmic news , the algorithm program is the core , the data resource is the foundation , and the intelligent operation is the key . Algorithmic news has been widely used in news production , but its danger is also obvious , which can effect the attitude of the audience and also changes traditional news values . <p> Thirdly it is the autonomous operation of artificial intelligence . In addition to the programs designed by humans , the algorithmic news can be automatically generated without any human intervention.The collecting information , analyzing data or even writing the news articles has now been replaced by Artificial Intelligence . <p> Risk of algorithmic news 1 . Copyright disputes Copyright disputes are the most pressing problem in relation to algorithmic news . In China , there is a mobile application named @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that starts with news aggregation and uses algorithmic technology to achieve personalized delivery , " Today 's headline " accurately grasps user 's needs and readingpreferences by using algorithmic technology . Within a few years ' time , this application became very popular in China . However , this application does not generate news but ratherengages in the distribution of news content , just like a ' porter ' of news . <p> Unfortunately , this application had to face legal consequences for the same . Many news agencies sued the applicationin Court . Until August 2017 , the number of cases in relation this application , accepted by Haidian Court alone exceeded 5,000 and it lost most of these cases . <p> 2 . Copyright of algorithmic news As a news software for automatic writing , the news robot will acquire , ananlyze , refine data and ideas according to algorithm and automatically generate newsto deliver important informationto users speedily . The emergence and rise of robotic writing will have an immeasurableimpact on the production , editing , publishing or dissemination , distribution and promotion of news . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In China , Xinhua news agency have a robot journalist named " xiaoxin " , Tencent have robot journalist named " Dream writer " and Today 's headline have a robotic journalist named " Zhang Xiaoming " . <p> Among the many question that will arise in relation to intellectual property in this connection , most common are the following . Whoshall be the owner or the creator of the algorithmic news ? Does the algorithmic news have copyright ? Should the copyright belong to the robot or the institution that created the robot ? According to the current intellectual property law , robot will have the copyright . But , robots are not entitled to rights of humans and they can not exercise the same.Therefore , in others words , the copyright should belong to the creator or owner of the robot . On the other hand , if the robot make any mistake as to the news generation , who will take the responsibility for the robot ? How can it be corrected ? . If the basic data or algorithmic news is wrong , it is very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> 3 . ' Information Cocoons ' harm the right of information The famous scholar Manuel Castells said that , power is based on the control of communication and information whether it is for the state or the media companies . The control of communication and information has always been the goal of various power competitions . It can be said that in the process of information exchange , power is controlled by the freedom of information . Especially , the field of news communicationbased upon human desire for freedom of information . The right to freedom of information is a universal right and is considered a fundamental human right in many countries . <p> The algorithmic technology is based on the large amounts of data.The emergence of algorithmic technology fully meets the demand in relation to point-to-point precision consumption in news products.It also allows the predictions of predecessors to be easily realized.This seems to be an improvement but it has also buried the hidden dangers , just as McLuhan said " in the beginning , we shaped the tools , and finally the tools in turn shaped us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flow of information . <p> Further , algorithmic technology has brought a reversed frog effect in the era of artificial intelligence which controls the exchange of information and results in ' Information Cocoon effect ' . The ' cocoon effect ' means that people 's information reading habits will be guided by their own interests . If they continue to accept this information , they will enclose themselves in a standardized , procedural cocoon . <p> The user only sees what he wants to see , only hears the opinions he agrees with and the sounds with similar opinions are repeated which will make a relatively closed environment . These risks deprive individuals of their right to self-determination , undermine the diversity of information , manipulate the basis of information dissemination and in turn generate a monopoly of knowledge caused by mechanization brought about by the advancement of science and technology that Harold Innis is concerned about . <p> Although algorithmic technology controls communication rights it is only a gradual threat , but the free flow of information is the key to safeguarding human rights . <p> 4 . Infringement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ algorithmic technology to discover and collect personal privacy . Therefore , with the development of algorithmic technology how to regulate privacy protection should be considered . For example , Facebook ' likes ' can tell a lot about person . According to a study carried out by the American social media company in 2013 , researchers showed they could use Facebook ' like ' to correctly predict personal information , including a user 's gender and ethnicity . <p> The researchers could also predict a person 's age , intelligence , and opinions about religion and politics . The study was based on information from 58,000 volunteers who provided " likes " to Facebook . The findings were published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.Many companies urge people to log on to their websites with Facebook or other social media accounts . Thisin turn , provides companies with a complete picture of the user 's birthday , list of friends , schools attended and other personal information.Marketers often use Facebook ' like ' and other digital records to sell products and improve services . <p> The researchers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ information . They said companies , governmental agencies , or even one 's Facebook friends could gather data that an individual may not have wanted to share.Therefore , Facebook should take necessary action to adequately protect personal information of their users and their friends . <p> Regulation of algorithmic news Based on the principle of " Center of the audience " , the algorithmic technology satisfies the user 's subjective needs by directly collecting the user 's preferences . This personalized and customized news and information often ignores the importance of information and the significance of information . In other words , when the algorithmic technology uses the accumulated user 's interest as a push guide , the media platform also mistakes the user 's ' attention ' of the specific information as ' importance . ' Obviously , this is unfair to users and it is also completely contrary to the spirit of the Internet . <p> How to regulate algorithmic news ? Firstly , the social norms of algorithmic technology in news depend on the self-discipline of the enterprises . For example , there is a need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , society , and ethics to form a research committee to increase the analysis and judgment of algorithmic technology cases , and actively accept the management and guidance of relevant government departments to improve the rules of algorithmic technology . <p> Secondly , there is also a need to rely onthe supervision of the user . For example , the mobile application " Today 's headlines " have been launched on the software named " Ling gou " and this software could detect and filter information to be anti-vulgar , anti-pornography , anti-false information . When the user is using the relevant text or link , the ' Ling gou ' will judge the health of the related content . According to reports , more than 600,000 users in China have used " Ling gou " software to filter the internet platform . <p> Thirdly and importantly there is a necessity to build an algorithmic association . In order to improve the application standards and devise and impriveoperating rules an algorithmic association should be formed . The rules formulated by such an association in terms of algorithmic technology will improve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ third party " Ethics Committee " could be established to find problems and deficiencies and to address them in order to promote algorithmic self-discipline and ethics of algorithmic technology . <p> ( Dr. Zhao Ying is Associate Director of China-Sri Lanka Cooperation Studies Centre and visiting scholar of Southwest University in Chi ? and Dr. Cai Fei , Associate Professor of Southwest University of Political Science and Law in Chi ? .

Can the Members in the Government benches name the Tamil journalists killed during that period ? Do you know at least one name ? During the period of 20 years , 14 Tamil journalists were killed . Has anything being done ? Not even an investigation has commenced . Some investigations are going on with regards to Ekneligoda and Wickrematunge .

However , both articles did not identify MP Sumanthiran by name .

They have claimed to be police in civil attire . They had refused to show identity cards but pulled out their pistols and fled .

There is a case pending and those people are free to prove their innocence . I did not ask DIG Gunarathne to release them , but explained what was brought to my attention . The DIG said that he will take necessary action . I hear that the youth were released on the following morning .

By end May , there would be eight PCs dissolved , with only Uva Province left till mid-September . The Cabinet , consisting of only UNP Ministers , deferred President 's request till the next Cabinet Meeting and it would then be the subject of Minister Vajira Abeywardne as Local Government and Provincial Councils Minister . If the President stopped with the request to hold elections before 31 May , it would have been good and right . BUT with his proposal to have 25 per cent women representation , wittingly or unwittingly he allows space for further delay . <p> That can not be done unless there is yet again an amendment to the PC Elections Law . What does all this mean ? Do they really want to hold PC Elections ? On Friday last , Parliament was to discuss PC Elections as moved by JO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was stalled thrice during the day due to lack of quorum , until Parliament was finally adjourned for lack of a quorum , till February 5 . In this Parliament of 225 MPs , the quorum is just 20 MPs . With Mahinda Rajapaksa appointed Leader of the Opposition counting all 95 UPFA MPs , the JO that wanted the discussion could not even have the 20 MPs required for the quorum for their own request . But they claim to stand with the People ( sic ) . How much do they cost the People ? On an RTI application sent to the Secretary-General of Parliament by PAFFREL , it was revealed that the cost of Parliament sitting for a single day is Rs.25 million . <p> It simply means each of these MPs wastes Rs.1,11,111 ( One lakh , eleven thousand , one hundred and eleven ) at every Parliamentary sitting . That does not reduce significantly even if the Parliament is adjourned due to lack of 20 MPs attending to the day 's business . Last Friday was not the first such day the Parliament could not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It happened on September 6 , 2018 when there were only 16 MPs . It had happened many times before . No party leader takes it seriously and has never accepted it as a serious fault , a letdown and as insulting the voter who elected them . <p> This absenteeism , no doubt is the political decision of the party leadership in avoiding PC elections . This includes the JVP too . They are accused of not taking their seats when the bell is rung by the Speaker calling for a quorum while being in Parliament . Apart from all the thuggery and vulgar behaviour of Parliamentarians the people endured during the Presidential tantrums beginning October 26 , it was this irresponsible bunch of 225 MPs those FR petitioners wanted to continue with as Parliament to save democracy . It was this Parliament , the Elections Commission memberRathnajeevan Hoole told the SC , his Fundamental Rights would be violated , if dissolved to hold elections on January 05 ( 2019 ) . <p> He now stands proudly having saved democracy with this Parliament that does not allow for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a voter . It is not only political party leaders but also , the MPs and the university academic Hoole , who now stand badly exposed with their hollow statements on democracy and rights . Those urban middle class rights activists accepted as civil society by the Western Diplomatic Corps and donor funders , who took to the Colombo Streets shouting Not Ranil , but democracy have also been exposed , no sooner than Ranil Wickremesinghe was sworn in for the second time as PM . They stand exposed more after they stormed into preselected media houses taking over PM Wickremesinghe 's lashing of media as black media . They are further exposed as Government Stooges with their piercing silence on the PC elections issue . <p> Where do they stand on PC elections ? Elections left on hold for over one year in the Eastern , Sabaragamuwa and the North Central Provinces and for over three months in the Wayamba , Central and the Northern Provinces have nothing to do with their democracy . Indefinite postponement of those elections does not mean any violation of sovereign rights of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as they did three months ago .

For that change Sobhitha Thera thought could be brought with the abolition of the Presidency . These urbanites came for the 2015 January election to defeat Rajapaksa and not for any change of politics . With Rajapaksa out , rest is fine for them . <p> They 've therefore given campaigning for democracy a new synonym ; stooging . The biggest stooge among the lot was exposed last Monday ( 28 January ) at the media briefing held by the Elections Commission ( EC ) . None expected Chairman of the EC to demean himself saying , he would resign from the Chairmanship and not from the EC , if PC elections were not held before November 2019 . Why till November ? Why not before end May as the President has proposed ? And why only from the Chairmanship and not from the EC ? Does he expect he would be appointed Chairman again ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he and the two members were wholly silent on why the EC can not hold PC elections under the prevailing law , PC Elections Act No.02 of 1988 . On 19 January I wrote to Chairman EC a letter captioned " Illegally postponing elections for dissolved Provincial Councils " that was also sent to all media . <p> In that , I said the PC Elections Amendment Act No.17 of 2017 though passed in Parliament is still not law , as the Review Committee headed by PM has not handed its report to the President within the required two months period for the bill to be Gazetted as law . Where a new law or an amendment is yet to be made operative , the Interpretation Ordinance quite clearly says in Section 6(2) " Whenever any written law repeals in whole or part a former written law and substitutes therefore some new provision , such repeal shall not take effect until such substituted provision comes into operation .

It is common knowledge that PC elections , therefore , can not be held under that new Act . What is not told by you is that the previous Act No.02 of 1988 still remains operative , as this new Act is yet to be validated after completing its due process . The EC can therefore legally hold PC elections under the previous Act which is still in operation . It is clear the EC does not need any further approval from anywhere else to have elections to dissolved PCs . The EC and its members have no legitimate and moral right to deny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day the PC Election ( Amendment ) Act No.17 of 2017 is made operative . <p> I thus accuse you and the EC as compromising with the government in denying PC elections to the People . " On the third working day after I sent my letter , the Chairman EC sent me a very short response via email that in English would read as , " While a public reply will be given at the media briefing on 28 January 2019 to the issue you raised , the relevant reply will be sent to you via email . Appreciate your interest in holding elections in due time " . Three whole working days are gone after the media briefing , until last morning , I have not received the reply he said he would send . The big bluff he is , he did not in any way respond to the issue I raised in my letter and said he would publicly respond to . Therefore my accusation the EC with its Chairman and the other two members are stooging for the Government , in allowing indefinite postponement of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should hold elections immediately under the existing law , PC Elections Act No.02 of 1988 , but they do n't . They are also with the Colombo middle class , blowing hot or cold as the UNP wants . The EC is not an IndependentCommission and is not there to safeguard the rights of the people . The members of the EC too like the funded Colombo civil society believe politicalstooging is part of democracy . Sadly for all of them , they do n't seem to know the story of the king who walked the streets naked , thinking he was wearing the best attire in the world . The elections for the PCs thus depend on how Wigneswaran and his TPA would see them as important for their own identity . In how the SLPP and Rajapaksa would see it as important for their politics in months to come . All others would wait for an opportunity to file FR petitions seeking stay orders against any election before November , in the name of democracy . 
@@40568237 <h> Trump 's coup to strangle Venezuela 's Maduro <p> 2019-02-01 02:27:04 <p> 0 <p> 341 <p> In what is seen as the most outlandish foreign policy declaration the Donald Trump administration has hitherto made , the United States on Monday tried to unseat Venezuela 's democratically elected president by recognising the pro-US opposition leader as the new leader . It is reported that US Vice President Mike Pence phoned Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaido last week to instruct him to declare himself as the " acting president " , and denounce the incumbent leader Nicolas Maduro as a " usurper . " Wow ! If regime change is so easy , why regular elections ? The US could have removed Saddam Hussein in 2003 by simply declaring a servile opposition figure as president . This would have saved the US thousands of lives and billions of dollars . <p> The US action of making a random declaration to recognise an opposition figure as a legit leader sets a dangerous precedent that needs to be checked . How can the US endorse an undemocratic power transition , while accusing Maduro of not being a respecter of democracy ? How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ US intelligence agencies probe Russia for rigging the US elections ? In terms of international law , outside intervention is permitted , only when a government commits genocide or crimes against humanity . Maduro is accused of neither . Maduro may not be a saint . Yet , he is not the Satan that the US president and his neocon advisors are portraying him to be . He may not be a Sim ? n Bol ? var , the legendary 19th century leader who led a revolution that spelt freedom for most of Latin America from the colonial yoke . Or even a Hugo Chavez , who re-launched the Bolivarian revolution in the late 1990s to free Latin America 's poverty-trapped people from the grip of transnational capitalists . Maduro is far from perfect . The US and its rightwing allies may call him a dictator and accuse him of being corrupt and connected to drug cartels . That 's politics . Permitted . Maduro , once a bus driver , was first elected to office in April 2013 , after Chavez died of cancer . Despite the rising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free fall . <p> In May 2018 , Maduro was re-elected to a second term in an election that was boycotted by most opposition parties . The boycott was partly in protest over the arrest of several opposition figures and partly in keeping with a US script worked out to discredit a Maduro victory . As expected , Venezuela 's opposition-controlled National Assembly refused to recognise Maduro 's victory , intensifying the political crisis that culminated in this week 's US-sponsored coup . With the anticipated public and military backing not coming , the coup appears to be falling apart . <p> Why is Venezuela in turmoil despite being the proud possessor of the world 's largest known oil reserves ? One of the reasons is that the socialist economic reforms , to which much of the country 's oil revenue is channelled , do not bring rapid results . Besides , during the Chavez government , Venezuela financed socialist programmes in several neighbouring countries -- part of Chavez 's bid to revive the Bolivarian revolution . This happened at a time when oil prices were rising . During Maduro @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prices took a plunge , adding to the country 's economic woes . <p> But the crisis was also due to US sanctions and US-sponsored subversive measures geared towards bringing about political instability and making Maduro unpopular . Recently , Britain 's Bank of England refused to release US$ 1.2 billion worth of Venezuela 's gold , with which Maduro wanted to revive the economy and provide relief to the people . One wonders whether the Bank of England is also part of the plan to destabilise Venezuela . Even Tuesday 's US sanctions targeting Venezuela 's national oil sector are aimed at aggravating the economic crisis . While the US action is being endorsed by its rightwing allies in the region and even Britain , Germany and France , despite their democracy-promoting boast and opposition to extrajudicial or extra-constitutional means of government change , Russia , China , Cuba , Turkey , and Iran have condemned what they see as a violation of Venezuela 's sovereignty . <p> Washington 's response exposes the regime-change programme in its arsenal to subdue unfriendly nations . The US has many regime change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since the end of World War II . One regime change formula is military intervention , like what happened in Iraq , Libya and several countries in Latin America . Will Trump send troops to Venezuela ? The question looms large after pictures showed that a notepad Trump 's National Security Advisor John Bolton carried to the White House news conference on Tuesday had the words " 5,000 troops to Columbia " scribbled on it . Another regime change method involves military coups . It happened in Iran in 1953 . In Latin America , it happened in more than a dozen countries in keeping with the Truman doctrine of containing communism . <p> In 2002 , it nearly happened in Venezuela . The US fully backed the failed military coup against Chavez 's socialist government that had declared war on the private sector . That the two key plotters had undergone training in the US Army School should be an eye-opener to governments which send troops for training in foreign nations . The coup briefly ousted Chavez , but with the support of loyal troops and people , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years later , addressing the UN General Assembly sessions , Chavez hit back : He described as a devil the then US President George W Bush , who backed the botched coup . " The devil came here yesterday ... it smells of sulphur still today . " <p> Another regime change formula is engineered popular uprisings : Through sanctions and other punitive measures , the US would seek to aggravate the economic crisis of a target country with the intention of triggering a popular uprising against the regime . It worked in Ukraine in 2014 , but failed twice in Iran . Now comes the Trump way : A regime change through the withdrawal of recognition to a government , followed by a declaration recognising a lackey as the legit leader . None of the US regime change formulas has to do with ushering in democracy . Rather , it is about power politics connected with the moves to enhance America 's national interest . In Venezuela 's case , it is about regaining the foothold in the country 's energy and other key sectors which Chavez had nationlised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ConocoPhillips and Total . In the meantime , while democratically elected Maduro is being strangled by US-sponsored overt and covert actions , the worst of dictators enjoy the US blessings . <p> It was only recently that President Trump refused to take any punitive measure against Saudi Arabia for the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi , while Israel continues to be rewarded for its oppression of the Palestinian people . In this regard , it is not out of place here to recall what President Franklin D. Roosevelt is reported to have said in 1939 , when he was asked about the United States ' blind support for Nicaraguan dictator Anastasio Somoza Garcia , known for human rights violations , corruption and collusion with US capitalists who plundered Nicaragua 's gold and other resources . " Somoza may be a son of a bitch , but he is still our son of a bitch . "

@@40616236 <h> Growth of beedi a great source for taxation to enhance State revenue <p> There is need for greater regulation and control of the beedi industry to prevent under-aged smoking and enhance revenue to the State , finds a report released by the Social Development Network ( SDN ) , which adds that the beedi trade can no longer be considered a cottage industry given its extent and reach . <p> A survey carried out by the not-for-profit organisation estimates over 2.5 billion sticks of beedi to be manufactured annually , employing 8,000 families islandwide . This translates to a consumer spend of Rs. 12.5 billion annually on beedi , demonstrating the potential for additional revenue to the Government in the form of tax . <h> SDN President Jeewa Siriwardena ( right ) presents the survey findings <p> Currently , there is no tax on beedis at the point of sale , and the only levy incurred is during the import of tendu leaf used for manufacturing beedi . At Rs. 5a stick , beedis are considerably cheaper than cigarettes , and the addition of a mere Rs. 3would yield the Government over Rs. 7.5 billion in additional revenue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lack of governance and control on the industry and its points of sale . With little or no restrictions governing its sale , SDN encountered many instances of retailers admitting selling beedis to minors , who claim to shuttle sticks for adults . However , at just Rs. 5a stick and no monitoring by authorities , beedis are easily accessible to students who want to have their first taste of smoking and poses a grave threat to future generations and the Government 's objectives to control smoking . <p> In addition , SDN , an organisation that works towards the empowerment of women and children 's rights , asserts that greater attention must be paid on women involved in the trade and the question of family labour involving children in the tobacco trade . <p> " There are over 8,000 families involved in manufacturing beedi , and more than 95% of them are women . However , they are not covered by any form of contract or health and safety standards , and 8,000 forms a significant number of our workforce .

Whilst we do accept that family labour is an essential part of lower income groups and agriculture , their involvement in the tobacco trade must be controlled , " SDN President JeewaSiriwardena said . <p> SDN in its report suggests to bring beedi under the same stringent regulation and focus similar to cigarettes at the point-of-sale to prevent ease-of-access to minors to control under-aged smoking , plus for the Government to urgently consider governance surrounding employment of children as family-labourin the industry and to consider revised levies and pricing to make beedis less affordable to minors . <p> Whilst enhancing rate of cess on tendu imports would prove a straightforward approach , continued and enhanced widespread smuggling of tendu leaf could render this effort counterproductive . Introduction of tax at the point of sale will bring greater revenues , plus , serve as a barrier to under-aged smoking . However , this would prove difficult to monitor and control under the existing mechanism . <p> Customs officials told SDN that large quantities of tenduleaf -- and possibly even finished beedi sticks -- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the airport or even via fishing boats off seas in the northern region , and likely to consist of much larger volumes than what is declared and imported through Customs . <p> " In every country and for every Customs operation , there are certain goods that fall under priority for detection and control and some others that do not , whereby we pay little attention to them .

@@40616237 <p> Taking a stab at controlling monopolies and re-establish competition in paddy markets , the Government yesterday announced it will disburse Rs. 1 billion to small- and medium-scale mill owners to purchase paddy , mill it and resell to cooperative networks countrywide . Non-Cabinet Minister of Economic Reform and Public Distribution Dr. Harsha de Silva told reporters that concerns had been raised about the dominance of large-scale paddy millers , who purchase paddy at low rates , mill it , warehouse it in large quantities , and release it to the market at much higher prices . <p> " The President raised concerns about paddy millers gaining exorbitant profits , and wanted us to address this problem . Public Distribution was a ministry we established to deal with problems like this , where market discrepancies are creating issues . This decision is the result of six months of consultations with all stakeholders , including millers , farmers , and banks . We even had talks with Dudley Sirisena , " he said . <p> Following discussions with over 300 small- and medium-scale mill owners , the Government decided to temporarily intervene in the market by releasing Rs. 1 billion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ metric tonnes of rice . President Maithripala Sirisena had presented the Cabinet paper that had received approval on Tuesday . Currently , about 40% of the paddy output is purchased by large-scale millers , and about 10% by the Government . With the Rs. 1 billion , small- and medium-scale paddy millers plan to purchase about 20% of the harvest . <p> Under the new scheme , which is implemented with the participation of the Sri Lanka Rice Producers Cooperative Limited ( Rice-Corp Sri Lanka ) , most of the small- and medium-scale millers have been organised into cooperatives spread out across eight key Districts . These cooperatives will be given funds by the Government and they will release money under agreement to the millers who are their members . The millers will then use the funds to purchase paddy from the farmers , mill it and resell it to the cooperatives . In the last step , the cooperatives will sell the rice to consumers . The process will be strictly monitored via an IT platform , which would also have Agriculture Ministry oversight . <p> " When markets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ failures . What happens then , is sometimes Government failure happens , which is worse than market failure . What we are trying to do is make sure we put in place a set of policies where we try to reactivate competition in the market , so that we can rectify market failure without creating a Government failure . The reason there is an oligopoly structure in the paddy milling market is because competition was killed off over a period of years . We are trying to resuscitate the small- and medium-scale mill owners , so that will help both the farmer and the consumer , " Dr. de Silva said . He insisted that the latest measure was not an interventionist attempt . <p> According to Rice-Crop Sri Lanka Chairman Muditha Perera , many small- and medium-scale millers dropped out of the industry since 2000 due to weather problems , price controls , and ad-hoc rice imports . The depletion of the small- and medium-scale millers allowed large-scale millers to consolidate their presence in the market , thereby leading to a situation where the large-scale millers could artificially hike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are involved there is more competition . This Rs. 1 billion gives us the chance to restart our businesses . We expect this effort to stabilise prices and perhaps provide a price decrease to the consumer . Prices could drop by about Rs. 10 and remain around the Rs. 80-Rs. 90 per kilo range , " Perera said . <p> Perera stated that many of the millers went bankrupt as they were unable to repay bank loans , and efforts were being made to appeal to banks to restructure those loans , so they could be repaid over a longer period of time .

However , the details for the KOL campaign are to be worked out . <p> Along with the promotional campaign , new measures are being taken to ensure quality is maintained in all tea exports .

" -- William Butler Yeats <p> Today ( April 17 ) I heard a NPR " news " report that described the democratically elected president of Venezuela as " the Venezuelan dictator Maduro . " By repeating over and over that a democratically elected president is a dictator , the presstitutes create that image of Maduro in the minds of vast numbers of peoples who know nothing about Venezuela and had never heard of Maduro until he is dropped on them as " dictator . " <p> Nicolas Maduro Moros was elected president of Venezuela in 2013 and again in 2018 . Previously he served as vice president and foreign minister , and he was elected to the National Assembly in 2000 . Despite Washington 's propaganda campaign against him and Washington 's attempt to instigate violent street protests and Maduro @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been offered large sums of money , Maduro has the overwhelming support of the people , and the military has not moved against him . <p> What is going on is that American oil companies want to recover their control over the revenue streams from Venezuela 's vast oil reserves . Under the Bolivarian Revolution of Chavez , continued by Maduro , the oil revenues instead of departing the country have been used to reduce poverty and raise literacy inside Venezuela . <p> The opposition to Maduro inside Venezuela comes from the elites who have been traditionally allied with Washington in the looting of the country . These corrupt elites , with the CIA 's help , temporarily overthrew Chavez , but the people and the Venezuelan military secured his release and return to the presidency . <p> Washington has a long record of refusing to accept any reformist governments in Latin America . Reformers get in the way of North America 's exploitation of Latin American countries and are overthrown . <p> With the exceptions of Venezuela , Bolivia , Cuba , and Nicaragua , Latin America consists of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reform governments in Honduras , Argentina and Brazil and put gangsters in charge . <p> According to US national security adviser John Bolton , a neoconservative war monger , the governments in Venezuela , Cuba , and Nicaragua will soon be overthrown . New sanctions have now been placed on the three countries . Washington in the typical display of its pettiness targeted sanctions against the son of the Nicaraguan president Daniel Ortega . <p> Ortega has been the leader of Nicaragua since for 40 years . He was president 1985-1990 and has been elected and reelected as president since 2006 . <p> Ortega was the opponent of Somoza , Washington 's dictator in Nicaragua . Consequently he and his movement were attacked by the neoconservative operation known as Iran-Contra during the Reagan years . Ortega was a reformer . His government focused on literacy , land reform , and nationalization , which was at the expense of the wealthy ruling class . He was labeled a " Marxist-Leninist , " and Washington attempted to discredit his reforms as controversial leftist policies . <p> Somehow Castro and Ortega survived Washington @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teeth so did Chavez unless you believe it was the CIA that gave him cancer . Castro and Chavez are dead . Ortega is 74 . Maduro is in trouble , because Washington has stolen Venezuela 's bank deposits and cut Venezuela off the international financial system , and the British have stolen Venezuela 's gold . This makes it hard for Venezuela to pay its debts . <p> The Trump regime has branded the democratically twice-elected Maduro an " illegitimate " president . Washington has found a willing puppet , Juan Guaido to take Maduro 's place and has announced that the puppet is now the president of Venezuela . No one among the Western presstitutes or among the vassals of Washington 's empire finds it strange that an elected president is illegitimate but one picked by Washington is not . <p> Russia and China have given Maduro diplomatic support . Both have substantial investments in Venezuela that would be lost if Washington seizes the country .

Where is the shame when the highest American government officials stand up in front of the world and openly proclaim that it is official US government policy to overthrow democratically elected governments simply because those governments do n't let Americans plunder their countries . <p> How is it possible that Pompeo can announce that the " days are numbered " of the elected president of Nicaragua , who has been elected president 3 or 4 times , and the world not see the US as a rogue state that must be isolated and shunned ? How can Pompeo describe Washington 's overthrow of an elected government as " setting the Nicaraguan people free ?

The targets were Christians and foreign nationalities to get the maximum global attention . <p> Sri Lanka is a geo strategically blessed paradise island @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my book further outlines ) . This is due to its internal disarray of politics and external geopolitics . Countries facing an existential threat for a long period of time tend to become a ' national security state ' according to John J.Mearsheimer . Out of its 71 years of independence , Sri Lanka has fought a brutal terrorist war for almost 30 years . Today there is another phase of terrorism : violent extremism . <p> Certain liberal values introduced by the present government made our nation vulnerable and a soft target for terrorist to breed and function . What was seen by the West as an autocratic state under Rajapaksa was reset overnight , tagging Sri Lanka to a global liberal order . This was done at the expense of an ensured demilitarization and the complete dismantling and weakening of the country 's military apparatus . <p> It brought prosperity to individuals without understanding the setbacks of liberalism . The principal of liberalism was confused with nationalism . Some policy makers saw one against the other to push agendas forward . <p> Many extra regional nations came forward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our national security . Noncooperation with some powerful nations may lead to the assumption that certain powerful nations may have used a backdoor to enter the island using terror . <p> Cardinal Malcolm Ranjith explained at a press conference warning that " powerful nations could be behind these attacks " . It is an urgent area for Sri Lankan national security to invest in serious research and investigation . This lacuna is due to the lack of support by certain policy makers . A glance at the support extended to Sri Lanka 's national security think tank will reveal its rank on the State 's list of priorities . The ' National Defence Policy ' is the leading document capturing all threats . It remains a classified document inside a cupboard for three years . None of the policy makers bothered to take this forward . <p> The National Security think tank ( INSSSL ) at its internal Ministry of Defence discussion held in 2017 March identified the threat of extremism that could trigger in Sri Lanka and documented in its monthly threat forecast written in March and October of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 100 detonators and explosives in the West coast of the Island . How did such warnings go unheard ? <p> This gross negligence was clearly due to the malfunction of processes within the government , perhaps due to political meddling within intelligence agencies and political division . The consequence is devastating and has dragged the entire nation to a " state of fear " , taking more than 350 innocent lives . <p> When the state can not manage the consequence of an extremist act , extremism presents a clear threat to national security . Extremist groups can operate in emerging democracies , while also finding operational space in failed or failing states . Post war Sri Lanka was a soft target for extremist to creep in due to the political instability with two sets of instructions flowing in from the bipartisan government . I have indicated multiple times the grave danger to national security from the existing political instability of the country . <p> It was not even a month ago when President Trump announced , " we just took over 100% of the IS caliphate , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bullet was fired in the IS held Syrian town of Baghouz , on the banks of the Euphrates River . Lina Khatib , an expert from Chatham House , UK who analyzed the victory of the U.S. , British , and French-backed Kurdish and Arab coalition , said , " The group itself has not been eradicated , ... The ideology of IS is still very much at large . " She states that IS will revert to its insurgent roots as it moves underground , using the territorial loss as a call to arms among its network of supporters . <p> Joseph Votel , the top American general in the Middle East , warned : " ( The caliphate ) still has leaders , still has fighters , it still has facilitators , it still has resources , so our continued military pressure is necessary to continue to go after that network . " <p> In the same manner Prof. Rohan Gunaratna , the international terrorist expert , analyzed how this spilled over to Sri Lankan attack . He stated , " With a vengeance , the returnees from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ homelands responded to the call by the IS leadership to avenge Baghouz , the last IS stronghold . The indoctrinated personalities and cells attacked Buddhist shrines and broke Buddha images . " <p> At least 41,490 international citizens traveled to Syria and Iraq to join ISIS , according to ICSR ; this is at least 50 each month . A total of 41 Sri Lankan Muslims from two extended families travelled to Iraq and Syria . There were many individuals who migrated as refugees to Sri Lanka from Muslim nations in the last several years . <p> The members of the IS branch that staged the attacks in Sri Lanka believed in martyrdom . They were educated and mostly from upper middle-class families . This is a different scale and complexity of threat when compared to the LTTE threat . The extremist bombers were calm . One bomber even gently holds a child just before his suicide . This shows they were well trained for months and perhaps years . <p> Some see this as a retaliation to the Christchurch attack , which took place last month . The Christchurch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the attack . It was used by a political leader to win popular support , which will further divide the Christian and Muslim communities in the same way as President Trump 's Muslim ban did soon after his victory . The danger in such populist acts by politicians will further polarize and lead towards a clash among two great civilizations . <p> ISIS tentacles reached NTJ in Sri Lanka in 2017 , among another group globally . The spillover from the Baghouz defeat affected Sri Lanka , the Island nation who was at the top of tourism , ready to participate for Belt and Road 2nd Forum and celebrate its 10 years of success in eradicating terrorism this May . <p> The Sri Lankan attack was the single largest killing in a day by a terrorist outfit in the Island 's history . Despite sophisticated security services the nation possessed during the three-decade battle , there were intelligence and security limitations . It was ' a gross national security negligence ' that the entire nation fell victim to . The answer for this could be seen as intelligence information was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ endemic security failures were in plain sight , even in the United States over the 9/11 attacks . The CIA found that available intelligence did not flow to political decision makers . <p> Despite multiple warnings from Indian intelligence before the attacks took place , the extremist cell NTJ was identified months and years before by the Islamic community leaders as a threat . <p> Steps to Strengthening Military Intelligence : <p> The Sri Lankan government will have to develop several immediate steps first to strengthen military intelligence and the handling of cross border intelligence sharing among other nations as this sort of terrorism require a multi-pronged , multi-jurisdictional approach . Secondly , it is necessary to protect our vulnerable communities who could be targeted through the spreading misinformation and disinformation in the social media , which could lead to communal riots . Religious leaders have a great role in promoting religious harmony in this environment . <p> Third , while operational intelligence on arresting the perpetrators will go on , the analysis of intelligence data will be an important step to understand the real root cause behind the attack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ negligence should be done by the government to understand where the limitations had come from , and should be addressed immediately . The accountability of negligence has to be pointed out and those responsible should be charged or fired . Finally , external support from other nations should be taken only for intelligence sharing and building capacity to combat extremism , and not to sign any other security agreements that could have security implications in the long run . <p> In the coming months , the deradicalization of the radicalized youth will be another essential part we would need to invest in . The government and civil society will have a massive duty on managing the spreading of hatred and division among different ethnic and religious groups . <p> A collective effort from society will be necessary to defeat extremism . <p> Just as the manner in which the Sri Lankan Muslim society assisted to defeat the LTTE , they will assist to defeat extremism within the island .

That is the best we can hope for at this point in time . The bomb blasts and insecure conditions have setback the economy . It has not devastated it . The task is not one of economic reconstruction .

They are not sufficient conditions for economic development . A host of other conditions are needed for the economy to take off to a higher trajectory pf growth . It is because these conditions were lacking that the country 's post independent economic growth averaged only around 3.5 percent . In the last four years it dipped even below that long term average owing to economic and non-economic conditions not being conducive to growth . <p> Policies <p> The lack of clear and certain economic policies , a weak capacity to implement economic policies , inability to undertake essential economic reforms and corruption have been among the main reasons for slow economic growth . This incapacity has led to the country being the one left behind in South Asia 's economic growth of over twice our attainment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after a stable and capable government is established after the next elections .

It also extended the arrangement by an additional year , until June 2 , 2020 , with the re-phasing of remaining disbursements . <p> The release of the US$ 164.1 million is a small amount . Yet it is of significance in reinforcing international confidence . Its decision to release the funds was probably motivated by the sympathy it had for the country owing to the terrorist attack . <p> Good report <p> The IMF also gave a good report on the economy .

The government 's primary obligation of ensuring peace and security is the foremost precondition . Now that this is ensured and the life of the nation is normal , economic growth should gain momentum in the second half of the year . There is a need to catch up lost production in the months ahead . <p> Peak production <p> Both agriculture and manufactures should produce at their peak possibilities .

The optics of the image released to the public when the Bodu Bala Sena 's Galagoda atte Gnanasara and his mother met President Maithripala Sirisena following his pardoning while serving a prison sentence for contempt of court said it best , smiles and merry laughter all around as it were . <p> The discarding of ' good governance ' niceties <p> This presidential pardon must be read for what it is , with no frills and furbelows to obscure the core point . Clearly it is an unequivocal signal that ' good governance ' niceties have been discarded in what is essentially , a battle for political survival in an election year . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hoarse on the palpable affront to Sri Lanka 's judicial institution that this pardon most certainly denotes but let us unflinchingly recognize ugly realities in all their permutations and combinations . Indeed , by keeping silent on this remarkable pardon , the United National Party shifting uneasily in their government seats while trading insults with the President and his men , has also communicated that very same message . <p> The monk had been sentenced for insulting the Bench in the most horrendous manner possible . But this pardon reduces that fact to a frivolous bagatelle of no worthy account . For those of us with short memories , it may be instructive to recall precisely what the Court of Appeal pronounced in handing down the punishment late last year . This was consequent to the monk 's barging into the hearing of a habeas corpus petition in the Homagama Magistrate 's Court filed in respect of the disappearance of cartoonist Prageeth Ekneligoda during the Rajapaksa years and haranguing the magistrate and the state counsel as eunuchs . <p> In exceptionally stern language , the Appeal Court pointed to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ court hearing with no standing to appear , had ' addressed ' the Bench without express or implied permission , intending to ' intimidate ' the magistrate into granting bail to the suspect intelligence officers after the magistrate had already refused to do so . His ' address ' to the magistrate was in a high tone , heard ' even by those waiting away from the court room ' and in ' abusive , offensive and commanding ' language . In doing so and in saying that this was the ' white person 's law ' and that he did not accept that law , he had tried to coerce the Bench into obeying his commands and to reverse an already pronounced Order . <p> Pious statements and past reprehensible conduct <p> The Court observed that whether the law is foreign-made or locally-made , it is the ' prevailing law that the courts have to apply ' and that ' the Court will administer justice according to such law irrespective of its genesis . ' The accused 's behavior was assessed as degrading the honour and the Court , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deserving therefore of the most stringent response . Later and upon an appeal being filed against the appellate court order , that judicial position was upheld by majority decision in the Supreme Court . Effectively therefore , a punishment affirmed by the apex court in the country has been tossed aside by the Office of the President as mere trivia . This is made worse by the fact that the presidential pardon has been granted after a mere few months of the sentence being served . <p> So the controversial monk 's pious injunction to the public soon after his release this week that ' everyone must work prudently and responsibly ' contrasts oddly with his behavior resulting in the sentence for contempt of court in the first place . For this was conduct that was neither prudent or responsible by any standard whatsoever . In fact , his unpardonable behavior before the Homagama Magistrate 's Court was the very least of those wrongs . This was on the heels of even more riotous conduct hardly befitting his robes , to put the matter mildly . An ugly cacophony of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Muslims with no perceptible differentiation between the innocent and the guilty . <p> Indeed the very violence of that behaviorresulted in warnings issued by the Bodu Bala Sena in regard to the spread of Wahabism in Sri Lanka not being taken with the seriousness that was perchance warranted . If even the part serving of a jail sentence has resulted in the correction of past reprehensible conduct , that is to the good . But dogged skepticism prevents any such assumptions being made in good faith . Ultimately therefore , this pardon by the President , in the wake of increased insecurity of the country 's Muslim community following communal violence politically instigated in Minuwangoda and Kurunegala following the Easter Sunday attacks on Christian and Catholic churches and high-end hotels in Colombo will be read by many as a non too subtle signal to the country 's ethnic and religious minorities ; behave or the ( literal ) barbarians will be at your gates . Unsurprisingly , wary apprehension has been heightened , increasing the persecution complex felt by Sri Lanka 's Muslim community . <p> A series of diverting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ atrocities therefore , we are faced with diverting and distracting side events . The smoke and ashes of that fateful day had hardly faded away before we saw organised violence against Muslims in Minuwangoda and Kurunegala . Now we have the pardon of a convicted monk known for tirades against the Muslim minority and to boot , a Joint Opposition no-confidence motion competing for primacy with a Government supported Parliamentary Select Committee hearing on Minister Rishad Bathiudeen . <p> Others who face similar allegations of instigating Wahabi radicalism , including the Governor of the Eastern Province who , along with his son , is implicated in a so-called Shariah University in the East escape unscathed . Quite apart from the disturbing scent of a politically motivated witch hunt in the baying of the Joint Opposition for Bathiudeen 's blood , probably as fitting revenge for not joining their ranks in the ill fated and short lived ' political coup ' last year , why is the Parliament tasked with ascertaining his guilt or innocence as the case may be ? <p> If that is the case , for what earthly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Previously , a Tamil Minister was accused of making statements in support of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam ( LTTE ) in addressing a public meeting in the North and the criminal law was moved against her following consultations with the Attorney General .

That must manifestly be the common purpose .

@@41028237 <h> Leaders who bait &amp; whip people into a frenzy do not deserve our sympathy : Mangala <p> For as long as Sri Lanka has been an independent and sovereign nation , our people have been torn between two opposing political forces . This is the battle between the politics of unity and politics of division . To unite peoples across religious , ethnic and geographical lines requires moral courage and national vision . Unfortunately , many who have aspired to leadership roles in politics , the clergy and business have , far too often , taken the short cut of trying to gain or retain their power and influence by seeking to divide our people . <p> Some like the LTTE have tried to carve our country in two among ethnic and geographical lines . More recently , the radical Islamic cult of Zahran Hashim and ISIS sought to set the country on fire by igniting themselves , hundreds of innocent civilians and communities . All Sri Lankans condemn this unspeakable brutality . Our country owes the victims of these attacks an incalculable debt . Their grief is eternal , and the UNP will stand with them until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are not the only forces who have succumbed to the temptation to lead Sri Lankans by dividing and not uniting . In 1983 , several national leaders were guilty of , at minimum , turning a blind eye to heinous persecution of innocent Tamil civilians who were made to pay the price for crimes committed by the LTTE . During the 1989 insurrection , extremists ruthlessly killed civilians of all faiths and ethnicities . The government 's crackdown on their brutality was so heinous that none other than Mahinda Rajapaksa went to Geneva to seek international intervention to protect the human rights of Sri Lankan citizens . <p> In recent years , Sri Lankans have made many strides towards a more united country . For every step forward we take , the stark reality is that there will always be those whose political survival depends on dragging the country backwards and trying to divide us along sectarian lines . It can not be said too many times that most Tamils had nothing to do with the LTTE , most Sinhalese did not support the JVP insurrections , most Muslims abhor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and other Christians are disgusted by the attempts of a few to legitimize a racist and religiously motivated witch hunt . <p> At the forefront of this witch hunt , attempting to hijack our criminal justice system with sectarian fairytales about forced sterilizations and terrorists lurking under every kufi , are the same men of the cloth who before 2015 led mobs to burn innocent shopkeepers alive . Standing in solidarity with this hatred are those who committed the cardinal sin of remaining silent while these same mobs attacked and set alight evangelical churches with the tacit blessing of the last regime . These laymen and clergy do not represent the vast majority of followers of their faith , who want only to live together in peace and harmony . <p> But there is a clear and present danger in ethnic peace and harmony . It is not a danger to the country or to its people , but a danger to certain politicians , media institutions , political movements and clergymen . In a united Sri Lanka , where Muslims do n't fear Buddhists , where Sinhalese do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they would become irrelevant . <p> When a political party , media organization or religious leader depends for their survival on one group of Sri Lankans becoming afraid of another , we must be wary of them . When their survival depends on highlighting what divides us and undermining what unites us , we must be wary of them . What role is there for them in a Sri Lanka in which Sinhalese women were not afraid of lurking Muslim doctors waiting to sterilize them , and instead choose their doctor without regard to religion . What role is there for them in a Sri Lanka where a Christian need not be tempted to convert to Buddhism to succeed in politics ? What role is there for them in a Sri Lanka where your religion or ethnicity does not play a role in your employment , housing or marriage prospects ? <p> What these people do not want you to know is that in such a Sri Lanka , they would have no role . No one would vote for them . No one would worship with them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listen to them . That is why they try to frighten us . That is why they try to divide us . That is why they mercilessly and ruthlessly target anyone who would try to unite us . They do n't care what faith a person belongs to , or whom they support , so long as you are on their side . <p> Everyone should know how Rishard Bathurdeen earned the ire of the Podujana Peramuna and its minions among the media and the clergy . When they tried to illegally overthrow the government last October 26 , they pleaded with this very same so-called terrorist Rishard Bathurdeen to join their government . They tried bribing him . They tried threatening him . But Rishard Bathurdeen refused to support an illegal government . <p> Mark my words . Had he supported Mahinda Rajapaksa in Parliament last year , there would not have been a no-confidence motion against him . He would not be called a terrorist . There would be a new target . Even today he is being cajoled to join the other side in exchange for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a man who served as a Cabinet Minister under them for almost a decade , who we are supposed to believe suddenly became a terrorist overnight after he stood by the UNP and by democracy . <p> The irony of the no-confidence motion being brought against this man is that it is being championed by Parliamentarians who clung to power for a whole month after their illegal government last year was defeated in not one , not two but three consecutive no-confidence motions . When they saw that they could not get their way , the whole country and the world watched as they tried to terrorise Parliament on 16 November 2018 . <p> Every elected and appointed official in our country has sworn an oath to uphold and defend a Constitution that does not give power to politicians , priests or social media platforms to decide who is guilty or innocent of any crime , including terrorism . That is a sacred duty left to our judges , after a police investigation and fair trial . <p> In a country with such a proud tradition of justice , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proven guilty , people including a cabinet minister have been declared guilty without evidence , and the police have literally invited public complaints against these targeted four individuals in order to find them guilty of something -- anything . Racists and xenophobes have hijacked our justice system and literally turned it upside down . <p> If Rishard Bathurdeen or anyone else has committed a crime , there is a process for a criminal investigation to commence , for evidence against them to be presented before courts and for justice to take its course . If they are guilty , they should be punished . Especially in the current context , our police and security forces have unprecedented autonomy to investigate and prosecute anyone remotely connected to these attacks . <p> But never in the history of our country have people first been declared guilty by the press and in Parliament , only to thereafter have the police call for evidence that they may have committed a crime . Today the targets are Muslim leaders being accused of terrorism . Who will tomorrow 's targets be ? What will they be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no one will be safe from this kind of mob lynching . <p> In a way , we must sympathize with those Sri Lankans on the street who have taken the bait fed to them by their political and religious leaders and are driven to violence by fear and a carefully nurtured sense of hatred . Even those people who cursed my parents for my actions must be doing so because they have been programmed to be afraid of anyone who dared question the leaders of their tribe . <p> These leaders who bait and whip them into a frenzy do not deserve our sympathy . Whether they sit in Parliament , call themselves clergymen , print newspapers or use our airwaves , they know what they are doing when stir up mobs against each other . Especially at a time when our marshals , generals and admirals are appealing to us to keep the peace , it is devastating to see politicians , religious leaders and media moguls trying to incite racial and religious hatred that could drive us into another war . <p> I have no doubt that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ principle and fighting for a united Sri Lanka . As for those who are trying to set our country on fire , it is their children , and great grandchildren who will one day be forced to reckon with and disavow their dirty deeds . No lie can live forever , and someday the whole country will see through their self-serving duplicity . <p> To the vast majority of Sri Lankans of all faiths , ethnicities and political orientations , it is our turn to speak up before it is too late . If you abhor terrorism , the act of using violence or the threat of violence to achieve a political objective , you must speak up . If you believe that evidence of a crime must be put before a judge by the police and prosecutors before someone can be pronounced guilty , you must speak up .

Wasala Courtesy The Island <p> Today Sri Lanka is facing , arguably its worst survival crisis since independence , following the two armed JVP insurrections ( 1971 and 1986-90 ) and the long drawn out armed LTTE separatism ( 1976-2009 ) , both terrorist movements . A considerable number of good but ill-informed or misinformed young Sri Lankans believe that the past seven decades of independence have seen nothing but a steady degradation of the country as a nation ( in terms of governance , economy , and social standards , etc. ) due to something intrinsically wrong with the established ( political ) system and the alleged depravity of all the politicians of the country having been given to corruption and abuse of power without any exception . But the truth is that there were and there still are good honest politicians , though they have traditionally been surrounded by a host of very bad ones . See how the worst characters who were close to former president Mahinda Rajapaksa and abused his inborn kindness and rather naive trust in them as a cover for their dishonest practices have now decamped to the government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ videos to sling mud at him and his brother Gotabhaya . <p> A series of mudslinging videos due to be launched in the social media on the 14th and 15th against Gotabhaya , as some Joint Opposition MPs have already forewarned , is an indication of the utter despair and frustration of his opponent 's camp . Such tactics are bound to earn the disapproval of the politically literate Sri Lankan electorate , and will ultimately turn out to be counterproductive for the perpetrators . Already , a few of the bigwigs of the government have been caught red-handed and exposed through the media . Large sums money from local or foreign sources ( more likely from the latter ) are suspected to have been spent on this . One can reasonably wonder what they have done other than Rajapaksa bashing for the past five years . The speakers on government campaign platforms sound as if they are the Opposition and try to absolve themselves of all wrongdoing , meanwhile transferring all blame to MR . In other countries , m ud-slinging is usually indulged in by opposition elements against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is different . <p> The speeches that the UNP presidential candidate makes and the obviously impractical election promises he dangles before audiences suggest that he has strategically forgotten that he is a powerful minister of the government with the ability to have demonstrated his credibility ( if he has any and if he wants to ) by actually doing something about at least some of the problems that he pledges himself to solving ( like looking into what is happening at Muhudu Maha Viharaya and Kuragala , or by doing something constructive about it or by ensuring that the impoverished workers on the Upcountry tea estates get the Rs 1000 daily payment they have been demanding for so long ) . <p> Belittling of the country 's past achievements by his secret promoters is another mean tactic . Sri Lanka has succeeded in introducing a number of positive changes through parliamentary democracy under both the original UNP- and SLFP-led governments , the most conspicuous of these being those made in 1956 , 1970 , 1978 , 1994 and 2009 . ( The regime change engineered with foreign involvement in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had had until then can not be included in this list . ) The negative assessment that Sri Lanka made no progress because of the depravity of politicians , therefore , is not totally valid , though superficially it may appeal to the young sections of the electorate who tend to generalize on the basis of what they have been experiencing in the name of ' good governance ' during the past four and a half years . That is , this most pessimistic verdict on post-independence politics up until now is largely a reaction to the Yahapalanaya , which may be described as an absolute kakistocracy ( rule by the worst people ) unmatched by any government that ruled before . Paradoxically , the indiscriminate judgement might make the democratic dislodgement of the most undemocratic and corrupt administration ever in post-independence Sri Lanka more difficult than it should be in the prevailing circumstances and it is being slyly promoted by the Yahapalanaya 's erstwhile supporters who are hellbent on preventing the patriotic forces now poised to replace it from doing so . <p> Patriotic forces have a clear vision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ especially appealing to the tech-savvy young generation . Their concern is with the survival of the Sri Lankan state as a vibrant single entity . Their opponents are only worried about their own survival in politics .

Today , Sikhism is the fifth largest organized religion with 30 million followers across the globe . <p> The anniversary was marked by the historic opening of a corridor across the India-Pakistan border to link a famous Sikh shrine in Kartarpur in Pakistan with another in Dera Baba Nanak in India . <p> The opening ceremonies , which were held in India and Pakistan separately , were presided over by the Prime Minister of India , Narendra Modi , and his Pakistan counterpart , Imran Khan . <p> Guru Nanak was a poet , a religious teacher , and a social reformer who preached that God is one , omniscient , omnipotent , omnipresent , and beyond all form and name . His thought that ' All men are equal ' led to a social doctrine which was against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or financial status . <p> Stayed In Lanka For More Than Two Years <p> Guru Nanak spread his faith through incessant travels . He was not stationary , expecting devotees to come to him . He reached out to the common man in their fields and humble abodes , eschewing existing places of worship . <p> Apart from traversing the length and breadth of North India , the Guru , who hailed from the present-day State of Punjab , had visited South India and then crossed over to Sri Lanka also . <p> It is believed that he stayed in the island of Singhla Deep " for almost two and half years as a guest of the Kotte King Dharma Parakramabhu IX and his co-regent Vijayabahu VII whose given or original name , according to Sikh chronicles , was Shivnabh or Shivnabin . <p> According to the renowned South Indian historian , Dr.V.Raghavan , there was at least one epigraphic evidence to show that Guru Nanak had visited Sri Lanka in the fifteenth year of the reign of Parakramabahu IX . The saint 's name is given as Jnanakacharya " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1969 , Dr.Raghavan said that although most of the names mentioned in the Sikh accounts did not find a place in actual historical records , the possibility of Guru Nanak having come to Sri Lanka could not be ruled out . Religious leaders and traders from various parts of India , including the Punjab , were visiting South India and Sri Lanka regularly at the time . And Sinhalese kings were in close touch with India , following many Indian customs and practices , and being open to Indian influences in various spheres . <p> The epigraphic evidence Dr.Raghavan was alluding to , was given in 1969 by Dr. Saddamangala Karunaratna , an Assistant Commissioner of Archeology in Sri Lanka . In his paper , Guru Nanak and Ceylon " presented at the International Seminar on the Life and Teachings of Guru Nanak at the Punjabi University , Patiala held in September 1969 , Dr. Karunaratna referred of an original writing on a slab numbered M-111 " which was kept in the Archeological Museum at Anuradhapura . The writing mentions Nanakacharya 's visit to Sri Lanka . <p> Quoting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dr. Dalvinder Singh Grewal , says that the writing contains a passage in Sanskrit which is said to have been written on the orders of the Jayavardana Kotte King Dharama Prakrambahu IX . In the fifteenth year of the reign of Dharama Parkarambahu IX , Jnanakacharya , a divine person from abroad , had visited Jayavardhana Kotte . <p> The saint was propagating a new faith . He met the ruler and explained to him the tenets of his faith . The king is said to have promised to embrace the new faith , provided he defeated his Sangharaja , Dharamakriti-sthavira in a debate on a religious doctrine . <p> A public meeting was arranged in front of the palace , where a debate on Ishvara and the Soul was held between Jnankacharya and Dharamakriti-sthavira . Guru Nanak defeated the Sangharaja . After the defeat of Dharamakriti-sthavira , Jnanankacharya asked the King to keep his promise to accept the new faith . But the king said that he would be able to give a reply only after confirming the result of the debate . <p> Guru Nanak 's travels in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the royal court found out that the faith of Jnanakacharya emphasized monotheism and rejected idol-worship and the caste-system . The Brahmins , whose religion was wedded to the caste hierarchy , did not relish the idea of their King embracing Jnanakacharya 's new faith . They approached Dharamadhvaja-Pandita , a scholar of Sanskrit , Pali , Hinduism and Buddhism , and got him to challenge Jnanakacarya for a debate . <p> A public debate was again arranged . The subject was idol worship . At the end of the debate the customary voting took place . But the result was manipulated to make Dharamadhvaja-Pandita the winner . Jnanakacarya had no option to leave left Jayavardhanpura . According to Dr Karunaratna Jnanakcarya was none other than Nanakacharya or Guru Nanak . <p> The story about how Guru Nanak decided to come to Sri Lanka is quite interesting . Mansukh , a trader from Lahore in Punjab , who was a follower of Guru Nanak , had visited Sri Lanka earlier on trading missions . King Shivnabh was very impressed by the trader 's devotion to the Guru and was eager @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was at the request of this trader , that Guru Nanak visited Sri Lanka , Dr.Grewal writes . <p> According to another legend , King Shivnabh used to observe fast onIkadashi ( first of each lunar month ) and forced his citizens to follow the practice . Those who did not were punished . Trader Mansukh did not fast . Instead he used to sing Nanak 's hymns and distributedPrasad . The king arrested him and asked him to explain his conduct . <p> In his defense , the Punjabi trader said that his Guru had taught him those who ate less and worshipped God , observedlkadashievery day . Intrigued , wanted to know who the Guru was . The trader said he was Nanak from Kartarpur . The king then said , I wish to see Guru Nanak . How can I see him ?

Writing in sikhnet.com , Dr.Grewal says that Guru Nanak along with Bhai Mardana and other Sikhs visited and stayed at this place for over three months . The people of the village told Dr. Kipral Singh of Punjabi University , Patiala , who had visited the place in September 1968 , that about 450 years ago a Siddha Baba from Northern India , had visited this place . The village of Kurukkalmadam was established in memory of the Siddha Baba .

@@61477233 <h> By : A.A.M.NIZAM -- MATARA <p> It has become very clear now that the Swiss drama was a deliberate hoax enacted by neo-liberal western powers , the UNP and the LTTE terrorists to discredit and malign the new Sri Lanka government headed by President Gotabhaya Rajapaksa. just one week after it came to power to Political columns of both the Island " abd Sunhday Times " have posted details relating to Swiss threats made to the new government to force to acquiesce to its dictates and make it collapse before it started its programmes . <p> The Island columnist C.A.Chandraprema ( CAC ) states that Sri Lanka can never expect fair play from Switzerland as it is more pro-LTTE than most other Western countries and points out recent actions by Swiss authorities which include court ruling saying that the Tamil Tigers are not a criminal organization , acquitting 12 LTTE activists who had been charged with sending 15 million Swiss Francs collected from the Sri Lankan community in Switzerland during the war and about the sophisticated system being maintained by Swiss LTTE to raise funds from the Tamil community in Switzerland . <p> CAC further points out that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sri Lanka are on the alert for attempts to revive the LTTE and the whole world is on alert with regard to any kind of terrorist activity because terrorism is the scourge of the modern world , Switzerland has justified terrorist attacks if it is to seek separate independent state . They have decriminalized the collecting of funds in Switzerland for terrorist attacks on Sri Lanka and refuses even to consider the LTTE to be a criminal group even though the FBI categorized the LTTE as the deadliest terrorist organization in the world in 2008 . <p> Although the LTTE military machine was smashed by Sri Lanka in 2009 , its international networks still remains intact and still poses a direct threat to countries like Sri Lanka , India and Malaysia . The Swiss government however actively promotes LTTE terrorism and provides a safe haven for LTTE terrorists on Swiss soil . This is the background in which this entire abduction drama had taken place . <p> Gania Barrister Frncis alias Sriyalatha Perera <p> A statement issued by the the Swiss Federal Department of Foreign Affairs on this hoax drama @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Swiss Embassy in Colombo has today been detained on the grounds that she allegedly made false statement sand they calls on the Sri Lankan judicial authorities to ensure better protection of its employee 's personal rights in any further proceedings and compliance with national law and international standards . <p> * The local employee has reported that she had been abducted in Colombo to force her to disclose embassy-related information . <p> * The staffer was subjected to a 30-hour interrogation and was subjected over three days despite being in poor health . <p> * They expect the Sri Lankan law enforcement authorities to comply with national law and international judicial standards and to ensure that the employee 's rights are now better protected and it calls on the Sri Lankan authorities to meet their obligations under applicable law and give due consideration to the employee 's poor state of health . <p> * That in this high-profile case Sri Lanka 's reputation as a country that upholds the rule of law is at stake . <p> The Swiss government prior to its dealings with Sri Lanka on this case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ facilitating them to publish an article highly critical of Sri Lanka under the title " Sri Lankan Critics Fear a Crackdown Is Underway , and Some Flee " on November 27 before we Sri Lankans knew anything about this alleged incident . The said article has quoted the Swiss foreign ministry as its source . Extracted details and comments on the article will follow . <p> CAC explains that the Swiss embassy took nearly two weeks after the incident to present the alleged victim for a medical examination to be carried out and for a statement to be recorded . During that entire period she was held incommunicado in the Swiss embassy in Colombo and there is no word about that in the Swiss government 's statement . Even though the Swiss authorities have condemned the 30-hours of interrogation to which the employee was subjected over three days despite allegedly being in poor health , the Swiss have not explained why this person who was supposedly in poor health was kept inside the Swiss embassy instead of being given medical help for nearly two weeks . <p> He further states @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be recorded , the Swiss embassy retained possession of the alleged victim 's and her husband 's phone and a court order had to be obtained asking the embassy to give that phone and the sim cards to the CID and there are no reports to say that the Swiss embassy has complied with this order . CAC states that wee have to hope that the Swiss Embassy will not do to those phones and SIM cards what Hillary Clinton had done to her phones and SIM cards -- the FBI found that they had been smashed to bits with hammers ! <p> In conclusion of his column CAC says that another possibility is that this woman may have been motivated to do this by some outside party without the knowledge of the Swiss embassy . He claims that there seems to be a close connection between the LTTE groups in Switzerland , the UNP , the TNA and the Swiss government and hence the new Sri Lankan government will have to figure out a way to deal with this . From the very beginning , the enemies of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Western embassies backing them . Now that the Rajapaksas are back with a huge mandate , naturally , these local representatives of the global liberal mafia are doing their damnedest to undermine the new government . We have seen this happening in other countries too where the global liberal mafia has been conclusively defeated . <p> CAC in a note of caution states that the Swiss drama which began within days of the new President assumed office clearly shows that the Western embassies will not allow the new government to rule the country in peace but will do their damnedest to undermine it . In last Monday 's statement , the Swiss authorities had indicated to the Sri Lankan authorities that it is seeking ' a common and constructive way forward ' to resolve the security incident . This position has been reiterated in the statement issued by the Swiss authorities on Thursday as well . What is the resolution that the Swiss are seeking ? If they want to have legal action against their local staffer stopped and permission to take her out of the country as they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a feasible option for Sri Lanka because we would then be portrayed as the guilty party . <p> We have not yet got to the bottom of who is behind all this . If the government caves into the Swiss demands and stops legal action against this local staffer , will Sri Lanka be left alone ? Hardly likely . It will only intensify the campaign against Sri Lanka . Thus , the only feasible option that Sri Lanka has in the present case is to come down hard on all those involved . That will at least deter any future gimmicks of this sort . <p> CAC also advises that Sri Lanka 's economy too should turn east and the economy will have to be oriented away from the West to the east consciously over the next few years so that our dependency on the West is reduced and their ability to dictate terms goes down proportionately . It is certainly true that it is only the Swiss embassy that is involved in this spat with Sri Lanka and the other Western embassies have not got involved . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they have done up to now without international condemnation , indicates that Sri Lanka has no future with the West and that the wisest course of action is to look Eastwards . <p> The Sunday Tines Political Editor ( STPE ) states that the Swiss government has issued a virtual ultimatum urging Colombo to ensure all matters in the case of Garnier Banister Francis , their Assistant Migration Officer , be completed on December 16 . This was with the case being taken up in the Colombo Chief Magistrate 's Court that day . In other words , the Swiss government expected the matter to end there and the ding-dong controversy brought to a halt and it did not work that way . <p> As the officially designated Assistant Migration Officer Garnia Barrister Francis was dealing with visa and asylum applications together with her Migration Officer , a Swiss lady . In her official capacity , she was privy to sensitive information on those who have obtained asylum as well as those who sought visas among related matters . This included the case of Chief Inspector Nishantha de Silva , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He has now obtained asylum in Switzerland . <p> She had alleged that she was sexually abused and assaulted at the teacher 's apartment by unknown men according to what she told the CID . She had not complained to the Police because the unidentified persons had warned that her family members would be killed . One of these men had also pointed a pistol at her , she has alleged . This is in marked contrast . Either in her first statement to her bosses or the later one to the CID there was no reference to the purported abductors thrusting a pistol in her mouth . The charge was made by former Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne as if he was A witness to this hoax drama or who was a party to the abductor gang . <p> The first account she gave her Ambassador and later confirmed by his deputy , Imbach , runs completely against her version to the CID . She has told CID that she went to the apartment of a teacher at St Bridget 's Convent at 3 p.m. on November 25 . However @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 5 p.m . Surveillance camera footage in the vicinity had revealed that she had left the apartment by that time . An Uber taxi in which she claimed she travelled had no records of that journey . The CID had also found evidence to confirm she has told neighbours around the apartment she lived in Maligakanda that she and her family were leaving home since they were going abroad . Similarly , there have been many other statements that were contradictory leaving the CID and the Attorney General 's Department to conclude that she had fabricated the incident . Exacerbating the situation , they confirmed , was the fact that she was in a physically and mentally fit and proper condition . She was , however , in a confused state at times , said one source . <p> From Monday , she remains in the Y " Ward of the Remand Prison at Welikade . This ward also houses a number of female drugs suspects whose cases are pending in courts . This came amidst reports that alleged she was found in possession of a sim card and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now being investigated . Meals for Banister Francis were being delivered from outside . It has remained a common practice for prisoners and remand prisoners to smuggle in telephones into prisons by bribing their way through . A group of European envoys , a diplomatic source in Colombo said , urged Foreign Relations Minister Dinesh Gunawardena to provide her with reasonably better " facilities in the remand cell . He has replied that it was possible to do so if her counsel made a formal request -- a procedure that is usually followed . <p> The EU envoys meeting with Minister Gunawardena had been fixed before the Swiss saga began . The envoys took up the same position as the Swiss government that due process " should be followed . They asked that Banister Francis be properly protected . " The EU envoys also complained that the local media were biased " and one sided . " Minister Gunawardena had replied that the media in Sri Lanka were free " and the government had no role to play in what they do , the same source said . <p> STPE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abduction centres on Chief Inspector Nishantha de Silva of the CID . The CID denied such accusations . Another suspicion is whether an outside party staged it with the intention of placing both President Gotabaya Rajapaksa and the government in an awkward position . In Colombo , the latter position has gained more substance as the investigations continue . It has come to light that an outside party who had allegedly colluded with the CID , has fled the country with his family . That a second person connected to the investigations , after CI de Silva , has flown away has angered the government leaders . ght by western countries in particular . The tragic irony is that the new government is in accord , but for very different reasons . In the recent years , this elite organisation of the Police department has been politicised to such a degree it has lost its credibility and reputation . In the past four and half years , the CID was handling a part of the so-called high-profile cases . In reality it was against the ruling party 's opponents . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the statements made by Banister Francis relate entirely to her two claims , one to her Ambassador and the other to the CID , only over the alleged incident . It is facts arising from this purported incident that the CID has been reporting to the Chief Magistrate 's Court . Being a Sri Lankan citizen , she does not enjoy any diplomatic immunity . Like all other citizens , during a Police inquiry where they are required to make a statement , they would have to sign it to affirm its authenticity . There is a paradoxical situation here . <p> Mindful of any undertaking given , or on their own volition to avoid accusations , CID detectives appear not to have dealt with the CI de Silva affaire during the interrogation -- the sole cause why Bannister Francis claims she was purportedly molested sexually and assaulted . If the CID did so , answers to some questions would have surfaced . However , the CID complained she was not co-operating . " That would have included details like for how long CI de Silva has the asylum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him and the telephone details that are linked . She has told investigators that her mobile phone was with the embassy . Of course , this is not to suggest that she has to violate confidentiality to which she is sworn into by her employers . This is only to make clear how knotty the issue has become for the investigators . <p> The role of the CID has also been one of the bones of contention between Bern and Colombo when efforts were being made to urge the local staffer to make a statement . After protracted discussion , it was agreed that the local lawyer representing the embassy staffer would be near when her statement was being recorded . In addition , two embassy staffers were also allowed to sit at a distance . They were able to see the statement being recorded but were not within hearing distance . The government agreed to these moves to obviate any complaints of the absence of transparency or complaints of impropriety . <p> STPEAlso reported that Ambassador Mock , once his Foreign Ministry 's spokesperson , played the role of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rajapaksa and Maithripala Sirisena during last October 's political crisis . He said that The Sunday Times can now reveal that the role of a ' peace maker ' came at the request of then President Sirisena . By then , he had realised he had erred over the foisting of Mahinda Rajapaksa as Prime Minister after ousting incumbent Ranil Wickremesinghe . The Supreme Court was to later pronounce the move as unconstitutional . Envoy Mock was the second diplomat from whom Sirisena sought help after the first person he consulted declined To intervene . <p> Notwithstanding the current deadlock , it is imperative that the government resolves the Swiss saga by ensuring that relations reach normalcy . The pronouncements of Bern and Colombo make clear their positions are well known . The issue over a local employee should not be allowed to irreparably sour relations between two nations . <p> To be continued ......... <h> Leave a Reply <p> Disclaimer : The comments contained within this website are personal reflection only and do not necessarily reflect the views of the LankaWeb .

Liyanage to take over the Qatar mission when Amaraweera was serving the UNP-UPFA yahapalana coalition , which betrayed the Sri Lankan military at the Geneva-based Human Rights Council ( UNHRC ) in Oct 2015 . <p> Post-Swiss Embassy incident study <p> on challenges <p> The writer recently had an opportunity to examine failures on the part of successive governments , regarding high profile accusations , with the focus on the Foreign Ministry . Touchy issues were discussed against the backdrop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Colombo . The Swiss accommodating Inspector Nishantha Silva on its political asylum programme and Swiss Ambassador Hanspeter Mock alleging on behalf of Embassy worker Garnia Banister Francis , that she was abducted on Nov 25 , the day after Inspector Silva left the country . <p> President Gotabaya Rajapaksa 's government acted swiftly , and decisively , to counter the high profile Western project . Veteran politician Dinesh Gunawardena , who had never held the foreign affairs portfolio , handled the situation well , with Foreign Secretary Ambassador Ravinatha Aryasinha playing a significant role . There had never been a previous instance of Sri Lanka successfully countering such a high profile propaganda project meant to undermine the government . <p> The Swiss operation took President Gotabaya Rajapaksa government by surprise though the new administration responded admirably . Had the government succumbed to Western pressure , the country would have been in serious trouble . Instead , Ambassador Aryasinha , accompanied by Defence Secretary Maj. Gen. Kamal Gunaratne , on Dec 01 , 2019 , set the record straight at a meeting with Ambassador Mock . Whatever the Swiss say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Minister Gunawardena can be quite rightly satisfied with the ministry 's performance . President Rajapaksa appointed attorney-at-law Susil Premajayantha as State Minister for International Cooperation . In the absence of a deputy minister , Premajayantha functions as the deputy minister while being called State Minister for International Cooperation . Interestingly , there are no deputy ministers in Gotabaya Rajapaksa 's government . In addition to 16 cabinet ministers , including Premier Mahinda Rajapaksa , there are 39 State Ministers . The government owed public/media an explanation as to why there are two ministers to handle the vital subject split into Foreign Relations and International Cooperation . Let there be no confusion . <p> At the onset of Eelam War IV , in August 2006 , top SLFPer Mangala Samaraweera handled the subject . In early 2007 , Rohitha Bogollagama replaced Samaraweera . After the conclusion of the war , in May 2009 , and following the April 2010 general election , Prof. G.L. Peiris took over the ministry . One-time UNPer Bogollagama , could n't secure a place in parliament , at the first general election , after the end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the leader of the then Premier Ranil Wickremesinghe 's delegation for talks with the LTTE in terms of the CFA , finalized in Feb 2002 , served as the external affairs minister till the change of government , in January 2015 . <p> The 2015 change of government brought Mangala Samaraweera back to the Foreign Ministry . Having received the backing of the four-party Tamil National Alliance ( TNA ) to install Maithripala Sirisena as the President , the UNP-SLFP combine , aka yahapalana government , co-sponsored the accountability resolution at the UNHRC , on Oct 01 , 2015 . In spite of President Sirisena repeatedly claiming that his approval had n't been obtained for the controversial move , he did nothing during his five-year term to reverse the process . <p> The Foreign Relations Ministry should at least now undertake a thorough examination of past events/disputed policy decisions . Although President Sirisena and many others blamed Samaraweera for the Geneva betrayal , the then minister could n't be faulted for implementing yahapalana policies . Had Samaraweera acted unilaterally , President Sirisena and Premier Wickremesinghe should have had the guts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ failure on the part of the top political leadership . Sri Lanka endorsed the Geneva resolution in spite of the then Sri Lanka Permanent Representative in Geneva Ambassador Aryasinha strongly objecting to it at an informal session attended by Western governments . Samaraweera dismissed Aryasinha 's concerns and was instructed to finalize the resolution . Samaraweera could n't be faulted for the Geneva co-sponsorship . Instead , the yahapalana administration , led by President Sirisena and Premier Wickremesinghe , should accept responsibility for the Geneva betrayal . <p> During Sirisena 's presidency , four held the foreign ministry portfolio : Ravi Karunanayake succeeded Samaraweera , in May 2017 , before him being removed in early August 2017 amidst the media furor over Treasury bond scams perpetrated in Feb 2015 and March 2016 . One time Attorney General Tilak Marapana succeeded Karunanayake , in early August 2017 . Having sacked the cabinet in late Oct 2018 , President Sirisena placed the foreign ministry under Dr. Sarath Amunugama during what is dubbed as a 51-day government . Thanks to the judicial intervention , Marapana regained the foreign ministry in Dec 2018 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gotabaya Rajapaksa convincingly defeated UNP Deputy Leader Sajith Premadasa who contested the 2019 presidential poll on the New Democratic Front ( NDF ) , under the ' swan ' symbol . <p> Had Premadasa won the presidency , Nishantha Silva , along with his wife and children , would n't have sought political asylum in Switzerland and there was no requirement for the Swiss Embassy drama , orchestrated by interested parties . The UNP , too , had a role to play . No less a person than President Gotabaya Rajapaksa referred to a statement issued by defeated presidential candidate Sajith Premadasa as well as Dr. Rajitha Senaratne . Dr. Senaratne caused media furor by declaring that the abducted Swiss Embassy worker had a pistol trusted in her mouth . <p> President Rajapaksa assured Ambassador Mock , on Dec 16 , that the alleged incident never took place . The President repeated what Ambassador Aryasinha told Mock on Dec 01 when he presented the findings of high profile investigation to the Swiss envoy . <p> The government earned the wrath of Western powers for its handling of the Swiss issue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they blamed President Rajapaksa 's administration going public with the Francis issue . President Rajapaksa did n't mince his words when he pointed out to those who expressed concern over the media coverage as to how Garnia 's unsubstantiated allegations ended up in the New York Times as if it was the factual truth , even before Ambassador Mock complained , in writing , having met Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa . US President Trump appears to be quite justified in accusing the NYT of repeatedly publishing fake news . <p> In fact , high profile international media coverage exposed the Swiss project . The Foreign Relations Ministry addressed the Swiss issue commendably , amidst another serious matter caused by the Conservative Party ahead of the UK general election , on Dec 12 , 2019 . On the instructions from Colombo , High Commissioner Manisha Gunasekera strongly reacted to the Conservative proposal for a two-state solution in Sri Lanka . The HC objected to the Conservative declaration : " We will continue to support international initiatives to achieve reconciliation , stability and justice across the world , and in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Middle East , where we maintain our support for the two-state solution . The Conservatives made their move at the same time Westminster Magistrate 's court delivered a ruling against Brigadier Priyanka Fernando in respect of him allegedly making a threatening gesture at LTTE supporters , who were shouting abuse against the country in front of our London High Commission , while openly waving Tiger flags . The Foreign Relations Ministry , in a statement issued on Dec 07 , 2019 , titled ' Foreign Ministry comments on the judgment in the case of Brigadier Priyanka Fernando , ' without hesitation pointed out the ruling was given on the eve of the UK election general election . <p> It would have been better if the statement was aptly titled ' Foreign Relations Ministry comments on the judgment in the case of Brigadier Priyanka Fernando . ' There should n't be confusion over how the ministry is named and a State Minister under a different title . <p> Negligence on the part of past governments <p> The failed Swiss move , and Sri Lanka 's spirited response , should be examined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The sharp change in Sri Lanka 's response can be safely attributed to President Gotabaya Rajapaksa 's policy . <p> The writer , attending the workshop at the Sri Lanka College of Journalism , on Dec 21 , 2019 , briefly discussed as to how Sri Lanka pathetically failed to exploit Lord Naseby 's contradiction of the UN war crimes charges in Oct 2017 , Sri Lanka Monitoring Mission ( SLMM ) bid to deceive the public , in 2007 , with regard to war casualties ( 2002-2007 ) , exposure of those propagating lies over Mannar mass graves early this year , soon after Geneva alleged there could be more secret graves , appearance of a man in Tamil Nadu alleged to have been killed by the Directorate of Military Intelligence ( DMI ) , in late 2009 , Australia providing a new identity to one-time leading JVP activist , Kumar Gunaratnam and a missing LTTE child soldier appearing in an award-winning French movie , the then Northern Chief Minister C.V . Wigneswaran accusing the army of poisoning 104 ex-LTTE cadres in government custody and wartime accusations directed at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Indian waters ) . <p> The writer also compared the handling of the situation caused by the Swiss and Sri Lanka 's failure to exploit disclosure of secret talks the UN mission in Colombo had with the LTTE in 2007 . Had the Rajapaksa government bothered to examine what was happening on the ground , the country would be in a much better position to counter propaganda offensives directed against our political and military leadership . Unfortunately , there had n't been any effort on Sri Lanka 's part to inquire into /oppose Labour Party MP , Siobhain McDonagh 's declaration , in the UK parliament in Sept. 2011 , that the Sri Lankan military killed 100,000 Tamils , including 60,000 civilians , in the final phase of the war . <p> Another Labour Party MP Joan Ryan once functioned as former Chief Executive and Policy Advisor of UK headquartered Global Tamil Forum ( GTF ) . The LTTE enjoyed an extremely close relationship with the GTF . Tiger ideologue/advisor Anton Balasingham lived in the UK . Having bestowed UK citizenship on Balasingham , one-time Veerakesari staffer and British @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protection , until his death in Dec 2006 . Balasingham 's murderous outfit had its International Secretariat in London without impediment . Even after the assassination of Foreign Minister Lakshman Kadirgamar , in early August 2005 , the UK allowed Balasingham and his Australian-born wife , Adele , to conduct talks on behalf of the LTTE . Thanks to Wiki Leaks , the secret talks a high level Norwegian delegation had with Balasingham in the immediate aftermath of the Kadirgamar assassination is in the public domain . <p> Mrs. Balasingham , who participated in the LTTE passing out parades and even presented cyanide capsules to terrorists , lives in the UK . Those who moved court against Brigadier Fernando for allegedly making a threatening gesture never challenged the British over Adele , who nurtured the female Tiger cadres with cyanide capsules , living there . <p> Sri Lanka paid a very high price for ignoring Lord Naseby 's Oct 2017 disclosure made possible by the UK Freedom of Information Act 2000 . The revelation could have been effectively used to counter the primary UN allegation that over 40,000 civilians perished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exclusive interview with the writer , in September 2019 , in Colombo , Lord Naseby said that he was deeply disappointed by Sri Lanka 's failure to use his disclosure , based on wartime dispatches sent from British High Commission in Colombo to the Foreign and Commonwealth Office , to defend her armed forces . <p> The writer also asserted that the war-winning Rajapaksa administration owed the public an explanation as to why US defence attach ? Lt. Colonel Lawrence Smith 's far reaching comments , at the inaugural Colombo Defence Seminar , in respect of what was dubbed as white flag killings and other accusations , were never properly used . Instead the Rajapaksa administration squandered millions of USD on PR firms under questionable circumstances . Such hare brained projects never brought any benefit to Sri Lanka . The political leadership bypassed the Foreign Ministry . Actually an inquiry is required to establish the amount of funds spent on costly foreign PR firms and to find out the truth . <p> The US sustained the project against Sri Lanka until the yahapalana lot betrayed the military , in Geneva @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quitting the UNHRC , in June 2018 , calling the Geneva body ' a cesspool of political bias ' Sri Lanka remained committed to the process initiated by the US on behalf of the British , Norway et al . <p> The circumstances under which the US got involved in the Geneva process , having backed the then General Sarath Fonseka at the 2010 presidential election , should be examined against the backdrop of Western and Indian concerns over the Rajapaksas ' relationship with China . <p> With the US-Japan-India coalition taking on China , Sri Lanka should be mindful of the previous Sirisena-Wickremesinghe government entering into a Comprehensive Partnership with Japan , in Oct 2015 . Stepped up Japanese diplomatic initiatives should be viewed in the right context . It would be relevant to mention President Gotabaya Rajapaksa recently received an invitation from Tokyo for an official visit . <p> A thorough examination of all bilateral agreements , entered into and to be signed , is necessary without further delay . There is no point in denying that Sri Lanka had entered into ACSA ( Acquisition and Cross Servicing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government took place in Nov 2019 when the previous government was having talks with the US on MCC ( Millennium Challenge Corporation ) and SOFA ( Status of Forces Agreement ) . <p> Having played politics with the US issue , the new government finds itself in an unenviable situation . Defeated presidential candidate Sajith Premadasa recently called for the abrogation of ACSA and doing away with talks on MCC and SOFA . It would be the responsibility of the government of the day to take decisions in consultations with political parties represented in the parliament . <p> Foreign relations should not be undermined by party politics . During the workshop , the writer also recalled the presence of the then Sri Lankan Ambassador in Washington , top career diplomat Prasad Kariyawasam , at an event in June 2016 when TNA lawmaker Sumanthiran disclosed the reaching of an agreement on foreign judges in terms of the Geneva resolution . The head of mission can not be faulted for following the government policy . Jaffna District MP Sumanthiran would n't have made such a declaration without having specific guarantee from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are being repeatedly told foreign judges , as well as security sector reforms , insisted by the so-called international community , would n't be implemented , the Geneva resolution remains unchanged . <p> It would be the responsibility of President Gotabaya Rajapaksa 's administration with Minister Gunawardena 's ministry to set the record straight . The writer believes Sri Lanka should seek a comprehensive review of the Geneva resolution on the basis of Lord Naseby 's disclosure , Wiki Leaks revelations , pertaining to the war , June 2011 , the US statement , as well as a still confidential UN report , prepared by the UN during the Vanni offensive . It placed the number of deaths ( both LTTE and civilians ) at 7,721 and the wounded at 18,479 during the period Aug 2008 to May 13 , 2009 . Sri Lanka never pushed the UN to examine its own report , based on information provided by those who lived in the North . Instead , the June 2011 report , released by a three-member Panel of Experts ( PoE ) , which prohibited examination of accusations made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not open to any form of scrutiny , till 2031 , Sri Lanka was blamed for deliberately killing 40,000 . Lord Naseby convincingly countered these accusations . Let us hope the new government makes a comprehensive presentation in Geneva , next March 2020 , to clear its name . <p> Let me end this piece by inviting those concerned to peruse career diplomat Chanaka Talpahewa 's ' Peaceful Intervention in intra-State conflicts : Norwegian involvement in the Sri Lanka peace process ' to understand as to how foreign ' interventions ' could jeopardize a country . Sri Lanka is a case in point . <p> ( To be continued on January 01 , 2020 ) <h> Leave a Reply <p> Disclaimer : The comments contained within this website are personal reflection only and do not necessarily reflect the views of the LankaWeb .
