The facility was to be developed by Sical Logistics Ltd . <p> The trust that runs the Union government-controlled New Mangalore port on Monday decided to terminate the project after Sical Logistics applied for force majeure , citing the export ban for not beginning work on the project that was awarded in 2009 , said two members of the port 's board of trustees . Companies can declare force majeure when they want to break contracts due to unforeseen circumstances such as natural disasters , fires or political events . <p> Sical Logistics had signed a concession agreement with the New Mangalore port in October 2009 to develop and operate a 6.62 million tonnes ( mt ) a year iron ore loading facility at the port for 30 years .

Take Abbas Mustan 's Players . <p> Look at the title itself . Players is no longer an English word . It is globalised in its indigeniety . The message is clear . Everyone is a player , even criminals and non-citizens . Players is a secular word . It does not carry the burden of ethnicity or the baggage of civilization , caste , family . A player is a global creature who plays global games . <p> Abbas Mustan creates what I call the original copy . Mustan 's film borrows from many Hollywood thrillers .

This was pointed out by senior scientists taking part in a workshop at the Institute of Seismological Research ( ISR ) , Gandhinagar . <p> The scientists said large water reservoirs can induce earthquakes measuring more than 6 on the Richter scale , depending on the size of the reservoir and the properties of the soil in the area . The 2001 earthquake that damaged several buildings in the Ahmedabad city measured 7.9 in the Richter scale . The workshop was attended by 10 scientists from the US and 60 from across India . <p> Referring to threats of earthquakes from large water reservoirs and the need to ascertain and understand them , director-general of ISR-Gandhinagar , B K Rastogi said , " There is a need for conducting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pradesh and the Kalpasar project . " <p> One of the studies presented at the workshop said artificial water reservoirs have triggered earthquakes at over 100 sites all over the world .

The study said Koyna Dam in Maharashtra is a classic example which has induced thousands of low intensity earthquakes as well as a couple of others measuring more than 5 to as high as 6.3 . <p> The Kalpasar dam project aims to generate tidal power and water supply by building a 30-km long dam between Kalatalav in Bhavnagar district in Saurashtra and Adalar in Bharuch district in south Gujarat . <p> Explaining how the water reservoirs lead to earthquakes , professor emeritus of geophysics in the department of earth and ocean sciences at University of South California Pradeep Talwani said , " The water in the reservoir seeps through pores below the reservoir .

@@709239 <p> Now , I take pride in knowing my teas : I come from a land where tea is the preferred beverage , ubiquitous in the national beverage-scape . Tea was incorporated into my breakfast routine at an early age ( with some noisy reluctance on the part of my mother , and intractable insistence on my part ) , and I 've had a steamy cup of Darjeeling warm my senses nearly every morning since early childhood . One of my fondest childhood memories revolves around getting hot elaichi ( cardamom ) chai at train stations . <p> Tea-sellers would rapidly enter the compartments or yell " chai garam " ( hot tea ) through open windows , the moment a train arrived at a station . Usually for Rs 2 ( in a different era-I 'm not sure how inflation has affected railway tea costs ) , you would hold in your hands the most deliciously steaming , perfectly brewed fragrant chai swirling around in an earthen mug . Bliss , especially during cold , wintry journeys . <p> Imagine my surprise the first time I encountered the phrase , when a " fancied up " version of this was served up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cafe several years ago in Chico , California . Since that fateful day , I 've bitten my tongue every time I 've encountered it in lettering or in a cup . Until now , Indians generally use " chai " as the generic term for tea ; if one calls a drink " chai tea , " one is needlessly reduplicating the word , for no reason obvious to me . The Wikipedia entry actually redirects to Masala Chai , and there 's this line embedded in the larger text : " The redundant chai tea is sometimes used to indicate spiced milk tea as distinct from other types of tea . " <p> If the point was to set it apart , would n't simply settling for the word " chai " be a sufficient differentiating move ? I did n't really let it get to me too much until a recent trip to NY , when I got so riled up , I vented on Facebook about my disgust with the redundancies in the phrases " chai tea " and " dal soup . " <p> Dal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ India , but you could n't go to many ( North ) Indian restaurants in America where dal is not listed under soup . But , in North India , dal is generally consumed with your entree-it 's actually part of it . ( Of course , I 'm generalizing broadly , since there are pockets in India in which you would consume dal as shorba or rassam at the start of the meal : however , they are not the versions offered in Indian restaurants here in the U.S. ) . <p> That particular Facebook thread kind of erupted , with friends offering other redundancies . There was " naan bread , " " pakora fritters , " " chutney sauce " and a longer debate about the term " curry . " Before I turn to the last term , the interesting point of the duplications is that the Indian ( often Hindi ) word is followed by the ( loose ) English " translation . " What is inexplicable is that English routinely consumes different words from other languages without forever coupling them eternally with their " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general rule ? <p> Why ca n't Indian culinary vocabulary imports be standalones ? Finally , the term " curry " : umm , Most Indians use the word sparingly . To me , 99.99% of the times , curry means only one thing : a gravy dish made of Indian chickpea flour . For the odd occasion , I 'd refer to " malai curry " or " chicken curry " but that 's pretty much it .

NUJS , at least from the day I joined till the day I left , has had a tradition of a very active student body and the faculty and the administration always gave it its due place and respected their stands even at times when they may have disagreed . Apart from the obvious fact that the proactive student body was constituted by some of the most brilliant lawyers I 've known , perhaps the liberal Calcutta-way of thinking also contributed . <p> Actually not so .

Their desperation to outrank " the best " resulted in a few very questionnable things happening . One of them was the fact that there would be CLAT counselling for college allotments and not the usual preference list thing . <p> Students of the organizing university appointed arbitrarily to " guide " Law School aspirants would call up the successful candidates and counsel them into preferring this certain college over NALSAR , Hyderabad . But , how ? Well , they began with calling up the Bengalis first - told them that they 'd be close to this said university , that in NALSAR the bongs are " cornered " , that NALSAR is " sooo far from the city " , that NALSAR has " leopards roaming around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they turned on a website run by the students of NALSAR and accused them of " lobbying " - of course , vocab was never a strong point of these students . Notwithstanding all of that , they were successful in convincing quite a few smart people into the belief that NALSAR is a highly politicized , regionalistic law school where everyone just hated everyone . The only difficult problem here was - it was n't crowded and that it did n't adopt " different pedagogies " in character building - washing your plates for example , or living in a kitchen/mess converted into a dorm because the hostels are , umm , well , let 's just leave it there . <p> Actually not so . We at NALSAR are happy that these things have come to light . Students made a representation to the Judges ' panel and things are looking up . We are happy that the misdeeds have come to the fore .

The NALSAR community has shown great courage and honesty in helping put together this report . If it is implemented , it will pioneer accountability and transparency in the law schools . Others should follow suit if they want to clean up the system instead of whining about it . And if you think your faculty is so useless , what are you doing about it ? NALSAR is doing something about it . <p> I cant raise my voice alone go to VC and say U SOB ... ! ! ! if i do this i will fail in every exam i give .... <p> Yeah yeah , all spineless people have the same excuses .

I do n't think they need reminding that these doomsday concoctions are worthy of little attention . <p> While administration and students achievements are distinct , there is surely a relation between the administration and quality of University . Apart from students , we all know that whatever NALSAR is today is because of Prof. Ranbir Singh ( If not solely , then substantially ) . <p> Administration does play a vital role . Example , NLIU The moment Prof. Balraj Chauhan left it , it had been under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faced by even NUJS too if administration turns out to be pathetic .

Throw out the malignant tumour and be more intelligent in choosing the next administration . Prof. Dhanda is already the Dean of Academic Affairs and a lot of progressive reforms are anticipated under her stewardship . <p> And since you admit that student achievements are not affected , the kind of vitriol that has been profferred is unjustified - NALSAR students continue to do brilliantly in whatever they do , and yeah , they also flock to top universities abroad .

What 's stopping them from going back to their Alma matter ? <p> I do n't refute it - and that is precisely why this is a welcome move .

But , because of the POOR ADMINISTRATION THEY DID NOT GO THERE ( Please read this again ) . You may ask your alumni ( who are at NUJS ) if you want to . The reason why they opted for NUJS is because of the independence which one gets here , and the trend which has been set by Prof. M.P . Singh ( Again because of a GREAT ADMINISTRATOR ) . <p> " After all , there MUST be a reason NUJS has more NALSAR alumni on its faculty than its own students . ; ) " - I hope my reply helped you a lot . <p> Your point is taken . Hence the last sentence of my post . " And that 's the position we hope will change when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saying the administration in NALSAR so far has not been antagonistic . My objection is to translate that into a sweeping aspersion on student achievement , which is far from the truth - the quality of the alumni being testified to , among other things , by the fact that NUJS is recruiting them more than their own students <p> Must point out - NUJS has NLS , NUJS and NALSAR alumni on their faculty . NLS has NLS and NUJS alumni on theirs . I have n't heard of NLS or NUJS or NALSAR alumni teaching at NALSAR . New administration being ushered in does not instantly change NALSAR . Jindel Law School may have an enviable faculty and infrastructure , but a world class student body may not be instantaneously churned out . These are not quick-fixes but processes . NLS and NUJS have had them in place for years . By your own admission , NALSAR shall ' usher ' them in now . And , let 's not be petty . We all hope for the best . <p> After all , there MUST be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its own students . ; ) And that 's the position we hope will change when the new administration is ushered in . <p> There , my friend , lies the real answer . ADMINISTRATION . Good administration is the difference in attracting mediocre and an outstanding faculty . Your entire argument is weak because you 're stressing entirely on ( 1 ) a student body 's struggle against an admittedly mismanaged university , and ( 2 ) CLAT preferences . At the same time , you 're in complete denial over a poor administration pulling a good law school down . Ridiculous indeed . <p> If you must know , along with a very large number of students in my batch , I did not write the NALSAR entrance exam . NLS I did . NUJS was my second preference , not NALSAR . There is such a thing as being too presumptuous - considering the sweeping statements and the misplaced assumptions that clearly is a lesson your law school has failed to impart . If you 're going to come on this forum and openly deny that NALSAR @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how much of a bare faced lie that would be . Mismanagement is a sclerosis which rots the finest of institutions . While I 'm completely with the NALSAR student body 's struggle to throw those responsible for the mess , there is no denying that there IS a mess . <p> Put that aside - any law school student at a top law school knows just how capable those who constitute the student bodies be it at NLS , NUJS or NALSAR are . Mismanagement is an obvious disadvantage for one of these law schools . I prey that such occurrences do not hinder NLS and NUJS , and that while it does hinder NALSAR , that it deals with it effectively . <p> You are wrong . Good faculty do not necessarily imply good management . Right now there are plenty of young people who would gladly teach if given an opportunity . Nalsar was such an extreme degree of mismanagement that the VC did not even permit the younger faculty to teach . But it is not as if most of the other schools make it very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are managed properly right now . Nalsar is just the extreme among a set of bad apples . <p> it took LI several days to post the story of death of a renowned NALSAR faculty but they posted this news within minutes TOI published it ..... how many other NLU did you go and ask information other than NALSAR ..... it must be investigated how much money does LI receive from NLS Bangalore .... <p> Wow ! The comments for most of the posts relating to Law Schools , including the one above , are a fun read . They are as bad as the comments to posts in rediff . C'm on , we law school students are much better than what we post as comments . Would love to read informative and well thought out comments . <p> NALSCAM is the IIPM of the legal world . It is a poor man 's NLSIU . It is well known that NALSCAM used underhanded means to be ranked #1 in India Today ( the turning point for the college ) . The truth has now been exposed . Those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The qualifications of the faculty are extremely average and the admin is third class . How does this not matter ? <p> What I find most interesting about this article is how its actually a report of the report made by TOI . Its basically a gossip piece ! ! And in any event , I would submit that whether or not the article is spot on and whether or not NALSAR 's " brats " are the best in the world - is of no consequence whatsoever . On the contrary , what does matter is the brand value that the name NALSAR carries along with it - and this " scandal " is a mere bump in a well paved road . There will be no change in the fact that prospective CLAT candidates will put NALSAR somewhere in their top 5 choices - and even if anybody out there is conceited enough to truly fool themselves into believing that THEY are too good for NALSAR - good for them ! ! <p> It is disappointing to read immature comments from supposedly bright law students of national law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and should be taken as a wake up call by all law schools , especially the students to mobilise themselves and bring desired changes to their own institutions . We all know that all NLUs , by virtue of being autonomous bodies are marred by administrative discrepancies , and that no NLU is perfect . So instead of turning this into a NALSAR bashing fest , take a cue from NALSAR students who have shown guts in correcting the wrong at the risk of attracting bad press . <p> With due respect , it is time for some introspection . Not NALSAR bashing and most definitely not the time for naive denial . Just a thought - the top NLUs are modeled on a structure which embraces student bar councils for student activities . If this was at all a matter to be dealt with by the students , perhaps - just perhaps - NALSAR students had n't done as much as their counterparts in other law schools in the past that the situation reached such proportions ? Advocates are who the society looks towards to protect their interests and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leading law schools let this circus go on for so many years ? Tables are easily turned . What remains is the fact that this is a sad state of affairs for NALSAR . <p> Please try and understand ....... Its been a long time since backdoors were admitted in NALSAR ...... this only happened in the regime of Ranbir Singh ..... I know that there has not been a single back door admitted after the CLAT was introduced . <p> Anyone in the law school community would vouch for this fact . And for mud slinging and false statements , I do nt care , you can go on with that . <p> Please try and understand .. I admit , I stole your money and lied to you and committed all that you accuse me of .. even if I may have denied it earlier .. but all that is okay because i have not done that for a long time .. and THIS time i am telling you the truth .. you should totally believe me ! ! ! <p> Its funny how an administrative report is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ merit and the calibre of NALSAR as a law school . <p> I guess the long standing ranking of NALSAR is not due to the fact that India Today rated it as one of the better colleges . It is because of the achievements which were made by the students . <p> Honestly speaking , before the CLAT had come , every year 5 to 6 students used to leave NUJS to join NALSAR . This was because entrance exams of NUJS used to take place before NALSAR . Trust me , most of the students if given an option would still take NALSAR over NUJS . Admittedly , NLS was preferred over NALSAR , but , NALSAR was a very clear preference over NUJS . India Today was not the reason behind these preferences , but , infrastructure , nation wide recognition of NALSAR and other nuanced details made students choose NALSAR over NUJS . <p> On a separate note , I would like to tell the present study body at NALSAR that this is a tough time which we are facing , but , till the time you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ international level , all this would just be just so much of inconsequential gossip .

As per the rating agency the logistics industry is expected to grow at 15-20% a year to reach around USD350bn by 2015 from its current size of around USD80bn . <p> Fitch Ratings believes third party logistic companies providing transportation and warehousing will show a slight increase in revenues , with operating profit margins remaining stable at current levels of 5-10% for transportation companies and 20-25% for warehousing companies . <p> No Changes Near Term : The industry is not expected to see any significant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small unorganised players continuing to provide stiff competition to the organised sector . However , the larger companies with a pan-India reach could benefit over the medium term as companies gear up for potential regulation changes from 2013 onwards . <p> Growth Momentum : The Indian logistics industry is expected to sustain its growth momentum despite the recent slowdown in the Indian economy . Slower GDP growth for the quarter ended September 2011 to below 7% prompted the government to revise its fiscal 2012 ( to end-March 2012 ) economic growth forecast to 7.0% from the previous target of 8.5% . Fitch forecasts growth of 7.5% for FY12 . However , the impact of this slowdown is likely to be offset by the rise in outsourced logistics . <p> Rise in Outsourced Logistics : Companies are expected to continue to concentrate on their core competencies , leading to outsourcing their logistical requirements . Furthermore , if the government ? s plan to allow foreign direct investment ( FDI ) in multi-brand retail and/or introduce the goods and services tax ( GST ) is implemented , corporates are likely to tie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a further rise in outsourced logistics . <p> Margins to Remain Stable : The cost of diesel , which is the major fuel expense for surface transport companies , is not expected to increase significantly as a percentage of revenues , as diesel prices are expected to remain subsidised by the government . Increases in other operating expenses like insurance , toll , vehicle interest rates and lease expenses are expected to be passed on as most long-term contracts have built-in escalation clauses . <p> GST Delays : The GST , which was first proposed in the budget speech in 2006-07 was expected to be implemented from April 2012 , but is likely to be delayed . <p> Problems with Rail Freight : Railways ? market share in freight is not expected to increase as Indian Railways will continue to subsidise passengers ? fares with freight hikes . The inability of the railways to provide door to door service and lack of sufficient infrastructure continue to restrict its market share . Road freight transport could see an increase in market share at the expense of rail freight . <p> What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not envisage any regulatory or market changes in 2012 which would affect the rating outlook . Implementation of the GST , deregulation of diesel prices or formal notification to allow 51% FDI in multi- brand retail would be positive for the outlook of the larger players in the industry . These would be able to absorb the reduction in margins that may be seen initially , as they would make investments to alter their operations to take advantage of the changes . <p> Growth in the Logistics Sector <p> Fitch believes that growth the logistics industry in 2012 coupled the fact that operating expenses are not likely to increase significantly would be positive for the credit metrics of companies . Despite the recent economic slowdown in the quarter ending September 2011 , Fitch believes the Indian logistics industry will sustain its growth momentum in the coming years , particularly on the back of retail , automotive and food processing industries .

@@760239 <h> Soulcalibur V Review for PS3 <p> Soulcalibur V dropped in for review and we 've been quite busy playing it for the past few days . We specifically stress on those last two words , to lay emphasis on the amount of time it took us to cover everything in the game , which left us whining for more . Let us begin by saying that this new offering from Project Soul is worth every penny you 'll pay for it , but that 's only if you 're expecting the game to provide you some brilliant weapon-based fighting mechanics that 'll keep you busy online as well as while with your friends . However , we 'd like you to take heed of the fact that this title suffers from some hiccups in its story mode . <p> Living up to expectations , the game manages to look and play as good as any fighting title nowadays . It embraces full-blown sets of breathtaking moves that are assigned to familiar as well as new characters . For those who 've played the previous offering in this series , Soulcalibur V need n't come across as a breath of fresh air , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ games are all about delightful ' edge of the seat ' gameplay , and we believe developer Project Soul has left no stone unturned in imbibing the same . From the onset , the game reveals itself to be a brilliant looking entrant that is on par with any other modern fighting title . <p> The story mode that we mentioned earlier is much in buzz currently for being short in length . But there are other things too that do n't go its way . The narrative revolves around two new characters -- a rebellious zealot named Patroklos and the funnily soft-natured Pyrrha . The former is in search of the latter who has been snatched by the ' malfested , ' and this journey of his is filled to the brim with a plethora of predictable twists and turns that are bound to get under your skin at some point of time . And we failed to understand why all this is illustrated by mere charcoal-drawn storyboards that are accompanied by cliched voice-overs . Although there are a few cutscenes here and there , we could n't help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use them during the entire campaign . <p> Although the story has you playing as various characters , a majority of your time is dominated by Patroklos . This campaign unfolds in an episodic manner , making the provisions for you to jump into any situation you want , once you 've completed it . That said , you 'd be surprised as to how early things come to an end in this bummer of a campaign . Take two and a half hours for a span , and that too , if you 're unable to cope with a difficulty spike in the middle . Perhaps , the only things radiant in the story mode are new characters . Apart from the two we 've mentioned before , Natsu , Xiba , Elysium and Z.W.E.I. are the other new fighters , who make meritorious additions to the game 's other modes . As one would expect , Ezio wo n't be seen in the story , but he 's available in all other modes with a complete set of moves that stay true to his personality . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modes these days , encouraging you to improve your times on six consecutive stages , while playing as one character . And then there 's the Quick Battle and vs . Battle modes for the hasty types who wish to jump into straight-up fights without any hassles . If you ever think you 've mastered everything there is to this game , you might want to try out the Legendary Souls mode which unlocks on completing the campaign . Presenting CPU fights with the highest difficulty , it really does separate the best from the rest . All these diverse modes leave you with that unavoidable urge to get back to the title and keep fighting . This is chiefly because of the amazing fighting gameplay that we 've been mentioning all along . <p> Soulcalibur V also holds some decent online multiplayer components . You can hop into ranked matches as well as player matches that can be arranged in the form of rooms . A nifty feature here is that while you 're cooling your heels during other matches and waiting for your turn , a window pops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It 's a pretty neat addition if you ask us . Furthermore , The Global Colosseo feature acts as a meeting point for gamers before they start their battles . Smooth and enjoyable fights await you in all the three online modes . <p> The Critical Edge attacks prove to be healthy additions to this game . These attacks act as brilliant mechanisms to balance the fights . The trick here is to fill up your Critical Gauges as soon as possible to let loose some burly moves using a string of button commands . This neat little entrant can really prove to be the difference between winning and losing during intense fights . A number of well crafted environments are available in Soulcalibur V , with all of them being dynamic and a treat to watch as well as battle upon . The music in the title is quite engrossing and so are its lively sounds , which do wonders for the game 's overall appeal . The tracks can even be selected individually from the library during some custom matches . <p> Some long hours of fun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . However , your brains will simply need to be applied for the visual aspect of these creations , as the characters can only be given moves of other fighters . Tekken 's Devil Jin makes an appearance here , as his moves can also be applied by players to their creations . Our sincere plaudits go out to the Project Soul team for the diversity of this offering , which lets you generate even popular characters from outside the series , if you 're willing to invest that much time . Enormous amounts of possibilities are on offer with this mode which deserves every bit of attention it gets . <p> Final Word : The Training mode that can be found within the title does n't help a great deal , and it could have done with a better UI . Despite this , and the drawback suffered due to the story mode , Soulcalibur V still has a lot in it for you to explore . The gentle flow that lies in the characters ' movements , encourages you to come up with new combos and learn fresh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to click with players . A glitch here and there is to be experienced , but otherwise , it 's a neat journey altogether . With that , we conclude this review and leave you with our score for this game .

Walia began by saying there had been no communication gap , but when reminded of Virender Sehwag 's comments that MS Dhoni had given him and the press two entirely different reasons for resting the seniors , Walia kept repeating the phrase , " Let 's not analyse it further .

Good luck team India . totally agree with @longandshort . <p> Vilander on February 25 , 2012 , 11:26 GMT <p> Sachin do it one last time , old boy .. <p> Nutcutlet on February 25 , 2012 , 7:02 GMT <p> This is dysfunctional response to high-handed and out-of-touch autocracies is classic . You only tell an autocrat what he wants to hear , because if you do n't , you - as the messenger - get shot . I have said this so many times , sometimes in language that is clearly too strong for the censors on this site , but Indian supporters deserve much , much better than the bunch of ( choose your own plural substantive ) that comprise the custodians of the great game in India . When is someone going to use whatever legitimate apparatus exists to clear out the governing body ? Unless you start afresh - sanitised - the infection will remain . ( Btw : Has anyone else noticed how misquotation has become endemic in this set up ? ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FLETCHER GOT SANDWICHED .. HAHAH : P <p> on February 25 , 2012 , 6:22 GMT <p> if sachin can get his 100th century at this time .. team will be in a high again .. dhoni has lost patience and sehwag is a big zero to me .. <p> sachiinnnn .. GO GET IT .. <p> basusri133b on February 25 , 2012 , 6:05 GMT <p> It is hard to believe that India has been playing Test Cricket for more than 70 years . Comments made by Walia are astounding . It is most distressing to see how pathetic a condition our cricket has been reduced to . <p> on February 25 , 2012 , 5:31 GMT <p> Really Indian Media is the worst media in the world ............. <p> on February 25 , 2012 , 5:28 GMT <p> Can Australia placed the last nail on Indian Coffin of hopes ? ? <p> longandshort on February 25 , 2012 , 4:58 GMT <p> Sehwag 's time should be up . The guy has not done anything in the tests and very irresponsible in the one days . in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad shot going for a duck in 2 balls . Forget captain , this is not a good show of temperament as a senior batsmen in the squad . <p> Dhoni may appear to have taken things to his head but he is right . If the senior guys are too slow and fat to field , can not perform then they are a liability . If he had his way these senior players would be dropped . its probably the BCCi thats meddling with politics . They should take a lesson from ACB 's page on axing Ponting . <p> Aspraso on February 25 , 2012 , 4:21 GMT <p> ok guys here is the game plan for the next 2 matches -- we will have Dhoni and Gambhir walking out cracking jokes and with laughter on their faces . Dhoni will keep company with Sehwag at 1st slip chatting away with him all smiles as if they are in consultation , Sehwag and Dhoni will drop a catch each to even out things -- all the while the Aussies and Lankans will be plundering runs and running up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ game but it is NOT about winning matches . <p> eshwarmv on February 25 , 2012 , 3:56 GMT <p> MS Dhoni has achieved what other captains could not achieve that is winning in all the possible formats and tournaments . One must not forget that India won the CB series last time 2-0 . The aussies had Gilly , Symonds , and Hayden . One of the finals was at brisbane . On both occasions India had a good solid start with Sachin and Uthappa combine building a solid platform . A solid opening will ensure that India has every chance qualifying for the finals and also winning it . <p> Sehwag must be told by the management to buckle down in the initial stages . If he is there when Doherty comes in then India will have great chance of getting 280 . All India needs to do is win the remaining 2 matches . The REAL FIGHT is between Aus and SL . A close look at the points table will confirm that . <p> Sakthiivel on February 25 , 2012 , 3:42 GMT <p> Looking like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even win against weak Aussie team . Come on guys IPL is ready and make us proud . <p> on February 25 , 2012 , 3:38 GMT <p> is it worthy to have sachin nd sehwag in the team ? . dhoni is doing the right job by rotation policy and giving chances to youngsters.the time to selectors to sack sehwag from the team <p> on February 25 , 2012 , 3:27 GMT <p> Dhoni is a good captain , even if he losses captaincy he ahud be in team . Sohal i laughed when you wrote bhajji , but you right irfan pathan wud make a great captain . As he is a bowler and batsman <p> All that BCCI wants is sweep dissention under the rug and project unified Team India when it is not . No amount of window dressing will do any good . The reality is different from what Mr. Walia and BCCI wants to projects . The statements are out in public heard from players by media . The team is not performing and producing results . So every thing is going to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get act together and deal with non-performers and trouble makers head on . Shewag is only showing his stupidity , specially when his performance has been wanting . <p> cosair on February 25 , 2012 , 0:54 GMT <p> India has always had a problem choosing a captain . Simply because the best batsman or bowler does not necessarily make a good captain . A good captain must command the respect the team , in turn respect the players , able to motivate the players in delivering their best and have a good cricketing brain . Is there any one in the India who has these qualities . <p> posybeon123 on February 25 , 2012 , 0:40 GMT <p> the senior players may cost 20 runs but have the potentials to score more that 30 runs each <p> Jaihind04 on February 25 , 2012 , 0:04 GMT <p> Bring rahane and manoj tiwari back . Not only can they save some extra runs but may also contribute with the bat . Sehwag needs some serious running on the treadmill . Let Tendulkar play , an INDIA match never looks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ zero . Well , do n't look at me like that , i know u agree with me : D . <p> Jaggadaaku on February 25 , 2012 , 0:03 GMT <p> Sehwag is very irresponsible giving part time bowlers at the end of Australia innings . He has given away 25 extra runs in last 4 overs using part timers and threw his own wicket in 2 balls for duck . This type of cricketers should n't be qualified for even playing and becomes captain . What might be expectations we have from him ? @AlBundy1 , and @Tamilpower , Tendulkar wo n't be able to get his 100th International 100 in his entire life , even if he would play 50 more years , with/without UDRS , in India/overseas . Because since his 99th International 100 , more than 130 centuries blasted by world 's batsmen including the newcomer and bowler- R. Ashween 's century against WI , but our master could n't get one yet . Every time , he starts his inning very slow in order to go for his milestone , and gets out before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pressure . Looks like he does n't want to get his 100th International hundred , and the whole world is crazy about it for no reason . <p> on February 24 , 2012 , 23:05 GMT <p> Do what SriLanka did . Sack all and appoint a new captain and coach . <p> amit82020 on February 24 , 2012 , 22:49 GMT <p> i think we should still continue with dhoni as the indian capt . look at what he has achieved , his record speaks for itself . if india were to change capt it should be done sometime next year or after , so they can phase out a few of the senior players and groom a capt with his team at the same time . also gambir SHOULD NOT be consider as the indian capt since he would be useless in overseas tours , like how he is currently and cant lead from the front .... yes he made a couple of nineties but the adelaide pitch was similar to the indian pitches . in this tour alone only 4 innings he was able to score more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the front . <p> on February 24 , 2012 , 22:03 GMT <p> Captain should be changed every 2 years and its time for new captain . I think we need a bowler captain zaheer is my 1st option bhajji is 2nd option irfan is my 3 options . <p> yesbose on February 24 , 2012 , 18:26 GMT <p> This team is missing Yuvraj Singh . had he been there maybe the performance of the team would have been different and Dhoni would have taken all the credit . <p> Alexk400 on February 24 , 2012 , 17:13 GMT <p> Gambhir should be next captain in all matches . Sehwag is iressponsible <p> Nampally on February 24 , 2012 , 17:02 GMT <p> I do n't care who plays in the Indian XI . The result should be a WIN in each of the next 2 games . It is India who made Aussies look like invincible guys by their inept cricket . SL landed in Australia &amp; thrashed them in 2 out of 3 matches and will win the next match against them too . No excuses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do their talking to the media &amp; to the Aussies . I think the Aussies are terrified of the SL . However the Aussies are banking on docile Indians for their one win required to get them to the Final . Dhoni , Sachin , Sehwag , ZAK &amp; Gambhir - if you are as great as your record shows , let the next 2 matches be the ones where you will let your actions on the field confirm your greatness . All Indian fans are banking on you guys to carry the other 6 with you to show that you are still the best team in the ODI format . No holds bar . Go flat out to win by playing sensible , intense &amp; determined cricket , whether batting , bowling or fielding . JAI HO ! <p> praveenchopra on February 24 , 2012 , 16:54 GMT <p> dhoni must be sacked , give captaincy to raina <p> Nampally on February 24 , 2012 , 16:49 GMT <p> It sounds like a joke when a guy appointed as a Media Manager never spoke to the Media &amp; let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become just like West Indies - lacking in unity . Get a guy like Anil Kumble to manage &amp; unite the team + do all the PR/ media duties . After seeing Sri Lanka , there is no excuse for pathetic display by the Indian team . SL - a Nation with &lt; population than Mumbai , thrashed Australia twice + losing once narrowly&amp; beat India too . India , who call cricket as its National game , has been put to shame by its players - irresponsible &amp; behaving like school children.Mahatma Gandhi 's peace movement had greater intensity , commitment to duty , guts &amp; determination . When you represent India , you are playing for diginity of a Nation . There are 2 games left . If this team has any pride at all , they will rise up - batsmen getting runs &amp; bowlers getting wkts . Throwing away your wkts . while batting &amp; bowling with no length or direction is just Is n't Cricket . <p> on February 24 , 2012 , 16:16 GMT <p> what dhoni had said in media need not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had said to the seniors . Both may be true .... to be fair to dhoni he would have told this reason ( slow fielding ) to the media as the media already knew the other reason ( giving youngsters more chance ) . so dhoni might have added a point to the above reasons .. thats it .. we should not look too much into it . we shoulld also understand gambir also said that ( when sachin was dropped ) " it is the best playing eleven india can field today " . Gambir also added " we did not want big names ... we need players who can perform " ! ! ! ! So can we take gambir insulted sachin ? No. that was gambir 's opinion in the teams interest.that 's it . As a captain dhoni did a right thing by not telling the seniors , all the reasons for dropping them .... it is not necessary .... For him fielding players who can actually perform on field matters .... So i do nt think there is any thing wrong with the team @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ February 24 , 2012 , 14:46 GMT <p> This issue is becoming boring and boring day by day ... Can media talk about some real game ahead which is Ind vs Aus .... <p> wolf777 on February 24 , 2012 , 14:20 GMT <p> People should learn to accept personal resposibilty and resign for the good of the team and its billion plus fans . The media manager , the captain , the tour manager Shivlal Yadav and not the least the chariman of the selectiors they all should be sacked fof non performance . Bring in a new captain that is not Dhoni or Sehwag . <p> PrajithR on February 24 , 2012 , 14:05 GMT <p> Obviously media is milking the issue to maximum ... Media wants X news per day &amp; however they get it they will be happy ... Also no need to give Ex-players like Kapil Dev too much of a hearing ... Kapil in his final years was a poor bowler who continued playing only to get world record of 434 wickets ... In the process Javagal Srinath 's peak years were lost ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... @Tamilpower ... What is that comment supposed to mean ? <p> bigwonder on February 24 , 2012 , 14:02 GMT <p> Do you think players will forget it ? These are the players that have literally been worshiped in India . Their ego is now way too big to fit on this earth . Anyone remember 2007 Worldcup and how the team decided to get themselves out of the tournament due to internal differences . Personal egos will always stay and will interfere with the team dynamics . The selection committee and BCCI needs to make it crystal clear that the players are not above the nation . Also , keep in mind this was an Australian media trick at the beginning of the tour . They always have tricks in their bag . <p> buddhikapm on February 24 , 2012 , 13:58 GMT <p> We also ran trough a similar time perioud .. feel sorry about indian cricket .. u guys play cricket in two grounds .. one is cricket ground other one is NEO sport channel ... stop the 2nd one .. then it will be ok @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GMT <p> Very funny post - @Tamilpower . Tendulkar may get his 100 100th but only if its played in India with no DRS of course ! India would still lose as their old boys would probably doze off by day 2 . We will need to include 1 hour nap time in the afternoon for our oldies - 10dulkar , Dravid and VVS . <p> KBCA on February 24 , 2012 , 13:54 GMT <p> Dhoni is a decent one day batsman ( Albeit with very unattractive technigue ) , but he is a hopeless captain . He holds india back and clearly does nt have the support of the whole team . india should focus on finding a new smarter captain if they want to progress otherwise it will only be backwards they will go . <p> sportofpain on February 24 , 2012 , 13:50 GMT <p> Not sure this is responsible reporting . Analyzing every single sentence spoken by different individuals and connecting them to form a ' pattern ' to prove someone 's hypothesis is n't the right thing to do . The team is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the team instead of trying to tear them down ? <p> on February 24 , 2012 , 13:44 GMT <p> transfer indian pitches to australia and see what they can do ......... <p> Harry0009 on February 24 , 2012 , 13:35 GMT <p> Unless we give chances to potential talents like Manoj Tiwari , Manish Tiwari etc. we can never find another Tendulkar . We have got so obsessed with one person and his talent that we do n't see another such potential person who could who knows say even turn out better than SRT . SRT has done enough for the Indian Cricket and hence deserves all the accolades . But let 's keep it at that since time has come to groom better and younger faces who are more of match winners . People keep questioning as to what will be Indian Cricket without SRT " which is more like the world will end if the cat closes its eyes " . I think we should move on . Sehwag needs motivation from his captain that anything else to perform if we see all that 's happening . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good in Australia . Raina 's technique is very suspect in those wickets . Rohit needs to growup while none like Jadeja barring the captain . <p> puneetusa on February 24 , 2012 , 13:30 GMT <p> I am still wondering what should be our playing 11 ? ? ? For this all important game against Australia on Sunday- Seriously this fake rotation fiasco , seniors not getting along , media controversies , blah blah .... Point Blank- " We need the best available 11 to play the next two games " - with or without any personal favors and differences .... it 's about time people should leave their personal differences for the sake of nation and die-hard fans ... history proves it that Whenever India is in this sort of dire situation where it 's do or die- they do perform 8 out of 10 times .... so let 's hope for the best ... ! ! ! ! ! <p> Harry0009 on February 24 , 2012 , 13:26 GMT <p> Am not sure of the role of Duncan Fletcher as a coach for the Indian team . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? We have seen pathetic Test cricket from the team , and equally pathetic ODI cricket . God only help such a captain who calls Raina , Rohit , and Jadeja as youngsters . Not sure why are we so obsessed with Sachin 's 100 than a better Indian performance . Let him play against Zimbabwe at home to get his 100th 100 and let that not affect the team . Not sure Dhoni 's so called cool attitude while batting . Irfan might have finished the game off against SL chasing 236 while in the other game Gambhir stood up and Dhoni was there to get the credit . Ironically in the game against SL , he ran out two folks Gambhir and Irfan who would have potentiallly won the game for India . And damn about the commentators who has nothing but praise Dhoni even if that was sheer luck of his . <p> crikbuff on February 24 , 2012 , 13:25 GMT <p> Dhoni says that Rotation policy is because seniors are slow in the filed . Sehwag says rotation is to allow juniors who will play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gap , then what is ? BCCI is taking Indian cricket fans for a ride , they think we are fools to blindly follow and idolize the cricket team ! They think they can make millions of dollars at the Indian public 's behest , and continue to fool us . They are wrong ! <p> on February 24 , 2012 , 13:16 GMT <p> if sachin wants to play world cup 2015 what 's the big fuss.He is such a player if comes into some form will make mockery of opponents bowling.He is still equivalent to 2-3 Indian Players.Dhoni better see his commitment before passing any comments.He is way ahead than Ricky Ponting if compared.We wants him for another worldcup . <p> sportofpain on February 24 , 2012 , 13:12 GMT <p> Not sure this is responsible reporting . Analyzing every single sentence spoken by different individuals and connecting them to form a ' pattern ' to prove someone 's hypothesis is n't the right thing to do . The team is not performing well at the moment - how about rallying round the team instead of trying to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2012 , 13:12 GMT <p> Its becoming like street cricket , where you have to do many politics to get a chance to bat or bowl even . Rather than Sehwag , Dhoni is frightened of Gambir taking the reins of Indian team . Since when Gambir became one of the slow senior players ? People can watch runouts of Gambir in recent matches and decide . Its time to change the captain , rather than seniors in Indian team . <p> on February 24 , 2012 , 12:46 GMT <p> Since Sir.Wally hammonds ( Dimbeswar talukdar ) himself has said that tendulkar is better than bradman . I guess we all have to accept it and live with it . <p> PVenks on February 24 , 2012 , 12:35 GMT <p> Forget the rift , Dhoni needs to get the best team on the park , with the right batting order and go about winning remaining matches . The team order in my view is : 1 . Sachin 2 . Gambhir 3 . Kohli 4 . Dhoni ( The way he has been batting in this series , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maintain left right combo ) 6 . Sehwag ( Has been clueless with new ball , better chances to succeed at 6 ) 7 . Pathan ( Far better than Jadeja in his current batting and bowling form ) 8 . Ashwin/Yadav ( Ashwin for SL , Rahul for Aus ) 9 . Rahul/ Yadav ( Yadav for fast pitches , otherwise both spinners ) 10 . Zaheer 11 . Vinay Kumar <p> Would you feature my team selection in one of your articles ? : - ) <p> Cheers , Venki . <p> spinkingKK on February 24 , 2012 , 12:29 GMT <p> I ca n't see any problems in any comments . Dhoni was elobrating on his decision to rotate the seniors further . In addition to giving chance to the youngsters , it could also improve the fielding and save some 20 runs . It was a fact . There is nothing much to be read into it . Obviously , he ca n't tell that to the faces of Sehwag and Tendulkar . He need n't have to say that to the press . That was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can prove Dhoni wrong in the next matches and that will only benefit India as a team . Also , when Gambhir said that Dhoni should have finished off the game in 48th over , he was saying it in his perspective and he was very clear about that when he said that Dhoni has his own style and it was working for him . Like the Media manager said , lets move on . We got two important matches to be won and India are definitely capable of beating both the teams . Play Pathan a bit earlier in the order and bat first if you win the toss . Jai Ho India . <p> crickwizard on February 24 , 2012 , 12:16 GMT <p> Walia 's responses sounded vague , disjointed and at times dubious . I would n't make him my media manager in case I owned a company .. : ) <p> there now seems to communication gap at various levels .. amongst players .. between players and media manager .. and media manager and BCCI ... <p> sathish008 on February 24 , 2012 , 12:15 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Finals . <p> on February 24 , 2012 , 12:03 GMT <p> after world cup i seem indian team getting huge misunderstand ...... Y dhoni can , t play 2nd down.only one sided matches dhoni plays on top order.if he is good average batsmen y ca n't he comes on top &amp; balance the team.let dhoni comes after kohli n show some decent batting . even ausies struggling on top but still they manage some decent score n put the pressure on oppositionon then y c n't india can do the same . <p> similar srilankan captain jayawadane he took some responsibilty for the team he promote himself on the top he doing well .. y c n't dhoni <p> stop blaming seniors/others do some thing your own .. /then proove you are the best .... <p> why the hell do we get involved in these trivia ? who cares what goes on between any two players , whoever they may be ? we must only be interested on what happens ON THE FIELD . professional players get paid huge amounts . they ought to perform irrespective of their personal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be expected to be paid . PERFORM OR PERISH ! period . <p> Why doe they let Shewag go to press conferences anyway ? His comments do n't make sense and he is embarrassing to the whole nation , I can not get over his comments that we have not changed over the " last 10 years " and we are " soft " . He has been unresponsible on the field and off the field . India is better without him . <p> AvidCricFan on February 24 , 2012 , 11:22 GMT <p> All statements now are window dressing . The cracks are out in public . Its diffcult to mend fences . If Shewag thinks that he has huge following that will accept his rationale , he is utterly wrong . He needs to focus on his primary responsibility of making runs as a batsmen and give his best on the field . He has miserably failed outiside of subcontinent for a while now to justify his inclusion in the team . In fact , BCCI should look at rebuilding the team grounds up with committed players @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desire to excel . <p> VinodGupte on February 24 , 2012 , 11:19 GMT <p> What is Fletcher doing ? Is he just a sock puppet ? Extremely disappointed with his performance . What a curse ! <p> on February 24 , 2012 , 11:06 GMT <p> sri lanka won and india out of tournament what a shame <p> Rajesh. on February 24 , 2012 , 10:58 GMT <p> Bring back Gary Kirsten ........... And sack all the media managers et all . If anything they only add to the confusion not resolve it <p> cricfanraj on February 24 , 2012 , 10:51 GMT <p> As fans may be we should stop reading nonsense in media and start concentrate on cricket which entertains us.This team made every indian dream on winning WC true and I support the team than listening to out dated / jobless ( sorry to be harsh ) retired cricketers / journalists who do n't undestand the game and only motto is to create sensation by making an issue out of everything . Hope team India does well on Sunday game and all this nonsense will die @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GMT <p> So there will be an article about what media manager said about something , gap between touring party and BCCI or Selectors , about rifts , hidden meanings of his words will be analysed . You could title that article as let us not forget . Actually let us not forget what happened this time because that should not happen once again . <p> GlobalCricketLover on February 24 , 2012 , 10:33 GMT <p> Only the dumb BCCI prez can think that it 's a misquoting by press ( when the live relay shows that there is a clear communication gap or at least ego issues ) . Has n't he seen the press conf relay ? If they can say this about such an open incident , imagine what they would be doing in the behind-the-scene financials ! ! <p> bigbenbigben on February 24 , 2012 , 10:25 GMT <p> Who else thinks Dhoni 's comments about slow fielding does not make sense ? I do n't because even if the 3 seniors ( GG , VS and SRT ) are cumulatively costing the team 20 runs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ average yields an extra 7 runs . So when you retain any 2 of them , you are only saving 7 runs in the field , not 20 ! So a Manoj Tiwari or Rohit Sharma or anyone else should be able to average 7 runs less than these 3 in order to be a worthwhile to the team ... <p> Looking at it another way , lets say we drop all 3 of GG , VS and SRT . That means the 3 newbies we induct into the team should score 20 runs less than the 3 on an average . Who has the confidence they will ? I do n't . At least no one on the horizon seems capable . So let Rohit Sharma and Tiwari wait and gain some experience in the non-crucial games .. In any case they will be in the team in another year or so ... <p> I usually like Dhoni but this time his statement on fielding did n't make logical sense . <p> on February 24 , 2012 , 10:19 GMT <p> schin is better than bradman and all know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on February 24 , 2012 , 10:01 GMT <p> GO India.India need to put behind all the frustration and pain and just look to go and play their natural game.Does'nt matter if they win or lose , they have the support of the fans.Just play a good game of cricket.Because it seems difficult but not impossible for India to reach the finals . <p> perl57 on February 24 , 2012 , 9:56 GMT <p> Accept it Siddharth you guys do not like BCCI and hence does not want Ind to win any more matches . Just question yourself , Mahela is playing ot of his skin while in his non captaincy days he was just a dud . This is not a news for media ? They did not even question this to him . But they are far more interested in poking this thing out . If Aus or SL media question this , then it is fair but mor0s like monga also keep making wild guesses . If India reaches final from here , then probably it has fought against media , umpires along with other teams to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as an Indian fan still will watch the matches . Media can dig a hole and bury themselves . <p> JustOUT on February 24 , 2012 , 9:48 GMT <p> The truth is , this Walia might hv been soccered btw two groups Dhoni vs Sehwag . And to forget abt the bashings he got from both the groups , he is asking everyone to forget all . haha . Watever is happening is good for Indian cricket , atleast now the players will realize they are not GREATER than GAME . <p> SanjivAwesome on February 24 , 2012 , 9:45 GMT <p> May be media should give the players a break and not read between the lines that have been uttered by the players .

So a Manoj Tiwari or Rohit Sharma or anyone else should be able to average 7 runs less than these 3 in order to be a worthwhile to the team ... <p> Looking at it another way , lets say we drop all 3 of GG , VS and SRT . That means the 3 newbies we induct into the team should score 20 runs less than the 3 on an average . Who has the confidence they will ? I do n't . At least no one on the horizon seems capable .

@@782240 <h> Geelani , LeT and the slow death of Kashmir 's azaadi dream <p> When former Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf visited India in April 2005 , he met with Kashmiri separatist leader Syed Ali Shah Geelani , as all visiting Pakistani leaders do , evidently to be seen to offering solidarity with the Kashmir cause . <p> At that meeting , according to narratives of those present , Musharraf sought to persuade Geelani that the days of open support for Kashmiri separatism , backed by patronage of terrorists spawned by Pakistan 's ISI , were over . <p> " The situation has changed , Geelani sahib , " Musharraf said . " We want you to be a part of the peace-building measures . " <p> But having given over his life to the cause of Kashmiri separatism , a cause that seemed at risk of dying out , Geelani saw this as Pakistan 's betrayal of Kashmir . He then went on the offensive , questioning Musharraf over his support for the US since September 2001 . An incensed Musharraf , a proud General who had himself done his damnedest to finger India over Kashmir and lost , resented Geelani 's criticism of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's patronage of the Lashkar -e-Taiba and other terrorist groups , of course , continued long after that meeting , and continues to this day . But the event may have marked one milestone in Geelani 's progression from a man who worked a crowd to chant " Hum Pakistani hai , Pakistan hamara hai " ( watch the video here ) to a tired old man who now confronts the realisation that his azaadi dream , fostered by years of Pakistani support , is now dying . <p> There is therefore a supreme irony about reports that Geelani faces a police investigation for having endorsed the Pakistan visa application of one of the three persons who were arrested on the charge that they were planning terrorist attacks in New Delhi . The police have alleged that the suspected terrorist underwent terrorism training in Pakistan . <p> The best defence that Geelani 's aides can come up with is that he gives many recommendations for Kashmiris to secure Pakistani visas , and does n't always know what the visitors go there for -- and to that extent Geelani can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyone who puts his signature down on any endorsement is staking his personal reputation , and for Geelani 's aides to claim otherwise -- now that Geelani stands accused of supporting the visa application of a suspected terrorist - is pious baloney . <p> Geelani 's frustration with Pakistan 's " abandonment " of the Kashmiri separatist cause -- at least in official interlocutions -- is manifesting itself in other ways . The man has in recent times taken to " advising " Pakistan not to crush the Balochi separatist movement , but instead talk to the leaders there . <p> Even Pakistani leaders have woken up to the realisation that when one 's beard is on fire , it is folly to ask for a match to light one 's bidi . When Pakistan itself stands at grave risk of balkanisation , and when the terrorists that it spawned in Kashmir today pose an existential threat to the Pakistani state , the lust for Kashmir appears to have abated ( although the ISI-military is still stirring the pot ) . But that rationale has n't yet dawned on Geelani @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ winter months , Geelani has been hibernating in New Delhi , where he has been meeting mainstream political leaders and civil society representatives and thinktanks . <p> Some observers see this as a " mellowing " of Geelani , although there is no compelling evidence of that . He is still lobbying diplomats in Delhi , and working to present his warped view of Indian " occupation " of Kashmir to whoever is willing to listen to his outpourings . <p> But his increasingly vociferous criticism of Pakistan over Kashmir comes at a time when India 's relations with Pakistan have ironically been on the slow mend . Most recently , it found expression in the Pakistan government 's articulation of its resolve to grant Most Favoured Nation status to trade with India , a move that LeT leaders -- and their masterminds in the ISI and the Pakistani military -- oppose . <p> The tortured history of India and Pakistan suggests that whenever bilateral relations between the two improve , the forces that oppose the normalisation process crawl out of the woodworks . The November 2008 terrorist outrage in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if things are on the mend , the red flags too should come out . <p> Politicians like Mani Shankar Aiyar like to criticise those in India too that oppose the process of normalisation of relations with Pakistan -- and equate them with the Lashar-e-Taiba . Yet , Aiyar can not get himself to criticise the perverted politics of Geelani , who too resents the peaceable overtures between India and Pakistan on the ground that it amounts to a " betrayal " of the Kashmir cause . <p> Over the decades , the Indian government may have played its cards all wrong in Kashmir , and the sense of alienation among Kashmiri people may be very real . But secessionists like Geelani have if anything made it worse for the Kashmiri people by their open embrace of Pakistan 's perfidious role in Kashmir . <p> It 's good to know that Geelani no longer sees Pakistan as Kashmir 's " saviour " . But as contrition for his past follies , Geelani must , if he has truly mellowed down , go one step further . He should publicly acknowledge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his followers to chant " Hum Hindustani hai , Hindustan hamara hai . " <p> He owes that , at the very least , to the Kashmiri people he has misled all these decades .

It also signaled the intensification of the battle over our food future . <p> At about the same time the Prime Minister was reported to have said that opposition to Genetically Modified ( GM ) foods is being led by some foreign funded NGOs which do not fully appreciate India 's development challenges . Manmohan Singh 's remark was apparently made in reply to a question about why India has imposed a moratorium on Bt Brinjal . <p> Groups from seven states across India came together to organise the first of its kind Seed Festival at Janata Kendra near Mumbai Central Station from February 19 to 21 . <p> Through talks , an exhibit of seed diversity and interactions with seed savers - the festival aimed to raise awareness about the importance of our bio-diversity , native seeds and many different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ varieties have been crafted by human-nature interaction to provide food and livelihoods in India 's diverse regions and cultures . Over the last 50 years this diversity has been depleted by the technology and policies promoted by governments and agro-industry . <h> Seed festival and India <p> Over the years samples of traditional seed varieties came to be stocked mostly in distant gene banks , to which most farmers do n't have ready access . <p> Thus conserving and multiplying traditional seeds among ordinary farmers has become the mission of a wide variety of activists . <p> This Seed Festival was part of a larger effort to raise public awareness and policy support for the conservation and promotion of India 's seed wealth and its related community knowledge and culture . <p> Much of this mobilisation is inspired by the work of Dr. R.H. Richharia , an agricultural scientist who did pioneering work to collect , converse and study thousands of distinct rice varieties around Raipur , Chhattisgarh . Mumbai 's Seed Festival was coordinated by the Richharia Campaign , which works primarily in Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Andolan a collective of small farmers in Uttarakhand who promote holistic agriculture on traditional principles and have preserved about 200 local varieties of rice , beans , millets and other crops . <p> Sahaja Samrudha , which means ' bountiful nature ' , is a group doing similar work in Karnataka . <p> Pebble Garden , a group at Auroville near Pondicherry , which has turned six acres of eroded wasteland into a forest rich in fruit trees and hardy plant varieties for home gardening . <p> Sambhav , at Nayagarh Orissa is engaged in in-situ conservation and promotion of rice and vegetable diversity . <p> They were supported by the Mumbai based Alliance for Sustainable and Holistic Agriculture ( ASHA ) , Farmers ' Market , and Mumbai Organic Farmers and Consumers ' Association ( MOFCA ) among others . <h> Seed festival and India <p> Such initiatives are inspired and driven by some staggering data . For example , the earth is estimated to have about 80,000 edible species of plant , many of which are available in numerous varieties . <p> According to Bharat Mansata of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ festival , now just about 25 plant species supply 90 percent of the human diet of the planet as a whole . This shrinkage of varieties means that our food future is endangered both in terms of nutritional value and security . <p> Take for example the epidemic of diabetes in India . Many Indians may have an inherited susceptibility to the disease . <p> But the dramatic escalation of the disease is also partly a consequence of the dependence on just wheat and rice as staple cereals - with a corresponding decline in the consumption of other cereals and millets . <p> Dependence on fewer varieties of plants is also bad in terms of risk management - as and when diseases strike the staple plants we have few other options to fall back on . <h> Seed festival and India <p> Overshadowing all this is the bitter dispute about genetically modified ( GM ) crops .

Why , ask the activists , has the Indian government signed the Indo-US Knowledge Initiative in Agriculture which will reshape India 's agricultural research and revamp its policies based on US-AID recommendations ?

" <p> Therefore , the Festival also included a workshop at IIT-Mumbai on the need for a framework to protect the " genetic and knowledge commons in farming and indigenous communities " . <p> The workshop considered the various ways in which free exchange of genetic resources among farmers has been curtailed by intellectual property regimes pushed through the World Trade Organization ( WTO ) and other global bodies . <h> Seed festival and India 's food politics <p> Activist groups are asking for an appropriate frame work to protect the inalienable natural rights of people to their common resource and knowledge . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the realm of information technology and seek to apply its principles to knowledge about farming practices . <p> A Seed Festival bringing together such a range of activist groups from across the country might happen once in a while .

India ' s defence forces have always been unwaveringly under civilian government control ( under the supreme command of the President of India ) both in their primary role on the borders and also in their secondary role in aid to the civil power when called upon to do so . <p> In the defence sector , India has looked abroad only insofar as purchase of weapons , weapon platforms , weapon systems and military equipment are concerned , never for foreign military presence on Indian soil to assist in meeting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That is the measure of the country 's confidence in its Defence Services ' capacity to carry out their primary and secondary duties .

Among other things , it guides government on all issues pertaining to the power and authority ( sovereignty ) of the State , including ? entering into treaties and agreements with foreign countries ? . Accordingly , two major strategic agreements were signed between USA and India , namely : <p> # New Framework Agreement for U.S-India Defence Relationship , between the U.S Secretary of Defense and the Indian Defence Minister , on June 28 , 2005 ; <p> # U.S-India Joint Agreement signed between U.S President George W. Bush and India ' s Prime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The strategic agreements included civil nuclear co-operation , the Knowledge Initiative in Agriculture ( KIA ) , and closer military ties . However , in India , public and media attention was focussed on the 123 Agreement pertaining to nuclear power , which was vociferously opposed mainly by the CPI(M) , and the other components went almost un-noticed . There were problems within USA too , for having signed a 123 Agreement with India , which was not a signatory to the NPT . <p> Possibly to overcome the alarm at home , a legislation titled ? ? Henry J. Hyde United States-India Peaceful Atomic Energy Cooperation Act of 2006 ' ' came into force in USA on January 3 , 2006 . Though this legislation is not binding on India , its stated India-specificity caused alarm in India . This was because even though USA had signed very similar 123 Agreements with other countries like the one signed with India , there was no country-specific U.S legislation that laid down strategic conditionalities like the Hyde Act does . The Hyde Act speaks of making the 123 Agreement subject @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ USA and to ? s ecure India 's full and active participation in U.S efforts to ... sanction and contain Iran ... ? as a matter of U.S policy . Note 1 . <p> U.S President George W. Bush visited India in March 2006 and , with Indian PM Dr.Manmohan Singh , signed a Joint Statement on India-USA Strategic Partnership . A photograph taken on March 2 , 2006 , commemorating this historic event has been interpreted as the body language of ? big-brotherhood ? . Indeed , in the current context of PM Dr.Manmohan Singh calling public attention to a ? foreign hand ? supporting the anti-nuclear agitation at Koodankulam and the anti-GM upsurge across the country , the photograph seems to draw precisely the same counter . The PM 's accusation amounts to claiming that foreign funding ( even if this is actually happening ) of indigenous protests against India 's nuclear and GM programs advanced as part of the India-USA Strategic Agreement , is an attack on the Indian goverment 's sovereignty , and hence is anti-national . Note 2 . <p> Thus far , the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( nuclear and GM ) have been discussed . It is now necessary to examine the third , namely , the military co-operation component . <p> March 2 , 2006 <p> Military cooperation and ties ... and sovereignty <p> No nation can stand alone in modern times . In relations between nations , history ( including armed invasions and migrations ) , culture , religion , ethnicity , language , economics , etc. , all play their role in national strategy that is designed to maintain the sovereignty and integrity of each nation . The military of a nation thus maintains relations , which may be co-operative , neutral or adversarial , with other militaries , depending on national strategy . In democracies in which the military is under the control of an elected government as in India , military strategy and doctrine is subservient to national strategy . Thus India 's military has contacts with the other militaries of the world through a variety of means such as : diplomatic through military attaches ; exchange or deputation of military personnel for training &amp; familiarization ; exchange programs for senior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as in UN operations ; observer status in military exercises ; and joint military exercises . These contacts are all sanctioned by the national government , specifically the Ministry of Defence ( MoD ) , through its bureaucratic machinery . Whatever one 's opinion of the attitude or functioning of India ' s bureaucracy ( justified or not , most military officers take a jaundiced view of the bureaucracy ) , it remains the means by which the national political leadership and the military ordinarily communicate with each other . <p> In September 2010 , when Adm Willard , U.S PACOM Commander visited India , he proposed to expand the existing defence engagement of co-operation and inter-operability between the U.S and Indian militaries to a ? much richer dialogue ? including the Logistics Support Agreement ( LSA ) and Communications Inter-operability and Security Memorandum of Agreement ( CISMOA ) , to go " beyond bilateral exercises and sale of military hardware " . Ref 2 , 3 . And in order to do so more efficiently , Adm Willard 's suggestion , in blatant interference in India ' s affairs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ armed forces to work with each other " . Here was a U.S military commander openly trying to wean India ' s military away from civilian control exercised through the bureaucratic machinery . Knowing the present UPA government 's proclivities , it is not surprising that there was not even a squeak of protest where there should have been a ticking-off of Adm Willard and USA ' s ambassador in India summoned to receive a strong formal protest . This was failure of the Indian government to assert national sovereignty . <p> About 18 months later on March 3 , 2012 , Indian mainstream newspapers reported that Adm Willard ( the same U.S PACOM commander who had wanted to slice away bureaucratic procedures from India-USA military ties ) had stated that U.S Special Forces were positioned in India . BBC News on March 2 , 2012 &lt; **44;634;TOOLONG &gt; reported that Willard told a U.S Congressional hearing , ? We have currently special forces assist teams - Pacific assist teams is the term - laid down in Nepal , Bangladesh , Sri Lanka , Maldives , as well as India @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are working very closely with India with regard to their counter-terrorism capabilities and in particular on the maritime domain but also government to government , not necessarily department of defence but other agencies assisting them in terms of their internal counter-terror and counter-insurgency challenges ? . <p> Adm Willard 's statement was clarified by the U.S Embassy in India saying that the troops were not stationed in India , and was also denied by India ' s Defence Ministry . The key word is ? stationed ? . U.S troops have in the past been sent to India for training , though it was not very clear whether U.S troops were training Indian troops or the other way around , but now Adm Willard 's statement that ? In the past months , the US has trained Indian counter-terrorist specialists ? , clarifies this . The U.S troops sent for training Indian troops can not be considered as stationed in India because their role is training and not operations . But Adm Willard 's admission that the U.S Special Forces troops are ? laid down ? in India confirms their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in an operational role is especially hazardous , for if any of them are killed in operations , it will form cause for USA to augment its military strength on Indian soil . These U.S troops would remain under U.S PACOM command and control , the Indian military having no say in their deployment or operational role . There have been precedents for such action in the past across the globe . Besides , the presence of foreign troops on Indian soil in an operational role is a slight on the Indian military and upon Indian sovereignty . <p> Denial both by the U.S Embassy and MoD of U.S Special Forces troops being ? positioned ? or ? stationed ? in India is ominous . Foreign troops on Indian soil in an operational role is undesirable for the morale of India ' s military , which upholds India ' s sovereignty . <p> Note 1 .

The central government should take the initiative to rehabilitate them inside and outside Gujarat like the migrants of Kashmir . Moreover , the origin of the fire that burnt coach no. 6 of Sabarmati Express is yet to be conclusively probed and established . It is time for the central investigative agencies to go into the origin and reality of this fire in S-6 . AIMMM salutes brave people like Zakia Jafari , Teesta Setalvad , Sanjiv Bhatt , Sreekumar and Mukul Sinha who continue the struggle for the victims of Gujarat . <p> Jammu &amp; Kashmir <p> AIMMM , after detailed deliberation on the situation in the J&amp;K , is of the view that the present apparent peace is managed by oppression .

Even the recent report of Interlocutors has not been made public so far . AIMMM demands the urgent release of political prisoners , implementation of the recommendations of the aforesaid five working groups and restoration of Autonomy as recommended by Justice Saghir Ahmed . AIMMM also stresses the immediate withdrawal of AFSPA from whole of Jammu &amp; Kashmir and Manipur where it has been misused to the hilt and has created a climate of fear for ordinary people and impunity for the men in uniform who are free to violate rights and kill innocents at will .

Surya Namaskar and the introduction of Gita in school syllabus are two clear examples of this policy which flies in the face of the country 's secular Constitution . The Central Govt. , through HRD ministry , should intervene and ensure that the secular ethos of the educational system all over India remains untouched . <p> Shia-Sunni riots <p> The AIMMM strongly condemns the Shia-Sunni riots which were engineered in Lucknow during the Prophet 's ( pbuh ) birthday celebrations on 5 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyone rekindling this extinguished fire is an enemy of Islam and Muslims .

Perhaps a survey of other cities across the country will come up with similar results . This speaks volumes about the discrimination faced by Muslim children in private schools . The AIMMM feels that just as the access of neighbourhood and weaker section students has been ensured through government rules for admission , minority students too should have a quota in these schools proportionate to their ratio in the local population .

While Israel remains in occupation and denial of Palestinian rights and continues to flout hundreds of UN resolutions , only skeletal diplomatic relations could be maintained with it . AIMMM is further alarmed at the continuous Israeli attempts to create a lobby within the Indian Muslim community , which is a very dangerous attempt to create a fifth column . <p> National Commission for Minorities Educational Institutions <p> The AIMMM condemns the recent divestment of the chairman of the National Commission for Minorities Educational Institutions ( NCMEI ) of his administrative and financial powers which only demonstrates the central government 's insincerity towards its avowed policy of promoting minority education .

@@788233 <h> The death of side roles in Bollywood <p> Last weekend , I watched Rajnikanth-starrer ' Sivaji ' on a TV channel . No , No ! I 'm not going to talk about the big-budgeted film . The point of discussion here is Mama , the character who shared screen with the superstar in most part of the film . The characters like Mama have become a rare species in Bollywood films these days . <p> A side character or a supporting role was among the various factors that used to ensure the success of Bollywood film earlier . They were anybody like the hero 's best friend , or his cousin or simply a die-hard follower . Sometimes they were Chachas and Mamas also . They were not just comic roles ; they used to complement the hero or heroine 's character in the films . They were either romance gurus of heroes or the next-door-friends of heroines who would help out the protagonists in difficult situations . <p> Actors like Mehmood , Rajendranath , Deven Varma and Asrani successfully played such side characters in hundreds of films . They used to decorate even the weak scripts , and therefore they had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many occasions , producers signed them even before signing the lead actor . It was a time when these side actors were more of an attraction than the heroes , who did not guarantee full houses . <p> During recent times , character actors like Johnny Lever and Rajpal Yadav ruled the Hindi film industry . Senior and talented actors like Amrish Puri , Paresh Rawal and Om Puri also played some memorable character roles in many films . They were not just the props , but very important elements in movie scripts . Most of the times , they were the scene-stealers . <p> These side actors might not be enough to sell a product but they did enhance its value . That 's why they could be seen on film posters , irrespective of the presence of big stars . These days a few actors like Vinay Pathak and Ranvir Shorey get to play such characters , but they are very limited in numbers . <p> Such dear-to-all characters , which enjoyed the respect and love of audiences for years , have now started vanishing from films ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changing pattern of filmmaking in recent years is seen as one of the reasons for their disappearance as more and more filmmakers are choosing to experiment with new ideas and make films on realistic themes . <p> Moreover , in the race to redefining stardom , Bollywood stars want their film scripts to focus around the central character only . After giving a couple of hits , these star actors start influencing and changing scripts to ensure enough screen presence for their character . Side characters or supporting roles are being omitted or ignored to portray the main protagonist as independent and more powerful . <p> The regional language cinema , however , has not completely done away with the supporting roles as side actors are doing quite well in South Indian films even today . <p> But in Bollywood , not only side actors but ' villains ' also have disappeared from Hindi films . There was a time when even a poster having Amrish Puri , Kader Khan , Amjad Khan , Shakti Kapoor or Gulshan Grover could give a spine-chilling experience to audiences . They had played @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they had become synonym to evil . But , with the changing times , the gap between good and bad has shortened and the second-rank actors are happy enough to play the negative characters , leaving no scope for the typical ' villains ' in the industry . <p> Change is a very natural process and it was sure to happen with Bollywood also . And nobody can argue that this change in storytelling has n't happened for good . But , at the same time , Munnabhai 's Circuit would tell you that this ' crazy-for-films ' nation loves to love the nice side guys , even today ! <p> Let 's not forget Anupam Kher . He played very good roles in films like Parinda &amp; Chandini . These days the remunerations of stars have gone so high that the producers are not able to afford the sidekick roles . Although there is friend circle for hero/heroine , usally they are unknowns . <p> The era of family cinema is definitely gone so that explains why previously important characters are dying out . It 's all gloss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not mean good story telling . And Heroines in the 1950s were less prop like then they are now which is sad . Bollywood flushes feminism down the drain better than anything else in India . <p> yea , let alone supporting actors , even ' number 1 ' heroines like Kareena are lucky if they get to play anything other than a bimbette with item-songs and 15 minutes of dialogue in those khan dominated movies . i do n't care about the fate of male side actors , when women in general are so marginalized in the media , humph . <p> well I think that actress are rare species than side actors . when do they serve other roles other than being pretty accessories in big budged films ? ? hey if they 're lucky they may get to be a plot device to move the story forward or get the hero character development . <p> I think when it comes to side actors or villain is again back to the actors them self . Could they work on the character or they just happy to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impact to the audience , some could stands out &amp; over shadowed the lead protagonist , such as recently Sanjay Dutt &amp; Rishi Kapoor in Agneepath . <p> I do n't agree with this , I do n't think side actors or character actors or villains have gone anywhere . But it 's true there are more types of films coming out and more filmmakers are experimenting , nothing wrong with that IMO ! : ) <p> Actually , i 'm glad the trend of stars being stereotyped as villains is over , it 's pretty silly and does not exactly help the actor show his versatility . Also , Jhonny lever is so un-funny , he always makes me cringe everytime he appears on screen . Indian comedies are generally in bad taste and rarely make me laugh , it 's better that we do n't have to suffer through the sidekick routine anymore . <p> earlier side actors would highlight lead actor 's " hero " image . for example Rajendranath would make Shammi Kapoor look macho or Laxmikant would help Salman look cool . But then Hero @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . Then came Johny Lever . He is such a power house of talent that many lead actors got insecure about his presence in their film . Now a days very few actors can carry film on their own . There are multi starers. 3-4 lead actors share screen space taking turns playing lead and comic relief . <p> I think Bollywood created this self righteous people who start to believe their own hype and think that they alone are the reason crowd rush into cinema to watch movies . I will blame the media as well , they play major role in hyping this talent-less heroes and start childs to max and make supporting actors/actress look insignificant .

This was my first co-ed school and all I did was share study notes with her . Then , I changed schools and went to a boys ' school , from where I would complete my Class 12 . After that I never met my class crush -- I saw her a couple of times but never got to talk to her and that 's how it ended . <p> Then , in 1993 , SHE came to Kota -- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lived next door . The first year went well , being just friendly ; but the second year we did n't realise how close we suddenly became . It was in the months of August and September that we started going on dates . It was our fifth time on a date , when we had our first kiss . <p> First we went for fast food and them to a temple a kilometre away from our homes . It was the day of Janmashtami and Durga Pooja was arriving within a month . After visiting the temple , we visited a garden at a little distance . We walked together and chatted and finally sat down on a bench . <p> The conversation was about love , romance and feelings . As we spoke , we got closer and closer to each other -- I 'll never forget that moment in my lifetime . Slowly we kissed each other and remained in that position for about three minutes . After that , when we returned to our homes , neither of us slept that night . <p> We were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our bad luck that her father was transferred to Ahmedabad ( Gujarat ) . I spoke to her on the phone thrice after she left -- and then we never spoke or met again . Four years later , my family shifted back to Ranchi and today I 'm married to someone else -- her sweet name is Kanchan and I am also blessed with a four-year-old son , Devansh . <h> ' He was really shocked ' <p> I got married four years ago . My first kiss was really exciting and thrilling . <p> It was our second family meeting at my place . Our parents were talking and we went to my room upstairs , with their permission . Unfortunately , his elder brother came along with us . We were chit-chatting and after a few minutes , we sent his brother back downstairs . <p> I was sitting at a 10-foot distance from him . After getting rid of all my shyness and fear , I went and sat next to him and took his hand . He looked at me and held it tight . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went back to my seat . He was really shocked and my hands were shaking . He returned home and texted me that " it was an awesome kiss " .

Yes , says the government , acknowledging that Mr Trivedi has not resigned yet . But the Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee also acknowledged that the Prime Minister has received a letter from Mr Trivedi 's boss , Mamata Banerjee , asking for his removal .

" Sources say this was meant to indicate that the party will not be content with Mr Trivedi resigning , it wants him to be fired . <p> But the opposition pointed out that the drama over Mr Trivedi is an unprecedented political crisis . " Is he the Railways Minister and is the budget he presented yesterday alive or dead ? " asked the BJP 's Sushma Swaraj . Other leaders pointed out that even as Parliament was discussing Mr Trivedi 's status , MPs from his party were on a dharna outside against the minister and the new fares he announced in his Railways Budget yesterday . This is a theatre of the absurd , " said the BJP 's Arun Jaitley <p> This morning , sources said that the Congress had given in to Ms Banerjee 's two big demands : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mukul Roy as Railways Minister , and that the increased fares would be rolled back , at least for the cheaper tickets . However , Mr Mukherjee has urged Ms Banerjee to wait for these changes till after the union budget is presented tomorrow . But Ms Banerjee is not known for compromises . So her party members have begun a protest at parliament , demanding that the hike in passenger fares be reversed . They also want a financial package from the centre for West Bengal , which is seeped in debt . Among the Trinamool Congress leaders on " strike " at Parliament is the man tipped to be the next Railways Minister , Mr Roy . <p> Even as that drama continues , Ms Banerjee is needling the Congress on another front . A group of MPs from her party will meet the Prime Minister today . " We will convey we are upset with the NCTC , " said Sudip Bandhopadhyay , who will be among them .

Earlier this week , President Pratibha Patil outlined for parliament the agenda of the government . Ms Banerjee wants the term " NCTC " to be deleted from that address . The BJP has filed similar amendments . What that means is that the BJP will push for a vote .

@@806233 <p> With its muddy roads , humble huts , and constant military patrols , Bajo Agu ? n , Honduras feels a long way away from the slick polish of the recurring UN climate negotiations in the world 's capital cities . Yet the bloody struggle going on there strikes at the heart of global climate politics , illustrating how market schemes designed to " offset " carbon emissions play out when they encounter the complicated reality on the ground . <p> Small farmers in this region have increasingly fallen under the thumb of large landholders like palm oil magnate Miguel Facuss ? , who has been accused by human rights groups of responsibility for the murder of numerous campesinos in Bajo Agu ? n since the 2009 coup . Yet Facuss ? ' s company has been approved to receive international funds for carbon mitigation under the UN 's Clean Development Mechanism ( CDM ) . <p> The contrast between the promise of " clean development " and this violent reality has made Bajo Agu ? n the subject of growing international attention -- and a lightning rod for criticism of the CDM . <p> The Coup and Its Aftermath <p> In June @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Manuel Zelaya , stymieing the government 's progressive social reforms and experiments with participatory democracy . " It was not only to expel President Zelaya , " says Juan Almendarez , a prominent Honduran environmental and humanitarian advocate . The coup happened " because the powerful people in Honduras were acting in response to the people 's struggles in Honduras . " <p> The result has been social decay and political repression . The homicide rate in Honduras has skyrocketed under the Porfirio Lobo regime , registering as the world 's highest in 2010 . Human rights groups highlight the ongoing political assassinations of regime opponents . In this small country of 8 million people , 17 journalists have been killed since the coup . LGBTI organizers , indigenous rights activists , unionists , teachers , youth organizers , women 's advocates , and opposition politicians have also received death threats or been killed . Those responsible are rarely punished by the justice system , which instead devotes its energies to prosecuting social and human rights activists . Protests are often met with teargas canisters and live ammunition . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ activists seeking to halt the encroachment of large landowners on their farms . <p> The Struggle for Land in Bajo Agu ? n <p> Highly unequal land distribution has long been an issue in Honduras , and genuine land reform has been evasive . However , partial agrarian reform in 1961 made the rainforests of Bajo Agu ? n available for cooperatives of farmers who migrated there from other parts of the country . Clearing the forests to make the land suitable for farming was extremely difficult work , but the farmers ' perseverance turned it into one of the most desirable and fertile agricultural lands in the country . <p> However , under pressure from international financial institutions , Honduras 's government passed the Law of Agricultural Modernization in 1994 , allowing large producers to extend their territories beyond the maximum legal property limits . As a result , large landowners began to buy up the land of small farmers , effectively reversing whatever limited land reform had been achieved . The human costs were immense . According to Juan Chinchilla of the Unified Campesino Movement of Aguan ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ migrate to the cities and to the U.S. under terrible conditions . " <p> An older movement , the MCA ( Campesino Movement of Aguan ) , has organized several dramatic acts of resistance to this dislocation . In May 2000 , the collective orchestrated a remarkable mass occupation of a former U.S. military base on a large tract of arable land controlled by agro-industrialists . Coordinating with landless farmers from all over the country , the MCA organized 50 trucks and , early one morning , entered the former base and tore down its fences . This occupation continues today , despite threats and persecution . <p> In 2008 , MUCA occupied one of Miguel Facuss ? ' s palm oil processing plants and subsequently entered into negotiations with then-President Zelaya to have occupied lands legally transferred to small farmers . When the coup occurred and jeopardized these hard-won gains , landless farmers mobilized against it , with MUCA officials travelling to the Nicaraguan border to meet Zelaya on his second attempt to return to Honduras . It was there that MUCA decided to organize a mass land occupation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this resistance , aggressive landholders buoyed by the coup have continued their onslaught against the farmers of Bajo Agu ? n . According to the Inter-American Commission of Human Rights , 42 farmers were assassinated between September 2009 and October 2011 in Honduras . More recent reports have the numbers in the 50s by 2011 . In one surprisingly brazen incident in November 2010 , after five farmers were killed in El Tumbador , Facuss ? gave a press statement acknowledging that it was his hired security guards who were responsible . <p> A community member from the Mara ? ones settlement in Bajo Agu ? n described an eviction of small farmers from the Guanch ? a cooperative on 8 January 2010 , carried out by a contingent of 500 police and soldiers with teargas and guns : " It was a violent eviction where they had nothing legal to show us ; the first greetings they gave us were the weapons . They began to shoot at us , to capture and beat our compa ? eros . There were captured children , nine of them ... compa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our food -- they took part of it and destroyed the other parts . " <p> Almost every farmer I interviewed said that it was unsafe to leave their settlements . The countryside is dotted with military checkpoints , and farmers have been killed travelling to or from their settlements . " The way we see it , it has become a crime to be a farmer here , " Heriberto Rodr ? guez of MUCA explained . There have been at least four military operations in the area since 2010 . <p> Palm Oil and Power <p> Bajo Agu ? n 's small farmers are already under siege . But carbon trading with the global North could help to fuel in this aggression even further under the Clean Development Mechanism ( CDM ) . Set up under the current UN climate treaty , the CDM is supposed to encourage " clean " technology in the South and to provide Northern actors with the most efficient ( i.e. , cheapest ) way to reduce global pollution . The basic equation is simple : a project in the global South that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can then be bought and sold by companies in the global North , who can use them to meet government requirements to reduce pollution without actually reducing emissions in their factories or power plants . <p> Dinant , Facusse 's palm oil company , has set up one of these projects . In the past , the company 's palm oil mill pumped its waste into large open pits , a process that produces large quantities of methane . Dinant 's project involves capturing this greenhouse gas and using it to power the mill . The project 's blueprint claims that it will reduce pollution in two ways : first , by not letting the methane from open pits escape straight into the atmosphere , and second , by preventing pollution from burning the fossil fuels that were formerly used to power the mill . <p> Dinant 's approval is obviously problematic for a number of reasons . <p> First , with the expanding palm oil industry contributing to massive deforestation in sensitive tropical regions , it 's ironic that Dinant would be rewarded for environmentally sound practices . Moreover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ producing palm oil for export -- instead of food for local consumption -- in a country where one in four children suffers chronic malnutrition . As Heriberto Rodr ? guez argued , " We do n't need palm oil here . We need what we can eat . " <p> Finally , if Wikileaks cables detailing some of Facuss ? ' s more unsavory dealings -- including but not limited to his potential links to drug traffickers ( to say nothing of his documented violence against local farmers ) -- are any indication , Facuss ? ' s misdeeds are no secret to the North . And yet one CDM board member told a journalist that " we are not investigators of crimes " and that there is " not much scope " to reject the project under CDM rules . <p> As rights groups have brought these problems to light , Northern companies associated with the project have pulled out one by one , including a consultant that contributed to the project application , the German government bank that had agreed to give a loan to Dinant , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ credits . This has left Miguel Facuss ? and Dinant out on a limb . However , the struggle to stop European carbon market money from flowing to Bajo Agu ? n is not finished : the CDM board has re-approved the project , and the British government has not withdrawn its support , which means that new buyers could still appear . <p> Not for Sale <p> At an international human rights conference in February , MUCA signed an agreement with the Lobo regime that included a financing plan for the farmers to pay the large landholders for occupied land . But critics say that even if the government can be trusted ( itself a questionable proposition ) , the crucial issues of assassinations and impunity were ignored . Facuss ? ' s company is now accusing farmers of new " invasions . " <p> Needless to say , the situation in Bajo Agu ? n continues to be incredibly dangerous . Local rights groups have called for a Permanent Human Rights Observatory to witness , document , and discourage the ongoing violence against farmers in the region . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Dinant to access carbon market money , the project remains officially sanctioned , and loans from international development banks have not been cancelled . Heriberto Rodr ? guez , speaking from his roadside hut in an Agu ? n settlement , had no doubt about the impact of this international support : " Whoever gives the finance to these companies also becomes complicit in all these deaths . If they cut these funds , the landholders will feel somewhat pressured to change their methods . " <p> MUCA spokesperson Vitalino Alvarez rejects the idea of carbon trading projects altogether . " To get into these deals is like having our land mortgaged , " he said . " So to this we say no ; this oxygen , we do n't sell it to anybody .

Rajeshkumar memorial lecture on the topic ' Media and people 's agitations ' at the Thiruvananthapuram Press Club on Thursday . <p> The media , which has the power to make or break a movement , should ask itself which face of India it is projecting . Large sections of the media projected Anna Hazare 's anti-corruption movement as a never-before phenomenon . The hype and the hysteria generated on this was incredible . Similar was the treatment given to the agitation by Baba Ramdev . <p> " But which were the faces seen associated with such movements ? Middle-class intellectuals , academics , and human rights activists . Most of them belonged to the upper castes . When a team was set up to draft a bill , there was no place in it for a Dalit , for the religious minorities , and there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The faces commonly seen in discussions on TV channels were the same . He asked where the faces and voices of the Adivasis , their women , the Dalits , and the fishermen were . " A fresh concept of a people 's movement is needed ; one from the perspective of the victims , the oppressed " he said . <p> Conventional political parties had failed the subaltern population of India . There was nothing left in the Left politics and there was nothing right with the Right , he pointed out . <p> " The CPI(M) views any new type of public movement with suspicion and tries to suppress it . Chengara is a good example , " Bishop Coorilos said . <p> " Why are mainstream political parties afraid of , say , a Gothra Mahasabha ? Why is their sense of democracy not sought to be understood ? What is wrong with a decentralised notion of power ? Not the World Bank 's People 's Planning , " he pointed out . <p> Tools of Marxian analysis developed mostly for Europe could not be applied as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ignore the caste question in the country , they would remain confined to Kerala and West Bengal . It was time the Left took Ambedkar seriously . It had not so far accepted his critique of Marx . <p> Caste inequality should be tackled alongside economic inequality , he added . <h> @ Lakshmi , sorry for your poor understanding of the matter in whole . If H.G. Mor Coorilos was trying to fish in troubled waters , he should have tried to side with either left or right , regardless to his position in church , as a member of the society he have all the right to express his views . Even from the religious point of view he is called for liberating the people from their sufferings , if any one thinks that the assignment of a bishop is just confined in carrying out the sacraments it is their conceptual error about the position and Christianity in general . Also be informed that Mor Coorilos is not a person sitting in the comfortable room and make irresponsible statements , you must check his activities . Again with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that any apolitical movements should be approached with great caution as most of them are not transparent regarding their sources , most anti-politics movements are supported by large corporates or other fundamental groups . <p> from : Santhosh Mathew <p> Posted on : Mar 17 , 2012 at 19:05 IST <h> Fishing in troubled waters is a pastime for the uncouth politicians . What on earth is an ordained bishop of a religion doing that for ? I hold no brief for Anna Hazare or Baba Ramdev but nobody was specifically invited nor was anybody prevented from participating in their anti corruption rallies. ! !

@@806240 <h> U.S. , EU and Japan File WTO Case against China 's Rare Earth Quotas <p> Mar. 16 -- The United States , together with the European Union and Japan , launched an official case with the World Trade Organization ( WTO ) earlier this week protesting China 's export restrictions on rare earths . <p> The latest complaint comes after the EU successfully resolved a similar dispute at the WTO in January this year regarding Chinese export restrictions on other industrial materials , including zinc , bauxite and magnesium . <p> U.S. President Barack Obama 's current administration has consistently taken a firm stance on fair trade practices with particular regard to China which it claims subjects U.S. businesses to " unfair practices . " <p> " We 've got to take control of our energy future and we can not let that energy industry take root in some other country because they were allowed to break the rules , " Obama said at a Rose Garden press conference on Tuesday . <p> However , Beijing has strongly defended its management of the country 's rare earths . <p> " China has maintained a certain volume of rare earths for exports every year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Foreign Affairs Spokesman Liu Weimin . " In the future also , China will continue to supply rare earths for the global market according to the WTO rules . " <p> China 's Industry Minister Miao Wei also told the country 's state-run news agency Xinhua that the country was " actively preparing to defend ourselves " against the WTO complaints and denied the quotas were trade protectionism . <p> " We feel sorry for their decision to complain to the WTO , " Miao said . <p> Rare earths are a group of 17 minerals which are essential components in the manufacturing of high-tech devices , from mobile phones to renewable energy equipment . <p> Some experts , however , have pointed out that the scarcity of these rare earths has been greatly exaggerated and that " rare earths " is somewhat of a misnomer . Some of the minerals are as common as copper and even some of the rarest can be found in greater quantities than other precious metals , including gold and platinum . <p> China is not the only source of rare earths , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ production because mining in the country is very cheap and standards are lower than in other countries . Beijing officials are expected to use this fact to combat accusations that it holds a monopoly on some of the world 's most precious resources . <p> The Chinese foreign ministry said it hopes " other countries with rare earths will also actively develop their rare earth resources to share the burden of global rare earth supplies . " <p> One of the key issues for the group of developed nations filing the case against China is that the country 's export restrictions on rare earth materials present a threat to global resource security . However , another point China will be sure to make is that shipments of rare earths coming out of China in 2011 only filled around 60 percent of the quota . Prices have also fallen due to a combination of weakening demand from stagnating Western economies and the development of the rare earth industries in the United States and Australia . <p> U.S. officials have said that although the immediacy of the issue has lessened due to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supply when the global economy does pick up , driving up demand . <p> Of the minerals comprising the rare earths group , it is the heavy earths that are in critically short supply . These are used to produce industrial magnets and other crucial components . But one of the driving forces behind China 's clampdown on the industry has been the aim of drastically reducing the damage it inflicts on the environment . The result has been sweeping mine closures and tight state control of the industry . <p> Chen Jiazuo , analyst at the Antaike consultancy in Beijing , said that the case might prompt Beijing to change its export and tariff policies . <p> " Based on previous experiences , the Chinese government will give in in the end , " Chen said . " But China 's regulation of the rare earths industry is reasonable . Its focus is to protect resources and the environment , and develop in a sustainable way . " <p> The European Union has pointed out that , although it supports environmental protection , foreign demand tends to be replaced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have no effect on environmental protection . <p> The European Union has had to manage a very delicate balancing act between making complaints on behalf of European companies who grudge paying the 42 percent export duties for rare earth materials , while simultaneously asking for China 's help in resolving the EU Sovereign Debt Crisis . <p> The United States , European Union and Japan may be taking a coordinated approach to avoid retaliation from China similar to that experienced by Japan in 2010 when China halted exports of rare earths temporarily due to a diplomatic dispute . <p> Japan is the largest importer of rare earths in the world and takes about 60 percent of all Chinese exports . As a result of increasing concerns about resource security , the Japanese government has introduced a 110 billion yen ( US$1.31 billion ) plan to develop new technologies which will decrease its reliance on rare earth imports by 30 percent in the medium to long term . <p> If China does n't reach a deal with the trio within 60 days , they will have the right to ask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lead to trade sanctions .

@@810240 <h> The toilets are stinking now and we are forced to pay money : regular users <p> Two years ago , at a huge gathering , the Union Minister for Fertilizers and Chemicals , M.K.

The idea of not charging the public was solely aimed at cultivating a habit among the masses to use toilets and not defecate in open areas in public places , " Mr. Alagiri maintained . <p> For their part , the then authorities in Corporation of Madurai earmarked land in places like Periyar bus stand , Maatuthavani , Arapalayam , Government Rajaji Hospital , Anna Bus Stand , Tirumalai Nayak Palace , Sellur and Arapalayam . The sponsors built the toilets , which had tiled floors and water facility , among others . Public welcomed it .

The so called SHGs are not only charging the public but also have failed to maintain them properly , users complain . <p> According to regular users , the toilets are stinking now . The public are forced to pay money for using the facility , but the custodians actually fail to keep them clean . S. Shabeer Khan , a student from Tirupalai , who comes to Periyar bus stand during weekends and works in a shop on a part-time basis , said that the government or civic body could collect a nominal fee but should maintain them well . <p> A staff , in-charge of the maintenance of a private sponsor 's toilet facility , said that they spent nearly Rs.15 lakh on establishing the facility . <p> " We did it in public interest . We had built @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out to Rs.20,000 , which included salaries for the conservancy workers , procurement of cleaning materials and payment of EB bill .

" <p> On an average , close to two lakh people used these 13 free-to-use toilets and the city 's open space(s) were free from the foul smell .

The idea of good politics is to keep the good initiatives and they should try to bring in additional new ideas for the benefit of the public .

@@812235 <p> New Delhi : Arpan Sheth , a partner with Bain and Co . India Pvt . Ltd and author of the Bain Philanthropy Report 2012 , speaks about emerging trends in Indian philanthropy . <p> While writing the report , what findings surprised you the most ? <p> I think there were two aspects of the insights I was surprised by this year . One is how Indians think about themselves in relation to philanthropy . Even though I would posit that they were novices , I 'd expected them to think of themselves as more experienced givers -- and it 's because many Indians have been giving for many years . I was very surprised that eight out of every 10 those we interviewed and surveyed said that " I 'm a novice to giving and I 'd like to do more . " <p> One striking aspect was around the hurdles to giving . I would have thought that the perception around the lack of accountability and transparency in NGOs would have been more or less static year over year . I 'm surprised to see the drop , and I think there are two potential answers : one is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realistic answer -- that folks know this is an issue . They know they have to do the due diligence and they are coping . <p> Your report found that nearly 78% of Indian families surveyed had at least one " young " family member ( under 30 ) actively involved in philanthropic decision-making , as compared to only 14% of American families . What do you think is behind this stark contrast ? <p> It 's quite a contrast when you compare it with the US . The survey done on this by the Center on Philanthropy at Indiana University in the US found that the role of children and younger relatives is lesser . I think this is because ( US ) philanthropists have a fairly well-formed view of who and what they want to give to , based on a lifetime of experiences . Their children and younger relatives , therefore , play a lesser role in the priorities of giving -- they may have them get involved with their existing priorities , but they are less influential in shaping the priorities . <p> In India , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creation and to giving . The first and second generation of wealth creators have been focusing on building businesses and , therefore , creating wealth . And secondly , you think of Indian culture -- we are a very family-oriented culture . The family unit means a lot -- there 's more respect for elders , and they listen to their children . So it 's a natural outcome for novice givers -- that they begin to take the views of their children and their younger relatives in mind in terms of where to give . It 's a natural thing . <p> Why do you think so many of India 's young wealthy individuals are becoming interested in philanthropy ? <p> Most of the respondents came from families that created wealth in the past decade . My hypothesis is that if you are a young wealthy Indian , you are cognizant that you are a privileged individual . Everyday you look around and you see the poverty and need around you , and these younger givers know that the role of government is constrained by resources -- there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it may also be cultural . The older members may not be that focused on philanthropy because they are focused on building their careers and businesses . The younger generation is often more educated -- they may have been educated in the West -- and they are influenced by that and all these factors come into play . <p> What does it mean for India 's philanthropic sector that many giving decisions are being driven by under-30s ? <p> There are two significant things here . There 's the fact that young Indians are getting involved , and there 's the fact that eight out of 10 people are saying that " Yes , I 'm a novice giver . " What that means is philanthropic organizations need to spend more time nurturing givers , working with them , advising them and increasing their competence levels , as well as doing a lot more with regard to basic education and cultivation of a donor in India as compared with the US . Another thing I can tell you for sure is that more younger people than older people intend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 'll give more in the next 12 months versus 49% of older philanthropists . We also asked will your quantum of giving go up over the next five years : 66% said it would go up 10% or more in the next five years .

@@814236 <h> What consumer price index means for you <p> If you do your own eggs and milk shopping everyday , you would know that egg prices have been rising steadily through 2011 and are 10% higher than last year and that milk prices are 20-25% higher . Not to mention the increase in your house rent , which in most parts of the country rises by at least 10% each year . <p> So although we saw the wholesale price index ( WPI ) move up , we know that the real change in prices of things we spend on was higher . Till last year , we had no way to record what the retail price inflation was . This year a new consumer price index or CPI has been introduced to measure inflation . <p> We all know that inflation is hitting us as household bill amounts get higher and higher . But what does the CPI mean to you ? The urban CPI for February came in at 9.45% . Does it mean your food articles are more expensive by 9.45% ? Or is it utilities or house rent ? And it is more expensive compared with what ? <p> How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CPI is like your shopping basket . It is a selection of goods and services which show what you spend on . Since it 's a nationwide aggregate , the basket tries to represent an average individual and is not specific to you . There are two baskets , one for an urban consumer and another for a rural consumer and then there is a combined basket to represent both together . The idea behind building this basket is to see how the prices of items in it have changed over the years . This change is shown as a percentage and is the inflation you face . <p> Each separate item in this basket has a value . The first time an item is picked , its value is pegged at 100 ( in this case , the basket is valued starting in the year 2010 ) and then moves according to price change every year . For example , you know how expensive milk has become ; in two years from 2010 January to 2012 January , the index of dairy products has moved from 100 to 122.4 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your shopping by moving from one section such as frozen foods to another such as soaps and shampoo , the CPI basket also groups individual items into sub-groups . For example , food , beverages and tobacco is a sub-group , which includes products such as fish and meat , cereals and vegetables . Clothing , bedding and footwear is another sub-group , which includes items like footwear . All these together make a complete basket . In the new CPI , there are five such sub-groups . <p> So , the final cost of the basket depends on the price of individual items and the space they occupy ( weightage ) . <p> What 's more expensive this month <p> Illustration by Shyamal Banerjee and graphic by Yogesh Kumar <p> The new CPI basket for inflation has been in use for two months now . And no surprises , data shows the inflation basket costs more mainly on account of higher prices from items other than basic food articles . This is happening because you are spending more on packaged food and activities other than eating at home . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as sugar remain low , vegetable prices are actually seen to be falling . On the other hand , oil , proteins and dairy products are all getting more expensive . <p> Says Dharmakirti Joshi , chief economist , CRISIL , " These categories are linked to changing foods habits . Higher incomes have meant more demand but the supply does n't match up leading to higher prices . " <p> Other non-food items such as clothing , housing , fuel and house requisites are all showing double-digit inflation for both January and February . This is raising the average price of the basket and pulling inflation higher . <p> Although these items individually occupy a small space in the basket , together they constitute a large part of it . Thus , if costs for these items rise together they can make the aggregate cost of the basket much higher . Agreed Joshi , who said high prices in these categories can keep inflation high and if along with that vegetable and cereal prices also flare up , then we can see sharp spikes in inflation . <p> Similarly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ space ( high weightage ) can be low if its prices are rising slowly . Sample this , the item cereals and products contributed only around .06% to the overall inflation despite a weight of 8.73% in the basket on account of low price rise . <p> How is CPI different from WPI ? <p> Until now , " inflation " was a reference to the WPI , which is also a basket of products where price changes are compared annually . But the items put in the WPI basket are very different from that in the CPI basket . As the name suggests , the former is a wholesale basket of goods and nearly 65% of it is occupied by manufactured goods , which include things such as metals , chemical products , rubber , machinery and parts . <p> You wo n't find these items in your regular shopping list right ? So the CPI basket , which includes items such as prepared meals and clothing and services such as healthcare and education , is more like your shopping basket and relates more to you . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ articles , but here too the CPI focuses mainly on end-consumption related items , whereas the WPI has a mix . <p> Says N.R. Bhanumurthy , professor , National Institute of Public Finance and Policy , " A substantial difference between the two is the presence of the housing index within the CPI , which was missing in the WPI . There is some linkage between the two indices as wholesale prices ultimately get reflected in retail prices , albeit with a lag . This is what happened with vegetable prices , WPI showed a softening from January and this is now reflected in the CPI . " <p> Do n't just look at the final number <p> The final inflation number published for the CPI every month gives you an estimate of how the price of the entire basket has changed compared with the same month last year . To make sense of this number in relation to your expenses , it helps to know the list of items included in the index and their weightage or the space that they occupy in the basket . <p> Says Bhanumurthy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If the housing index has a high weightage it will reflect more in the overall inflation figure . " The magnitude of impact on you will depend on your personal basket of products and services . <p> It is early days to judge the credibility of this index . Even so , this is a critical figure for shaping monetary policy decisions and the interest rate regime . <p> Additionally , knowing the details of what is in the basket can help you understand which aspect of your living expenses are getting dearer and at what pace .

As you might guess from the title and from the screenshots below , it 's all about keeping a helicopter flying through a never-ending sequence of caverns and general obstacles . With average game time being around a minute , Copter It 2 ! is definitely in casual game territory , but there 's something charming about a game that 's this simple and yet this hard ... <p> Although there 's an online component , this is mainly the interstitial adverts which pop up from time to time ( in the free version - see ' Download ' , above ) , plus there 's an automatic comparison with the world high score table after each flying attempt . I 'm not sure whether finding out that my global rank is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> As seen top-right , there 's sound here too , limited to just engine ' chuffing ' and the occasional explosion ( oops ) , but nice to have granularity in volume rather than just ' on ' or ' off ' . <p> The caverns seem to be randomly generated when you start the game , with two implications . One , you can keep trying a particular cavern in order to improve your score . And two , if Copter It 2 ! throws up a cavern which is just insanely difficult , you can quit the game and restart it to try something easier . <p> A tap on the screen pulses the copter 's engine , a long tap keeps the engine on for as long as you hold your finger down on the screen - any spot will do , which is convenient . Working against you are two factors : gravity is very much at work and your copter accelerates downwards whenever the engine is n't on . Plus any contact with cavern floor or ceiling results in instant explosion . This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you find out the screen top and bottom are also purveyors of instant death . So timing your engine bursts , in order to keep the eponymous copter falling gracefully beneath a giant stalactite or pushing it over an equally large stalagmite , is critical . As each cavern unfolds , you 'll also find other obstacles , including giant nuclear waste cans and ( seemingly ) giant beer barrels . All just as lethal , though ... ! <p> The timing of the adverts is fairly well judged and anyone who gets addicted to Copter It 2 ! will find themselves grabbing the commercial version ( at a mere ? 1.50 in the UK ) fairly quickly . While those who only play once in a while wo n't mind the odd advert pop-up . Nicely done . <p> Only 61899th ? Errmmm .... my excuse ?

Life can never be the same after someone forces themselves on to you so viciously . Rape is never just physical ... it damages you emotionally forever . I wonder what appeal any man would find in forcing themselves on a woman ? What could drive a man to such an extent as to abuse a woman and leave her broken on the inside ?

It connotes a set of fast-growing and increasingly influential economies ( also described as " rising powers " or " second world " ) . <p> But it imputes to them a sense of unity that on closer inspection may not really exist . This week 's BRICS summit in New Delhi reveals the potential and flaws of both aspects of the term - and why India ultimately has to be self-reliant . <p> India well deserves to be considered one of the world 's highest potential economies given its population , democracy , growing domestic market , outsized role in global information technology , and investments in other sectors from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being a member of the BRICS has n't helped India avoid being the only major emerging market to experience declining foreign investment in the past two years , and a Moody 's downgrading of its banking sector debt . <p> On the question of BRICS unity , the long-term significance of the hand-holding that goes on at such summits is laughable at best . The rise in cross-currency denominated trade that the BRICS have begun ( Russia and China started almost two years ago , and the UAE and China this year ) is a very important trend , and speaks to their common interest in diversifying away from US dollar dependence . <p> But the simmering suspicions and even hostility between the BRICS themselves is a far larger <p> story . Russia is boosting its military investments to defend its sovereignty from , of all countries , China . India and China have outstanding border disputes that China has categorically stated wo n't be resolved anytime soon . <p> On the trade front , India has initiated anti-dumping measures against China , while Brazil has joined the US and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well . <p> We therefore have to be much more rigorous and analytical in assessing the importance of the BRICS as a concept and a gathering . <p> As Sanjaya Baru of the IISS has written , the " BRICS are in search of cement " .

The key to health and well- being is when there is a free flow of ki - Universal life force energy in each part of animate or in-animate matter . Reiki teaches us to connect and channelize this life force energy from the universe to all parts of our own human energy field called Aura . In a Reiki class we learn to feel and sense this human energy field - Aura and to channelize ki -life force energy in the right way so that we can balance the Aura , that is , make the Aura at ease .

Patient 's faith , surrender to the universe , and karma play a big part in healing . It also depends on the kind of problem one has . For instance , ordinary headaches , tiredness , fever , pains and aches are relieved in a very short period . Chronic problems may take longer .

One still needs to compete to gain an admission . <p> The bigger issue is the significant investment required for a foreign MBA . <p> If you are evaluating this option after having done an MBA previously , you have to also consider the lost income from the existing job . The visa process is also not the easiest . <p> If you are targeting the most plum jobs abroad , then you have to begin by achieving great clarity on what you want to do in life and whether your current passions are going to motivate you towards them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that direction successfully .

With some planning , you can stay comfortable in the heat and be a head turner . <p> " A lot of my customers tell me that they hate summer . I tell them that with the right clothes that allow our skin to breathe , we can embrace the season , " says designer Asmita Marwa , who showcased her collections in flirty cottons at the India Resort Fashion Week , Goa , and Hyderabad International Fashion Week . She suggests teaming up Turkish pants with structured tops and drape dresses in linens and voils to beat the heat . " You can play around with layers .

Designers vouch that the trend will hold good for another couple of seasons . <p> There 's no dearth in Indian and western outfits for working women . Designer Puja Sahney suggests classic silhouettes that withstand the vagaries of fashion trends . " Women feel comfortable in androgynous shirt dresses and kurtas with cut-away sleeves that can be paired with narrow cotton pants . Cigarette pants , kurtas paired with palazzos work well . Palazzo-styled ethnic pants with a touch of lace or fine hakoba embroidery can be worn with kurtas , " says Puja .

@@896233 <h> A Raga-Flamenco Journey : Anoushka Shankar Spellbinds Washington with the Ultimate in Fusion Music <p> Washington , DC , April 14 , 2012 ( Washington Bangla Radio ) On April 13 , 2012 at the George Washington University 's Lisner Auditorium , Anoushka Shankar and her Traveler Ensemble performed their " Raga-Flamenco Journey " concert . Anoushka played her sitar soulfully , along with Sanjeev Shankar in Shehnai , Pirashanna Thevarajah in various Southern Indian percussion instruments , Bernhard Schimpelsberger in Flamenco percussion box , Melon Jimenez in Flamenco guitar &amp; Sandra Carrasco in cante ( vocals ) . The concert was presented by Washington Performing Arts Soceity ( WPAS ) , and Co-presented with the George Washington University Lisner Auditorium . <p> The music which ensued was innovative , experimental and awe-inspiring to say the least . It was at once a combination of musical instruments from various parts of India as well as the Flamenco counterparts of Spain . The Sitar , originally a Persian but now more popularly a North Indian string instrument , was combined with Mridangam , an ancient percussion instrument which originated in Southern India , as well as three other Southern Indian percussion instruments : the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ palm of the hand , Kanjira , a hand drum of the tambourine family , and Morsing , a Southern Indian mouth harp . To this was added the Shehnai , a North Indian wind instrument typically used for auspicious occasions such as weddings . These alone could have provided for an unusual and highly creative concert . But the creativity and innovation of Anoushka Shankar goes far beyond in which she thought of combining this large variety of Indian classical musical instruments with the gypsy &amp; folksy tunes of Spanish Flamenco music . <p> In an interview she confessed her long-standing love for the Flamenco , and that she had always contemplated creating an album which would be a combination of Indian and Flamenco styles . Traveler , her newest album which she played from at the Lisner auditorium , was the manifestation of a primal love affair with the Flamenco style of music , and years of research and experimentation in concert performances and in the clubs of Madrid . As her father Pandit Ravi Shankar could be viewed as Sitar personified , and was responsible for introducing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anoushka can be equally credited for introducing the Flamenco style of music to Indian ears . <p> Though the origin of Flamenco is shrouded in controversy , it is widely believed that Flamenco traces its roots back to the gypsies of Rajasthan , India ... the traveling communities which moved through India , across South Asia and the Middle East before settling in Europe . Through years of evolution and intermingling with various forms of music , Flamenco settled in Andalusia becoming a genre of its own . <p> Anoushka was accompanied by Bernhard Schimpelsberger in Flamenco percussion box or Cajon as it is widely known in Peru and Spain . It is eye-opening to see how music can be created by beating a box with the palms and fingers of both hands . Cajon originated with the slaves of the Spanish Colonial era . These slaves were forbidden to use music in their lives , so used shipping boxes or crates to create music for themselves when no one was listening ... which proves beyond doubt that music can not be confined or suppressed by force , and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and crevice of human existence . <p> Anoushka 's Spanish guitar accompanist was Melon Jimenez , who played rather softly in comparison to the usual Flamenco guitarists who must be heard over the dancers ' nailed shoes striking the floor .... for obvious reasons ... no dancers were performing ... and a loud guitar would 've drowned out the sitar , the predominant instrument in this concert . During his rendition of the " Granaina , " a form of Flamenco music which originated in Granada , Melon 's guitar was heard a bit more clearly . Anoushka announced that while experimenting with the two forms of music she was lucky to have struck a chord of union when she realized that the notes in Granaina were almost the same as Raga Manj Khambaj in Indian classical music . She demonstrated this by playing Manj Khambaj in sitar while Melon played Granaina in his Spanish guitar . Curiously , these two forms of music played side by side sounded cohesive and almost symbiotic . In my opinion , this was one of the major highlights of the evening 's presentations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dedication towards finding new avenues of combining the tunes of the East and the West , much like her father sitar maestro Pandit Ravi Shankar had done with Jazz many years ago . <p> The Flamenco vocalist Sandra Carassco is a great singer/performer and her palmas ( hand-claps ) were just as rhythmic and pleasing to watch . The entire concert was an experience to be cherished for a long time to come , or until Anoushka is ready to bring us similarly awe-inspiring or even more innovative concerts ... hopefully in the near future . <h> You @ WBRi <p> Opinions expressed at or through this site are the opinions of the individual authors and commentators and may not reflect the opinions of WBRi Inc .

It does n't matter how many works of his you 've read , Manto wedges himself in a part of your memory so thoroughly that you must live with it for the rest of your life . <p> On May 11 this year , the two countries that the great Urdu writer lived in -- Pakistan and India -- are celebrating his 100th birth anniversary . <p> Manto , who was born and raised in India -- and having spent some of his most important years in Mumbai ( then Bombay ) -- moved to Lahore after Partition , has influenced authors of both the countries equally . <p> Among those who grew up reading Saadat Hasan Manto 's works was a young and impressionable Prasoon Joshi . <p> In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who has penned songs for films such as Taare Zameen Par ( for which he won the National Award ) and more recently Aamir Khan 's television outing Satyamev Jayate , tells us about the impact Manto 's works had on him and how the author grew on him . <p> How and when did you first come across Manto ? <p> I must have been in my early teens . I found an old book in Devnagiri , in the Raza library in the small town of Rampur ( in Uttar Pradesh ) . I remember skipping the first one or two pages and picking up the book as it engaged me . <p> I also distinctly recall that my doing so was frowned upon by a few elders . In fact , one of my uncles remarked ' Ye sab mat padha karo ' ( Do n't read such things ! ) <p> I must confess I got rather intrigued by this comment and went on to read it with more involvement . <p> What was his first work you read ? <p> As I said , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a good short story is unparalleled . The impact that Manto 's writing had on me is imprinted forever I think . <p> How did Manto affect you first as a young reader and then as a writer ? <p> ( Manto 's writings ) challenged my thinking completely and totally . <p> Since I was still in my teens and had limited or sometimes no understanding and ( scant ) exposure to ( some of ) the subjects he ventured into . <p> Exploring them left me perplexed at times . Themes of prostitution and hints of necrophilia in ( stories such as ) Thanda Gosht posed questions to which could not find answers then . <p> I must say a lot of his work made more sense to me later in my life when I could understand the nuances better . But then there were masterpieces like Toba Tek Singh that immediately made me a fan of his style and depth in his writing , his unabashed portrayals made me bolder as a writer . <p> You 've mentioned that he is one of your favourite authors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was ) the honesty with which he explored his subjects , the tactile and vivid images he drew and the tightness with which he delivered what he intended to . <p> It has happened more than once that I have felt happy with my work but happened to read one of Manto 's and have gone back to the drawing board . <p> What story/play of his affected you the most and why ? <p> Toba Tek Singh , Hatak , Khol Do , Thanda Gosht ? actually it is very difficult for me to select . His plots seem linear yet there are a lot of different strains woven in . A story like Khol Do initially ( seems like ) more of a socio-political comment , but the psychological trauma it portrays leaves you numb . <p> I actually do not dislike anything he wrote , even his memoirs about various people primarily from the creative field . <p> But , yes , Hatak -- and the character of Sughadhi impacted me deeply . Some have called Manto a misogynist but I would heartily take a contrary point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman is a complex endeavour for any writer . To portray it so vividly in Hatak through Sugandhi is brilliant . <p> A recent news report suggested many young Indians are unable to relate to Manto anymore . Why do you think we are unable to pass down the relevance of someone who was so important to at least two generations to the next one ? <p> I do n't believe that they have properly read the author . On one hand his writings have captured one of the most tumultuous times in our history as a nation . <p> The saga of Partition is unfortunately not as well documented as it ought to be . The trajectory of emotion , the depths and the heights of society of humanism that Manto has explored so starkly are in itself , invaluable . <p> His work is not just contextual but makes a larger comment about us as nations , as societies , as men and women . His work should be seen in a broader perspective . <p> I think it 's a response from a lazy bunch of readers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be consumed contextually . Sometimes we need to educate ourselves a bit to appreciate great works . <p> Do you think any Indian author has been quite able to combine biting satire and simple prose to convey the irony that is our nation since Manto ? <p> Yes and no . Yes in bits and pieces some have done it but with such single-minded purity like Manto did ? I do not find anyone ( who came ) close to him . <p> Manto regularly got into trouble for his outrageous stories . Do you think he would have been an acceptable author today or would we have frowned upon his writing as well ? <p> Counterpoint is very important for someone like Manto to make his point . Today we have a very confused morality in our society . It 's cool to be rude , it 's cool to be abusive in personal life and popular cinema and music but we lack ( the ) appetite for serious writing like Manto 's . Many might find it too in your face , too stark for the ' gloss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel we are even less receptive for his kind of approach . <p> Do you believe we as a society are more liberal today than we were in Manto 's time ? <p> It may seem that we are more open-minded and more modern but there is an unsettling aspect underpinning this . I often sense that there 's a strain of extreme conservatism that is affecting us deep down . For example , I see a strong need for regional identity emerging clandestinely whilst on the surface it 's about liberalism and acceptance . <p> Also , if Manto was to write today he may have got typecast very quickly . We lack the patience to be able to deep dive into one writer/poet/creative person 's work and do justice to it . <p> Satyadev Dubey once pointed out that the process of creation goes hand in hand with the process of destruction . Manto 's life especially in Lahore was a journey towards self-destruction . And yet it was the very journey that gave us some masterpieces including the epic Toba Tek Singh . Do please share with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cursed not blessed . I feel that writing is a painful process for a true writer . You are churning all your emotions intensely and you have no choice . The weight , the pregnancy of thought of emotions that a writer carries with him or her is not an easy one . <p> As a writer your quest for truth is never-ending . It will take you to the most uncomfortable situations whether you like it or not . It is your destiny , your compulsion , your purpose . Manto too went through all of it , sometimes fully aware , sometimes led by serendipity <p> What would you say have been your greatest learning from Manto 's works ? <p> Be fearless and honest in sharing your deepest and darkest of emotions .

@@936231 <h> Shocker : We have plotted and killed people , admits CPM leader <p> The outspoken claim of a CPM leader in Kerala that the party has indeed plotted and killed its opponents landed the Marxists in an absolute mess . <p> In his brazen display of medieval thuggery , the local leader seemed to have taken a cue from the party 's state leadership which has unleashed an offensive against the tide of public outrage for its suspected involvement in the murder of a popular CPM-dissident TP Chandrasekharan three weeks ago . <p> The star of the foolish street-corner spectacle that plunged the CPM into a fresh crisis is MM Mani , secretary of the party in Idukki , an eastern district adjoining Ernakulam and Kottyam . Ironically , the meeting where he blurted out was convened to tell the party workers that the CPM was not involved in the murder of Chandrasekharan . <p> Unfortunately for him and the CPM , the shocking footage of his speech found its way to the state 's TV channels . <p> His speech was surprisingly vivid in details of the murders that he said the party had planned and executed .

@@945236 <h> A five-day dance programme in Kochi saw leading exponents of Indian classical dances come up with performances that melded the classical and the contemporary . <p> Classical dancers from the Capital descended on Kochi last week and gave discerning audiences a fill of many dance forms . Swapnasundari , Bharathi Shivaji , Saswati Sen , Madhavi Mudgal and Rama Vaidyanathan performed at JT Performing Arts Centre at the Choice School compound , Tripunithura , in connection with a fete called ' Parampara , Indian Classical Dance Festival ' . <p> The curtain went up on the five-day festival with the magical smoothness of Odissi . Madhavi Mudgal and her niece-disciple Arushi Mudgal took the audience on a journey of pure art . <p> Madhavi handled the abhinaya parts leaving the nrita and nrithya to the promising Arushi . <p> A mangalacharan from a 13th century musical treatise ' Sangitaratnakara ' , set to music by the late Pandit Jitendra Abhisheki , that invoked Lord Shiva , set the tone for the evening . <p> ' Aahlad ' , a nritta piece in raag Sahana , was choreographed and performed by Arushi . It had music by Hindustani vocalist Madhup Mudgal , Arushi 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and this was easily the high point of the recital . <p> Madhavi enacted excerpts from three Ashtapadis from Jayadeva 's ' Gita Govinda ' . For one moment Madhavi was Radha , in the next she was the ' sakhi ' or Radha 's confidante , and then she transformed into Krishna . <p> Two typically Odissi pieces , ' Kede Chhanda ' and ' Oriya Champu ' , followed . The former , an Oriya song , depicted the childhood mischief of Krishna . Arushi 's beautiful bends and sways in the sancharis , the abhinaya , postures and footwork , did justice to this piece choreographed by Kelucharan Mohapatra . <p> The Oriya Champu was a ' kha champu ' where all the lines of the song began with the letter ' kha ' . With emphasis on abhinaya , Madhavi created blossom-laden trees , scented breeze , singing bees and the lovelorn characters . <p> The recital concluded with a duet ' Dvidha , ' a play of rhythms and visual patterns . The performance ended with chants from the Vedas . <p> The second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and unconventional modes . The foremost disciple of Kathak maestro Birju Maharaj , Saswati is totally devoted to the Lucknow gharana and her guru , so much so that at every turn , you are reminded of her guru in the way she performs . <p> While a few pure Kathak numbers were performed with the customary baby Krishna , sakhis and Yashodha as characters , the classical met the mundane in innovative numbers where the ghungroo took over and taal became the dance . <p> Saswati even played imaginary hockey with mudras , footwork and the ghungroo as mainstay , something that Birju Maharaj does . In Saswati 's performance , the demonstrative elements outweighed the pure dance part so that the concert format was missing . <p> On the theme of Sita <p> Bharathi Shivaji , on the third day , stuck to the traditional Mohiniyattom genre . Innovation , there was in great abundance , as far as the music and lyrics were concerned . Sita was the theme of her recital . The recital had Sita as a child , adolescent and as a young lady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in chronological order . She danced to poems set to music in the Sopanasangeetham style , rendered in the robust voice of Sadanam Radhakrishnan . <p> ' Balaganapathy ' was the opening piece , which had a lot of novelty . Vallathol 's ' Kochusita ' was followed by the adolescent Sita 's beauty and demeanour and then ' Sitaparinayam ' , all choreographed by Bharathi . The colourful swayamvaram was staged like a dance drama in a solo show , which Bharathi performed with much stamina and grace . <p> Swapnasundari 's singular contribution has been the revival , reconstruction and crusade for Vilasini Natyam , a dance form indigenous to Andhra Pradesh but which was on the verge of extinction . The classicism and extensive repertoire of the dance form were evident in Swapnasundari 's mesmerising performance on the fourth day of the fete . <p> Vilasini Natyam has three basic segments or aspects . The temple tradition , which includes rituals ; the court tradition , which includes ' nritta ' and ' nritya ' presentations ; and the theatrical presentation , like the ' Parijatams ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consort Satyabhama that used to be performed for nine consecutive nights in the temples in Andhra . <p> Swapnasundari packed all these elements in her two-hour recital . <p> The padam was the soul of the performance . In Vilasini Natyam , unlike in most other Indian classical dance forms , the padam is performed with the dancer seated . Swapnasundari performed a hitherto unpublished padam that exists only in the oral tradition . This part calls for intense abhinaya , where the emotions and ideas are carried through to the audience with the help of the eyes , face , gestures and manodharma ( spontaneous improvisation ) . <p> Enthralling Parijatam <p> The Parijatam was riveting . The presentation was filled with ' nritta ' , ' abhinaya ' and elements of ' natya ' . There was an exchange of dialogue between the dancer and vocalist as in a dance-drama . The dancer also sang snatches of the songs before giving it a visual expression . The unique feature of this presentation is that the dancer comes adorned in the traditional wooden hand-crafted jewellery called ' Ganiyam ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Bhagavatham ' ( dance opera ) presentations . <p> Parampara concluded with a Bharatanatyam recital by Rama Vaidyanathan . The youngest of the dancers who performed in the festival , Rama 's was an energetic , well-rehearsed and crisp performance . <p> Rama started with a choreographed piece titled the ' Divine Cowherd ' . A ragamalika based on a composition by Narayana Theerthar , it was a well-designed entry and a perfect way to connect with the audience . It had a variety of movements , pirouettes , bursts of strength and beauty . <p> Having captured the attention of the audience Rama quietly slipped into the varnam . She chose a composition of the famed Tanjore Quartet set in Bhairavi raga . This item brought to the fore Rama 's strengths -- her skill in executing the adavu jatis . The jatis for this piece were composed by Karaikudi Sivakumar who was also the ' nattuvanar ' . <p> A ' javali , ' again a composition of the Tanjore Quartet , in Surutti , a musical piece specially picked for ' abhinaya ' was where Rama @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , another abhinaya-oriented one based on Papanasam Sivan 's ' Ena thavam seithane ... ' ( Kapi ) also Rama did not seem to be in her element . <p> But then Rama made up for all this with her precise , firm movements , beautiful ' aaharya ' and an excellent back-up team . <p> The dancer completed her recital with a Thillana in Varamu raga and a Adi Sankaracharya ' Ashtakam in Megh raag.

But the macroeconomic impact on the new year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goes for commodities in general ; the CRB commodities index ( which includes oil ) has dipped by a sharp 22 per cent , from 352 a year ago to 273 now . Since India is a net commodity importer , this too will help reduce the import bill in dollars , though once again domestic prices wo n't see much of a change because of the rupee 's fall . <p> The second silver lining is provided by the rupee 's depreciation . This is portrayed in much of the media as a huge negative development -- a view seemingly endorsed by the finance minister , who called it a " grave " problem . <h> Indian economy : Is there a silver lining ? <p> It is , of course , problematic in that it prevents the global price fall from being reflected in domestic price trends , and it will cause headaches to companies that have borrowed overseas and not hedged their positions . <p> But any price movement creates winners and losers , and the dominant economic effect here is that it will help import substitution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and boost export competitiveness . <p> An uptick in manufacturing will be the single biggest positive development to look forward to , given the stagnation in this vital segment of the economy over the past half-year . <h> Indian economy : Is there a silver lining ? <p> The third positive development ( missed by most people in the noise over poor GDP numbers ) is that gross fixed capital investment -- which includes everything from highways and airports to schools and hospitals , and of course plant and machinery -- has moved up a small notch in the latest quarter . <p> This could point to the hoped-for revival of investment , and may continue to improve since the general expectation is that interest rates will fall even if slowly . The fourth silver lining is that some special factors that operated last year will not do so now . <p> The drop in mining in the first three quarters of 2011-12 , for instance , was on account of the sharp drop in gas production by Reliance , and mismanagement of the coal sector . That fall has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ downward-pull factor is out of the way . <h> Indian economy : Is there a silver lining ? <p> Meanwhile , there are also reasons why the clouds wo n't go away quickly . The monsoons look iffy , and could hurt both growth and inflation . <p> The world economy is slowing down , so export markets will be slack . International money is fleeing to the safety of places like Germany and the US , so there could be capital outflow , which could put pressure on the rupee . <p> If we had a government that was not in denial and not paralysed , and which had the capacity to focus on problems and deliver solutions , the positive factors could have been exploited .

Based on Thomas Hardy 's classic novel Tess of the D'Ubervilles , the tragic romance is re-imagined and set in contemporary India . Trishna lives with her family in a village in Rajasthan , India 's largest state . As the eldest daughter , she works in a nearby resort to help pay the bills . Jay is the wealthy son of a property developer . When he takes up managing a resort at his father 's request , he meets Trishna at a dance and their fates cross . Jay finds every opportunity to win Trishna 's affection and she accepts his efforts with shy curiosity . But when the two move to Mumbai and become a couple , Jay 's deep family bond threatens the young lovers ' bliss . In Trishna , the lead character Jay is a mix of both Angel and Alec from the Hardy novel . Taking on the challenging role is British actor Riz Ahmed who says , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ try and combine two great characters from literature but what became clear was that it was n't going to be a literal adaptation of Hardy 's novel .

He 's on this trip to India from Britain with his friends as a last kind of blow out before he stays on in India to run some of his father 's newly acquired hotels in Rajasthan . He 's frustrated because he has to slot into that role rather than have his own projects and that both haunts and drives him as a character . Ultimately the project he finds and latches onto is Trishna herself . He seeks her out and tries to develop her , to satisfy his own needs and make something his own . In some ways you could say his privilege is a curse in the sense that he 's got a lot to live up to . But in other ways , he does try to break away in his own direction when he goes to Bombay . He 's only able to do that and have that financial independence because of his wealth . <p> Does he really fall in love with Trishna ? <p> Yes , but I guess we 've been talking from the point of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from means there 's a tragic outcome to the relationship .

When they 're in Bombay they are in love , but the limitations in the relationship come from the gap between them being so vast . There 's only so much they can talk about -- their world views only overlap to a certain extent . At the point where they 're talking about the abortion that 's something that really frustrates Jay , because Trishna did n't make her own mind up about that and she kept it from him . I guess honour trumps honestly and openness for Trishna . There is love between them but as with every relationship , what makes up that love is lots of different things . Maybe for Jay at the beginning , he almost over-idealizes her , he sees her as a way of re-connecting with his ethnic background @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's his own . The limitations of all those things in the relationship start emerging and he feels he 's failed in his own life . <p> What was it like working with Freida ? <p> A lot of fun -- she 's a very cool girl . I think she 's an incredibly instinctive and natural actress . She 's very generous and there 's minimal fuss with her . Working with her is one of the easiest processes because she 's incredibly self-sufficient . She 's generous about giving you space and time to develop your character . For me , it 's ideal to work with someone like that , particularly when you 're working with Michael and the process is one where things change and evolve and everything 's very flexible . Michael wants you to be natural and that creates a really nice atmosphere on set . <p> Did you read Tess of the D'Urbervilles before embarking on this film ? <p> After Michael told me about the film , that was when I read the book but I had n't read it previous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of daunting to try and combine two great characters from literature but what became clear was that it was n't going to be a literal adaptation of Hardy 's novel .

In the novel they 're never really on the scene at the same time so that meant we could take on the spirit or psychology of one character and then at different stages in the story , introduce the other . To begin with , Jay idealizes Trishna in the same way that Angel idealizes Tess . He sees her as a pure woman and views the experience as a return to a natural way and all that is good and pure . When Jay is at the hotel with his friends , he spots this girl from the village and this real obsessive but full-blooded love emerges and at this point we see Angel 's spirit of his affection for her , but what we start to get is a gradual decline into Alec .

India is changing at breakneck speed with modernization , industrialization and mass migration from the countryside into more urban centres and we explore how the old world and new world are rubbing up against each other . The idea of morality is very pertinent because it 's very important to point out that some western audiences may find themselves slightly confused as to why Trishna feels embarrassed about sleeping with Jay and why she feels she needs to run away and why she feels mortified at having had the abortion .

Michael never calls action or cut . It 's a very relaxed , gentle , natural process in term of the atmosphere created for the actors . For the production crew I guess it 's not so relaxed -- it 's crazy that 's because there 's so much that 's being achieved and Michael has very high standards and he 's a real stickler for authenticity .

It 's a romantic story but also a tragedy and a drama . From my point of view I try to make the characters I play as complicated for myself as possible so I do n't have to have a very clear grip on who they are day-to-day on set , so you get a fuller picture of them at the end of the film . That 's also part of how it is working with Michael -- not having a rigid , fixed view of the characters .

@@981237 <h> Kolkata 's street chess flourishes under busy flyover <p> Kolkata : Rain or sun does not bother them , neither does the cacophonous traffic nor the incessant clamour of a packed city . Their dream is to get World champion Vishwanathan Anand to visit their " club " , the concrete railing under a busy flyover where a clutch of chess aficionados concentrate on games over which rulers once traded kingdoms . <p> For the 80-odd members of the Gariahat Chess Club , the love for the game transcends everything else - weather , traffic , crowds - as masters and novices come together to play the game of kings right under the busy 570-metre-long Gariahat flyover in south Kolkata . <p> " I 've been playing chess here since my childhood , even before the flyover was constructed . This area was our favourite meeting place . As more and more people joined us and some even ventured out to participate and win prizes in various tournaments , an idea began to take shape - that we should form a club , " Gariahat Chess Club president Debashish Basu told IANS . <p> However , despite attempts spread over months , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and passion for the game catalysed the motley group in November 2006 to give birth to the club on an an open space under the flyover . <p> The club now boasts of at least 80 members , who sit on concrete railing where the chessboards are also placed . <p> " For me and other members of the club , all the noise does not affect us . If you have the passion , nothing can bother you , " Basu said . <p> The chess club has one aim - to promote the game of chess - and their mission is to organise a tournament every month . <p> From retired pensioners to school and college goers , from bankers to professionals - all make a beeline to the Gariahat Boulevard waiting for their turn to play the cerebral game . <p> But how does one concentrate , in the chaos of the traffic and the clamour of the hawkers and commuters , on a game which demands tremendous mental attention ? <p> " We have been playing here for years and nothing - be it the weather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a game is played we transcend to a different world where the only things visible are the 64 squares and the pieces on them , " Sandip Mazumdar , for whom a day is never complete without a game of chess , told IANS . <p> " It would be wrong to say they do not get disturbed by the surrounding noise and cacophony . Initially it surely is difficult for them but as time passes they get habituated , " said Sabyasachi Mazumdar , a clinical psychologist . <p> " On the contrary , those who have been playing there regularly might find it difficult to concentrate when playing at a secluded and calm place , " Mazumdar added . <p> The Gariahat Chess Club , a constant source of inspiration for budding chess players , is making an effort to invite five-times World champion Viswanathan Anand to their club . <p> " It has been our dream to bring Anand to our club , especially now when he has retained the world crown .

@@981238 <h> Samsung Galaxy S III vs Apple 's iPhone <p> Until I started watching videos on Samsung 's new Galaxy S III phone , I never thought of the iPhone 's display as small . <p> The Galaxy 's screen measures 4.8 inches diagonally , compared with 3.5 inches for the iPhone . That translates to a display area that 's nearly twice the size . Yet the Galaxy is thinner and lighter . <p> Apart from that , the Galaxy shares the iPhone 's curvy and shiny design , along with a center button that wakes up the device from power-saving mode or takes you from whatever you 're doing to a home screen . <p> Unlike the iPhone , the Galaxy runs on faster 4G cellular networks ( AT&amp;T markets its iPhones as 4G , but the network is based on older technology ) . The Galaxy also comes with a new wireless technology called near-field communications , which can be used to share files and make purchases . <p> Pictures taken with the Galaxy were sharper and had better light balance than those with the iPhone , based on a handful of test shots I took . The Galaxy 's tool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longer on unlimited plans - surpasses what comes with the iPhone . <p> All that makes the Galaxy a strong contender to Apple 's popular device . <p> I understand the comparison is n't entirely fair . The iPhone 4S is about eight months old , and there 's a new model expected this fall . Last week , Apple previewed changes to the phone 's operating system , promising improvements to its Siri virtual assistant , a mapping service with voice navigation and more . <p> But the reality is the new Galaxy is available this week - not in September or October . <p> All four national wireless companies and regional carrier U.S. Cellular will sell the Galaxy , which runs the latest operating software from Google , a flavor of Android known as Ice Cream Sandwich . <p> The basic model with 16 gigabytes of memory will cost $200 with a two-year contract through AT&amp;T , Verizon Wireless , Sprint and U.S. Cellular . That 's comparable to the iPhone 's $199 . A 32 GB model will cost $250 , which is cheaper than a comparable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than others , though it may still be cheaper overall with lower monthly data fees over two years . <p> The Galaxy phones will be available in white or blue . AT&amp;T will also have a red version this summer , but it wo n't carry the 32 GB model . <p> Now back to Galaxy 's screen . <p> The Galaxy shines when displaying widescreen video . That 's because much of the display 's increase is in width rather than in height when the phone is held on its side , or landscape mode . The iPhone wastes some display real estate to make wider videos fit . There are unused strips of black above and below those videos . <p> When watching a foreign movie through a Netflix app , the Galaxy 's larger screen makes the subtitles much easier to read . I can read them fine on the iPhone , but my eyes kept zeroing in on the text to do so , making me miss the action . <p> The colors on the Galaxy also appeared richer , thanks to a screen that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> All that video can deplete your data allowance in no time . <p> On the iPhone , the tool for measuring data usage is n't easy to find . You have to choose " General " in your settings , then " Usage , " and then " Cellular Usage . " There 's info there on the amount of data sent and received , but no total . You have to remember to manually reset the counter each month on the day your billing cycle starts . <p> On the Galaxy , " Data usage " is the third item from the top under " Settings . " You can tell the phone when to warn you that you 're about to reach your cap for the month . You can also automatically disable data usage when you 've reached a pre-specified point to avoid extra charges . You do n't have to do any math to get the total used , and the counter automatically resets each month . You can also see which apps use the most data . <p> Before I go further , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still excels . <p> The iPhone has more software from outside parties , extending the device 's functionality . Many apps are written only for the iPhone and other Apple devices . Versions for the Galaxy and other Android phones sometimes come months later and lack all of the features . <p> The iPhone works better than Android devices in corporate settings . Android , for instance , lacks the tools needed to access Wi-Fi at my office or the corporate email system ( though some might consider that a plus for Android ) . <p> The iPhone has Siri , the virtual assistant that hears your voice commands and talks back . <p> The Galaxy introduces a voice assistant , but she 's best described as Siri 's forgotten stepchild . The Galaxy could n't find an Indian restaurant just a block from me , and she gave me the name of a doctor when I asked for Thai restaurants . The Galaxy also lacks Siri 's attitude and sense of humor . <p> Me : " What is the best smartphone ? " Siri : " Wait , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the grammatically incorrect and boring , " Opinion vary but I think Samsung Galaxy is the best of them all . " <p> Here 's where the Galaxy prevails : <p> As with other Android devices , the Galaxy syncs well with Google services . By signing into a Google account , names , emails and phone numbers from my Gmail contacts are automatically transferred to the phone . The same happens with calendar entries . Apple uses a separate contact and calendar system , not the one I already use through Google . <p> You can remove the plastic back cover to switch the battery or insert a microSD card for additional storage of up to 64 gigabytes . The iPhone 's battery can be replaced only by a technician , and there 's no slot for more storage . <p> Both devices have two cameras , including an 8 megapixel one in the back . The Galaxy 's front-facing camera does more than take pictures : When you 're reading something , the camera will see your eyes glued on the screen , so your phone wo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will start to dim if you do n't touch it periodically . <p> If you 're texting a friend and find it easier to discuss something by phone , the Galaxy will automatically call that person when you put the phone by your ear . <p> When watching video stored on your device , there 's a " pop out " feature that lets you watch in a smaller window while doing other things such as email and Facebook on the phone . <p> The Galaxy 's near-field communications technology offers a preview of the future . One day , it could be common like Wi-Fi and Bluetooth . With it , I 'm able to share photos and video simply by tapping the backs of two Galaxy phones together . I 'm also able to make purchases at a handful of stores by tapping the phone to the merchant 's NFC reader , as long as I have credit cards set up through the Google Wallet app . <p> Alas , Google Wallet is n't so useful until more merchants accept it , and the app is only available @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sharing features , which let you swap small files , work with some other late-model Android phones . If you tap two Galaxy phones together , you can quickly transfer really big files , such as videos and photos . <p> All Galaxy models except T-Mobile 's will be able to use so-called fourth-generation , or 4G , networks . T-Mobile does n't have a 4G network , but its 3G network is almost as fast as a 4G network ( and indeed , it calls its network " 4G " ) . <p> Current iPhones do n't work with 4G technology , though the AT&amp;T version says it does because it uses an upgraded 3G network , much like T-Mobile 's . The iPhone coming this fall is likely to support " real " 4G , using a technology called LTE . <p> The next iPhone will also have an Apple-designed mapping service with turn-by-turn directions spoken aloud . It 's one of the rare instances where the iPhone will play catch-up to Android , which has had Google 's voice navigation app built-in since 2009 . <p> If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 'd wait a few months and make a comparison then . <p> If you 're an Android user looking to switch to an iPhone , the Galaxy offers enough reason to stick with Android . You 'll miss out on the cachet of owning an iPhone or the joys of chatting with Siri , but you 'll get a solid device with the latest technologies . <p> Download the Gadgets 360 app for Android and iOS to stay up to date with the latest tech news , product reviews , and exclusive deals on the popular mobiles.

In the recent past , Rasheed had actively attended rallies and meetings organised by the Defa-e-Pakistan Council , an ISI-sponsored coalition of pro-Kashmir extremist groups formed by Hafiz Mohammed Saeed , who also heads Jamaatul Daawa . <p> Considered close to the Pakistani military and intelligence establishment , Sheikh Rasheed Ahmed had accompanied Hafiz Mohammed Saeed to a series of rallies and press conferences that were held in Rawalpindi , Karachi and Lahore where they made harsh statements against India and the US . <p> Rasheed , one of the few Pakistani politicians to have served not one but two military dictators ( Zia and Musharraf ) , has always been a colourful character , mixing populist rhetoric with the idiom of the street which borders on the crass . He is famous for his tongue-in-cheek political one-liners that aim to demean anti-establishment opponents in the style of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his patronage and facilitation of groups linked to armed resistance in Kashmir , it really came to media limelight when the Indian government denied him permission to visit New Delhi in 2004 after Kashmiri leader Yasin Malik publicly disclosed that Sheikh Rasheed 's residence and farm house have been used by jihadi organisations . <p> Therefore , when the Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front chairman Yasin Malik stated at the Marriot in Islamabad on June 13 , 2005 , that Sheikh Rasheed had the honour of having trained around 3,500 jihadis in guerrilla warfare , it was not at all surprising for those who are aware of his past as someone who had been a hardened militant with intelligence connections and who wanted to liberate Jammu and Kashmir with the might of the gun . Yasin Malik declared : " Sheikh Rasheed has played a great role for Kashmir 's liberation . He used to support the frontline jihadis from Kashmir , but few know of his contributions . " <p> Perhaps , in the euphoria of reliving the past or overwhelmed by gratitude , Yasin Malik went on to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ militant movement at a reception arranged by Sheikh Rasheed Ahmed , then information minister , in his honour : it was at the information minister 's farmhouse that some 3,500 Kashmiri jihadis , including Yasin , received training in arms . <p> From the reformed militant leader 's perspective , there obviously could n't have been a better tribute to shower on another Kashmiri before an august audience . But the politician in the unruly Sheikh realised that even in these days of Indo-Pak bonhomie , it is not possible to accept as minister a man who could have trained militants to wage jihad in Kashmir . When journalists questioned him after the meeting was over , he tersely remarked , " I have no idea about which Sheikh Rasheed he ( Yasin ) is speaking . " <p> The wily sheikh of Lal Haveli knew quite fully well that since the heroes of the past are the terrorists of the present under the changing international climate , he should simply refuse to concede that he ever supported jihadis in Kashmir . The next day , however , <p> groaning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rasheed , the visiting Kashmiri leader Yasin Malik had to rephrase his earlier statement by saying , " I have been misquoted by the media . What I said was that Sheikh Rasheed used to give shelter to the Kashmiri freedom-fighters at his Rawalpindi farmhouse . I never talked about a military training camp being run by the information minister there in the 1980s . " <p> The same day , on June 14 , Sheikh Rasheed issued a " policy statement " saying that " it had never been his policy to train militants " . The federal minister said this when his comments were sought on a statement issued by the external affairs ministry 's official spokesperson at a press briefing in New Delhi . " I am a politician , not a militant , and I strongly support the peace process between India and Pakistan , " he added . What Sheikh 's policy statement proved was that it is always easier to persuade a militant to give up jihad than to inject in him the culture of popular politics demanding doublespeak and concealment of an unsavoury @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sheikh Rasheed had refuted his claim while requesting anonymity , saying that the late JKLF commander , Ashfaq Majeed Wani , was in charge of the training camp ( called Freedom House ) which was located at Sheikh Rasheed 's 250-kanal farmhouse in Fateh Jang , Rawalpindi . The camp was being funded by the ISI , under its then director general Lt Gen Hamid Gul . But there are those who believe that the liberation of Jammu and Kashmir might not have been Sheikh Rasheed 's sole motive and that he had actually rented out his farmhouse to the ISI for a hefty sum of money . <p> As journalists dug up his past , the poor Sheikh found himself contradicted not only by Pakistan Peoples ' Party , during whose tenure the training camp used to operate , but also by General ( retired ) Mirza Aslam Beg , who was the army chief at that time ; Major General ( retired ) Naseerullah Babar , who was the interior minister in Benazir Bhutto 's cabinet ; Amanullah Khan , chairman , Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hijacked an Indian Airlines aircraft to Lahore in 1971 . <p> Conceding that the ISI gave military training to Kashmiri rebels battling security forces in Kashmir , JKLF chief Amanullah Khan disclosed : " We had a gentleman 's agreement , an oral sort of agreement . I was given assurance that the ISI was all out for the independence of Jammu and Kashmir , " he said while referring to beginning of ISI assistance for his JKLF . <p> " I was given the impression that Pakistan 's then military ruler , General Ziaul Haq , also supported the notion of independence for Kashmir . We began bringing young men into the Pakistani administered Azad Kashmir from the Indian side in 1988 , where they received training from the ISI . <p> " The agreement was that we will bring boys from across the border and indoctrinate our ideology by ourselves while the ISI will train them and send them back . The ISI training for our group ended in early 1990 after the agency tried to interfere in the JKLF affairs . " <p> Similarly , while confirming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Freedom House in Rawalpindi was a militant training camp .

The government had also learnt that the land was given to him to support the Kashmiri groups . But , as the military was under the president , there was little the government of the day could do about it constitutionally . " <p> Asked about the fate of the Rawalpindi training camp , a retired intelligence official said it was shut down by the first government of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif in 1990 and was relocated in Pakistan-Occupied Kashmir . The move to shut down the Fateh Jang training camp was actually initiated by the first government of Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto and finally materialised by the first government of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif . <p> However , there are those in the militant circles who insist that the Freedom House training camp was shut down after the establishment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ groups like the Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front . <p> Image : A photograph dating back to 2003 of Sheikh Rasheed Ahmed when he was Pakistan 's information minister Photo : Zahid Hussein/Reuters

In any form tobacco is bad for health . Consumers know this and yet continue to use it carelessly . <p> Some 10% of the Indian population is addicted to the consumption of tobacco . Starting early in life ( age 15 or so ) and reaching the peak level by 40-49 years . There are an estimated 110 million males and a growing crop of 8 million females , who consider it a fashion to smoke , something that was taboo a decade ago ! <p> Cigarettes are produced in the organized sector , some 108 billion sticks , which are taxed at the source . Beedi , the so- called poor-man 's cigarette , is basically produced in the cottage industry is not fully tax-compliant , possibly because of logistics .

Yet we use the products in a nonchalant manner . <p> It may be recalled that , in order to discourage use of tobacco in public places , COPTA -- Cigarette and Other Tobacco Prohibition Act -- was passed . This Act defines the public places where one can not smoke -- such as bars , pubs , hotels , restaurants , auditoriums , bus stops , airports , railway stations , schools , colleges and offices . It also provided that separate zones be created in hotels , bars restaurants , etc where smoking may be allowed . COPTA was passed in 2003 and many cities , including , for example , Bangalore , does not strictly enforce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not smoke on the road , parks , etc . In fact , selling of tobacco products is strictly prohibited without presentation of proper ID and the buyer should be at least 18 years old . Surprise inspections are carried out and licenses to operate are cancelled , the seller is fined and shop closed . <p> However , in India , people smoke in trains and buses and fights between co-passengers are frequent . There is no way a TTE who travels in the train can control this situation , very much like the bus driver or the conductor . However , civil responsibility and sense prevails and smokers , if any , take the opportunity to puff away at stops ! . <p> Let us take a look at the grim situation , how this smoking really starts ? <p> Whether it is Ram , Rahim or Robert , exposure to smoking starts very early in life , like a parent or a close relative who smokes . Passive smoking starts from this point . A case history would reveal how it generally happens ! <p> Ram , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was more close to his grandparent than his own . Then , one day , the father turns around and says : " If I catch you smoking , I will break your hands " . Ram had seen others smoke outside his family , and not even the thought ever crossed his mind . <p> Yet , the challenge was acceptable and with a few friends , he managed to buy some beedis . All that they could dare to do was to have a few puffs and coughed it all the way home , having smoked in a different locality ! Not much happened after that , until his father moved to a metro , on promotion . It was while concentrating on his studies , his cousin returned from abroad , and had trunk-load of Pall Mall and Chesterfield cigarettes . These were available at home and a sudden jump from Kareem beedis to Chesterfield was irresistible and the urge to smoke a ' foreign ' cigarette won the day .

From one or two free cigarettes a day , he began to buy one or two himself , until it became a habit to have a smoke after a cup of tea , lunch , snacks or dinner . <p> Ram graduated from getting freebies to buying a packet of 10 cigarettes a day and it became a constant companion . Just as work progressed from clerical position to that of an executive level , expensive brands replaced the cheaper cigarette , and one packet a day became two . By this time , tobacco companies started promoting 20 cigarette packs . <p> Meantime , some " well-wishers " in the smoking group suggested that Ram should now really go in for a pipe ! Naturally , a Briar was bought along with some Virginia tobacco . Already , an occasional cigar after a good dinner and a VSOP was the norm of the day , and resultant complication was the consumption of tobacco in every manner possible .

Nothing worked ! A special filter , to be used in four stages , was bought and tried , and it would not help stop smoking . Until one day ... <p> And that day , Ram decided that " from tonight , I shall will not touch the cigarette ; please help me , God " . With that determination , he simply crushed the last few cigarettes in the pack and threw it away . That was in 1984 .

It wiped out half of all species then existent , including dinosaurs . However , a snail shell survived to tell Coimbatoreans the tale . Placed between bottled snakes and a cross-section of rosewood 450 years old , this specimen occupies an insignificant spot within a glass case on the floor of the Gass Forest Museum ( GFM ) . The museum currently hosts 10,000 such artefacts . <p> GFM is on Cowley Brown Road , nestled within the forest campus of Tamil Nadu Forest Academy , which celebrated its centenary last week . However , its collection has been curated over the last 110 years . " The colonists had the license to loot our land but some chose to be fascinated by it .

Despite being 50 years old , the gaur is among the more recent stuffed acquisitions of the museum since hunting was banned by the Wildlife Protection Act of 1972 . Most stuffed creatures are captures of the British in the early half of the 20th Century . " The practice of taxidermy -- curing , stuffing and arranging animal skins for display -- was perfected by them .

Stuffed creatures are labelled with their characteristics , habits and habitats as well , bringing even extinct species alive . <p> Despite being a niche forestry museum , GFM hosts over 25,000 visitors a year .

These are horrible , pathetic and absolutely dismal set of numbers from Infosys ? <p> Suresh Mahadevan : Certainly , 2-3 things look disappointing . One , the guidance of 8 to 10 has now become at least 5 . So clearly there are some issues with respective growth . <p> Secondly , in this quarter , margin seems to have come down quite significantly which is what has caused the net profit to be quite low . I have not read the full release , I have not fully digested , but at the outset , yes , it looks like a little negative data point for the stock and maybe for the sector as well . <p> ET Now : The management commentary as well has been a little jittery and cautious , saying that perhaps this is not it and the entire sector is facing a whole lot of headwinds . The point is , is the poison out of the system with this kind of quarterly performance or can we see significant underperformance in the future quarters to come because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a telltale indicator ? <p> Suresh Mahadevan : Actually to be honest , our analyst has been quite negative on the sector . I have been kind of neutral with a slightly overweight on Infosys because I thought maybe with the low expectations , the stock could do alright , but it seems like the expectations seem to get reset again this quarter . So we will have to look at it . <p> Some of the bad news may be in the price earlier , though incrementally this is a data point which worries . So , as I said , I have just seen the headline numbers . It will take us some time to figure out what exactly is going wrong , but suddenly at the outset , it looks a little disappointing . The only saving grace may be the rupee unlikely to appreciate in the near term . So maybe that rupee tailwind is only positive , I guess , for the sector . <p> ET Now : Three things you would be monitoring very closely from the conference call which will decide whether in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Which are those three things ? <p> Suresh Mahadevan : The biggest thing is growth . People want to gauge what this company is going to grow at . Already the stock is at 14 times earnings when TCS is close to 19 to 20 times . So my sense is investors need to get some comfort around that can this company grow and some of their strategy may have caused the slower growth in the past . <p> They have not gone that much aggressively after the market share because they had always maintained that margins in the past . So I do not know what that is , but investors want to get a good handle on the growth prospects of this company and also their strategy in terms of how they are going to address this continuously under delivering on expectations . So that is what people would be looking for at the big picture . <p> ET Now : Do you think the change of guard for Infosys Technologies has failed because if I map Infosys ' performance , after the change of guard , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is tough to pinpoint one thing because clearly this is the company which is primarily an export company . As we all know , the world is not in a great shape and Europe is very obvious . Even the US , while it relatively does better than Europe , I do not think it is in a great shape because whatever data points we pick up indicate that pricing is under pressure . <p> My sense is if industry conditions are bad , of course some companies could relatively outperform , but beyond a point -- and clearly it is more to do with industry conditions and probably a little bit to do with Infosys-specific strategy as well -- clearly a combination of this has led the company to probably under delivering , I guess . <p> ET Now : Just want to get your thoughts on TCS . After what we have seen from Infy , what does one expect from TCS which has up until now at least outperformed ? <p> Suresh Mahadevan : That company has been like the opposite end of the spectrum from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expectations .

Kannan . <p> I still remember when we went to Beijing for the Olympics , the talk was if India could win at least one medal .

And it was that effort which had an immediate effect on other athletes as well in Beijing . Days later when Vijender Kumar and Sushil won bronze medals , it was proof the self-belief factor had come into play . <p> From 2008 till now , I have been asked several times if Indian sport changed in any way , since we have started thinking about ' how many ' medals , rather than ' if any ' . The answer is a resounding yes because after Beijing , there was another defining year in Indian sport - 2010 . <p> People remember the Commonwealth Games for corruption and wrongdoings but I can not forget the medal tally of 101 . It was proof that Indian athletes had started believing in themselves and how government funding could work wonders with proper coaching and exposure in place . <p> If the Commonwealth Games were still thought of as a fluke , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Asian Games was brilliant . A medal tally of 65 was the best ever and it reflected the depth in Indian sport . <p> Agreed , in 2011 , if people talk of success in Indian sport , the foremost achievement was the ICC World Cup triumph at home . But now that the London Olympics are just 12 days away , the question once again is how many medals India will win ? <p> In the past , whenever Indian teams went for the Olympics , there would be sarcasm regarding some players at least . However , now that the athletes list submitted to the Sports Ministry for clearance stands at a healthy 81 , it is encouraging that they have mostly made it to the Games through proper qualification , not wild cards . <p> For the sheer variety of disciplines Indians have qualified in , we can say the signs are indeed encouraging .

While it is easy to rubbish the Indian government for not doing enough , the reality is different . In fact , even for superstars like Leander Paes , Sania Mirza and Mahesh Bhupathi , the $ 6,000 funding per month does mean a lot . <p> In my view , there are two sporting disciplines in India where there has been a huge slip-up , though I do n't think anybody could have expected medals from them .

His training was ruined and he could n't make it to the London Olympics . <p> The story of four Indian swimmers fumbling has also become infamous now as they secured ' B ' grade qualification times and never improved on them for over a year . The end result was that with the international swimming body ( FINA ) naming 900 swimmers for the Olympics , Virdhawal Khade , Sandeep Sejwal , Saurabh Sangvekar and Aaron D'Souza were left weeping in the pool . <p> The Swimming Federation of India ( SFI ) then went with a begging bowl to FINA and has managed one slot for unknown swimmer Gagan AP .

But to waste time and resources is shameful , since they made no improvement at all . <p> Back to the question of how many medals India will win in London , I don ' think anyone can wager on it . Athletics , boxing , shooting , archery and wrestling - I think there is hope from all these disciplines . <p> Indian hockey is showing signs of improvement as well , but asking for a medal maybe a bit too much . <p> Today , each Indian athlete believes he or she can win a medal at the Olympics . After Leander Paes in 1996 , if there is one athlete who has inspired huge confidence , it is Bindra . That 's what one gold medal can do , though Sushil and Vijender are also our national heroes .

@@1031234 <h> Do not shackle legal education <p> The proposed overarching law to regulate higher education , with its focus on state control , can not do much good for legal research . <p> July 17 , 2012 : <p> Not long ago , the Bar Council of India found itself amidst a controversy regarding the qualifications required to practice law . Despite resistance from law students , it introduced an examination that law graduates would have to take in order to enroll at the bar . <p> The measure , notwithstanding its uncertain legality as per a strict reading of the Advocates Act 1961 , was an ambitious one : law schools have , by and large , focused on regulating the input of students , thereby ensuring quality ; this change aimed at scrutinising the output as well . If made to work well , it could potentially impact both the quality of lawyers and the quality of legal education . <h> NEW EDUCATION BILL <p> Now , only a few months later , another controversy has erupted involving the Bar Council , and threatens to radically impact legal education in India . The controversy involves the Higher Education and Research Bill 2011 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Higher Education and Research . The proposed Commission is one that " shall ... take all such steps as it may think fit for the promotion and coordination of higher education and research " and " make regulations to determine , coordinate and specify standards of higher education and research . " <p> As Sections 16(2) and 17(2) of the Bill confirm , the steps and regulations envisaged are wide-ranging and the Commission exercises broad powers . The need for such a single all-encompassing regulatory body in higher education is a large and complex question , and one that has invited some commentary . The Bar Council 's concern is , of course , not the general sentiment towards higher education regulation that animates the Bill but its intrusion into legal education . <p> Legal education is currently the responsibility of the Bar Council , and Section 7 of the Advocates Act empowers the body to " promote legal education " and regulate its standards . According to the Council , the Bill takes away this power and goes against the Advocates Act . The point here is n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ runs against a previous law ; the doctrine of implied repeal will apply -- but one that attempts to bring to light a change in the regulatory regime . <p> On June 11 and 12 , around 1.7 million lawyers went on strike in protest of the Bill and in a submission made to the Standing Committee of Parliament on Human Resource Development in May , the Bar Council launched a litany of charges , alleging that the Bill violated federalism , democracy , and professional autonomy . <h> AUTONOMOUS COLLEGES <p> Notwithstanding the hyperbolic statement , the Bar Council did rightly emphasise the success of the National Law School of India University , Bangalore , and the five-year B.A. , LL.B. dual degree model . We now have fifteen such schools , and they threaten to continue to mushroom with remarkable energy . <p> But we should recognise that the growth of law schools does not confirm the Bar Council 's effective regulation of legal education . In fact , the growth of such schools seems to be taking place without reflection upon either institutional considerations like faculty quality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> There is a growing sense that such institutions are being pulled along entirely on the strength of their students , and even when basic changes in infrastructure and so forth take place , they do so as a result of student agitation . Furthermore , as we go lower down the food chain , it is clear that these rapidly-emerging institutions are n't being pulled along at all . <p> Although a law degree has now become a rather prestigious enterprise , and lucrative job opportunities follow those from the leading law schools , there has been little discussion about the aims of legal education . Such law schools hoped to improve the quality of the bar . But , in reality , few embrace the life of a litigating lawyer , and not entirely without good reason . <h> BAR COUNCIL 'S RECORD <p> More seriously , perhaps , there has been little effort to create a culture of legal education which promotes genuine research output that can understand and shape legal change . The LL.B. course still does not have even a basic set of quality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a respectable and authoritative law journal that can create a conversation between students , scholars , lawyers , and judges . <p> Does the current Bill provide a better solution ? Although it identifies a problem , the solution hardly seems better . No regulatory option is a priori superior , and we are always limited by choice rather than imagination . Our current crisis of accountability is such that the proposed model seems even less likely to succeed . <p> The Bar Council has raised an important and valid claim : the uninspiring track record of regulatory bodies like the one proposed in the Bill . Legal education at the level of a doctoral and masters degree ( Ph.D . and LL.M. ) lies within the domain of the state and not the Bar Council , and it is this area of legal education that remains most neglected . More importantly , though , other fields of education within the state 's exclusive domain only confirm this tragic reality . <p> Very few can honestly deny that the Bar Council has been a poor self-regulator . How many lawyers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not deny that even India 's best schools suffer from serious and basic institutional challenges , from faculty to infrastructure . The Bar Council has not addressed these with the enthusiasm that shines through its submission to the Standing Committee . <p> But it 's also true that concern and attention around these factors is growing , that the alumni of such institutions will , in time , play a larger role in their affairs , and that recent measures like the bar examination are good signs for the future . <p> The present Bill will destroy this slow but moving train . It vests complete power in members nominated by the government , and will shower us with the same problems of state-regulation that have plagued Indian higher education for so long . Despite all our current problems , the solution does not lie with government appointees . The Bar Council has certainly built the buildings ; it now needs to nurture the space for ideas within them . <p> This article is by special arrangement with the Center for the Advanced Study of India , University of Pennsylvania @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @

@@1031238 <h> Mehdi Hasan <p> The first I heard about Mehdi Hassan , who I call an amazing ghazal traash ( sculptor of ghazals ) , was in 1966 when a friend brought me a reel-to-reel tape of a Pakistani Radio recording of something he said would spellbind me . He insisted that he had never heard such a voice , such meticulous Urdu pronunciation and articulation of ghazals by famous Urdu poets . <p> Knowing our shared taste for ghazals , I did n't doubt him . But the problem was that as student I did not have a reel-to-reel tape recorder . Once I found one , I was enthralled to discover the recording of an upcoming Pakistani ghazal singer Mehdi Hassan singing his famous ghazal , " Gulon mein rang bhare . " I loved it . Thus far the only ghazals I had heard were all sung by Begum Akhtar , such as " Aye muhabbat tere anjaam pe rona aya . " <p> It so happened , the next time I heard Mehdi Hassan was after I had arrived in Washington as a student in the 1970s . I think , it was his first live concert in the U.S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him sing live on stage , almost roobaroo ( face to face ) . <p> And for more than two hours he showed us how a ghazal should be sung , how it can be composed in an Indian raga to make it immortal , and how and when , which part of the verse should be highlighted . Basically , what I felt was that only Mehdi Hassan could bring the real meaning and spirit of ghazals alive and convey to you with great ease what the shayar ( the poet ) really wants to say . It could be " Yeh dhuan kahan se uthta hai " or " Yeh rakh akhir dil na banjaye " or " Ranjish hi sahi . " <p> And much later after another concert in the US capital , when I interviewed him on behalf of Voice of America , he confirmed everything I had thought about him and his magic . He said he chose to compose them into ragas because a raga , be it Bhairavi or Darbari , always sounds fresh and once a ghazal is composed in that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ die . And he said he always tries to find out the bhava or the emotional premise of a particular ghazal and then chooses a raga that can pry the poet 's feelings out so it touches the hearts of audiences . All his ghazals were composed in a way that even today magically highlight the poet 's feelings . <p> That is why , unlike others , I do n't call him the King of Ghazals , as people have often described the late Jagjit Singh , another stalwart . I love Jagjit 's gayaki also , but for me with his heavy voice and subtle nuances , Jagjit was a well-trained horse racing on a well defined track , while Mehdi Hassan was like a wild deer running freely , hither and thither , in green pastures sometimes , in dense jungles at others , but always coming back to the basic raga and or as they say in Hindi , the sum . I find Mehdi Hassan even two notches above Ghulam Ali , whom I also admire fondly . <p> So instead of King of Ghazals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who with his gayaki and purely magical voice chisels an imaginary and abstract statue of sounds -- the ghazal . The notes are so entrancing that it is difficult sometimes to separate his lower notes from those of the harmonium . <p> I always feel he is like a sang traash , who first chooses , say a sad romantic ghazal by Ahmed Faraz , and then selects a raga to accompany its mood , and then with his skillful husky voice and true notes , he gives the ghazal its real shape , sculpting it in some places and chiseling it in others , to bring to us the real emotional premise of the poet , the true spirit in which it was written . <p> He established a new era in the ghazal gayaki . The styles of the ghazal gayaki will be always known as " the pre-Mehdi Hassan era " and " the post Mehdi Hassan era . " And little wonder that in this " post Mehdi Hassan era , " we see so many male ghazal singers trying to follow his style . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daughter , sitting in my lap in my family room in Virginia , used to listen to Mehdi Hassan , even though they did not understand the language . But the result is heartwarming . My son Brittan often questions me about the different ragas and their moods and wants me to leave for him my huge collection of Mehdi Hassan ghazals once I depart this world . And my daughter Samiha loves Indian classical music , and the other day , called from Durham to ask me what the Urdu word suroor means . <p> My last roobaroo mulakat ( face to face meeting ) with the maestro was in Washington on a beautiful summer evening at a live concert arranged by the Smithsonian Institute on the lawns of one of their museums . I can never forget when my ghazal god , limped from his chair , and with great difficulty and with the help of his sons , slowly climbed the 10 or so stairs to reach the podium . I was sitting on the lawns below among some 150 fans . We were concerned that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to sing as usual . But when he began singing in his even deeper and huskier voice , we were reassured that the shola ( fire ) is still not extinct after all . <p> And now that he is gone and his voice fills the stillness of my small living room in New Delhi , I wonder if ever there will be another Mehdi Hassan . As his voice consumes the silence of the room around me , singing " Shola tha jal bujha hoon , hawaein mujhe na do , mein kab ka ja chuka hoon , sadayeien mujhe na do , " ( The fire is extinguished ; do n't try to reignite me . I am long gone ; beckon not now for my return ) I feel tears quietly rolling down my cheeks .

Jeay Sindh Qaumi Mahaz , the pre-eminent Sindhi nationalist party , declared on July 12 that it would boycott Chinese goods as the Chinese government was facilitating large-scale Chinese investment into the proposed city of Zulfiqarabad in Sindh , which has been a dream project of President Asif Ali Zardari . <p> The JSQM also planned a protest rally outside the consulate general of China in Karachi , but the police authorities cordoned off the area and blocked all roads leading to it . The party workers , who could not reach there , burnt hundreds of SIM cards of Chinese telecom companies and have called a province-wide protest against the governments of China and Sindh on July @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modern city spread over a million acres being planned in the memory of Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto , in Thatta district of Sindh , is nothing but a conspiracy to turn them into a minority by colonising their home land by non-Sindhis . In their opinion the Chinese in collusion with the provincial and federal government are the main instruments of this colonisation . Their fears have been aggravated by the phenomenal rise in Sindh 's population between 1998 and 2011 , which is mainly attributed to the influx of people from Punjab and Khyber Pakhtoonkhwa . <p> Earlier the Baloch nationalists had given a similar call and have been targeting Chinese nationals and assets regularly . They feel that Chinese are not only robbing them of their natural resources , but in collusion with Islamabad are trying to change the demographic composition of the land through various mega projects being undertaken in Balochistan . They have accused Islamabad of giving away several profitable projects to China without anything in return and perceive China as the major collaborator in Pakistani establishment 's nefarious designs in Balochistan . <p> This has led @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ China is the largest source of foreign direct investment in Balochistan . As a result three Chinese engineers involved in the Gwadar port were killed in May 2004 . So strong was the threat to Chinese nationals that Pakistani authorities decided against taking Wen Jia Bao to Gwadar during his visit in 2005 , although the Chinese premier was originally slated to inaugurate the port . <p> In February 2006 , Chinese engineers working for a cement plant were killed in Hub . Subsequently a convoy carrying Chinese workers was attacked in Khuzder in July 2007 . At that point of time , a large number of Chinese companies were involved in oil and gas exploration activities and were holding 122 leases in Balochistan , with 1,200 Chinese personnel deployed in the region . <p> Sustained attacks by Baloch nationalists forced three Chinese companies , Great Wall , BGP and a unit of state owned CNPC to pull out of Balochistan . On November 22 , 2011 , an attack on Chinese convoy in Dera Bugti district killed five persons including three security personnel , although the Chinese engineers escaped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spectrum , the Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan has also targeted the Chinese nationals . Two Chinese engineers working in Gomal Zam Dam in South Waziristan Agency were kidnapped by the followers of Abdullah Mehsud in 2004 and one of them was killed during the rescue effort by Pakistan Army . Similarly , the clerics from Lal Masjid also kidnapped Chinese women from Islamabad , which eventually led to the storming of the mosque by the security forces . On July 8 , 2007 , while the siege of Lal Masjid was going on in Islamabad , three Chinese nationals were killed in Peshawar and another was injured , as they were shot at by radical militants . <p> In May 2011 , during the attack by TTP militants on PNS Mehran , the naval air base at Karachi the attackers were allegedly looking for Chinese nationals working there . A Chinese woman was killed by TTP militants in Peshawar on February 28 , 2012 , apparently to avenge the atrocities being committed against the Uighurs in Xinjiang .

In regions like GB , the Chinese personnel are being guarded by Chinese troops . As a result of the precarious security situation , many Chinese companies are planning to prune down their investments in Pakistan . In 2011 , one of China 's biggest private coal mining firms , the Kingho Group pulled out citing security concerns from a $19-billion deal to extract coal and set up power and chemical plants in Tharparkar district in Sindh province , which could have been the biggest investment by a Chinese company in Pakistan . <p> The crucial point that needs to be addressed is the reason behind these anti-Chinese actions in a country , where majority of the population is favourably disposed towards China . The prime reason appears to be the extreme sensitivity of Pakistani government to the targeting of any Chinese interest . As a result there is a perception amongst those fighting the government in Pakistan that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to attack the Chinese , as the government does not pay much heed to attacks on hapless Pakistani citizens . <p> The fact that serious acts of violence against Pakistani citizens including security personnel by the clerics of Lal Masjid did not stir government to action , but the kidnapping of Chinese nationals did , proves the point . In addition the religious extremists are also driven by their sympathies for the Uighur Muslims . However , in the case of various nationalist forces , which are secular in their orientation , there is also a belief that anti-China stance could possibly win them the support of the United States and the western world . This to a great extent has driven their actions against China besides Chinese role in their regions . The Diaspora from the smaller provinces have been quite active in the US and Europe to highlight the growing Chinese influence in Pakistan . <p> Sindhi nationalists are not only hoping to get their voices heard by their anti-Chinese stance but are also optimistic about garnering the US support for their cause .

In just 41 ODIs , Perera has won six awards , including five in 26 matches since the beginning of 2011 .

If you make a quick 30 and get 2-3 wickets , you will not get man of the match if someone has beaten you in both compartments . For example , if one bowler took 4 wickets , and an all rounder took 3 wickets and made 30 runs , the bowler who took 4 wickets will be man of the match . Therefore , for a batsman to get Man of Match , all he has to do is get a 50 or a 100 . For an all rounder to get an award , he needs to get a 50 AND at least 1-2 wickets OR 4+ wickets . Its a lot harder for all rounders to get man of matches , but they do get more chances . Anyways , Perera looks like the biggest match winner since the days of Flintoff and Abdul Razzaq . Ca n't wait to see more performances from him <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Is this the objective ? We Indians always have a different view on life !

@@1067238 <h> Hitman : Sniper Challenge Review <p> Hitman : Sniper Challenge , the standalone mission leading up to Absolution , gives players an introduction , a peek if you will , into a whole new world envisioned by IO Interactive , as the assassin we 've come to know goes back to his visceral roots . Coming as an exclusive to those who 've chosen to pre-order the fifth in the series , this morsel of a game brings in new elements while using key aspects that have made the series such a hit . The downloadable version for consoles was released in mid-May , while PC gamers were made to wait till August 1 . In this review we give you an idea of what to expect come November 20 , 2012 . <p> The entire story mission takes place with 47 constrained to a non-descript ledge of a Chicago high-rise . The high-profile target is extremely private and has an entourage of bodyguards with him at all times . But nobody is out of reach for the agency . And , as the CEO of a weapons manufacturing company , the client wants his passage from this world to be a fairly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during the company 's annual retreat , to quickly , and without attracting too much attention , take out all 15 targets . <p> The fact that you have to play a single mission several times over seems like a daunting task in the beginning , especially when you check the list of unlockables and the kind of scores they demand . But once you start to find your assassin feet and wiggle your toes a bit , things get a lot more interesting . Of course , it also helps to master the hair trigger mechanic . Moving kills give bonuses , chaining a series of quick killshots together amounts to a few extra points , as does concealing bodies . And you will need all the extra points you can rake up . But all things considered , gameplay is very restricted , although it does allow for sweeping variation . <p> An addition to the series is the ' Instincts ' ability , which allows 47 to keep track of and pick out his targets as they move about . While it reminds us of Arkham Asylum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , relevant and direct sums it up quite well . Another treat is the hair trigger mechanic which slows down your breathing for a short time , making the riffle steadier and more accurate . But this takes some getting used to , and after playing the mission over and over for what seems like a million times , you wo n't really need it . But who knows ? It may find its place in Absolution . <p> Gameplay seems to point you in the direction of fast kills , strung up one after the other . While this is challenging , it is also far from the man we 've come to know as the silent assassin , who would go to painstaking , time-consuming lengths to achieve things like making sure no one misses a waiter . This small game , in terms of how the gameplay pans out , reminds us of the 2007 movie which brought us Timothy Olyphant 's shaved head , exaggerated gait and fierce attacks . There is the slightest hint of emotion from the otherwise instinctive killer . <p> Creative variation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think up new ways to take down an enemy and keep him out of sight . And there are quite a few . Since you ca n't physically conceal a body , you must use your environment -- the environment at your disposal rather -- to serve your purpose . Shooting a guard standing at the edge of the terrace in the base of the head will cause him to be thrown over , thereby effectively eliminating unwanted attention . And although very noticeable blood stains remain , the other bodyguards do n't think much of it , carrying on unsuspecting . Even if you drop a body into the water it goes unnoticed . Things like these take away from the realism you might expect , but it would probably be a lot harder to get through the mission undetected otherwise . <p> Apart from the targets , there are several things in the game 's environment that require careful attention . Easter eggs , rubber duckies and such . And then there is the elusive Mr. X , raising several conscience-pricking questions . And after the developer has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its players completely through , we have little doubt that fans of the minimally tattooed agent will see out the rooftop mission with nothing short of perfection . <p> Final Word : Hitman : Sniper Challenge allows but a sampling of the assassin 's abilities and is a nice way to lead up to Absolution . It forces players to keep going in order to unlock features such as controlled breathing and faster and smoother reloads in Absolution . What it does n't provide is a complete sense of satisfaction that has followed 47 in practically every venture to date . Truth be told , we just ca n't wait for Square Enix 's next offering . But until then , Sniper Challenge will have to do .

" There are various categories of patients for whom home visits are beneficial and whose needs we are trying to address .

A crime does not reduce its importance simply because it was committed by backward community women and the killers were upper castes . Behmai 's women were killed twice . Once when Phoolan gang made them widow and second when the Thakur community did not have the courage to challenge primitive socio-cultural practices that comes along with widowhood . Political parties as usual used it to promote their dubious agendas . <p> It was February 14th , 1981 , but the day had no significance in terms of celebration as Valentine day . Nobody , ever know that this was day of love . Work was as usual going on . Women had gone to the fields with their men for the regular work . Village Behmai was the route of the dacoits in the steep ravines of Bundelkhand and Chambal . <p> Behmai village is situated in district Kanpur Dehat which is about 100 kilometer from Kanpur city .

The story of Phoolan and her family is a story of politics of caste and power in our country . It is the story of identities and the fictitious ' respect ' in its name as Phoolan paid a price during her life for her innocence and probably being used by others but that story later . The universal fact in India is that we love our families but they turn out to be the biggest villains of our lives but it is true about Phoolan too though not much has been written about it . <p> Behmai is a small village which has about 200 villagers mostly the Thakurs .

He says ' , nobody survived that day who was at home . All those who were around were killed to the brutality of the dacoits . This was the main road for the dacoits that time and we were forced to feed them . He adds , ' I can understand some caste loyalty among people but we did not give shelter to anyone .

There was no voice of protest as people knew that any protest would be harmful to them . After the villagers were asked to sit on an open space at the backyard of the village and suddenly before they could foresee anything , the dacoit started firing from all the sides . People did not have time to run away . Some fell to bullets immediately while others later . No one was in the village .

Nobody asked any one 's castes . These three people had gone to the village for constructing a house . So , two were labourers and one was a mason . But there might be a possibility that given the Phoolan gang 's animosity with the Thakur gangs of Dacoit , this village became victim of her wrath . It is also reported that Phoolan was allegedly raped by Lala Ram and other gangs in this village and people did not come for her rescue but this incident the villagers deny that anything had happened in their village .

No government schemes came here . Since the villages did not have huge votes so politicians did not dare to go them . Women in these Thakur localities live inside homes and do household work .

It is shocking to hear that even when this was not really a marriage , her brothers send her to husband 's place as a widow the very next day to see his dead face and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a bigger irony that in her ' husband 's house , the only person that time was his father as his mother was not alive . For a young girl of 11 years age , living with father in law as a ' widow ' can not be imaginable . In one year 's time , her father in law also passed away making the miseries of life deeper and perhaps irreparable for her . Now , a young 12 years old widow has to live life on her own without any support from anywhere . The only assistance that came from government was Rs 30/- per months pension initially which she refused to take as going to Kanpur was more expensive than this pension . It is shameful how our political class , media and social activists did not take the issue further . It creates an image of impossibility and negativism among people . While Phoolan is appreciated that she took revenge of her but Munni could nothing as avenging your ' own ' people who torture you is difficult and impossible . Phoolan too failed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we heard any brutality of the society where a woman who is not even formally married had to live her entire life crying weeping and in widowhood ? At eleven years of age , a woman without any fault of her was forced into the curse of widowhood by her own family just because for the sake of ' social ' ' norms ' and ' customs ' . What is this society about that we make our head high ? <p> When I reach Munni 's house , she sits there and her eyes says many things . She has lived her life in great distress , crying and weeping all these years . There is none who she would share her pain and agony . Meeting a man in this village of the Thakurs will make her boycotted in the village alone but all 84 villages where the Thakurs get their wards married . Munni 's niece is here with her and a bit argumentative . ' All you people come here and write about us all the stories but none could share our agonies ' . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but nothing changes here . There is no hospital , no road , no telephone , no pension for these people here . What has the government done here ? No politician came here to wipe out our pain . ' I do understand the journalists using the stories to sensationalise thing rather than trying to help them . When people are frustrated and looted from all sides , their faith in the system , in the people collapse and they feel betrayed all the time . I do not want to take your photograph , as I am not here to make money out of your photographs ... but I want to speak to you and share your agony so that tomorrow , other girls of our society can dare say things , so that their male members understand whether they are forcing their girls , daughters and sisters into a curse ' , I said . And I see a glimpse of hope in her . She starts speaking to her when she realizes that I am not a ' patrakar , ' a journalist , but a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the benefit of the people . One can understand what does a journalist means for a common villager ; it is simply ' middlemen ' for the powerful . <p> ' You should speak up now ' , I say . It is three thousand year when our women 's were forced to keep quiet and be the career of a vulgar culture which oppressed and humiliated them . Munni 's pain is unexplainable . You can only feel it if you are sensitive to human relationship and needs . How do you explain the life of a girl who lost her parents at 3 years of age and was forced into widowhood by her brothers at 11 years of age in the name of tradition ? There is unwritten code of conduct . She does not speak anything her family , her brothers who probably are her only rescue at the moment . But the truth is that her brothers and relatives had no courage to stand up with her and say that though they moan the death of Lal Singh , they can not send their sister to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We talk of widow remarriages and here we find people being forced into this by their own family . I felt only one things if her parents were alive , would they have forced her into this isolation and humiliation where she must have lived life being cursed . <p> Today , when we ask Munni to come out of her home and move ahead , it is impossible . People like you and me can say many things and claim our liberation but she has to live in the society there . Where is she going to do anything when she has no formal education , no one to put her head on and not to even think of any other man in her life as it is a curse , a blasphemy ? I asked a young boy was why she could not marry again . He said , ' It is our tradition . We can not think of marrying after husband 's death . That is our culture and self-respect . If anyone dare to do so , it would be impossible to get married in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I confront him that if a boy 's wife is lost or dies then how long you wait and pat come the answer from a woman sitting nearby that these people would not even wait for a month to get the new bride . ' What can we do sir , this is our culture and tradition ' , they say . <p> In the war for the honor of the community , innocent people were killed . We make people heroes in the name of community and oppression while they remain individual cases . There is no denying fact that Phoolan was victimized and those who victimized must be punished but for their crime , innocent lives were killed brutally . There is another reality that every crisis throws some solutions and those who do not opt for solutions in the crisis remained cage to their pasts , customs and traditions . The positive side , that I found in Behmai was that there was no hatred for Phoolan as I had expected as most of them felt that she was a pawn in the hands of others . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chief minister of the state did not come here . Of course , people felt betrayed as Phoolan became a Member of Parliament from Mirzapur who had little time for her family and own people . <p> While it is true that the government and political parties failed to reach the victims of the Behmai massacre victims as nobody knows about the status of the case in the court . Kanpur Dehat is the district now and yet there is no electricity in the villages . No widow pension , no ration card as everybody is APL and shockingly no sympathy with the villagers and widows . Are we brutal society where every discrimination and cry is based on our prejudiced mind where we keep conspicuous silence and make up our mind that a particular community is always villain and has always done wrong thing . That if it is victimized and killed do not get a mention in the media and no compensation provided to them . <p> Yes , Behmai 's Thakur community could have used this calamity as an opportunity by starting a social reform . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by widow remarriages which could have been of far reaching consequences . A calamity of that enormity could have provided them an opportunity to change the ridiculous rigidities of life in the name of traditions and customs . Nothing is impossible in this world as you need to listen to the sobs of a Munni or feel her pain and cry which may not be audible . You only need a heart , a sensitive heart to feel the pain , anguish of a person who is wronged from all the side . Oh , India , how long will you kill your women every day ? It is time , when we stop talking about great laws , constitution and everything as it is Manusmriti which rules India , even today and we are victims of it . India need a greater social awakening so that Munni and girls like her get an opportunity to live their life in happiness and share her joys and sorrows with rest of the world . @ @ @

@@1099236 <h> Structuring salaries for your start up <p> When your company is growing , you are constrained to pay more , and so you should focus on return on investment while recruiting . You should take into account the market condition and also the value the recruit is likely to add to your company or brand before finalizing the compensation package . <p> How much should start ups pay ? <p> A very good question . Again , there 's really no clear formula for companies that are just coming up . Experts though are of the common opinion that much of it depends on the funding ( or lack of it ) that your start up has received . The second most important factor , they agree , is your company 's expected year of generating its first profits . <p> The average salary payment is about 75% of what the individual was drawing previously or is capable of earning from the open market . Some start ups may pay as less as 60% on an annual basis and get away with it by offering other sops like flexi-hours , variable pay tied into performance , a year-end bonus perhaps , extra holidays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mothers , even stock options , though the employee may not be senior enough to command it . <p> Some clever financial juggling by your accountant could even ensure that the take-home pay at the end of the month is even lesser by bi-furcating the compensation into monthly and annual components . This will help you in case of stuttering cash flows . <p> In any case , no start up can give more than what the potential employee was earning in his previous job . <p> Employees salaries should grow with the company <p> This " category " of employees need to work out a time table where compensation is concerned . Obviously , in the gestation period , partners or founders may have to make do with the bare minimum wages . They need to fix this period , which is also tied in to their company 's business plans .

So , for a CEO , the compensation should be mostly tied in with the performance of the company . While every company is free to decide the fixed to variable salary ratio for its CEO , the thrust should be more on the variable component and less on the fixed part . <p> In the variable portion for a CEO , as much as 90 percent can be linked to the overall company 's performance and ten percent to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> While deciding on the wages , a lot also depends on the market scenario .

@@1111231 <h> Valuable lessons <h> Various aspects of Carnatic music are covered here . <p> Dr. Radha Bhaskar 's workshops on music appreciation have been well received both here and abroad . This double-CD album takes one on a musical voyage covering aspects of varnams , kritis/kirtanas and other forms of compositions which find place in Carnatic concerts . <p> The instrumental passage after each segment of Radha 's explanations , in Raga Surya ( earlier known as Sallapam ) is gripping and warrants repeated listening . The introduction provides a sample of the varisais and geethams before moving on to varnam . <p> Radha lists out meritorious composers of varnams such as Patnam Subramania Iyer , Kothavasal Venkatarama Iyer , Thriuvottriyur Tyagaraja , Veena Kuppa Iyer , Syama Sastri and Swati Tirunal . Pachimiriyam Adaiappaiah can not be forgotten and his name finds a rightful mention as the composer of the K. Ata Varnam ' Viriboni . ' <p> The singing pattern <p> The speaker mentions that varnams are sung at the commencement of kutcheris . She also explains that the pallavi of the varnam leads to the anupallavi , after which the chittaiswaram or Mukthayi swaram is rendered before going back to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and there are normally four such passages following the charanam . <p> Vocal demonstration of the Adi tala Saveri raga varnam ' Sarasuda ' and ' Viriboni ' are rendered . It is interesting to note when Radha mentions the charanam sahityam of ' Viriboni ' - ' Chiru Navumo ' bears an incomplete meaning which means ' Of the face with a slight smile . ' <p> Moving on , Radha informs listeners that after the rendition of the varnam , a performer generally presents a composition on Lord Ganesha , a few short kritis some of which may be preceded by raga essays and decorated with niraval and solfa passages . The shorter kritis are followed by major kritis with elaborate raga vinyasa , niraval and kalpanaswaras before proceeding to the ragam , thanam and pallavi suite , where the creative abilities of the performer come to the forefront . <p> Radha then goes on to explain the difference between a kriti and a kirtana . Kritis generally consist of a pallavi , anu pallavi and charanam or multiple charanams . In the case of the keerthana , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ musical setting , which is mostly simple . It is illustrated with the help of Tyagaraja 's Sahana kirtana ' Sri Rama . ' The speaker rightly says that keerthanas were composed for group singing . Even if one is not aware of the raga or tala of the kirtana , one can easily sing it due to its simple structure . <p> Earlier renderings of ' Nadupai ' ( Madhyamavathi ) by O.S. Thyagarajan and ' Sadananda ' ( Bahudari ) by Neyveli Santhanagopalan find a place in the disc to illustrate kritis . Further illustration is provided with ' Ganamurte ' ( Ganamurthi ) in the voice of Maharajapuram Santhanam , before which Radha explains that some kritis sport only a samashti charanam , a hallmark of Muthuswami Dikshitar . Two such kritis can be heard - Semmangudi Srinivasa Iyer 's rendering of ' Gajananayutham ' ( Vegavahini ) and the second vocalised by Radha which is ' Pamarajanapalini ' ( Sumadyuthi ) . <p> The topic moves to sangatis . How the variations take place in a musical setting are lucidly explained by Radha , who demonstrates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice of O.S. Thyagarajan ) and ' Vathapi ' in the silken voice of M.L. Vasanthakumari . <p> Vivid explanations <p> The second disc commences with an explanation on chittaswarams and swara sahityams . Radha explains that in Adi tala , the chittaswaram could be in two or four avartanams ; in Rupakam and Chapu talas , they could consist of many more avartanams . The chittaswaram of ' Anandamrutha ' ( Amrithavarshini ) and ' Namami Vighna Vinayaka ' ( Hamsadhwani ) in Radha 's and Trichur Ramachandran 's voices serve as illustrations . <p> The speaker takes up the subject of swara-sahitya chittaswarams also . Mention is made that the swara portion is rendered after the anupallavi , and the sahityam after the charanam . This scribe has heard Brinda and Muktha render such swara sahitya chittaswarams , when one of them would sing the swara and the other the sahitya at the same time . This had a mesmerising effect . The vocal demonstration by Radha for swara sahityam is the masterpiece of Tiruvarur Ramaswami Pillai , ' Jagadeeswari ' in Mohanam . <p> The swarakshara aspect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ falls on a note matching the lyric , it is referred to as swaraksharam . The examples chosen are ' Samaganalolane ' ( Hindolam ) . <p> One other aspect in connection with compositions which is dealt with is the ' Mudra ' or the signature of the composer . Radha says composers may resort to using ' swanama ' mudra or ' ithara nama ' mudra . In the case of the former , the composition is signed with the composer 's own name as in the case of Tyagaraja , Syama Sastri , Narayana Tirtha , Purandaradasa and Jayadeva . In the latter , the composition is signed using a different name . <p> The lecture ends with Radha talking about the various genres of compositions to conclude a concert -- padams , javalis , bhajans , abhangs , Tiruppugazh , Thevaram and tillanas . That each Tiruppugazh is set to a different chandam ( rythmic pattern ) is a useful piece of information . <p> A great deal of effort has gone into bringing out this educational album , which will most certainly serve as a guide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

On Thursday , the Samajwadi Party ( SP ) leader appeared before the media with Telugu Desam and Left leaders in tow to announce the holding of a non-Congress , non-BJP meeting on Friday to break the Parliamentary logjam . The BJP has been blocking the functioning of the two houses till the Prime Minister resigns over the coal blocks allocation scam . There is , of course , no possibility of that happening . <p> The broader impact of Mulayam Singh 's announcement was not lost on observers . Even as he continues to support the Congress-led UPA , he is making covert plans for a Third Front comprising regional parties which look most likely to make some gains after the next general elections . <p> However , the Third Front idea is DOA . Given the arithmetic of the current Lok Sabha and even the possibilities in the next one , there can be no Third Front government without the Congress or the BJP -- unless both parties see a dramatic decline with seats falling below 100-120 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This is almost the exact point made by LK Advani in his controversial blog some time ago . <p> " My own view is : ( i ) The shape which national polity has acquired in the past two-and-a-half decades makes it practically impossible for any government to be formed in New Delhi which does not have the support either of the Congress or of the BJP . A Third Front Government , therefore , can be ruled out ; ( ii ) A non-Congress , non-BJP Prime Minister heading a government supported by one of these two principal parties is however feasible . This has happened in the past also . But , as the Prime Ministership of Chaudhury Charan Singh , Chandra Shekharji , Deve Gowdaji and Inder Kumarji Gujral ( all supported by Congress ) , as also of Vishwanath Pratap Singhji ( supported by BJP ) , have shown , such governments have never lasted long . " <p> In the next Lok Sabha , it is only scenario 2 painted by Advani ( a minority government supported by either Congress or BJP ) that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is Mulayam Singh or someone else . <p> Coming back to Singh 's current efforts to recreate the scaffolding for a future Third Front , it is clear that the only way he can become PM is with the Congress supporting him from the outside . But why would the Congress do that ? <p> For starters , the parties he has started out with -- the Left and the Telugu Desam -- are both declining powers . The Left will gain a few seats in Kerala and lose an equal amount ( if not more ) in West Bengal , and so the numbers will not add up to more than they are now . <p> Telugu Desam is slipping badly in Andhra -- with Jagan Mohan Reddy 's YSR Congress likely to make gains at its expense in Coastal Andhra and Rayalaseema , and the Telengana Rashtra Samiti in Telangana . So it will probably fare worse than it did in 2009 . <p> Mulayam Singh is thus leaning on two losers . His best chances are thus not related to the Third Front , but with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Currently , the Congress and BJP hold 320 seats between them ( 206 for Congress and 114 for BJP ) . Assuming that the Congress loses 50 seats and the BJP gains only 10 seats in the next elections , the two parties will , between them , still have 280 seats . A clear majority . <p> So , no non-Congress , non-BJP government is ever going to be possible unless at least one of the two has a catastrophic fall that takes their seats below 100 . <p> But this is n't the only point . Any government headed by Mulayam Singh will not get the support of Mayawati -- who is sure to get at least 20 seats in Uttar Pradesh , come what may -- unless the Congress and Mulayam have a seat-sharing arrangement to divide UP between them . But in that event , one ca n't rule out a covert Mayawati-BJP arrangement , too . And if Mulayam Singh and Sonia Gandhi have a seat deal between them , why would Sonia agree to make the former PM ? <p> Take Congress , BJP @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is possible since it means taking out more than 300 seats in a Lok Sabha with 545 seats . In fact , even 245 would n't be the real number of the Third Front , for <p> any government supported by the Left will never entice Mamata Banerjee . The Third Front is a pipe dream . <p> Conclusion one : There can be no Third Front without Congress or BJP support . <p> Conclusion two : If no government is possible without Congress or BJP , the logic of not letting either of them lead a coalition makes no sense . This means UPA-2 will have to be succeeded either by UPA-3 or NDA-2 . <p> Conclusion three : Since it is widely assumed that a BJP headed by Narendra Modi will not be able to aggregate an NDA with a majority , the chances are the NDA will have to be either led by a compromise BJP candidate ( Arun Jaitley , Nitin Gadkari ) , or the Grand Old Man of BJP , LK Advani . <p> Conclusion four : Given the mercurial nature of most of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -- it will be highly unstable . <p> The chances of a Nitish Kumar heading it are about as bright as a Mulayam Singh . <p> My own betting is this : Mulayam Singh and Nitish Kumar have no chance to make it to the top job , unless Congress or BJP fall below 100 seats in the next elections . That looks highly unlikely at this point in time . <p> Barring a dramatic reversal of fortunes , we are going to see UPA-3 or NDA-2 in 2014.

This festival , started 25 years ago but stalled in between with sponsorship scarcity , generously hosts pan-Indian dance forms featuring established and upcoming talent . This year yet another slot presented college performers . Coinciding with the announcement of the prestigious Shantala State dance award for Lalitha Srinivasan , the festival , using three venues JSS auditorium , Ravindra Rangashala and Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan , held consecutive morning academic deliberations with writers and art personalities on art criticism . <p> Anita Sharma 's nifty Sattriya lecture/demonstration , introduced by Dr. Sunil Kothari , was a clean winner , the Oras ( Purush and Prakrti ) , Rajaghariya Sali , a few Mati Akharas , Nadubhangi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exit for kingly characters , and for a gopi -- all executed to perfection by her and the disciples . Madhavadeva 's Jhumura from " Pimpara guchuwa " with the gopi/Krishna interaction was lively . Most evocative in expressional delineation was the Bhatima rendered by Anita . The evening performance of Nandi from Sutradhari in Kalyan and Ek tala , Ramdani with Melar Nach incorporating Mati Akharas , and Gitor Nach in Chutkala , Sutal and Ek tala and Uma/Rudra Samwaad by a comely , aesthetically costumed group gave the audience a telling introduction to Sattriya . <p> Urmila Satyanarayanan 's Bharatanatyam in the centrepiece , paying homage to manifestations of Devi , was very communicative , whether depicting " Karunakari Kambukanthi Kathyayini " , or Bhairavi or Pandya Kumari Madhurapurivasi Meenakshi , the interpretative passages embellished by the ragamalika singing of Swamimalai Suresh . One wished the teermanams in the vigorous , cleanly profiled movements had , at finishing points , more immaculate rhythmic exactitude . Urmila 's abhinaya exulted in depicting the courtesan in the Shanmukhapriya padam " Yaradi Vaasalil " followed by the directly opposite tone of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tottu pesinaan " . <p> The other senior dancer Chitra Chandrasehar Dasarathy , despite competent musical support , still under the hangover of fever , seemed tired , her presentation of Moolaveedu Venkataswamy Nattuvanar 's Natakurinji varnam " Chalamela jesevaiyya " having a surfeit of ' karuna rasa ' without lacings of a more demanding nayika challenging Lord Ranganatha if her love for him was such a burden to bear " Nannu brova neeku bharama " . The too fast teermanams saw unfinished movements . In the Todi " Thaye Yashoda " abhinaya , after a tame start , the second half from " Anda Vasudevan evandaan " with the realisation that the young trickster the gopi is complaining of is the great God himself , was brilliantly expressive , showing the true prowess of the dancer . <p> Of the younger dancers , Radha Sridhar 's disciple Aishwarya Nityananda , in the Kharaharapriya varnam " Sringara Chaturane " , the nayika requesting the parrot to act as messenger and fetch her Lord Madanasundara , impressed in both nritta and nritya . Vocalist Balasubramani Sharma and nattuvangam by Pulakesi Kasturi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Navagraha revelled in contortionist Yogic postures . Set to ragamalika music , neither theme nor presentation method with English introductions to each planet , encouraged rasa build-up . Having a refrain connecting all the passages in ragas like Revati , Kapi , Hindolam , etc. , would enable an integrated rather than fractured presentation . <p> Preeti , disciple of Padmini Ravi , dances with uninhibited abandon , the openness never aimed at shallow prettiness . She successfully sustained the mugdha image of the unsophisticated hunter 's daughter Valli very well in the varnam , which converted even teermanams into narrative passages very intelligently . But all this bubbling energy without lacings of repose and inner quiet , becomes exhausting for the viewer . Lakshmi Ravi Khanna 's nattuvangam was most impressive . <p> Kathak couple Hari and Chetana , blessed with stage presence and synchronised movements , can afford to make their costumes less loud , without the orange outfit for a male . The white costume was fine . They need to fine tune their dance with more subtlety in aspects like thaat , and internalise emotion , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for . <p> " Tat Tvam Asi " by Nupur , with nritta in the Mysore style vocabulary , illustrating the inner journey of the micro jeevatma yearning to be united with the macro Paramatma through the Gita Govinda ashtapadis , had its moments , though one would have preferred an animated male dancer as Krishna . An ashtapadi like " Priya Charusheele " expressing Krishna 's love for Radha not being included was strange . For this critic the Sutradhari who became occasional Sakhi was the most communicative dancer . Music too loud had one raga too many . A ragamalika setting for " Pralaya Payodijale " with Dashavatar manifestations fits in . But in ashtapadis where every verse is in another raga , mood evoking becomes difficult . <p> Mayuri Upadhyaya 's Contemporary Dance lecture with visuals , though different from the original programming of dance presentation by the group , clearly grounded in the Indian sensibility , was most informative . <p> Discerning viewers look forward to the more detailed version of Dr. Pappu Venugopal Rao 's Powerpoint presentation on Gita Govinda in literature , dance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ version with its staggering , mind boggling statistics and visuals .

@@1123230 <h> Will the Euro Crisis Hurt China ? <p> t the moment , the news out of Brussels seems positive . The markets are cautiously optimistic that last week 's recent tentative agreement among the Eurozone members toward a new compact on government finance and bank regulation will hold . But investors are holding their breath : a failure could have grim consequences everywhere , including China . <p> If the Euro crisis continues , the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) predicts that growth in China could be chopped in half this year , from 8.5% down to 4% . Nor would the problems end there . According to economists , the effects of continued Western turbulence could be much more far-reaching . <p> However , most clouds have silver linings . One of the few for China is that European companies would be on sale , making an acquisition more attractive . Even as exports are hit , a weakened or pulverized Euro would put European assets on sale , opening up new merger opportunities for Chinese companies looking to build their global reach . <p> Richard F.M . Stoffelen , head of the China practice for KPMG Europe LLP in Frankfurt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ positive . " The positive is yes , prices go down , so yes , from that perspective it 's more interesting . The negative effect is uncertainty in the economic environment and uncertainty about the currency in which you own something , " he says . <p> No Surge in M&amp;A For now , however , Chinese businesses do not seem to have changed their stance towards European acquisitions substantially . Stoffelen says his phone is still ringing and deals are still being done , but the level of interest has not gone up significantly yet . However , that expectation remains . <p> Over time , Stoffelen says , he has found that the currency-exchange tends not to matter all that much when both the costs and the revenues of the company are in the same currency . However , when the revenues and the costs are in different currencies , then it can make a bigger difference . For example , he says , for a European Union-focused garment company or oil company , whose raw materials are usually sourced in dollars , the currency differential could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Juzhong Zhuang , deputy chief economist at the Asian Development Bank in the Philippines , argues that although a weaker Euro will hurt China by making its exports less attractive , domestic growth and trade with the fast-growing southern markets could compensate for the shortfall in Western growth . " My view is that growth of domestic demand and South-South trade will offset the impact of weak growth of major industrialized economies to a large extent , " Zhuang says . <p> China 's South-South trade has been growing strongly in recent years , according to Zhuang . Intra-Asia trade has dominated most of this growth , but Latin America and Africa are also increasingly important . However , their share is still relatively small , he says , less than 20% of the total South-South trade . <p> More important to Chinese growth right now is its domestic demand , which has continued to rise , and has become especially important since the global financial crisis , Zhuang says . " For instance , in 2011 , China 's growth was entirely driven by domestic demand , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ growth could keep the Chinese economy moving briskly over the next two decades . " I think China has the potential to grow at about 8% annually on average for the period of 2010-2020 and 6% annually during 2020-2030 . I am quite optimistic about this prospect , " he says . <p> Others also remain bullish on the Chinese economy , despite Europe 's problems . Robert Fogel , a Nobel Prize-winning economic historian at the University of Chicago who forecast in 2007 that Chinese GDP would grow to 40% of the world total by 2040 , says he remains optimistic today about Chinese prospects . " My opinion that China will continue at a high growth rate for the next 30 years is unchanged , " he said in an email interview with CKGSB Knowledge . <p> Political Consequences may Dwarf Economic Concerns Already in Europe , economic trouble seems to be leading to a resurgence of the violent hard right : in Greece , Hungary , the fascists are gaining genuine political power , a matter of concern for China if their xenophobia leads to restrictions on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the effects on China could go well beyond the consequence of weak sales or M&amp;A bargains . The biggest : a European disaster might slow momentum for domestic economic reform . Jean-Pierre Lehmann , a professor of French and American political economy at IMD in Lausanne , Switzerland , argues that Western weakness could strengthen the hand of Beijing policymakers who argue against reforms that would further expose it to the global economy . <p> Lehmann , who in addition to his academic work is the founder of the Evian Group , an international coalition of corporate , government , and opinion leaders working toward an equitable and sustainable global economy , says that recent discussions he had with reform-minded policymakers in Beijing suggested that they were worried about the implications a Euro disaster would have on their project . <p> Worldwide too , the political consequences of a Euro failure might be dire , Lehmann warns : a collapse in the European Union 's most visible project might come to be seen as a proof that supranational governance does n't work . If Europe wo n't work out an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possibly reach agreement on climate change or conclude a new global trade agreement ? " If you ca n't get them to act together in their own enlightened interest , how the hell can you get people to agree on the Doha Round ? " Lehmann asks . <p> Lessons from the Eurozone On a different note , some scholars say there are also positive economic lessons China may learn from the crisis . <p> Li Wei , professor of economics and emerging markets finance and Director of the Case Center at the Cheung Kong Graduate School of Business , feels that China can pick some key lessons from the Eurozone crisis to ward off potential threats . The main problem in Europe is not a debt problem -- it is about solving internal imbalances , he says . " After joining the Eurozone , the peripheral countries have become too expensive to do business in -- their wages have gone way beyond their productivity , " he says . " This structural problem has to be solved . " This internal imbalance is similar to what we are seeing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country becomes less competitive , the call for government help becomes stronger , and many of the private sector problems get passed on to public sector , " says Li Wei . " Even though China is not a democratic country , it has an overwhelming need to maintain stability and that is draining state funds . " <p> Rising social costs are themselves a structural cost , Li Wei notes . When income and tax revenues are rising quickly , it does n't seem very pragmatic to increase social spending . " But the tide can turn very quickly to make what used to look like a very sustainable debt problem to become intractable . We have seen this in Europe -- where a competitiveness problem becomes a sovereign debt problem . And Chinese local governments have large amounts of debt , " says Li Wei . " It is very important to realize that once things go wrong , they can go wrong quickly . It will be a perfect storm . " <p> Third , he stresses upon the importance to monitor fragility in the financial sector @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ market and the sovereign debt problems are making banks look pretty weak . Many of them are practically bankrupt -- they still exist because they are too big to fail . Chinese financial institutions will face similar pressure . So it is very important to make sure that the proper regulations are in place , there is transparency in information , " he warns . <p> If Li Wei is right , it would suggest that the greatest lesson China can draw from the European experience is that the most daunting political and economic challenges tend to be aggravated when not faced openly . As the example of the Eurozone crisis has shown , the worst kind of deficit of all is a shortage of credibility

If you too fall in the millionaire-aspirants category , presented below are some important financial tenets that will surely help you achieve your dream . <p> 1 .

But they also cost much more than a basic phone . It would n't be ' financially ' wise to buy a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ applications . When a simple phone serves your purpose , why waste money on the ' needless ' features . ( By the way , I have observed that , forget about using them , many people are n't even aware of the various features in their phone . ) <p> Instead , save this money and invest it wisely . Many , however , wo n't think so . They are of the opinion that their prestige comes from the type of phone they own ... and hence needless outflow of money . <p> This is just one example of money pointlessly draining out from your pockets . What about the costly branded products with little or no additional utility excepting the ' tag ' ; the luxury cars or gadgets to flaunt ; or the frequent dinners at expensive restaurants ? <p> Of course , this does n't mean that you should stop spending . Spending , by itself , is not the issue . The issue is how you spend your money - thoughtlessly or rationally ; intelligently or foolishly ; regularly or sparingly . Choice is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kite . The purpose of the thread is not to prevent the kite from flying . In fact , without the thread the kite will not fly far or fly high or fly for too long . <p> Many tend to live from salary to salary , without giving a serious thought to either balancing their budgets or planning their finances . <p> Some try to put it off for tomorrow ; but the tomorrow never comes.Some do a half-hearted attempt ; it serves no real purpose . <p> Some start enthusiastically ; but within a few months are back to square one.Some do n't fool themselves ; they never even start . <p> In fact , budgeting is normally considered to be nothing but trying to balance the cash inflows and outflows ; prioritizing so as to fulfill as many needs and desires as possible within the constraints of a given income . This , however , is a narrow perspective about budgets . <p> Budgeting is lot more than that .

If you prefer safety , you have to be content with nominal returns . <p> Without risk , there 's going to be no riches . <p> In fact , 100% safety is also a myth .

After already having shared platforms on the Micra and the Pulse , Renault and Nissan are at it again with the Scala . The Scala is basically the Nissan Sunny and like in the case of the Pulse , the Scala looks a lot more appealing than the Sunny thanks to the large , aggressive grille , stylish headlights and new alloy wheels . The rear bumper features a blacked-out section that mimics a diffuser , which helps reduce the car 's visual bulk . When viewed in profile , the Scala is exactly the same as the Sunny , save for the attractive new alloys .

It 's only when going uphill with a full load that the throttle lag becomes apparent and the Scala struggles to gather decent pace .

And , with power tapering off as early as 3800rpm , it 's best to use the gears and keep the engine in the mid-range . <p> What is very impressive is the Scala 's ride quality . This saloon competently absorbs rough sections and bad roads , thanks to its pliant suspension and tyres . The suspension works silently but sound insulation is not that great and each time you hit a coarse patch you get a hollow humming sound . <p> That said , the Scala remains a tidy handling car .

@@1123237 <h> What 's Hot and Trending in Bollywood <p> Scoops &amp; News <h> Popular Punjabi private albums making presence in big way in Hindi cinema <p> September 11 , 2012 08:22:57 PM ISTBy Enkayaar , Glamsham Editorial <p> When was the last time that a song from a regional language was incorporated in a Hindi film after paying copyright for it to the tune of Rs. 70 lakh ? Well , it just happened with COCKTAIL , whose song ' Angrezi beat pe ' , sung by Honey and Gippy was bought by Saif Ali Khan for Rs. 70 lakh to make it a part of his film COCKTAIL , and the song along with Jugini is indeed the highlights of the songs of COCKTAIL . <p> Honey and Gippy are now a prized commodity in the world of Hindi film music and the producers and directors are running after them to give music for their coming films . Indeed Punjabi music or the music sung in Punjabi language , which is a part of the staple diet of average Punjabi all over the state , as also amongst the Diaspora all over the world is finding increasing acceptance in Hindi films . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ music album of Hindi film has to have a rustic Punjabi flavor . It serves two purposes on the one hand it provides an element of rustics , it also helps as a catalyst in Delhi and Punjab territory which is one of the biggest territories , and it also helps in bringing the audience from Diaspora around the world into the cinema halls . <p> Punjabi folk music was an integral part of the Indian film music oeuvre till the time O P Nayyar was around . Feroze Khan , however , was the man who reintroduced the club Punjabi music being played across various dance clubs and bars through his film YALGAAR . In YALGAAR Feroz Khan had introduced the popular music director of London Channi Singh who gave an insight of what the club music in London was all about and how it was shaping the entertainment landscape . <p> In COCKTAIL ( which has entered the elite 100 crore category in Indian rupees- the new benchmark of commercial success ) , there are two songs which belonged to a private album but have been introduced into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ song is ' Jugni ' and the second one is Honey and Gippy 's ' Angrezi beat pe ' . As a matter of fact Kareena Kapoor and Saif Ali Khan had listened to the song in Dubai and they wanted to buy the song for their film at all costs . In COCKTAIL , another song ' second hand Jawani ' again is in the voice of the only female Punjabi Singer who has made her name for herself among her male peers from the land of five rivers , the name behind the voice being Miss Pooja . <p> It was SINGH IS KINNG which had set the tone in the recent times of using popular Punjabi songs in the mainstream cinema when they picked up the popular music band RDB of London which composed the title song which was sung by Snoop Dogg . The success of the title song of SINGH IS KINNG was a heady combination of rustic voice of Mika from the hinterlands of Punjab and the Snoop Dogg set to the pulsating club music from London which was fused to perfection to address @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pind aka the native land . <p> When one talks of the proliferation of songs based on Punjabi themes , and mixed with western tunes and it getting an echo in one form or the other in the world of cinema in Hindi a fact that has to be borne in mind is that London is a very big market for the Hindi films , and therefore consciously or subconsciously such songs find representation in the films that are being made in Hindi . Huge Punjabi Diaspora ensures footfalls and moolahs for the producers and the directors therefore they try to innovate as much as possible to bring the flavor of rustic Punjab . <p> It could be for this reason only that Arif Lohar 's ' Jee Karda Bhai Jee Karda ' became such a roaring hit in SINGH IS KINNG and in the same manner Lember Hussainpuri 's ' Saadi Galli ' , from TANU WEDS MANU became the signature tune for the film . <p> The music directors of the present times are constantly on a lookout to pick up songs from these private albums , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ village roads of Punjab as also by the Diaspora predominantly in London and use it to create a buzz around their music albums for various films . In the near future with Gippy Singh emerging as one of the biggest actors in Punjabi cinema with two super hit film CARRY ON JATTA and JATT TE JULIET , each doing a business of Rs. 25 crore each , who knows he might play the role of a lead actor ? Times indeed are changing times . 
@@1123238 <h> Suzuki Slingshot vs Suzuki Swish <p> Suzuki Slingshot vs Suzuki Swish <p> Like this story , share it with millions of investors on M3 <p> Suzuki Slingshot vs Suzuki Swish <p> Suzuki Slingshot vs Suzuki Swish <p> Post your opinion here <p> This is such a simple comparison . Buy a scooter and your pants will not get muddied as easily as on a motorcycle in the rains . If you like your pants enough , the three monsoon months are enough motivation to look at scooters alone . That 's all , shows over , bye bye . <p> But it is n't that simple . Motorcycles and scooter are wildly different in role and engineering . Scooters - especially the way we know them in India - are urban creatures . Meant for short trips about town , convenience of operation and to offer utility - storage space under seat and on the floorboard . <p> Motorcycles have a narrower focus - they get people and only a little bit of their luggage from point A to point B , and most of the time , the larger the displacement of the engine , the farther apart A and B can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carry luggage , even a shopping bag with a kilo of potatoes , you either hack up a solution - like hang it off the handlebar and corrupt directional accuracy - or invest in a solution - like a backpack , or tank bag . <p> Scooters have small wheels . So ride quality can not match motorcycles - big wheels deflect less over bumps and offer greater stability . In this sense , no matter what your father says , motorcycles are safer than scooters . It 's a big deal . But not abroad . The advantage motorcycles have in ride quality becomes less and less relevant as roads get better and better . And that will probably happen in India . Our roads are far from perfect but they slowly , steadily get better every year . There will come a tipping point where the ride quality will not figure in your purchase decision because in your town the roads will be good enough for it to not matter . <p> Then again , motorcycles are preferred load carriers in extra-urban situations . We do n't condone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would make sense . 200kg of onions on the floorboard , 200 on the rear seat with just enough space for 30kg more under the seat . But farmers prefer to load 200kg on the motorcycle instead . Why ? Because the smaller wheels and the naturally top-heavy stance of the scooter would make it unrideable with this load , but a motorcycle can and ( unfortunately does ) survive this role prostitution . <p> Now look at the ergonomics . The motorcycle has higher handlebars , while the scooter has a lower one . It 's about the role . The scooter needs to handle shorter trips so this ergonomics package works . On a significantly longer commute , the lower handlebar would n't work quite as nicely . Trust me , I know . I have traversed the Mumbai-Pune highway - about 180km each way - repeatedly on both bike and scooter . It can be done but the bike always feels more at home , safer and has the performance to make me feel safe in fast traffic . Scooters come into their own when I reach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavy traffic - you really appreciate the twist n ' go ability when you 're crawling along without a painful clutch hand , or sullied gearshift-side boot . <p> Now look to the European market scooters with 500cc engines like say the Yamaha T-Max . You 'd be surprised how much like a motorcycle it is under the skin . The frame is nearly a full-on twin-spar while the wheels are as big as possible while keeping a low seat height . But the ergonomics look like a power cruiser ( think Road Star Warrior ) which makes it highway worthy . What it retains from ( maxi ) scooters is a large under seat cavity that can nearly host proper touring luggage in waterproof , lockable accommodations . And the powertrain layout . <p> In layout terms , scooters are always at a disadvantage because the floorboard and apron force the engine further back in the design . So the front-ends are always lighter and this means handling can not be as sharp as a motorcycle . Mass centralisation is far harder to deal with on a scooter . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have 125cc engines , marginal differences in power and torque and just Rs 500-odd in price . The automatic transmission makes the Swish slower despite its 18kg lighter weight . This is standard automatic transmission character and that 's also the reason why the Swish returns 10kmpl less . <p> Shumi would say you should prefer motorcycles for the most simple of reasons . Motorcycles are more fun , they have a wider ability in terms of handling the city as well as going down the highway and most crucially , big wheels mean cornering is great fun . I 've commuted on scooters to college so I know that I 've never had to struggle with rain pants in the parking lot during the rains . A light jacket on my back and my college bag on the floorboard and I 'm a cool commuter . I 'd also think that most Indian womenswear tends to favour scooters rather than motorcycles . So whether riding is a pleasure or not , women will always tend to prefer scooters , unless we get motorcycles with lower seat heights or they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old days , this was simpler . The distinction between motorcycles , like the Jawa or Enfield and scooters like the Lambretta or Chetak was crystal clear . Like the white and black colours of our test bikes . They were dramatically different in price and in nature . <p> I rode the Swish and Slingshot in Pune to figure this out and as soon as the rain started , I completely ruined my denims about halfway up my shins on the motorcycle . I then noted that everyone seemed to have zip tied a giant cardboard splatter guard on their crash guards to prevent exactly this . This being an air-cooled engine it 's probably better for the pants than for the engine . In stock form , I immediately appreciated the sweeter ride quality of the motorcycle and the alertness of the chassis that the bigger wheels and more sorted handling bring to motorcycles . <p> But when I hopped on to the Swish I realised that shifting gears in crawling urban traffic is a waste of effort and progress is almost exactly as quick , not slower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of the muck and the scooter itself emerged from the showers and mud looking vastly less splattered than the motorcycle . Which is time saved cleaning it before heading to work or college in the morning . I also noted that my backpack felt much lighter when it rested on the floorboard of the Swish than when I wore it on my back on the Slingshot . So , how to reach a decision ? I would start with the distance of the commute . If you 're commuting from , say Thane to downtown Mumbai , well over 40km one way , over some fast roads and some congested stuff , motorcycles make more sense . They feel more secure and are more comfortable over these longer in-saddle minutes . Anything up to 20km can be handled on scooters but the advantage for the smaller wheelers grows if the roads are more congested over this distance - in terms of no gearshifts needed as well as in terms of not having to bear the weight of your luggage . Over longer distances , the superior economy of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play in this matter . <p> If the odd highway trip is on your menu , then of course , you have to get a motorcycle . Until such time that we get a 250cc scooter that will cruise at nearly 100kmph and be able to pass traffic smoothly and easily . Higher speeds will naturally bring better dynamics but on scooters this usually also means stiffer suspension and hence worse ride quality . Not a bad thing on great roads but a potential deal breaker on our roads . And till these scooters arrive , motorcycles will always be more fun to ride , a big one in our books . <p> And finally , the rains . They appear to be the obvious reason to buy scooters in places like Mumbai where the rains last a full , unabated three months and the roads get mucky like heck . Scooters do make sense from the cleanliness point of view here though bikes are more stable in slippery conditions . But it is a matter of one quarter of the year at the end of the day . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe the day this comparison leans automatically towards scooters will come - and not because of global warming and changing weather patterns either . But today is not that day .

@@1134231 <h> Is Aerial Yoga Really Healthy ? <p> After Pilates and power yoga , the mantra to fitness is a special type of yoga called Aerial Yoga . This type of yoga is a combination of the principles of the Indian Yoga asanas with the aerial arts ( like the trapeze games in circuses ) . The basic premise of Aerial yoga is to be suspended from the air and do all your exercises against gravity . <p> But is this type of yoga a really effective way to improve your fitness or is it just another passing fad ? That is the dilemma we are discussing here . <p> The Hammock : <p> We have all used the hammock to laze around on a lazy vacation just to relax and read books . In aerial yoga , the main equipment for workout is a hammock .

As a result it improves the flexibility of your muscles . <p> Another huge benefit of this special kind of yoga is that it does not put pressure on your back .

Banatwala 's Muslim League was a party confined to fringes of the South and Owaisi , despite being a hardcore political stalwart , could not speak for the entire Muslim population of India . <p> It was , however , in 1980s that a name like Syed Shahabuddin emerged on the scene . He was not only a seasoned diplomat but also a sound intellectual with an appeal that could make him the strong voice of the community @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after the demolition of Babri Masjid in 1992 . He became the sole voice of resentment against the demolition of the Masjid . Unfortunately , he became the victim of the conspiracies of being branded as " communal " and he soon vanished in thin air . <p> On the other hand , Muslim religious organisations could not come out of the perpetual guilt complex of Partition and failed to give direction to their community . Different religious schools in India played in the hands of one or the other political party , thus concentrating on short-term interests and sacrificing larger ones . The seminaries across north India failed to empower the community both educationally and socially . Their conformist attitude left them far behind to be exploited by fringe elements in the political set-up . Votes in the name of Muslims were garnered by leaders of all political parties . Even Mufti Mohammad Sayeed and Ghulam Nabi Azad , two political stalwarts of Jammu and Kashmir , contested from Bihar and Maharashtra and reached Parliament . Similarly , when Saifuddin Soz was briefly pushed into political wilderness by his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offered to contest from a Muslim-dominated area in India . But he refused and chose to lose from his traditional constituency in Baramulla . There are surely 29 Muslim members in Lok Sabha but hardly any of them could be considered as a leader who genuinely represents Muslims not only in Parliament but in other forums as well . <p> Take the recent example of the massacre of Rohingya Muslims in Burma and in Assam . With India having the second largest Muslim population in the world , no leader or a body could force the Indian government to register its protest with the Burmese government . Likewise , in Assam all forces were out to shift the focus to " illegal immigration " into Assam from Bangladesh . But if Muslims are solely responsible for the violence in Assam " who gave 5000 AK 47 rifles to Bodos in Assam , " questions Dr Tasleem Ahmed Rehmani of the Muslim Political Council . The plight of Indian Muslims in the camps is pitiable . Parliament Member Badruddin Ajmal told Outlook magazine that 90 percent of those killed in Assam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that could safeguard the humanitarian rights of the people in Assam . Those occupying the top positions in the government under the quota of being Muslims have only used that power to further their own interests . For this huge gap , Congress being the premier political force in India has also played a role in discouraging the emergence of an able leader . This could be seen in the backdrop of how they felt bitten by a person like Mohammad Ali Jinnah . However , the party has largely banked upon Muslim votes and done nothing substantial for them in nearly half a century rule it enjoyed in India . <p> There is , however , only one hope for Indian Muslims , which can be seen in the young , articulate and non-compromising Assaduddin Owaisi . Despite being under attack from Arnab Goswami for what he called his " irrational statement " in Parliament , Owaisi emerged as the only genuine leader who voiced his concern in the right perspective . After visiting 15 relief camps , Owaisi called upon the nation to be cautious about a third @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Masjid demolition and Gujarat pogrom as the reasons for two waves that led to radicalization of youth thus exploited by what he called anti-national forces . Assam 's violence is a case for introspection for the community leaders who have failed to represent them , that too in the largest democracy of the world . <p> Today , Muslims in India are orphans at the political level , and they deserve a strong leadership , which could move towards undoing the injustices brought out by the Sachar Report and also facilitate their living as proud Indian citizens . This is the biggest challenge the leadership faces . <p> The role of Muslims in the Indian freedom movement has been profound . Noted American author Gail Minault maintains in her book The Khilafat Movement that " whether as individuals or as a community , Muslim influence on the direction of Indian political activity was profound during this period " . But the way the community has suffered during the six decades following Independence is partly because of lack of genuine leadership and partly for reasons that Indian polity has taken a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effect in succeeding years but after 60 years that situation has forced the community to live in an atmosphere of hope and despair . Violence is no solution to any form of injustice but they need many Assaduddins to live like rest of Indians . ( risingkashmir.in ) <p> MG comment : Mr Rahul Gandhi should have also asked : why India has failed to produce a person like Gandhi and Nehru in the post-Independence era ? The fact is that the ruling party/parties consciously crush any emerging personality and find ways to send him/her into wilderness . See how Congress treated Syed Mahmood , or how the polity treated Dr Faridi and Shahabuddin or how the Muslim League trashed Banatwala . Kashmir was expected to produce an Indian Muslim leader of national stature but none has emerged after Shaikh Abdullah . I was present in a meeting in which former Union minister and former governor Khurshid Alam Khan narrated that during a cabinet meeting he raised a Muslim issue . Indira Gandhi was enraged and asked him : " have Muslims sent you here ? " The message is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few Muslim showpieces to demonstrate to their Muslim voters that their voice is being heard when , in reality , it is not . The decadent polity based on note and vote has created an army of worthless individuals who project themselves as " leaders " and swarm political parties ' offices offering their services on the cheap . The demoralised Muslim community too has not risen to the challenge and forced the polity to accept a Muslim leader on its terms ( Zafarul-Islam Khan ) .

@@1143238 <h> ' We can now predict future Lashkar attacks ' <p> September 21 , 2012 14:16 IST <p> Terror outfits like the Lashkar-e-Tayiba thrive on one very major factor -- the element of surprise . Intelligence agencies across the globe have gone wrong on many occasions and the LeT has surprised many when they stage an attack . <p> Now what if one were able to predict what the Lashkar was up to ? Knowing beforehand what they would do would surely go a long way in preventing an attack . Here is a programme known as the Computational Analysis of Terrorist Groups : Lashkar-e-Tayiba , developed by the researchers at the University of Maryland in US , which could act as a predictor of what this group is up to . <p> The project used algorithms to parse mined data on 770 variables from 20 years of Lashkar 's activities . The variables were updated every month for a computational analysis and this gave an understanding of the factors that determined of how often the Lashkar attacks occurred . <p> During the study it was found that if between 5 and 24 Lashkar operatives were arrested and put on trial , then there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ local forces . <p> V S Subrahmanian , researcher at the Maryland University 's Laboratory for Computational Cultural Dynamics , headed this project . He along with his co-author , Aaron James , tell Rediff.com 's Vicky Nanjappa about the project and how it helps in acting as a predictor for attacks by the Lashkar . <p> Sir , for how long have you been working on the book Computational Analysis of Terrorist Groups : Lashkar-e-Tayiba ? <p> For over five years . <p> Based on data mining and also data on variables over 20 years , it acts as a predictor for different types of terror strikes carried out by the Lashkar . Could you explain to us how this would work ? <p> In our study , we identified 770+ variables describing different types of attacks carried out by the LeT , as well as different aspects of the environment in which LeT carried out these attacks . The values of these variables were identified from reliable open sources for each month , starting from January 1990 to December 2010 . <p> We then learned conditions on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i ) when the discovered condition was true in a given month , it was followed by certain types of attacks in the next 1-3 months with high probability ( ii ) when the discovered condition was false in a given month , it was followed by the same types of attacks in the next 1-3 months with very low probability , and ( iii ) the condition was true sufficiently often . Thus , the conditions discovered in this way are like the proverbial " canary in the coalmine " providing strong predictors of future attacks ( of certain types ) . <p> In India there are various agencies which have been formed to study the pattern and mindset of the Lashkar and other terrorist organisations . Do you think they should base their study on the model that you and your team have sought to set up through your study ? <p> Our framework is one of the most data-driven and systematic studies of LeT to date . However , given the seriousness of the LeT threat to India , our model should be combined with other methods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found useful , so that their decisions are guided by the best methods discovered to date . <p> Security experts often speak about the manner in which a group such as the Lashkar changes its strategy . Is this correct or has the group become predictable in the manner in which it carries out an attack ? <p> All terror groups ( including the LeT ) change their on-ground tactics in order to evade detection . However , terror groups , including LeT , have organisational goals and processes ( as well as inertia ) that enable their strategic goals to be more predictable in the short term ( six months out , say ) . <p> That said , it is very difficult for anyone to accurately predict when and where LeT will carry out terrorist attacks . What our study does is to predict when certain types of attacks will be carried out -- but not exactly where . <p> How do you think this book would help in reducing or preventing future attacks by the Lashkar ? <p> The conditions that we have identified that are predictive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take appropriate protective measures against such attacks by beefing up security around the types of locations and situations LeT targets . <p> Moreover , the policies we propose in the book offer the promise of keeping LeT busy managing their own internal issues , reducing their time and ability to plan terror attacks . <p> What options would you suggest to reduce the threat of the Lashkar ? <p> The book proposes three major methods . ( i ) Disrupt the internal cohesion of LeT by fostering internal dissent within the organisation , ( ii ) Identify carefully calibrated and publicly stated repercussions for the Pakistani government if LeT carries out another terror attack and ( iii ) Find ways to disrupt LeT press and publicity campaigns as well as LeT training camps . <p> How serious have you found policy makers especially in India and the United States of America in countering the threat of the Lashkar ? <p> I have found both to be very receptive to data-driven approaches to countering the LeT threat . <p> What are the main factors which determine an attack by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 770 variables used by you suggested ? <p> The main variables correlated ( usually in some combination with each other ) with LeT backed attacks are : <p> Internal cohesion of LeT <p> Pak government support for LeT <p> Existence of LeT training camps <p> Press/publicity campaigns carried out by LeT <p> Social services programs carried out by LeT <p> The relationship between LeT and other Islamist groups . <p> What is the most effective counter terrorism strategy against the Lashkar according to you ? <p> The book proposes three major methods : ( i ) Disrupt the internal cohesion of LeT by fostering internal dissent within the organisation ; ( ii ) Identify carefully calibrated and publicly stated repercussions for the Pakistani government if LeT carries out another terror attack ; and ( iii ) Find ways to disrupt LeT press and publicity campaigns as well as LeT training camps . <p> The bans , freezing of assets and also the arrests have had some amount of success in weakening the Lashkar . You have also said that fostering the dissent within the Lashkar commanders would help in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this regard by the various agencies across the world ? <p> We have not seen evidence of ongoing efforts to foster dissent amongst LeT 's commanders.Could you also tell us about the machine learning techniques applied by you to the data sets to counter terrorism ? <p> We extended a data mining algorithm we developed and patented about 7-8 years ago to learn conditions of the kind described in response to your second question above . <p> Broadly the book suggests what lies in store while dealing with the Lashkar and its operatives . How accurate can the predictions be ? <p> This remains to be seen . However , about 15 months ago , we made broad predictions of attack trends by LeT which were over 80 per cent accurate , so we hope the same holds for the future . <p> However , we are not aware of any prediction methods to date that can accurately pinpoint both when and where an attack will take place . <p> Image : A burning Taj Mahal Palace Hotel during the 26/11 terror attacks in Mumbai orchestrated by the LeT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @

Not just because dozens of singers have come in after her , but also due to the fact that though this voice of Madhur Bhandarkar 's Heroine ( ' Halkat Jawani ' ) began singing for big-name heroines only in 1999 with ' Ruki Ruki Thi Zindagi ' ( Mast ) , Sunidhi Chauhan has actually been around since the early ' 90s , she was the star attraction of Kalyanji-Anandji 's globally-successful Little Wonders show . <p> Unfortunately , Sunidhi never got to record a song with the legendary maestros as they had quit the film industry scene by then , but she started out in playback by recording ( at the age of 11 ! ) her first song for Aadesh Shrivastava - ' Ladki Deewani ' in Shastra , the Suniel Shetty actioner . The year was 1995 , so she insists that she has been around for 17 years ! <p> By concentrating more on shows , playback singers today spend more time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the eras of Lata Mangeshkar or Alka Yagnik . Yes , I am very busy with shows , but I have the best of both worlds because I am also getting to sing a lot of the better songs going from item numbers like ' Halkat Jawani ' ( Heroine ) and ' I Want Just You ' ( Joker ) to melodious numbers like ' Gun Gunguna Re ' ( Agneepath ) , ' Kyoon ' ( Barfi ! ) and ' Ishq Sufiyana ' ( The Dirty Picture ) . In fact , this year 's been quite good , with ' Main Teri Fan Ban Gayi ' ( Tere Naal Love Ho Gaya ) , ' Jab Se Mere Dil Ko Uff ' ( Teri Meri Kahaani ) , ' Chokra Jawaan ' ( Ishaqzaade ) , ' Lamhe ' ( Vicky Donor ) , ' Disco Deewane ' ( Student Of The Year ) and now also ' Ishqk In Paris ' . <p> Do you think that your image has been again tweaked towards more of item numbers after ' Sheila Ki Jawani ' in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had ' Someone Somebody ' ( Tell Me O Kkhuda ) and ' Aa Zaraa ' ( Murder 2 ) , which were not item songs at all . I find a nice balance . <p> Are you missing the composers that were active in your early days ? I think most of them are still around , though maybe not as busy as before . As a singer , I am very happy that I am getting to sing with all the big names today like Pritam , Sajid-Wajid and Vishal-Shekhar to new-age talents like Amit Trivedi , Sangeet and Siddharth Haldipur and Sachin-Jigar . <p> How does it feel to have a rich repertoire of songs a mere 13 years after you really broke through ? I am very happy that all the composers have called me for every kind of song , and not just one kind , as was the case when I was singing ' Tu Sirf Mera Mehboob ' ( Ajnabee ) or ' Boomro ' ( Mission Kashmir ) . And I feel nice that after I was accepted in the regular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still got the cream of dance numbers like ' Dhoom Machaa Le ' ( Dhoom ) and ' Beedi ' ( Omkara ) . And I want to thank music lovers for accepting me for such a long time , over and over again . <p> Is there a genre you have never been given to sing ? Yes , and the one I want to really do is a ghazal . But I will not wait for a film ghazal to come , as it is almost unknown today as a female song . Instead , I am planning a ghazal album . <p> How do you assess yourself as a singer today ? Oh , I see many shortcomings in me . I can not share them and bring them to your attention ! But I am forever trying to rectify whatever deficiencies I keep seeing in my work . In any case , one can never be 100 percent perfect and if you think you are , you will soon be over . <p> For a while , it seemed that the era of confusion in film @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back into a messy scenario of fly-by-night hooks masquerading as songs . What do you have to say to this ? I think that there is a healthy two-way thing going . The new-age music people are being appreciated even as melody , as always , rules and music rooted in India , like that of Sajid-Wajid and Himesh Reshammiya , continues to rule . <p> And what is your explanation of there being no new major force in music after Pritam and no female voice of depth after you and Shreya Ghoshal , who came in 2002 . I can not answer the second question , because I think that only God can explain that ! I would say that hard work is the most vital aspect of sustained success . Like I insist on being satisfied with my singing before I allow the music director to pass my song . Then there are cases where a music director may admit that the composition is average but they would like me to enhance it somehow . As they have put faith in me , it is my duty to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so to speak , I have never paid attention to who is doing what , who has made it and who is losing ground .

People are always eager to give you that one chance , so maybe some singers do not know how to maintain the benefits they get from these opportunities despite having talent . <p> As for the music directors , I see potential in every new music director , especially when they give me good songs , like my song in Murder 2 that also won me nominations . <p> Last year you recorded a song for Enrique Iglesias . In our first meeting at the time of Mast , you had expressed some international ambitions . What is you stand now ? My version of ' Heartbeat ' from Euphoria had a bit of Hindi too as the desi tadka .

If Indian culture today is so looked up that Bryan Adams and Akon come here , why would we not want to go global ? I would certainly like to expand my fan base , learn more about music from outside , grow in the process , and also make Indian music reach a wider audience . Having said that , my growth here is also important - as a film singer , and in newer Indian zones , like Rabindra Sangeet that I found very fulfilling last year .

So sure was he , he said , that the Congress-led UPA government would implode , with difficult allies pulling it down , that he wanted the BJP to even start thinking of finalising its candidates for the Lok Sabha elections .

But now , some of the allies are feeling that sooner the government falls it 's better . Today , it seems almost certain .. , it may happen that the government will fall in a year 's time , " he said . <p> Mr Advani has drawn that conclusion from events of the last two weeks .

All of this week , an NCP crisis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at a meeting of its coordination committee of allies on Thursday , the DMK , now the Congress ' largest ally in government , was openly critical of the recent reform measures .

Even Mulayam Singh Yadav , who rescued the UPA government by reaffirming his party 's external support to the government last week - he said it was to keep out the BJP - has made it clear that he can not support the decision on FDI in retail . <p> Mr Advani 's influence is also apparent in the party now deciding to go all guns blazing on the issue of FDI in retail . It had so far gone slow on the senior leader 's suggestion that the government be attacked on the issue and a special session of Parliament be demanded to discuss it .

Is the 85 year-old slipping into a mentor 's role or is he still a contender to be the face of the party in the next general elections ? <p> The BJP 's parent body , the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh , is improving its grip on the BJP . On Thursday the party cleared a change in its rules to ensure that Nitin Gadkari will be party president for a second term and so in 2014 when elections are held . Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi is clearly the RSS ' pick as the face of tomorrow . But Mr Advani continues to have a hold on the BJP . How the Sangh Parivar deals with the relevance of Mr Advani could well decide the BJP 's fate .

For this is the Mumbai , on which the Mumbai you will live in , in a couple of years shall be based . <p> Here 's the rub : there is a substantial mismatch between the two . Actually , 1200 mismatches and counting . This paper Mumbai ( the soon to be real Mumbai ) is the updated Existing Land Use ( ELU ) Plan of Greater Mumbai . <p> This stark division between the two Mumbais was presented with great clarity by Pankaj Joshi , Director of the Urban Design Research Institute ( UDRI ) , who on 26th September convened a meeting of urban experts , stakeholders , interested laypersons , and the press to discuss the Existing Land Use Plan . <p> Image courtesy Mustansir Dalvi . <p> This new mapping of the city , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ base for the revision of the Development Plan for Greater Mumbai , to be implemented from 2014 . The new DP , as it is called , shall govern , administer and transform the city over the next two decades , until 2034 . It seems to rest on a cornucopia of chimeras . <p> According to his reading of the ELU , more than 1200 plots of open land in Mumbai now have different land uses that no longer adhere to their al-fresco precedents . In the ' R ' ward alone almost 200 open plots have been indicated as residential or commercial . By the simple expedient of comparing the new plan with current images of parts of the city on Google Earth ( apart from using other , previous studies ) , the UDRI was able to spot several discrepancies between what currently exists ( on the ground ) and what has been re-imagined by the ELU plan . <p> Here are some of the UDRI 's findings : <p> 1 . The city of Mumbai has increased by 2000 hectares . <p> 2 . Areas in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Backbay , Gorai find no place on the ELU as they are governed by other independent authorities . Imagine your city being remade without considering localities , inherent to the image of changing Mumbai . <p> 3 . Several Ward boundaries have shifted , and along with them , presumably , their administrative jurisdictions . <p> 4 . The transportation systems that are mushrooming all around the city , that affect your daily commutes today and will transform your movements tomorrow- the Metro systems and the elevated rail lines are not indicated on the Existing Land Use Plans at all . <p> 5 . Once open plots are marked as being ' under construction ' . <p> 6 . Some No Development Zones ( NDZ ) are now marked as being residential or commercial in nature , opening the doors for developing such places that may be naturally sensitive or form the runoffs for rainwater . It is not difficult to imagine the consequences of building on them . <p> 8 . In spite of counting the beaches , gymkhana plots and forested lands , the open spaces in Mumbai @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when an ideal for open spaces in the city should be around 11sq m . <p> 9 . While some Heritage Buildings are marked , they are not Graded . This could affect precinct edges , buffers and skylines . Already we have seen several of Mumbai 's historic skylines that defined our image of the city for a century or so wantonly defaced by spiralling new erections . Interestingly , a heritage property like the Sir JJ School of Art is now indicated as a commercial plot , as is St Xavier 's College . A cemetery in Colaba is now a ' water body ' . <p> 10 . The Worli Fort , a site of archaeological importance and one of the oldest buildings in Mumbai , has gone missing from the ELU entirely . You may see it as you traverse the Sealink . You may even walk on it , but do n't you believe your eyes . No . <p> Here then , is an incomplete and flawed view of the Mumbai of the present . In the future , this ELU is what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will base their decisions and permissions on . If transformations are to be effected using readings that do not square up with ground realities , urban planning , however well intentioned will not amount to much . <p> Pankaj Joshi told his audience of how difficult it was to get hold of the ELU . Not in the public domain , he had to extricate the documents from the authorities by invoking the Right to Information ( RTI ) Act . <p> This is symptomatic of the ways of the state these days . Either by their own resources or by outsourcing these studies to various consultants and planners , the information gathered and the documents generated from them are increasingly held back . The citizens at large shall only experience the consequences slowly , over time , as the new Development Plan gets implemented . Consider this : the previous Development Plan was published in 1981 , but sanctioned for implementation only in 1993 , twelve years after . <p> The need for transparency is even more acute , considering the numbers of discrepancies noticed on the ELU . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as soon as they were generated and opinions should have been called for . This adversarial stance between the authorities and those genuinely interested citizen groups and urban experts outside of the government is completely uncalled for . It is anybody 's guess whether corrective action will be taken before the new Development Control Rules become fait accompli.

@@1169233 <h> Will the quota system for LPG cylinders work ? <h> Will the quota system for LPG cylinders work ? <p> When household bills for Liquefied Petroleum Gas ( LPG ) jump over 60 per cent for those using 12 refills a year , the increase in the price of cooking fuel will beat that of petrol . <p> Since its decontrol in June 2010 , the petrol price has seen a much smaller increase of 20 per cent , a small but interesting fact that a purportedly common man-oriented government appears to have overlooked . <p> Part of the reason for this massive jump in LPG expense is that the current differential between the subsidised retail and market price is around Rs 484 , more than double what consumers were charged . <p> For petrol , the differential has never been so stark . So , a full decontrol of petrol price in June 2010 became a reality easily with a Rs 3.50 a litre increase in price but bridging the subsidy gap for domestic LPG required a gradual approach . <h> Will the quota system for LPG cylinders work ? <p> Stealthy gradualism , in fact , has marked the United Progressive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in sharp contrast to the National Democratic Alliance 's ( NDA 's ) shift to market-linked prices for diesel and kerosene and a roadmap for phasing out market-linked pricing for LPG and kerosene . <p> Given that fuel pricing is a contentious political issue , it was no surprise that the fortnightly market-linked price revisions for petrol and diesel under the NDA regime did not last long . <p> But gradualism also creates potential problems , as is evident in the quota on cooking gas cylinders - though the move has been considered radical and coalition partner Trinamool Congress quit in protest . <h> Will the quota system for LPG cylinders work ? <p> The result is a complicated structure that allows a consumer to get six subsidised cylinders at the subsidised price of Rs 399 ( New Delhi price ) . For subsequent refills , consumers will have to pay around the current market price of Rs 883 . <p> Since the domestic price has an 80 per cent linkage with imported LPG , the market price of Rs 883 will change every month . <p> An added @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Haryana have attempted to alleviate the impact of the Union government 's decision by announcing a three-cylinder top-up ( taking the annual quota of subsidised cylinders to nine for households in these states ) . Delhi , though , will limit it to families that are below the poverty line . <p> The proposal for a cap has been doing the rounds of government for some years . Initially , the plan was to put the cap at 10 . The idea was based on the fact that these cylinders often find their way into commercial use . <h> Will the quota system for LPG cylinders work ? <p> Besides , unlike kerosene , which is distributed through the public distribution system and is , therefore , not universally available , subsidised cooking gas benefits the rich as well . <p> So , a two-pronged approach was adopted involving a crackdown on multiple connections and setting up a transparency portal that showed that 44 per cent of customers use six cylinders in a year . <p> Capping the number of subsidised cylinders only pares the under-recovery or revenue loss that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last month , the estimate of losses from LPG sales would come down by only Rs 5,300 crore to about Rs 32,000 crore for the full year . <p> And that is if the quota system works - its success depends on how OMCs are able to combat the well-established misuse in their dealer networks . <h> Will the quota system for LPG cylinders work ? <p> The companies are banking on a software application that will be added to the transparency portal , but that is unlikely to prevent a dealer from booking subsidised cylinders in the name of consumers who use less than the quota of six . <p> Since the government has stuck to its position despite the political turmoil , the next stage could be cash credit of subsidy through an Aadhar-based smartcard . Eventually , the subsidy , too , would be limited to a certain category of people but for now the UPA government appears to be testing the waters for phasing out the LPG subsidy . <p> In motors fuels , too , the approach has been to tinker with the duty structure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Rs 5 a litre announced last month , excise accounts for Rs 1.50 . <h> Will the quota system for LPG cylinders work ? <p> Though the exercise has been revenue neutral , it has ended up giving OMCs relief of only Rs 3.50 a litre on diesel sales against the required Rs 17 . In the case of petrol where excise was reduced by Rs 5.30 a litre , the government prevented the retail price from rising by passing on the benefit to OMCs . <p> In its first tenure ( 2004-2009 ) , the UPA had moved towards a specific excise duty structure for petrol and diesel ( instead of ad valorem ) to prevent the price rise from cascading , but the excise on kerosene and LPG continues to be nil . <p> The central exchequer has , in fact , seen a decline in revenues on this head from Rs 23,627 crore in the first quarter of 2012-13 to Rs 17,595 crore in the same period this year . But with state taxes continuing to be on ad-valorem basis , their collection has increased 18 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> Will the quota system for LPG cylinders work ? <p> If the policy signals from the September 14 decisions are to be analysed , it is clear the approach in petroleum pricing is now product-wise . <p> In June 2010 , a more confident government decontrolled petrol , and took an in-principle decision to decontrol diesel price . More than two years after that , all the government has done in diesel is to announce a higher administered price that falls way short of a market linkage . <p> Thus , petroleum pricing policy as it stands is a series of unrelated government decisions . Petrol is decontrolled in theory but each time a price rise is needed , the proposal oscillates between the government and its OMCs . <h> Will the quota system for LPG cylinders work ? <p> Domestic LPG now has a cap , but that still entails 70 per cent of some 1 billion cylinders to be partly funded by government dole . In diesel , price revision has become an annual political decision ; decontrol is not in sight . <p> And in kerosene @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some places even as the quota for states have been cut in line with rising use of LPG . <p> The government 's approach appears to be based on ad-hocism rather than calibrated thinking on fuel pricing . The brighter side is that the sheer magnitude of the fiscal deficit is forcing it to sharpen the subsidy delivery mechanism and reduce malpractice . <p> But that can only be a small part of an effort to control petroleum subsidy that constitutes around 30 per cent of Rs 216,297-crore subsidy given out of taxpayer 's money last year .

" <p> Counting the advantages , Punj says , " These offices are a best option for entrepreneurs and executives who travel a lot . It also benefits project-based clients or companies who want to start a venture in a new location . Moreover , virtual offices are ' pay per use ' and hence there is no standing cost .

@@1170230 <h> Student Of The Year is a film about friendship and male bonding and those are some of the most precious relationships -- Karan Johar <p> Karan Johar is back with yet again a very different film . Having done romance , family drama and serious cinema , his next film is Student of the Year , a youthful joyride through college years . His first film without close friend Shahrukh , this time Karan is working with and launching three newcomers , for the first time in his career . BollySpice caught up with Karan , or KJo as he is popularly referred to , in London where he brought his cast down to introduce them to our great city and to the Brit-Asian media . <p> Can you tell us about Student of the Year ( SOTY ) in your own words ? SOTY is a quintessential high school film and has a strong layer of relationships and friendships . It will remind you of the days that went by and those of you who have passed their prime like I have ! It is a film about friendship and male bonding and those are some of the most precious relationships . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out smiling , rather than crying ! I felt young making it , so I hope everyone that is not young , will feel young watching it and those that are young will feel in the zone ! <p> The CEO of my company is my childhood friend who I have know since the 5th standard , which is like thirty years now and more than friendship he is like family to me . So that is what I wanted to show on celluloid -- a friendship that no matter what it went through , it lasted . When you watch this film I know you will think about , Facebook , text , or want to Tweet a friend . <p> How was the experience of working with newcomers ? This is a really special film for us at Dharma Productions . It is the only film with which we have launched completely new talent . We have introduced seven new actors , three of whom are our main leads . Each one of them is different from the other . Of the leads two of them have film @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ background . This film was more impulse than calculation . It was a spur of the moment decision . This was actually a film I wanted to produce and not direct . I wanted one of the guys in my company to make it . At one point I just thought why am I giving this to someone else ? Yes the film is very simple narrative , it is not path breaking , in terms of soul -- yes it has it . In terms of presentation -- yes it has that . I have made a serious film ( My Name Is Khan ) , but for me cinema is escapism and this ( SOTY ) is fun and fabulous . <p> Is it a risk casting and directing a film with three rank newcomers ? Nothing ventured , nothing gained ! Taking risks is imperative when you are in certain positions . Playing safe is the easy way out , but taking a different route altogether is definitely more challenging and therefore satisfying . Launching new talent is something all people in the industry in certain positions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We have eight to ten movie stars that are in every big feature film . I needed to challenge myself and take one step ahead as a filmmaker . This time not in terms of content , but in taking on newcomers . <p> What were the qualities which made you cast your actors ? Varun and Sidharth I sussed out on MNIK , as they used to stand in for Shahrukh and Kajol . Both these boys had what I felt was the x-factor , as not all good looking people look good on camera and have screen presence . After a series of readings , I realised that these boys were right . They bring a certain kind of vulnerability mixed with talent and that combination never fails in the movies . Alia was made for films ! She is a full Hindi film actress . She has Kareena Kapoor 's sole somewhere in her . She suddenly becomes like her sister Pooja at times , but also has this impish Preity ZInta quality . <p> Are you nervous about the success of the film ? I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this one there is no ballpark comparison . There is no estimate anyone can make . We have made it in a scale that would warrant the presence of movie stars but with new talent . We have pulled out all the stops and have done everything so it is positioned as a large movie experience . So yes , the nerves are high , but the excitement is even higher ! When you work with first time actors you feed off their energy and excitement . It is like graduation day for them . <p> What are your expectations from the box office ? Well look at a film like Barfi , it is going to touch 100 crores . No one ever anticipated that , no one ever believed it would happen , but it is not about that . I believe a film has to last .. What is 100 crores if its not going to last forever ? Today I think a film like Kahaani or Vicky Donor will live longer than a lot of 100 or 200 crore films . Taking nothing away from those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which I am very proud of , but there are still some gems , like Udaan , which did only 3 crores at the box office . I feel it one of the most genius films I 've ever seen and it was made in a miniscule budget . It has such a tiny budget but has such an immensely huge heart ! So as film makers you know when a film is loved and that is what is important . Box office is just a number and cinema lives beyond numbers . <p> You previously represented college years in Kuch Kuch Hota Hai ( KKHH ) , so how has college life changed in 15 years with SOTY ? College life has completely changed . This generation is so clued in . I can not even pretend to know , so it is very challenging for me . It is a completely different world to KKHH , I did glam up the college institution ( Saint Theresa ) , as of course nothing in real life looks like that . What was imperative though , was that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ While they are all glossed up , because that is the way I like it unapologetically , but we will try to do that aesthetically to keep the characters and their situations very rooted , things that you will identify with . <p> Sport has always been a feature of all your films , how important is sport to you ? Sport is something I know nothing about , but somehow I end up putting sport into all of my films and I am the most unsporty person you will meet ! Cricket in K3G , American Football in Kabhi Alvida Na Kehna , Basketball in KKHH and now a triathlon in SOTY . To me ESPN does n't exist as a channel , so I do not know why I keep integrating sport into my films . I think it is something subliminal . I remember in KKHH I kept saying " And then score the goal " , but Shah Rukh took me aside and said " It 's not called a goal , that is football and this is basketball ! ' In the end he actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> K3G opened with a cricket scene and Nikhil Advani , my assistant said " It 's the last ball and the last over , so the ball ca n't be shiny and Hrithik Roshan 's kit ca n't be so white , it 's not real ! " I responded " Are you mad ? It 's the first shot of the film and Hrithik is the hero of the film and I never said I was making a real film ! " But this time round for the triathlon we got a professional from America to come and shoot that part , as honestly I did not know what I was doing.The triathlon has been extensively shot over a period of 12 days . As a filmmaker you do not have to know everything , you just have to be honest about your limitations . <p> Your last film was a strong issue based film ( MNIK ) and this is a more typical Bollywood film . How does your mindset change given the extremes of the opposing genres ? Every film one directs is a result @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ college : heartbreak , first love , puppy love -- all defined my debut endeavour ( KKHH ) and I met with success , thankfully . I felt very reverent towards my parents for making me the man I am and providing me with that emotional confidence , so I made a film next ( K3G ) which was an ode to families and my parents , to show my gratitude . Following that there was a cool revolution in Indian cinema -- Dil Chahta Hai had made a big mark with the urban youth and I felt that I should also attempt to , as demographically I was also from that zone , so I felt that I should write a film that was also high on it 's ' cool ' factor . So I wrote and produced Kal Ho Na Ho . After that I lost my father and went into reflective mode and in that reflective mode I met lots of people and heard about their failed relationships and how marriage was taking a beating and that divorce was the new marriage and I decided to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So I wrote and directed Kabhi Alvida Na Kehna . <p> After that I felt as a filmmaker I had provided entertainment for both the national and diaspora audience , but I never felt I had tackled a global issue , I had never dealt with a social situation and felt very strongly about the misrepresentation of religion and how it can be misconstrued and held against humanity and there was born the idea of MNIK because being a filmmaker I felt accountable to society and to human beings by and large . That took a heavy toll on my emotionally because it was a heavy experience for me as a person . <p> So I felt I needed to make my ' holiday film ' go back to song and dance and glamour , glitz and glory . To go back to school and college where we build some of our most special relationships and that is how SOTY was born . I felt that if I did not take new talent then I was not leveraging the position that I had built over the last fifteen to sixteen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happy holiday film , but even on holiday you have your quiet and reflective moments , which will also happen with SOTY . You will go through the energy of an entertainer but somewhere at the end of the film you will go back into reflective mode and it will make you believe that there is nothing more important than the relationships we build in our lifetimes .

Abhishek Mukherjee looks back at the career of Tony Greig , one of the most talented and colourful cricketers in the history of the game and the cricketer behind the shape professional cricket has taken today . <p> Tony Greig , born October 6 , 1946 , was one of the most talented and colourful cricketers in the history of the game . Abhishek Mukherjee looks back at the career of the cricketer who helped shape professional cricket the way it is today . <p> He is truly a global citizen . A South African by birth , Scottish by paternal descent , Tony Greig captained England and later settled down in Australia . <p> A career aggregate of 3,599 runs at 40.43 and 141 wickets at 32.20 in a career spanning only five years indicates Greig 's stature as one of the finest all-rounders of the game , Greig is only one of few to score 3,000 runs and taken 100 wickets in Tests . <p> Yet , it is often not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for . <p> Early days <p> When Greig was in college , a group of Sussex cricketers -- including Test players like Alan Oakman and Ian Thomson -- visited his native Queenstown . Greig , making his debut for Border at the age of 19 , impressed the visiting Sussex members enough and was offered by them a place in the county side . After much deliberation and encouragement from his father , Greig gave up his University pursuits and left country for England . <p> After a string of matches for Sussex Second XI with mixed results , Greig got picked for Arthur Gilligan 's XI against the touring West Indians in 1966 . Playing against some of the biggest names in international cricket , Greig dismissed Seymour Nurse and Rohan Kanhai to return figures of 3 for 51 . <p> Early in the following year he got picked to play Lancashire at Hove . Coming in at 34 for three , Greig counterattacked from the very beginning . No one else went past 32 as Greig scored 156 in 230 minutes on debut to lift Sussex to 324 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ken Higgs and Peter Lever . <p> He never looked back from there . His medium-paced bowling complimented his batting well , and Greig soon became one of the backbones of the Sussex side . He also turned up on a regular basis for Border in the English off-season , thereby keeping both options open . <p> Picked to play for England against the touring Rest of the World XI in 1970 Greig shone at the first opportunity : he took 4 for 59 and 3 for 71 ( including Barry Richards , Eddie Barlow and Sobers in both innings ) . He played two more matches in the series , and it was inevitable that he would make his Test debut very soon . <p> A world champion <p> Before playing a single Test , though , Greig was picked for the World XI to play in Australia and played in all five matches . <p> After a quiet game at Brisbane , he came to his own at Perth : before Dennis Lillee decimated the tourists with some really hostile fast bowling , Greig picked up 4 for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before Sobers snatched victory after a 101-run deficit ; up against 321 at Sydney he scored 70 coming in at 61 for 5 to save the game . And opening bowling in the first innings at Adelaide , Greig routed the Australians with 6 for 30 , paving the way for Graeme Pollock , Bishan Bedi and Intikhab Alam in the second innings to win them the match . In the 10 First-class matches he played on that tour , Greig ended up with 525 runs at 37.50 and 26 wickets at 25.53 . <p> He went to South Africa to resume domestic cricket later that year . He had switched to Eastern Provinces by now . He began the first match with his World XI bowling partner from Adelaide -- Peter Pollock -- and picked up 5 for 39 . Everything was going fine before he had an epileptic seizure during the match , and six players were required to restrain his 6 ' 6 ? frame . It was something he was suffering since his teenage days . However , the incident did not gain much publicity , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he would make his Test debut at Old Trafford later that year . <p> It was a dream debut . Like always , Greig had reserved his best for the biggest of occasions ( his Test average of 40.43 was significantly better than his overall First-class average of 32.20 ) . With Boycott injured , Greig came in at 99 for 3 ( virtually 99 for 4 ) , and soon found his side struggling at 127 for 5 . Once again the pressure brought out the best in him : he top-scored with 57 and added 63 with Allan Knott to lift England to 249 . He played his hand , dismissing Ian Chappell first ball , as John Snow and Geoff Arnold routed Australia for 142 . He top-scored yet again with 62 against a rampant Lillee . And when Australia chased 342 , Greig took 4 for 53 , assisting Snow to bowl them out for 252 . <p> The Test made Greig an instant celebrity in the world of cricket . This was the first time England had won the first Test of a home Ashes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quiet series after Old Trafford he ended up second ( after Barry Wood ) on the batting chart with 288 at 36.00 , and also played his part with the ball . <p> Indian tricks <p> England toured India next , and Greig had a long spell of 23-8-32-2 ( wickets of Gundappa Viswanath and Eknath Solkar ) to assist Arnold to bowl out India for 173 in the first Test at Delhi . Coming in at 71 for 4 , Greig top-scored with an unbeaten 68 shepherding the tail to take England to 200 as Bhagwat Chandrasekhar took 8 for 79 in a marathon spell . This included a spectacular six off Chandra over extra-cover . Chasing 207 , England were struggling at 107 for 4 against Bedi and Chandra when Greig joined captain Tony Lewis . Lewis remained unbeaten on 70 and Greig on 40 as England reached home . <p> In the next Test at Calcutta , Greig once again stood high amidst ruins . He started off the Test rather innocuously with 1 for 13 and 29 as India took a lead of 36 . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chris Old ( 4 for 43 ) and Greig ( 5 for 24 ) made inroads as India were bowled out for 155 . The Indian spinners got England into trouble almost immediately , and Greig found himself coming out at 17 for 4 . Once again , Greig played a supreme counterattacking innings , and England reached stumps on Day Four at 106 for 4 . However , Chandra dismissed Greig for 67 with a top-spinner early on the final day . Chandra and Bedi went on to plot England 's defeat by 28 runs . <p> It was roughly at this time that Greig had started his experiments with off-breaks . He scored his first Test hundred ( 148 ) at Bombay later that series , coming in at 79 for 4 after India had scored 448 . He added 254 with Keith Fletcher , and though England lost the series 1-2 , Greig shone by topping the batting charts with 382 at 63.66 and coming second in the bowling list with 11 wickets at 22.45 , next to only Arnold . <p> The Calypso saga <p> Greig @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at 52.20 ; six wickets at 42.50 ) and a very good home series against New Zealand ( 216 runs at 43.20 ; eight wickets at 23.12 ) . He left for an away tour of the West Indies . He did not do well in the home series against West Indies that followed . West Indies gave England a 2-0 drubbing in three tests ( both victories were comprehensive ones ) , and Greig had a very ordinary series with both the bat and the ball . <p> However , it was in the next series that Greig made headlines for all the wrong reasons . not for the first time in his illustrious career . After Keith Boyce had routed England for 131 in the first Test at Queen 's Park Oval , the tourists fought back with bravado . However , Alvin Kallicharran defied them with a brilliant innings , well-supported by Bernard Julien . As Julien had played out the last ball of the second day , both batsmen left for the pavilion before umpire Douglas Sang Hue actually called " stumps " . Greig swooped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kallicharran 's end , and Sang Hue had no option but to rule him out . <p> The crowd laid siege on the ground in a vehement protest , creating a blockage on the players ' route back to the pavilion . Whatever Greig had done was perfectly within the rules , but he was called " unsportsmanlike " by all and sundry . Mike Denness , the England captain , had no option but to recall Kallicharran the next morning . <p> The incident marred Greig 's image to some extent , but this was probably the series that firmly established him as the world 's leading all-rounder with Sobers 's career coming to an end . After two quiet Tests at Port-of-Spain and Kingston , Greig came to his own at Bridgetown . Coming to bat at 68 for 4 , Greig scored 148 against Bernard Julien and mates , adding 163 for the sixth wicket with Knott . West Indies hit back strongly , with Lawrence Rowe scoring 302 , but Greig bowled on relentlessly -- he was a full-time off-spinner by then -- taking the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ total of six wickets . He followed this with 121 and 2 for 57 ( Roy Fredericks and Rowe ) at Georgetown , but after four Tests West Indies still led the series 1-0 . <p> Geoff Boycott scored a dour 99 to raise the tourists to 267 in the fifth Test at Port of Spain . Pat Pocock , in an inspired spell on the second afternoon , removed both Fredericks and Kallicharran . Greig , after opening bowling , had switched to off-breaks , but could not extract a lot of help from the track , finishing with none for 53 from 17 overs . Rowe , with the help of Clive Lloyd , had helped West Indies read 224 for 2 . In a burst of twenty balls , Greig removed Lloyd , Sobers , Kanhai and Deryck Murray in the space of just 5 runs . He took the last 4 wickets as well , and returned a haul of 8 for 33 from 19.1 overs on the third day . His 8 for 86 was the best innings figures against West Indies by an England @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Kingston in 1954 . <p> Boycott scored 112 this time , leaving the hosts 226 for a victory . Despite the presence of Derek Underwood and Pocock , it was left to Greig to take charge . Greig toiled on , opening the bowling and then reverting to off-breaks , removing Kallicharran , Lloyd , Kanhai and Murray to leave West Indies reeling at 161 for 8 . Boyce then added 36 with Inshan Ali before Denness had to take the second new ball . Switching to medium-paced bowling , Greig removed Inshan Ali immediately , and England ended up winning the Test by 26 runs and squaring the series . Greig finished with 33-7-70-5 , and finished with 13 for 56 from the Test . This was the best match statistics for any England bowler since Jim Laker 's historic performance against the Australians . With 430 runs and 24 wickets from the series , Greig came second on both charts for England . <p> In the next season , Greig had decent outings against both India and Pakistan at home before flying to Australia for the Ashes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bowling very much , and he remained generally unsuccessful . However , he did well with the bat . Australia went up 4-0 in the first five Tests , and 42-year old Colin Cowdrey had to be flown out to support an England side that had been hit hard by the pace of Lillee and Thomson . He batted well in bursts , scoring 110 ( coming out at 57 for 4 ) in the first Test at Brisbane . However , in the sixth Test at Melbourne , Greig took 5 for 123 and scored 89 to lead England to an innings victory to salvage some pride . <p> En route home , England visited New Zealand , and after Greig scored 51 in a mammoth 593 for 6 , he took 5 for 98 and 5 for 51 to rout the Kiwis by an innings . On his return , Greig had another epileptic fit at Heathrow Airport . This made the ailment public . However , there was no stopping Greig , who defied his country of birth to make it as the Test captain for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one after England 's rather ordinary show at the 1975 World Cup under Mike Denness . <p> This was another average Ashes series by Greig -- 284 runs and eight wickets in the series seemed almost a letdown for the great man , More so since England went on to lose the series 0-1 . In the second Test at Lord 's , though , he shone with 96 and 41 , and three wickets , and then scored 51 and 49 at Headingley . With Australia 1-0 up in the series and 220 for three at stumps on Day Four , having lost both Chappell brothers , England looked all set to go for the kill on day five . <p> However , a man George Davis was arrested earlier that year for an armed payroll robbery of the London Electricity Board on April 4 , 1974 . When he was serving a 20-year notice , his supporters dug up the Headingley pitch on the fourth night using knives and poured oil in the resulting cracks , thereby ensuring that no play was possible on day five . Greig @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The last Test was a draw , and Australia retained the rubber . <p> Grovel ! <p> The Australians seemed unstoppable : they went on to thrash West Indies by a whopping 5-1 margin , and just before West Indies toured England in 1976 , Greig uttered the following words during a televison interview : <p> " You must remember that the West Indians , these guys , if they get on top are magnificent cricketers . But if they 're down , they grovel , and I intend , with the help of Closey and a few others , to make them grovel . " <p> Had this been a remark by someone else by some other side this might not have had the serious impact it had . However , given the fact that a significant part of the West Indian population had slave ancestry and the fact that Greig actually came from South Africa -- a place where apartheid still reigned supreme -- Lloyd and Co. took the word grovel rather seriously , though probably none more than Viv Richards . <p> The impact was stunning . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strike rate of 70 , and both Fredericks and Gordon Greenidge also amassed more than 500 runs in the series . All four fast bowlers -- Michael Holding ( 28 wickets at 12.71 ) , Andy Roberts ( 28 wickets at 19.17 ) , Wayne Daniel and Vanburn Holder -- had sub-25 bowling averages . West Indies won the series 3-0 , and eventually , when the English side was battered both physically and psychologically , took stage at The Oval , the Test turned out to be a mini-summary of the series : Richards scored 291 as West Indies scored 687 for 8 ; Holding took 8 for 92 ( 6 bowled ; 2 LBW ) to bowl out England for 435 ; West Indies declared at 182 without loss in 32 overs . And then , Holding ran amok again , taking 6 for 57 to bowl out England for 203 . It was a fitting ending to a perfect annihilation . <p> India , again <p> It seemed that Greig 's career as a captain was over after the complete rout in the hands of the Caribbeans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chance in the tour to India later that year . John Lever , on his debut , began the rampage : he took 10 for 70 to win the Delhi Test by an innings . Greig had a quiet Test . <p> At Calcutta , however , Greig came in his elements . After Greig lost what looked like a must-win toss , Bob Willis bowled out the Indians for 155 on a pitch full of cracks before Bedi and EAS Prasanna had India reeling at 90 for 4 . There was some doubt regarding Greig 's availability , since he was down with a severe stomach bug . But Greig emerged from the pavilion to join Roger Tolchard with a weak physique and running a high fever . <p> The seven-hour stay at the wicket that followed in extremely demanding physical conditions is regarded by many as Greig 's career-best batting performance . Visiting batsmen have always considered batting in the cauldron-shaped Eden Gardens in front of a 100,000-strong crowd a challenge : with the host spinners on a roll , it was even tougher . <p> But Greig @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Old to bat India out of the match . It was an uncharacteristically dour innings , but according to Greig , given his physical conditions , he could merely hold on for survival -- especially on an almost unplayable pitch that was turning square . Not content , he bowled 10 overs , removing Viswanath and Anshuman Gaekwad to make early inroads into the strong Indian batting line-up . India managed to avoid an innings defeat , but still went on to lose by 10 wickets . <p> Greig could bowl only four overs in the next Test at Madras : however , he still scored 54 and 41 in a low-scoring affair where Lever , Underwood and Willis led England to a 200-run victory to seal the series for England . India fought back to win the fourth Test at Bangalore , and England had managed to hold on to a close draw in the final Test at Bombay to end up in a 3-1 series win . Greig had redeemed himself . <p> Greig led England for one final time in the Centenary Test at Melbourne in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cricket : after being bowled out for 138 , Australia bowled England out for 95 , Lillee taking 6 for 26 . Rodney Marsh then flailed his bat to score an unbeaten 110 , and Rick McCosker braved a broken jaw to bat at 10 , hanging around for over an hour to score 25 . Chasing 463 , Derek Randall led a furious onslaught , scoring 174 , with four other batsmen including Greig ( who had a nice all-round display , scoring 18 and 41 , taking two wickets and four catches ) crossing 40 , but England lost the Test by 45 runs -- the same margin as they had lost the first ever Test exactly a hundred years back ! <p> Packer , and more ... <p> On this trip , however , Greig had built up his contacts with Kerry Packer , and was instrumental in signing both English and others ( mainly South African ) cricketers for World Series Cricket . He had tried to keep the entire thing a secret , but the news became public . Greig tried to defend World Series @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on with the signings : as a result he was sacked as a captain but was surprisingly retained in the side . <p> In his last series , playing under Mike Brearley , Greig helped England to their first Ashes victory during his time .

He also took seven crucial wickets from five Tests at 28.00 , and England romped to a 3-0 series win . This turned out to be Greig 's last series . <p> He continued to play World Series Cricket for some time without much success ; however , he was instrumental in assisting Packer in setting up World Series -- getting the players to sign up the contracts and setting up the entire tournament .

In a state of shock , the girl went to her house and set herself on fire in an attempt to commit suicide . She suffered 90 per cent burn injuries . <p> She died while being treated at a government hospital in Rohtak .

@@1170234 <p> Craft traditions are usually hereditary , passed down from one generation to the next . It is also usual for successive generations , on becoming affluent , to move away from the craft into more educated and lucrative professions . But Subhash Arora has gone against the grain . <p> A non-tribal , actually a Punjabi Arora from Delhi and from a family involved in educational pursuits , Subhash was so fascinated with dhokra that he has made it his mission , his love and his career . This love for dhokra , which began in the late 1970s , continues with the same passion , nearly 35 years later . With a dreamy look in his eyes , Arora adds , " I want to do it all my life . " <p> So you wonder how it all started . With a smile he says , " I was not good at studies , so I did n't have much choice except to take up graduation by correspondence . I was studying clay modelling at Bal Bhawan , Delhi , during the holidays . I knew I wanted to do something creative . There were many options -- drama , writing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ During the training he happened to visit the Crafts Museum , Delhi . Here , the proverbial inspiration struck ; there were tribal craftsman from Chattisgarh -- Bastar to be precise -- who had come to demonstrate dhokra craft . Subhash Arora was hooked for life . Even as he describes it , the passion , the madness for the craft shines in his eyes . He says , " I worked with them during the casting , modelling the wax . It was the craft and me . " When the workshop ended after a month , he was at a loss . In a fit of youthful madness he decided to pack his bags and head to Bastar . He says , " I was not interested in studies . " His parents dissuaded him saying he was mad to go to a village in the jungles far away from civilisation with no access to phones . <p> Subhash vividly recalls reaching the village Konda in Bastar in the evening by bus and being welcomed by fireflies . He adds , " I had never seen fireflies or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look at the craft and he forgot the heat , absence of electricity , the bad civic conditions and the huts . As he says , " Kaam karte hue mazaa aata tha ( I used to enjoy doing the work ) . " Soon he persuaded his parents to buy him a small place in the village where he could stay and learn the craft . He learnt the craft and , along with it , the local language -- Halbi . <p> He says matter-of-factly , " If you live in Spain for 10 years , wo n't you learn to speak Spanish ? The whole of Bastar knows me because I am the only non-tribal who learnt the craft living with them , speaking their language and understanding their culture . " He stayed with them for four years , understanding every aspect of their life and , of course , the craft . It was not easy and it took much persuasion to be taught their skills . <p> Dhokra craft uses the traditional lost wax method to fashion objects from brass . The casting is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One distinguishing feature is that when casting bigger objects or three-dimensional ones , the craftsmen wind thin strips of wax around the clay model . They further adorn it with little drops and small motifs . The object , when finished in metal , gives a ribbed appearance ; the hallmark of dhokra . Describing the making of a small bull , he plucks out a small bit of wax and moulds it in front of me . He then demonstrates the making of a tile made of dhokra , he starts fashioning the leaves and becomes so lost in it that , for a moment , he forgets I am watching and listening to him . <p> His own designs <p> I prod Subhash to go back to his days of learning the craft . He recalls , " I came back satisfied with some objects that had been made . Then I reached a dead end . No one wanted to buy the pieces . I had made what the tribals made . " After much running around he gave up . He then absorbed what was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , made a second trip to Bastar after a few years . This time he stayed and made designs of his own . When he showed them to exporters and to owners of shops in Sundar Nagar , Delhi , they went crazy . Looking back he says , " I was neither a designer nor an art student . So designing was alien to me . I could not extend the use of this technique to a more saleable form then . " <p> Further understanding of design occurred when Rajeev Sethi , the well-known craft proponent and revivalist , called Subhash was called to repair some antique figurines . He was shown a box full of old pieces of dhokra art from Kond village in Odisha . Subhash says , " It was something I had never seen . The work was far more beautiful than that of Bastar . But seeing it I knew how to create modern , more acceptable , forms for the market . " <p> So out came a trail of horses , classic bulls , human figures , gods and goddesses , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went back , lived with the tribals training them to make products that would work in the market . He adds ruefully , " I was young and could withstand the harsh conditions . I used to live with them for four or five months in a year . Now I ca n't . So I have brought a few villagers and settled them in a village near my home in Faridabad . " <p> His work was recognised and he was awarded the Master Craftsman Award in 1993 for a beautiful piece depicting a tribal rider on a bull . Another stunning work has been for the INA Metro Gallery , where a wooden frame adorned with metal dhokra pieces was made for the CWG 2010 . Another fabulous piece is a part of the Akshara Exhibition put together by Dastkari Haat Samiti . It shows a lady working on a computer , saluting learning . Every detail from the key board to the expression on the face is captured to perfection . <p> Given the high cost of metal , huge pieces or one-of-a-kinds are made to order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wall hangings , key-hanging boxes , trays that contrast fallen leaves with dhokra panels . He adds , " Dhokra is an eco-friendly craft since it reuses scrap metal pieces . I teamed it with leaves that have fallen on the ground , then with leftover leather and grass bits . " Looking at the piece , again , the dreamy look overcomes him . Is he thinking of other ways to extend his craft to more utility driven products ? I leave him at that .

The rally sent a clear message to the Indian and Israeli governments that Muslims of this country will in no case tolerate the mischievous and barbarous acts of Israel against the people of Palestine in general and the Holy Al Aqsa Mosque/Jerusalem in particular . <p> The rally was also a clear warning to Israel that its dream of greater Israel and demolition of Al Aqsa Mosque in order to build a Jewish temple on its site would never be fulfilled . <p> Majlis Ulama-Hind is a Shia organisation . It was able to get the support of other Muslim organisations like All India Muslim Majlis-e Mushawrat , Jamaat-e Islami Hind , Jamiat Ulama-e Hind , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from this , a large number of people from Sunni population also participated in the rally in order to express their solidarity with the people of Palestine . Thus the rally gave a clear message that Palestine is not an issue only of Shia or Sunni but of all Muslims everywhere in the world . <p> Maulana Jalal Haidar Naqvi , organiser of the rally and Joint Secretary of Majlis Ulama-e Hind said that Israel had let loose its cruelty and barbarism on hapless Palestinian people right from its creation and its ultimate aim is to create a Greater Israel by including parts of Syria , Iraq , Egypt and Hejaz . Maulana Naqvi warned that Muslims will not rest till they succeed in their objectives to bring justice to the people of Palestine who have been displaced and dispossessed by the Zionist project . He said that it was strange and regrettable on the part of India to have abandoned its traditional policy of friendship towards Arab countries in general and Palestine in particular and instead to strength its relationship with Israel by allowing that artificial country to invade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harmful effect of the Israeli invasion is that ever since Israel opened its embassy here , cases of terrorism are rising in this country . Hence Muslims demand that Israeli embassy in Delhi should be closed down at the earliest . <p> Another speaker was Maulana Mohsin Ali Taqvi , Imam of Shia Jama Masjid in Delhi . He said that creation of Israel was the product of a conspiracy by imperialist powers but it was a pity that Muslims were not united against it at that time or even now . He added that if Muslims become united against Israel , this country would be wiped out . <p> Jamiat Ulama-e Hind 's Maulana Javed Qasmi demanded that India should re-adopt Nehru-Gandhi policy of friendship with Arab countries . President of All India Muslim Majlise Mushawrat , Dr Zafarul-Islam Khan said that Muslims are very grateful to the visionary leadership of the late Ayatullah Imam Khomaini who gave the Umma a gift in the form of ' Al Quds Day ' which reminds all of us that our ' First Qibla ' is under occupation . He regretted that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( NAM ) became a puppet of a small country ( Israel ) " which is very unfortunate " . He referred to a recent cancellation of NAM meeting in Palestine due to the blatant disregard of the international norms by the Israeli government . As regards the situation in Assam , Dr Khan held both the central and Assam state governments responsible for the fresh cases of violence and killings . Dr Khan complained that no body is talking about the large quantity of sophisticated arms and ammunitions possessed by Bodos and that Gogoi government also did not fulfil its promise of enabling Muslims to return to their homes safely by 15 August . Dr Khan exhorted the Muslims to desist from indulgence in self-grandiosity and lavishness and should leave behind the mind set of laziness . <p> Dr Syed Qasim Rasool Ilyas , general secretary of the Welfare Party , lamented that because of India 's strategic relations with Israel , cases of terrorism are taking place in this country . Dr Tasleem Rahmani of Muslim Political Council said that all problems of Muslims of the whole world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and its supporters fail , not only the problem of Palestine will be solved but problems of Muslims all over the world will also be solved . He suggested economic boycott of Israel and its supporters . He urged people to desist from buying Israeli and American products like Pepsi and Coca Cola . As regards the news about atrocities let loose on Muslims in Burma , he cautioned that half of such news was false . Hence we should be sensible in this matter but in any case we should help our Muslim brethren there . The rally culminated at the Parliament Street and a memorandum of demands was submitted to the Prime Minister of India .

It is indeed doubly strange that this gentleman went on to become a trend-setting all-rounder , a legendary leg-spinner , one of the most successful captains and , subsequently , the undisputed voice of cricket . <p> As a batsman he was hard-hitting and a well known exponent of lofted drives ; as a fielder one of the best close-in catchers of his era ; and as a bowler , the Australian leg-spinning bridge between the glory days of Clarrie Grimmett and Bill O'Reilly and the modern era of Shane Warne . <p> Neither as talented nor as large a spinner of the ball @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Benaud was a master at exploiting rough patches on the surface and was known to generate disconcerting bounce . He was accurate to the extent of nagging and in his arsenal there lay concealed a well-disguised googly and a fantastic top-spinner . Late in his career he also developed a flipper . <p> Under his captaincy Australia won 12 Tests and were defeated in just four . Not one series was lost while Benaud was at the helm . The young team he had inherited had turned into dominant world beaters by the time he left the scene . His handling of key players -- Alan Davidson in particular -- was exemplary . In an era not known to demonstrate emotion on the field , Benaud stood with an unbuttoned shirt , raised eyebrows and embraced his players when wickets fell . <p> His fearless moves and natural charisma enlivened interest in Test cricket during an era when post-War circumspection and parsimonious approach to batting and bowling had made the game increasingly tedious for spectators . <p> Richie Benaud achieved a lot as a cricketer , but the wisdom he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His analytical mind was sought by great cricketers and administrators alike . Shane Warne considered him a mentor , Ian Chappell looked up to him for advice and Kerry Packer approached him for guidance during the World Series Championships . <p> As Gideon Haigh put it , " He is perhaps the most influential cricketer and cricket personality since the Second World War . " <p> While reviewing Benaud 's autobiography , Anything But , Sri Lankan cricket writer Harold de Andrado wrote : " Richie Benaud , possibly next to Sir Don Bradman , has been one of the greatest cricketing personalities as player , researcher , writer , critic , author , organiser , adviser and student of the game . " <p> Early years of struggle <p> Born on October 6 , 1930 , Benaud 's career did not soar to greatness from the beginning . In fact , for a long , long gestating period it did not even take off . He fumbled through the first few years while both he and the team management seemed unable to decide whether he was a batsman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ debut as a specialist batsman . And in his Test debut at Sydney against West Indies in 1951-52 , he was chosen primarily for his batting and came in at No 7 , scoring three and 19 . He bowled just four and a half overs . <p> In his second Test match , against South Africa at Melbourne , he was struck by a fierce square cut by John Waite while fielding at short gully and suffered a smashed gum and split upper lip . According to the doctors , the impact could have as easily broken his cheekbone or damaged his eye forever . <p> The Australian team in the early to mid-50s was overloaded with all-rounders . Keith Miller and Ray Lindwall were in the middle of their careers , while Benaud and Davidson were starting theirs . The balance was thus awkward and often tottering . There was a slump in the Australian performance and Benaud himself seldom set the ground on fire . <p> Still considered a batsman who could bowl , he did achieve some success with both bat and ball in the Caribbean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 78 minutes , the third fastest in history at that time . <p> Yet , after six years of international cricket , towards the end of 1956 , the bottom line was alarming . He had managed just 815 runs at 21.44 and captured 50 wickets at 34.44 in 24 Tests , without a single five-for . Luckily , the selectors persisted with him . <p> The making of the all-rounder <p> It was during the tour to India in 1956-57 that Benaud showed signs of maturing into a top class leg-spinner . He took 7 for 72 in Madras , and had figures of 6 for 52 and 5 for 53 in Calcutta . The Indians , including Polly Umrigar and Vijay Manjrekar , born and brought up on a steady diet of spinners , succumbed against the increasing thought Benaud seemed to be putting into his bowling . <p> The following tour to South Africa in 1957-58 tour saw the making of Richie Benaud , the great all-rounder . He struck two centuries and captured 30 wickets in the series , including a 100 along with bowling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the victorious fourth Test . <p> This series also established him as the greatest leg-spinner of the day , and pitch-forked him into the spot for captaincy ahead of Neil Harvey . <p> Success at the helm <p> During the Ashes series that followed , Benaud led Australia from the front -- capturing 31 wickets in five Tests , securing the series 4-0 . The astute innovation in his captaincy was both refreshing and remarkable . Success followed success , with Australia beating Pakistan and India in the subcontinent , and Benaud himself continued to enjoy phenomenal success with the ball . <p> However , the peak of his career , as well as the turning point for the game of cricket , was reached in 1960-61 , when Frank Worrell 's West Indians arrived in Australia to play the most memorable series of all . The five Tests , including the tie in the first , saw exhilarating cricket , aggressive and attractive captaincy , and spirit that characterised all that the game was about . <p> Finally , there was a fantastic performance with which Benaud snatched the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1964 . England had taken a huge 177 run lead in the first innings , and were 150 for 1 in the second , requiring 256 to win . Benaud masterfully bowled into the rough created by the footmarks , and in a devastating burst took 5 for 13 off 25 balls . During the final stages , he also utilised the occasional leg-spin of Bobby Simpson craftily . England collapsed to a 54-run defeat . <p> A fascinating account of the tie at Brisbane and the heist at Old Trafford can be found in Benaud 's A Tale of Two Tests . <p> He led Australia in two more series before retiring from cricket , in the process becoming the first all-rounder to achieve the 2000 run and 200 wicket double . His final figures stood at 2201 runs at 24.45 and 248 wickets at 27.03 .

The first four are strategic and if they are in place , financing comes easily . The first is to reach a milestone in the company 's nanoscience R &amp; D where the company has a unique nanotech prototype , product , or process from which it can build a scalable nanotech based product line . The second is to identify a large or growing market with demand and money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a nanotech enhanced product within the planned technology of the nanotech venture . The third is to understand the target industry processes - how currently raw materials and manufacturing are successfully used in building salable products so that any scale up of the venture 's nanoscience prototype can fit naturally in that industry 's structure without too much disruption . The fourth is to spend venture funds to modify its nanoscience prototypes to become substitutable feedstock for the identified industry 's production methods .

Or do n't you ? <p> Here 's a listen at the album , to find out : <p> A high-pitched blast of Hindi welcomes us first , as the song segues into a steady beat and Hariharan starts off Kutti Puli Koottam , accompanied by Tipu . <p> Viveka 's lyrics are strictly functional and offset the North Indian flavour , intermingling with the uniquely south Indian instruments . <p> The song pursues its simple beat and the charanam offers a few beautiful moments . Not brilliant , perhaps , but pleasant , nevertheless . <p> Antarctica kicks off with synthesised music , even a whiff of the eighties as Vijay Prakash takes up the vocal reins . Karky 's lyrics supply the romantic quotient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supplies the rap section . <p> This one is a soft song , a farewell , with equal parts of anguish and sweet sorrow .

A pleasant listen . <p> Someone shrieks with laughter and then the announcement , " This is Veejay !

Joe and Krishna Iyer supply the rap ; the interludes are all filled with weird and wonderful sounds as is usual in a Harris Jeyaraj number . Just for the sake of its phrases and singers , this number might well become this album 's chartbuster . <p> Another folk song in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , steady beat , and the voices of Hariharan and Bombay Jayashri . The song obviously tries to emulate the haunting melody of numbers like Annal Mele and Ondra Iranda but does n't manage to be quite as melodious . <p> The way Alaikaa Laika begins reminds you a lot of the old classic Madai Thirandhu ? and you realise that this song too pretty much falls into the peppy Harris Jeyaraj collection , which means that it is lots of synthesised music , loud shrieks and mandatory youthful jargon , all rendered courtesy of Javed Ali , Sayandra Philip and Sharmila . <p> Jagdish on mission , which also happens to be the theme music , happens to be a mildly appealing mixture of suspense , bursts of synthesised music with rapid staccato beats . Strictly functional , and there 's nothing more to be said . <p> Taken altogether , Thuppakki seems to be a collection of songs , tailor-made by Harris Jeyaraj for both Vijay and A R Murugadoss . <p> Except Google Google and the mildly melodious Poi Varavaa , the rest are all oft-heard , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with low expectations .

The only son of accomplished pianists Merlin and Bosco , Rhys began singing at three , trained in western classical piano at five , and left both at 13 to learn the clarinet .

" <p> His first live performance was on the clarinet at 13 at Marine Drive 's Not Just Jazz By The Bay with Jazzy Joe and the Jazz Junkeys -- Joe Pereira and his students who were musicians trapped in the bodies of doctors and merchant navy captains . " My only motivation was the awesome , free food I got to polish off after the show , " he chuckles . <p> While studying at St Andrews , and later St Xavier 's ( mass media ) , Rhys meandered into the band space , playing for an ensemble group called Untitled .

He joined his mother at her jazz group , Merlin and The All Stars Big Band , and played gigs with all the old hands he had grown up hearing in his Bandra drawing room . <p> For the last two years , Rhys has juggled a range of freelance assignments -- gigs , television commercials and corporate shows .

<p> For the first three months after a customer picks up the card , the company communicates to her just how the system works , how it can benefit her . <p> There are offers to woo the customer to actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Once the concept sticks with her and she understands the ' value ' of the loyalty card , the retailer starts tracking her shopping behaviour -- what are the common items on her purchase list , does she come midweek from office or on weekends to shop and so on . <p> Future Group offers a mix of rewards to its loyalty programme customers that include free parking , a separate cash counter , free home delivery , no fee on exchange offers , premiere passes for films , to name a few . <p> The data collected from loyalty card use has helped the retailer to categorise customers based on usage and purchase patterns , which in turn has helped it rationalise a host of things -- from stocking to store layout . <p> Brand-based data can also be used as a leverage in retailer-manufacturer relationships . <p> " If customers do n't have brand loyalty , you can push back against manufacturers and tell them you wo n't carry their products anymore if they raise prices , " says a leading retailer . <p> One such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Discounts on private labels was not sustainable because every other brand duplicate the move . <p> " So , over a period of time we moved to a point-based system , wherein card holders can accumulate points and redeem them at any of the group stores , " says Sarda . <p> How the group has ensured the plan works by " revisiting it and studying it every month " . <p> " We are tracking the feedback continuously to make the programme more customer-friendly , " says Sarda . <p> On its part , Shoppers Stop , one of the oldest retail brands in India , which began offering its popular First Citizen Loyalty Programme card to customers 18 years ago , has a total of 2.6 million members to vouch for its success . <p> He explains how two years ago , in an experiment done at the store 's outlet in Malad , Mumbai , the company realised that men -- who are known to dislike shopping but who visited Shoppers Stop outlets with their family -- were buying only a handful of things from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were not aware that Shoppers Stop also had an elaborate stock of menswear . <p> So it started communicating to this set of consumers ( " not overdose but simply informing them and announcing bulk deals in the category , which was n't the case before " ) and within four weeks , Shoppers Stop noted a Rs 2 crore increase in sales from that one store , from that one category alone . <p> Last year , about 72 per cent of the total sales at Shoppers Stop came from loyalty programme customers . <p> Three years ago the company felt it needed a separate team to not just handle the loyalty programme but to also study and analyse the data thrown up by it . <p> " Remember , the customer is not always structured in her thoughts as the retailer . <p> " Brand loyalty offerings can influence her decision and make it more manageable , " says Bhatia . <p> Shoppers Stop goes as far as categorising its customers into two groups -- those who own loyalty cards , and with whom the company communicates , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to show just how critical is communication and how it can be tweaked to keep up with the changing demands of consumers , " says Bhatia . <p> Shoppers Stop has a special app for smartphone users to help track " personality types " of its customers to integrate it with the loyalty programme . <p> Among others Jet Airways , feel experts , has done a great job with JetPrivilege , India 's largest frequent flier programme . Way back in 1993 , the airlines understood the need to have " repeat business " and in the next one year , it announced its JetPrivilege programme . <p> Though the initial benefits revolved around tele-check in and accumulated " burn and earn " miles , gradually it expanded , through customer feedback , to other offerings . <p> It started the tier system for different categories of members , thus allowing the airline to segment data collected on the basis of regularity and volume of travel . <p> The programme allowed for a unique ' Dynamic Tier Review System ' , which allowed customers to get benefits according to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ online system ( to earn miles even after the air travel was completed ) , several partnerships with banks , hotels , credit card companies , restaurants , retail outlets and publishing houses to make it appealing to the flier . <p> Two months ago , according to a company report , Jet decided to spin off the programme into a whole new subsidiary to help it get a larger retail-based coalition loyalty structure to get better value on its investments . <p> Who 's failing <p> If the benefits are so obvious why are some sectors slow to adopt loyalty plans and leverage its benefits ? <p> While this will definitely make things easy for the user ( she has to carry one card or may be the whole system will migrate online ) , brands will enjoy the benefit of having a bigger database to draw their insights on . <p> " When that happens the customer will finally be the hero , " sums up Lahiri.

It was on 22nd day of October in that year when the Indian security forces mowed down at least fifty people and injured scores of that little village , in a killing spree that lasted for twenty minutes and the only fault of those killed was to dare protest the siege of their revered Shrine-Hazratbal . <p> 22nd October was a Friday and the faithful numbering around ten to fifteen thousand , after finishing with the prayers , gathered in the court yard of the local Jamia Masjid to register their protest against the army siege of Hazratbal Shrine . A procession then started marching through various streets shouting slogans for lifting the siege and in support of Kashmir 's freedom . When the procession reached the main road ( Srinagar-Jammu National Highway ) that divides the town , they faced a large contingent of the Border Security Force .

As luck would have it , his injured brother survived the carnage , after spending about a month in the hospital . <p> The so-called security forces did not stop there . A local resident , Farooq Ahmad Bhat , working on behalf of a Kashmir-based human rights monitoring group , had collected valuable details about the massacre . After he braved many threats from the security forces to desist , he was finally picked up from his shop on Ist December 2003 by troops from Ist Rashtriya Rifles in full public view and made to disappear .

@@1199240 <h> RBI 's ineffective communication <p> The central bank , by issuing policy statements all too often , has lost the capacity to surprise the market and manage expectations . <p> October 22 , 2012 : <p> For monetary policy to have the desired impact , a central bank 's communication style could play as important a part as the actual measures taken by it . The essence of effective communication is to manage , rather than be swayed by , expectations . <p> Financial market participants look forward to sound bytes from top central bank functionaries to be able to figure out what lies in store in terms of policy measures . Their pronouncements could provide clues on the nature of the central bank 's future market intervention , thereby prompting market players to act in a particular manner . Given these possibilities , central bankers are discreet and tight-lipped in their observations . Their public appearances are restricted to select occasions . That , however , is not really the case in India . <h> TOO MANY SPEECHES <p> Fed officials made all of 48 speeches in 2011 , and have made 33 speeches so far in 2012 . In contrast , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2011 , and already another 70 so far in 2012 . The RBI seems to be inspired by the Bank of England where the number of speeches in a year matches that of the RBI . There is , however , a difference . <p> In the case of the RBI , the burden of communication ( read speeches ) is largely shared by the ' big five ' ( the Governor and Deputy Governors ) , and in rare instances by a few Executive Directors . In the case of Bank of England , apart from the Governor and directors , 10 Executive Directors and 10 members each from the monetary policy and financial policy committees share the burden . <p> One wonders whether the time and resources involved in communicating the central bank 's stance on policy -- especially when the number of officials involved is not large -- can be put to better use . <p> Moreover , frequent communication from the top brass can lead to avoidable controversies . The scope for controversy arises not so much from the speeches , as from post-speech media interactions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Deputy Governor K.C. Chakraborty on the cash reserve ratio for banks . Public appearances during speeches are in addition to the formal media interface during monetary policy announcements . The RBI defends the greater public interface as an attempt to bring transparency in policymaking . <h> CONSTRUCTIVE AMBIGUITY <p> The RBI also indulges the researcher and analyst community through a post-policy teleconference . However , if one were to study the responses given by the Governor and his deputies to the questions posed by analysts in the post-policy teleconference , one finds an element of constructive ambiguity . <p> Should the top brass avoid their constructive ambiguity ? The simple answer is ' no ' . <p> The economy is a complex machine . One ca n't be sure of the exact impact of a monetary action . After all , there is a large informal economy that may not be impacted by monetary policy actions in the same way as the formal sector . Hence , the pass-through of policy actions is weak . In such a situation , it is better to give the system time to absorb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policy on a frequent basis to achieve the desired impact . <h> MANAGING EXPECTATIONS <p> Frequent interaction with the media builds up pressure on the RBI to act all the time , without its adequately taking into consideration the lag in the operation of its earlier moves . This could lead to its going too far , as is the case now , when it has hiked interest rates far too often . The practice of holding mid-quarter reviews adds to the pressure . <p> Rather than pandering to expectations , the central bank 's actions should have the capacity to take the markets by surprise . The RBI increased policy rates 13 times between March 2010 and November 2011 to tame inflation from around 10 per cent to its declared medium term target of 4-5 per cent . The success , however , was limited , as inflation had more to do with supply-led factors , whereas monetary policy measures are more effective in curbing demand pressures . <p> Inflation at the wholesale level still continues at above 7 per cent and at more than 10 per cent at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ April 17 , 2012 , on all other occasions , the RBI had delivered what markets had expected . In effect , economic agents had already factored in the rate action . <p> Theory suggests that anticipated monetary policy is rather ineffective . How could the RBI have expected the rate cuts engineered through baby steps to have any impact , when it was playing into the hands of market players ? Low inflationary expectations have yet to materialise . Inflationary expectations still rule at above 10 per cent after so many rate hikes . <p> The US experience in dampening inflationary expectations in the early 1980s during the Volcker regime suggests that strong monetary action works better than baby steps . <p> If the RBI were really serious about dampening inflationary expectations , it would have increased rates by 50 to 75 bps , taking the markets by surprise , rather than increasing rates on each occasion by 25 bps . Surprise moves are important for upholding the credibility of the central bank on the inflation front . We have seen that the RBI seems to oscillate between priorities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ middle-path approach has not helped in dampening inflationary expectations . <h> NO MAGIC SOLUTIONS <p> The RBI think-tank also would be aware of the fact that given the structural rigidities in the system , we would have to come to terms with some inflation till supply constraints are eased . However , it may not like to openly pronounce a change in what it sees as the desirable or tolerable level of inflation . <p> In a democracy , it would not be prudent to shift the desired level of inflation . In doing so , the acceptable level of inflation would turn out to be a shifting target . In such a situation , it is perhaps better to make policy pronouncements less frequently .

" I 'll be wearing a blue shirt and baseball cap with ' The Bronx ' written on it , " he says when I call him up to set up an appointment . <p> Ultan takes me on a walk around Mott Haven .

Mott started the company named after him -- and also set up in Mott Haven what we would today call an industrial park . <p> Until the 19th century , the Bronx was a rural area largely disconnected from the rest of New York City . As lumber yards , sawmills , piano factories , and other industries set up shop in the industrial area started by Mott , residences started coming up nearby . These residences today are a part of Mott Haven 's three Historic Districts . Because of the area 's development , the Bronx rapidly grew from a rural outskirt to an integral part of New York City in 1874 . <p> We walk past a giant black cloth shrouding the front of a building ostensibly under repair .

No two facades look alike . Each bare-brick front is topped by different kinds of gables -- some curved , some staggered , some sloping , some bell-shaped .

The station was moved under street level , and Madison Square Garden was built above ground level . <p> New York 's Grand Central terminal was next on the demolition list . Jackie Kennedy , who was leading a group of influential people to protest against these demolitions , ensured the formation of a Landmarks Preservation Commission and the New York City Landmarks Law to protect city monuments . <p> By the time this law was passed , many of the 19th century buildings in Manhattan had been replaced by skyscrapers .

After the acquisition , iGATE 's revenues crossed $1 billion ( Patni at that time had revenues of over $700 million ) and its employee strength grew to over 27,000 . <p> In an exclusive chat with Shobha Warrier , Phaneesh Murthy , CEO , iGATE , talks about the prevailing weak world economy , the US presidential elections , and outsourcing . <p> Do you feel the world economy is going back to what it was in 2008 ? <p> If you look around , it is evident that the world is in the cusp of a recession . Be it Europe , the US or Asia , and nothing is likely to change in the next one year . <p> In the US itself , at least 50 per cent of the economy , which is made up of banking and financial services , is under pressure . <p> Manufacturing , temporarily is doing well in the US but consumer sentiment overall is poor . So even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a mood to go on a buying spree . <p> Why do you think sentiments are poor ? Why everybody is expecting a gloom period soon ? <p> It IS a gloom period in the US with high rate of unemployment . It will take a long time for people to adjust to the new unemployment rate of 6-7 per cent . They are used to the 4 per cent rate . Due to the increased unemployment rate people feel depressed . <p> If ( Barack ) Obama comes back to power , taxes will go up . Thus the sentiment tends to be negative . <p> But Obama is talking about taxing the rich ... <p> The truth is the rich are the ones who spend more money and they are the ones who create the most jobs . Small entrepreneurs and medium businesses are not hiring due to uncertainty on taxes and high health care costs . <p> Also , the return on investment is extremely low . You will see that the corporate deposit rate is mere 0.5-0.75 per cent . Therefore , negative sentiment prevails @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once wrote that if US sneezes , the whole world catches cold . Does this hold true even today ? <p> Yes , very much . For countries like India and China , US is an important market . Since the slowdown has been very sharp , there has been a clear impact on the Indian growth rate . Chinese growth rate also has come down . <p> Though India has a good 5-6 per cent growth rate , it too feels there is going to be a recession . Actually , when you come off a 9 per cent growth rate , 5 per cent honestly seems like a recession . <p> How big is the US market for iGATE ? <p> For iGATE , 80 per cent of its business comes from North America and hence it is a huge market . <p> Do you think the economic situation will play a major role in the US presidential elections ? <p> As far as foreign policy is concerned , both ( candidates ) have almost similar views . The difference boils down to how they handle it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say that those who voted for Obama in the last election , will have a change of heart this time . <p> Because of unemployment ? <p> Partly due to unemployment , and also because people had high expectations . They voted for history at that time . Sadly , Obama disappointed them . <p> As an Indian who does business in the US , are you also disappointed with Obama ? <p> I expected this ( Obama 's policies ) . I am concerned with Obama 's ( views ) . He believes all CEOs are public enemies . I worked hard all my life to become a CEO and he thinks CEOs are only money sucking and greedy people . We work very hard for our employees , investors and shareholders , and we create jobs . He is also against outsourcing . <p> I feel Obama will win a second term and unfortunately we will continue to be under pressure - both as a country and also as an industry . <h> Obama can not stop IT outsourcing <p> In the last four years , how much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose 80 per cent of the market is in the US ? <p> He had many big and pressing problems in his current term . He , therefore , did not go after outsourcing with a vengeance . There are many companies close to the President , which have started in-sourcing many things . While there has not been regulatory support , clearly the mood has moved in a few companies . <p> Slowdown in the IT industry has more to do with market conditions than with Obama 's policies . <p> When the country is reeling under high unemployment , is it not expected that the Head of the State will oppose outsourcing ? <p> In my mind , anti-outsourcing is cheap talk . Indian IT industry has played a big role in making US companies more competitive and has created more jobs . IT outsourcing is a net job creator in the US . Rather than taking jobs away , outsourcing has contributed immensely to the US economy . <p> If Obama comes back to power and takes up outsourcing as a serious issue , what kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? <p> At the end of the day , he can not interfere too much because most of our businesses , about 98-99 per cent , is with private companies in the US . Each company in the US will have to do what is best for its shareholders . I think outsourcing companies like ours are good for shareholders . <p> His policies may slowdown the pace but I do n't think his policies will be able to kill the pipeline completely . <h> Obama can not stop IT outsourcing <p> It was reported recently that Indian companies plan to hire more people in the US . Does that mean there will be a shift in the way you and other Indian companies hire in the US ? <p> Yes , both iGATE and other companies are hiring more in the US . But the shift is because of the visa problems and also new regulations , especially in the banking sector , it require us to do more work within the US . <p> What kind of impact will it have on the revenue of the company ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ India , US based work tends to have lower margins . <p> The US is the biggest market for most Indian companies . With the kind of slowdown that is happening , will companies look at other markets ? <p> There is nothing happening in most of Europe and hence it is difficult to expand there . Yes , many companies are looking to expand outside the US . For example , iGATE started the India operations recently . <p> After the US , which is the major market for the IT industry ? <p> UK is the number two market . However , visas are difficult to organise in Europe . France is socialist and they do n't like outsiders . Germany is a good market but there are cultural and language barriers . They get a lot of work done in the Eastern European countries . <h> Obama can not stop IT outsourcing <p> Silicon Valley itself is doing much better . From a technology perspective , right now , it is humming there because of social analytic companies . Plenty of venture funding is also available . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ badly . That is a cause for concern . California unemployment rate is over 10 per cent and it has a $16 billion budget deficit . <p> California as a state is probably more bankrupt than some European countries . <p> What kind of a growth do you target for iGATE in the next 3 years ? <p> Our present revenues are just over $1 billion . Our mission is $3 billion by 2017 . <p> Hiring has been on hold for many Indian companies . Will this scenario change soon ? <p> Hiring will be dependent on growth of the industry . Since growth has come down , hiring has slowed down , too . Also , there is increased hiring in the US . That is the double impact . <p> You spoke earlier about single digit growth for the IT industry this year . Nascom , on the other hand , has stuck to its target of double-digit growth . Your comments ... <p> Yes , I still stick by my prediction of IT industry 's single digit growth this year . I see signs that lead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ won this year were against an existing player , unlike in the past where we used to win deals against customer 's internal work . It may still be growth for individual companies but not for the industry . <p> In addition , the overall market still presents a big challenge , especially in the banking , financial services and insurance ( BFSI ) space , which is still about 50 per cent of the business . <p> Third , European market is not growing and I do n't see an immediate recovery there . <h> Obama can not stop IT outsourcing <p> Globally , Indian IT industry is number one and will continue to be so . But my criticism of Indian IT is its lack of innovation . We are a very strong services market but 20 years from now we will need IP ( intellectual property ) . This is not happening . <p> Ten years ago , I had written an article where I had suggested that the first industry which will start generating world-class products from India would be the telecom industry because the country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some products , try it out in the home market and use them across the world because phones are the same everywhere . Unfortunately , even that has not happened . <p> Whom do you blame ? <p> I would blame our education system and lack of strong leadership . While the education system has helped the IT services business , the same system has gone against the products business because it does not encourage creativity and innovation . <p> It is the obligation of leaders to change these things . I do n't think we have done enough of that . <p> When do you see the world coming out of the current recession ? <p> I am an eternal optimist . I actually continue to believe that we are operating in a $1.5-2 trillion space . The Indian IT industry is only $100 billion . Hence , I think there are plenty of growth opportunities . <p> Regarding global economic recession , I would say it would take at least one more year for the recovery to happen .

The article pointed to serious conflicts of interest between the decisions he took as an official in charge of economic regulations and the assets held by his relatives in companies that benefited from reforms . <p> For instance , it claimed his relatives had bought a stake in the Ping An insurance company before it was floated on the stock market , and had garnered a share of US$ 2.2 billion in the company as of 2007 . <p> With the newspaper 's websites blocked in China and censors scrubbing any references to the article on Chinese micro-blogging sites , it remains unlikely that people in China -- besides the few hundred thousand who use software to scale censorship restrictions -- would have seen the report on Friday . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ damaging for Mr. Wen , who will step down from the party 's nine-member Politburo Standing Committee at the November 8 Party Congress .

The former Premier Zhu Rongji , who championed market reforms , is known to be strongly critical of Mr. Wen 's handling of the economy .

Media in China are , however , not allowed to publish stories critical of the Central leadership , although they regularly publish corruption stories related to local-level officials . In an apparent reference to the speculation , Mr. Wen , at the same March press conference , said he would leave office " with the courage to face history " .

While many clinicians and organisations working in the rehabilitation industry may be aware of the concept of " Seating " , very few are following the best clinical practices . Besides , the technology used in wheeled mobility and accessories is well below par when compared to the western standards . This negatively impacts the quality of life for persons with disabilities along with severe medical complications like deformity of spine , soars and stiffness in limbs to name a few . <p> As part of their first continuing education initiative , Specialised Mobility Operations and Innovations ( SMOI ) is hosting the first Indian Seating and Mobility symposium in New Delhi on November 3 and 4 .

According to World Health Organization ( WHO ) guidelines on provision of manual wheelchairs in less resourced settings , in any given population , 0.5 per cent requires Prosthetics and Orthotics ( P&amp;O ) devices while one per cent requires a wheelchair . However , in India , using P&amp;O devices and other mobility aids are preferred over wheeled mobility due to the lack of infrastructure , quality of products , training and most of all social stigmas involved . <p> Service delivery is a key component in providing appropriate mobility assistive equipment ( MAE ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a user . Therefore , an effective way of providing mobility solutions is to promote a systematic service delivery process . The WHO guidelines on provision of wheelchairs in less resourced environments highlighted the fact that most people who require a wheelchair do not receive one and those who do receive a wheelchair are given one without a proper evaluation to ensure it is appropriate in meeting their needs . This can lead to abandonment of the device or development of secondary complications that affect the health of an individual . <p> Speaking about the initiative , Dr. Padmaja Kankipati , Director , Service Delivery and Research &amp; Development , SMOI , said , " India is in stark contrast to other developed countries where people with mobility disabilities were leading fulfilling and independent lives .

@@1209234 <p> Indian companies tend to punch above their weight . Though small but growing in the global business world , they appear to be overreaching and unafraid to expand to new shores .

A global company must have a proper global infrastructure , global governance mechanisms around managing work and people in global jobs ( heads of operation , distribution or compensation and benefits , for example ) .

Here are tips for implementing them . <p> By Paul Rubens <p> HOW-TONov 2nd 2012 <p> Facebook 's state of the art data center in Oregon uses 38 percent less power and costs 24 percent less to run that its older data centers . These figures are astounding , and they should certainly make any cost-conscious CIO sit up and take notice . <p> What 's the secret behind these savings ? The company honored its hacker roots by custom-designing both the data center itself , and the servers ( and management tools ) inside it , from the ground up . It 's akin to what Google has been doing for the past 10 years or so , but the good news is that--unlike Google--Facebook has not kept what it has achieved and how it has achieved it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is true : following the open-source software model , Facebook turned its server , server management , storage , rack , electrical , cooling and overall data center designs over to the Open Compute Project(OCP) Foundation , a not-for-profit with some heavyweight names on its board including Intel , Rackspace , Goldman Sachs and Arista Networks as well as Facebook . The OCP Foundation has formalized Facebook 's designs into OCP specifications , and these specifications are freely available and anyone can contribute improvements to them . <p> Pick a Vendor , Any Vendor <p> One of the key ideas behind the development of the OCP specifications has been to avoid the " gratuitous differentiation " between different vendors ' products , according to Frank Frankovsky , Facebook 's vice president of hardware design and supply chain , and founding board member of the OCP . ( The phrase " gratuitous differentiation appears to be a mantra used by everyone involved with the OCP , and Frankovsky is no exception . ) <p> " Buying off-the-shelf servers , for example , is not economical as they include features that most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That leads to extra costs and wasted electricity , and there are issues like it not being possible to manage HP boxes in the same way as Dell boxes : proprietary management wreaks havoc in environments like ours . " Instead of being supplied by established hardware vendors like Dell or HP , OCP servers are often supplied directly by manufacturers in the Far East who are willing to supply them at wafer-thin margins . <p> The overall theme of the OCP then is to slim the server hardware down to what 's actually needed to carry out the sort of large-scale computing that Facebook is involved in , and run it off a highly efficient electrical system with a minimum amount of power transformations . Further power and cost savings are achieved by housing it all in a data center with a high efficiency cooling system . <p> Facebook has proven that its designs work in its purpose-built data center in Oregon , but the vast majority of enterprises have far smaller computing environments and are unlikely to embark on a new data center build . So the question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and medium sized businesses , or even large enterprises that do n't carry out computing on the same scale as Facebook , benefit from OCP designs ? And if so , how ? <p> " We certainly expected initially that our designs would appeal only to companies doing large scale computing like us , or companies like banks that have huge IT operations , " says Frankovsky . " But it turns out that there is almost no limit to who can benefit . I would argue that the OCP is applicable to everyone , and who would n't want to be more efficient and eliminate gratuitous differentiation ? " <p> The reason that anyone can benefit is that you do n't have to build a new data center to achieve some of the cost savings : You can pick and choose which OCP specifications to adopt . That means that even if you are using colocation facilities you could put in OCP servers and power supplies and make significant power and cost saving . <p> " We achieved a 38 percent reduction in energy usage in a newly built @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you could expect energy savings of at least half that , " says Frankovsky . The news is even better when it comes to overall cost savings : Frankovsky says he believes that even if you are responsible for a fairly small IT environment , you could still match Facebook 's 24 percent cost reduction . That 's because while Facebook was already getting heavy discounts on its hardware due to its scale , you probably are n't . That means the cost savings from switching to cheaper OCP gear--minus the gratuitous differentiation--will be all the more significant . <p> Smaller Enterprise Benefit From OCP <p> One company that is backing OCP and hopes to bring its benefits to smaller enterprises is Digital Realty Trust , the world 's largest operator of data center space . It is planning to equip some of its data center pods with equipment that complies with the OCP Open Rack standard including the OCP integrated power distribution system , enabling customers to pick OCP servers to run in the pods . Since these will be in the company 's existing data centers , customers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> But Digital Realty Trust CTO Jim Smith says that its existing cooling systems are already very efficient , even if they ca n't quite match OCP standards . " Smaller customers can pick their own OCP servers , and we can offer them between 75 percent and 85 percent of the benefits that Facebook gets at its data center , " he says . <p> Smith says that typical customers for Digital Reality 's OCP environments will be small-to-midsized companies or large , non-technology intensive companies that require between 1 and 3 megawatts of capacity . So far the company is in talks with potential customers , but has yet to sign any up . <p> One reason for this may be that companies are not yet sure that " open source " hardware design will really work , and prefer to take the safe route of buying from one of the established big name vendors , Frankovsky says . But he expects that will change quickly . " Think of Linux in the early years , and how unsure people were of the risks , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the open source software market , and then envision that in hardware . " <p> To help you take advantage of OCP , there is a growing list of " OCP solution providers " such as Avnet , ZT Systems and Hyve Solutions ( owned by Synnex , a business process services company ) , while QCT ( owned by Quanta , a Taiwanese original design manufacturer ( ODM ) which makes many of Dell 's servers ) and Wiwynn ( owned by Wistron , another Taiwanese ODM ) have been set up to sell OCP hardware direct to end users . <p> HP and Dell have also announced new , server designs ( codenamed " Coyote " --based on HP 's ProLiant platform and Intel 's Xeon E5-series processors--and " Zeus , " respectively ) which will be compatible with OCP 's Open Rack specification , and VMware has announced that it will certify its vSphere virtualization platform to run on OCP iron . <p> OCP solution provider Hyve Solutions takes standard OCP servers , adds cabling , drives and networking gear , and then ships them out as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manager , says Hyve has seen huge interest and significant sales volumes of OCP servers ever since Facebook announced the savings it had made by specifying them . <p> " Prior to this people bought what was available--maybe Dell or HP servers .

Frankovsky says that the Foundation is unlikely to branch out beyond these areas in the foreseeable future . " Linux was successful because there were a lot of developers working on a common core , and we want to study how and why Linux was successful before branching out too far , " he said . <p> But some day will OCP encompass other areas , like networking or perhaps mobile devices ?

@@1221240 <h> Why I love the new James Bond . Hint : Jason Bourne <p> I was 12 years old when I first encountered James Bond , a ripe age for grand pubescent crushes on fictional men . Yet the seemingly irresistible package of sophistication , sexual charisma , and bravado left me cold . Soon after , I picked up Bourne Identity and fell madly in love with another secret agent : Jason Bourne . <p> He was the ultimate anti-Bond . Where one man 's entire identity could be summed up in a single phrase -- " Bond , James Bond " -- the other did n't even know his name . That tormented quest for identity -- packaged in a tough-but-sensitive sexiness -- had an obvious appeal for someone hovering on the edge of adolescent anxiety . <p> My lack of interest in 007 was not mysterious either . By the 1980s , the Bond version of masculinity was already several decades too old . With his tux-and-martinis chivalry and smirking air of superiority , he was a quintessential male fantasy , and an outdated one at that . The gals were on the sidelines , both on screen and in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Sean Connery version of macho read not as offensive but just silly . This was some Uncleji version of machismo , like in Diamonds Are Forever , when he jokes , " There is something I 'd like you to get off your chest " -- just before he rips off a woman 's bikini top and strangles her with it . Eye roll ! <p> We did n't need have to wait till 1995 for Judi Dench to tell us in Goldeneye that he is " a sexist , misogynist dinosaur . " <p> This film image released by Sony Pictures shows Daniel Craig as James Bond in " Skyfall . " AP <p> Okay , so it was all supposed to be good fun , the characters and plots writ so large as to border on caricature . But what truly grated was the old Bond 's smug infallibility . He possessed no inner life , driven instead by a facile certainty of his rightness and inevitable triumph . It made him a bit flat , and entirely predictable . A 1970s Amitabh Bachchan playing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more intriguing and appealing character than any Roger Moore outing . Apples and oranges , perhaps , but the fact remains that the rise of the conflicted modern hero made the original Bond quickly archaic . <p> Old-fashioned sexism aside , world events have not been kind to Bond either . The end of the Cold War spelled an end to the moral certainties , blurring the lines between the good and bad guys . The post-9/11 war on terror outlined the limits of blind patriotism , and being in her majesty 's service no longer seemed like a good idea . Maybe Robert Ludlum was on to something , after all . <p> It 's why history has been kinder to my old crush , the other JB whose movie versions have consistently outperformed the Bond franchise , and by huge margins .

The gadgets have disappeared but the girls remain , but in an oddly obligatory manner . You can almost see Sam Mendes thinking , " Ok , have to do sex with hot chicks . How can I shove them in without making him look like an antiquated jerk ? " <p> Skyfall also does its best to confront the bigger question : Does James Bond matter any more ?

But in retreating into his past , the movie also rewrites its hero . Bruised , weeping , and stripped of his certainties , the James who emerges from its ashes is also no longer recognisably Bond .

Shefali Razdan Duggal , a member of the National Finance Committee for President Obama 's re-election campaign , dipped her feet into politics because , as a mother of two children , fund-raising gave her the flexibility to keep her own time . Living in the San Francisco Bay area , she had a big pool of Indian Americans and other South Asians to tap . She rose to prominence relatively quickly , and now is a must-see for Democratic Party hopefuls in the area and beyond . She has raised $1 million for the presidential campaign . <p> The choice is clear <p> Obama clearly is an inspirational figure for Duggal , whose husband incidentally is a Republican . " My husband and I are both rational , moderate people and we disagree sometimes , but he is very supportive of me , " she said from her home in California . So why Obama ? " It is his empathy . He is for racial and cultural equity and the intent matters . He has focused on improving the lives of all Americans . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has said that he has written off over 47 per cent of Americans , " she said , referring to the now notorious video clip of the Republican candidate dismissing nearly half the population as being too dependent on government handouts . Romney , who was addressing wealthy donors when he was secretly recorded , later said he was " completely wrong " . <p> The Republican Party 's increasingly harsh social and fiscal policy recommendations turn many Indian Americans away and the community remains largely a home for the Democratic Party . The Pew survey showed it was the most Democratic-leaning of all Asian minority groups , with a whopping 84 per cent voting for Obama in 2008 ; second perhaps only to African Americans , whose support for the president is at 99 per cent this election , according to an NBC poll . <p> An Indian American Congressional staffer , who did n't want to be named , explained why the community favours the Democratic Party . " It is a natural fit simply because , as a party , it respects us and our views . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Republican Party often appears hostile to a multicultural , melting pot America . " The rhetoric coming out from the Tea Party-influenced right on social issues makes me uncomfortable . It also makes first or second-generation Americans feel like outsiders . " <p> The Tea Party emerged in 2009-10 as a major force with its strict advocacy of adherence to the US Constitution and extreme fiscal conservatism . Its blessing for the Republican candidates was seen as crucial last year with most of them striking more and more extreme positions on government spending , lower taxes and religious issues . Once nominated , Romney has been walking back from some of the ideas just as the Obama campaign is trying to ensure the Tea Party label sticks to him . <p> But Sue Ghosh , who proudly wears the Republican badge and is a member of the party 's National Finance Committee , insisted that Romney had not wavered from his position . He wants to " streamline government and lower taxes and not cut defence " . A lawyer by profession , Ghosh grew up in New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ centre . He studied at the London School of Economics and worked at the Indian Statistical Institute , two places that in Ghosh 's opinion are " leftist " in orientation . <p> " It would be very difficult to change him but I find the Republican Party values work for me and my family , " says Ghosh , who was drawn to the party as a young university student . She rose in the party hierarchy , serving as legal counsel to three Congressmen and working as a member of the Bush-Cheney steering committee in 2004 . She said that many Indian Americans in the private sector do n't support Obama 's policies . " They are very frustrated and some are wondering if they can stay in business , " she said , on the basis of her interaction " with hundreds of Indian Americans " this campaign season . <p> When asked about the Republican Party being less diverse , as was evident at the August convention , Ghosh said it was because of " camera angles " . But she added that , the US @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the conventions brought into sharp relief the differences . An African American camerawoman for CNN was abused by two Republicans who threw nuts at her and said , " That 's how we feed animals . " They were thrown out immediately and party bosses apologised to CNN but the incident was flashed across to all people of colour . The Democratic Party convention was a medley of faces of different colours and ethnicities , a fact that ca n't but make many Indian Americans feel more at home . <p> Other factors determining their vote is how many high-level appointments Indian Americans get in each administration and how they treat India in policy terms . The latter matters a great deal , especially to the first generation . In the debate on which party is better for India , Sampat Shivangi , a long-time Republican fund-raiser from Mississippi , pulls out the trump card : the 2008 Indo-US civil nuclear agreement . " It was Bush 's biggest foreign policy achievement . He stood by India . The Democrats did n't do it . Senator Obama and Senator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , recalling when both the president and secretary of state Hillary Clinton were in the US Senate . " They were not in favour of the deal . " <p> Giving back to India <p> Shivangi , a gynaecologist , has a simple litmus test for a candidate before he opens his wallet for him . " He has to be pro-India . I do n't support anyone because I want a government contract from him . I do n't have an agenda . I only want to give back because we owe India , " said the 70-year-old who raised $1.7 million for Romney . Similarly Krishna , who grew up poor in Andhra Pradesh in a family of eight supported only by his father 's meagre school teacher 's salary , says he will never forget his parents , his teachers and the home country . He said Obama is more talk than action on India . Obama supported India 's bid for a permanent seat in the UN Security Council but " never did anything about it " . <p> Obama supporters , strongly refuting that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many high-level appointments granted to Indian Americans in this White House . Obama appointed Aneesh Chopra , a young and ambitious politico , as his technology czar in the White House while Kal Penn , the first Indian American actor to play major roles in Hollywood , has served as associate director of public engagement in two stints . Penn , who was born Kalpen Modi to Gujarati immigrant parents , is currently mobilising the youth vote for Obama . Many other Indian Americans were appointed at senior levels in the federal government . <p> As soon as a president is sworn in , those who consider themselves worthy start lobbying for jobs . Some get so ambitious that they pitch above their weight , as it happened last year when the position of US ambassador to India opened up mid-way .

@@1242236 <h> Netmagic CEO on life after NTT acquisition and where datacentre business is headed <p> Sharad Sanghi is one of the pioneers in Indian datacentre business . He founded Netmagic Solutions , now one of India 's largest datacentre solutions companies , in 1998 . The company later ventured into high growth niche services like disaster recovery , Cloud technology and application hosting . Nexus Venture Partners and Fidelity jointly pumped in Rs 80 crore in 2008 , followed by a Rs 70 crore investment led by Nokia Growth Partners and Cisco Systems with backing from the then existing investors in 2010 . Sanghi 's efforts were paid off when in January this year Japanese telecom major NTT Communications <p> acquired 74 per cent stake in it for $116 million , providing one of the largest exits for Nexus . In a video interview with VCCircle , CEO Sharad Sanghi talks on life after acquisition by NTT , global plans and mentoring startups . Edited excerpts : <p> Netmagic has undergone a decade of business evolution , where is the company today and what is the market like in which it is competing ? <p> The datacentre market along with Cloud technology is one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gartner has analysed this market growing north of 30 per cent , while Cloud as an **27;228;TOOLONG ( IaaS ) is growing much higher than 100 per cent . And the overall size of the datacentre market is now between $600-700 million . We see tremendous opportunity in this space and right now we are growing faster than the market . In fact , this was the major reason why NTT had done this deal with us . One point I want to make clear here is that it is NTT Communications and not NTT Data that has done the deal with us . NTT Communications is one of the largest datacentre providers across the globe and they also have a very big Cloud offering . But they did n't have a presence in India . They came here , found the market hot and vibrant . Netmagic is already the largest IaaS company in India and so it was a natural fit . For Netmagic , it gives a global footprint , and so was a very synergistic deal . <p> There is now a global trend where datacentres @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rise . These are both big verticals for you . Does this trend affect your company in anyway ? <p> Customers have traditionally opted for co-location , but at the end of the day the Cloud infrastructure has to operate from a datacentre as well . The difference now is that while initially we were packing 20 to 30 servers in a rack and each server was a separate work load . Now , because of Cloud you can have 400 to 500 virtual machines in a single rack . So the revenue per square foot and the rack density has increased . But the need for datacentres is ever growing . The second point is that not everybody has adopted the Cloud . It will take a while . So while Cloud is the fastest growing business , it will take a while before various workloads move to the Cloud . There are some concerns about Cloud security . In my belief , Cloud is more secure than even physical infrastructure . But it will take time for Cloud adoption to increase . So it would be wrong to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forward , Cloud will become mainstream and grow faster . But there will be customers who want physical infrastructure , which will make the datacentre business grow strong . <p> Gartner calculates the current market size at $ 100-150 million for the Cloud market , out of which cloud IaaS business is about 40-50 per cent . I expect this market to double for the next couple of years . We have already captured a quarter of this IaaS market . <p> Is it right to say that IaaS business is more of a volume game compared to the SaaS model which is value game ? <p> Yes that 's right . IaaS is at the bottom of the IT value chain , while SaaS sits at the top . So moving upwards , the margins are higher , but at the bottom there is a sizable market . So the volumes are very high . Today , one of our biggest challenges even with respect to Cloud is making sure that the customer do n't run out of Cloud space and so the customer can increase space on demand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immense . Disaster recovery is another vertical which is rapidly growing . <p> What is Netmagic doing in this space to maintain higher redundancy and curb down time ? <p> We have been able to characterise ourselves by offering the highest amount of up time and offering the highest SLAs ( Service Level Agreements ) . There are two main factors when operating up time for datacentres . One is power and the other is connectivity . We 've designed our datacentre in a way in which there is no single point failure , so everything like a powergen or a UPS is redundant . Secondly , on connectivity , we are carrier neutral , so unlike a typical telco that uses one service provider , every datacentre has multiple carriers . Our primary operations centre is in Mumbai , while our largest disaster recovery noch is in Bangalore . So every datacenter we provide has a small noch , which means every datacenter can operate on its own but has space to be operated by either Mumbai or Bangalore . Whether it 's DRS ( disaster recovery systems ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now , disaster recovery is another fast growing space and Cloud technology has enabled that growth . While customers knew the benefits of it , now they have to do it for compliance . What used to happen is that if a customer wanted 1:1 redundancy enabled for Site A , we would have to create Site B. For such insurance , customers had to pay a 100 per cent premium . Since major disasters would occur once in two or three years , many CFOs would not make this a priority . So what they would ask for instead of 100 per cent redundancy was 50 per cent redundancy . To allocate physical infrastructure on demand for DRS is very difficult . But with Cloud technology being elastic , the customers pay per use infrastructure for DRS . So now thanks to the Cloud this disaster recovery is a space seeing lot of traction . <p> There are a lot of medium sized companies cropping up doing a lot of business in DRS . Is Netmagic looking to acquire or even partner such companies ? <p> We 've already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a focus area in the market . We partnered with a company called Netmonastery . I am a firm believer that we are not going to be able to do everything ourselves . <p> What is the next step of synergy with NTT , how are you going to roll out and cater to the business for NTT 's global customer base ? <p> India offers tremendous talent at very competitive rates . And so we are looking to offer remote infrastructure management for NTT 's global infrastructure from India . This is a huge market . This is where Infosys and all the Indian IT majors play . Second is we are going to be one of the major contributors to NTT 's global Cloud initiative . NTT has a global Cloud of its own , but eventually NTT and Netmagic will integrate it to make it one large Cloud and a lot of the major elements of technology in terms of software for this Cloud will be contributed by us . I am confident with NTT coming in , our growth is going to hasten , because now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far as high growth areas are concerned , I see huge opportunity for us in data connectivity in peripherals like DRS and more importantly in data security . The increasing amount of cyber attacks on customers makes this a space of opportunity for companies like us . We have already started providing security services in this space . To increase our bottomline , we have to increase automation . So even with NTT coming in , it is not like we are going to start hiring in a big way . We have added employees , but more automation should be our goal . <p> How does entry of NTT affect the MNC client base for Netmagic in India ? <p> We want to have a good mix of global to domestic customers . See today only customers targeting an audience in India will host in India . If you are targeting customers in the US you will host in the US . So while the bulk of our revenues are in Rupees , because we are targeting companies in India , a lot of them are MNCs like Barclays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offices in India . What NTT is bringing to us is the customers , where the decisions are made overseas . We have close to 1,200 customers with 80 per cent of them being in India . But in terms of revenues the gap would be 60-40 split . <p> What is the sort of ticket sizes and margins that we see in Netmagic 's primary verticals ? <p> In the Cloud business , the ticket sizes are smaller but in data co-location and datacentre business , the ticket sizes are much larger . With NTT coming in , the ticket sizes have more than doubled . In the IaaS industry , because of huge amount of depreciations , we have to consider gross margins which are close to 30- 50 per cent as compared to a SaaS model in which the margins are higher . <p> What is your advice to startups coming up in this space ? <p> There are lots of ups and downs . But you need to have a clear picture . You need to provide value . If you are strong in your convictions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am not saying do n't adapt , but I 've seen a lot of startups who move away from what they planned to come out with in the first place . So do n't lose focus of what you are providing . <p> What is the road ahead for you as we also see you as a mentor on GSF ? Are you looking to become more active as an angel investor ? <p> I have invested in companies before along with Sanjay Gaikwad of UFO Moviez . But my philosophy is that I do n't just want to invest in companies , in which I do n't understand the business model . I would like to be part of it and add some value . My aim is more to mentor and add value .

Way back in Babylonian times , around 2100 B.C. , the Code of Hammurabi was the first basic insurance policy . This policy was paid by the traders in the form of a loan to guarantee the safe arrival of their goods by caravan . Of course , caravans faced the same kind of perils our transportation industry faces today -- like robbery , bad weather and breakdowns .

The writings talk in terms of pooling of resources that could be re-distributed in times of calamities such as fire , floods , epidemics and famine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Ancient Indian history has preserved the earliest traces of insurance in the form of marine trade loans and carriers ' contracts . Insurance in India has evolved over time heavily drawing from other countries , England in particular . <p> 1818 saw the advent of life insurance business in India with the establishment of the Oriental Life Insurance Company in Calcutta . This Company however failed in 1834 . In 1829 , the Madras Equitable had begun transacting life insurance business in the Madras Presidency . 1870 saw the enactment of the British Insurance Act . In 1907 , the Indian Mercantile Insurance Ltd , was set up . This was the first company to transact all classes of general insurance business . In 1914 The government of India established publishing returns of Insurance Companies in India . Specifically in shipping India has undergone wide changes and a considerable expansion and it became mandatory to legislate it for smooth working and development of Indian Marine Insurance . <p> In India the law of marine insurance has been put in a statutory from since 1963 . Marine Insurance Act , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is " an Act to codify the law relating to marine insurance . " The canon of construction generally applicable to a codifying statute is well known : the language of the statute must be given its natural meaning , regard being had to the previous state of the law only in cases of doubt or ambiguity . Bank of England v Vagliano Brothers , ( 1891 ) A.C. 107 , 144 H.L. ( per Lord Herschell ) <p> Maritime or marine insurance covers the loss of or damage to a ship or boat , as well as the loss or breakage of cargo over water , land or air . Maritime insurance is essential for any ship owner or cargo business . Each country typically have their own laws dealing with insurance matters however , marine insurance is peculiar in that by the very nature of international marine transit there are common factors governing marine insurance across the world , expressed as ' over the seabed and the ocean floor ' <p> Admiralty Courts assume jurisdiction by virtue of the presence of a vessel being in its territorial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and/or whether registered in the specific country or not and wherever the residence or domicile or their owners may be . Some of the common primary aspects of marine insurance across the world are ; Seaworthiness of a Vessel , Limitation of Ship owner 's Liability , Personal injuries to passengers , Cargo Claims , Personal injuries to Seamen &amp; Maintenance and cure , Maritime Liens and Mortgages , Salvage and Treasure Salvage , Marine Pollution , War Risks , Terrorism &amp; Piracy . <p> Marine Insurance are contracts but despite of being a contract it does not apply the general principles of contract law .. Most of the law of marine insurance is in essence pure interpretation of the contract contained in the common form of marine policy . ( Section 22 , English Act of 1906 ) . The basic principle of a contract of insurance is that the indemnity recoverable from the insurer is the pecuniary loss suffered by the assured under the contract . Thus , as per the enactment , a contract of marine insurance is a contract whereby the insurer undertakes to indemnify the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , against marine losses , that is to say , the losses incident to marine adventure . Indian Marine Insurance Act , 1963 , Section 3 ( Section 1 , English Act of 1906 ) . <p> The formal instrument embodying the contract of marine insurance is called " the policy " ; and " the slip " or " covering note " , is the informal memorandum that is drawn up when the contract is entered into . The subject- matter insured and the consideration for the insurance are respectively known as " the interest insured " and " the premium " . The person who is indemnified is " the assured " and the other party is styled " the insurer " or " the underwriter " so called because he subscribes or underwrites the policy . " Loss " includes damage or detriment as well as actual loss of property arising from maritime perils . <p> In Richards v Forest Land , Timber and Railway Co . Ltd 1941 3 All ER 62 , HL , ( per Lord Wright ) it was observed , " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law of contracts- namely , those of marine insurance . Subject to various imperative provisions or prohibitions and general rules of the common law , the parties are free to make their own contracts and to exclude or vary the statutory terms . The object both of the legislature and of the courts has been to give effect to the idea of indemnity , which is the basic principle of insurance , and to apply it to the diverse complications of fact and law in respect of which it has to operate . In this way , the law merchant has solved or sought to solve , the manifold problems which have been presented by insurances of maritime adventures . " <p> A marine policy is only a promise of indemnity giving a right of action for unliquidated damages in case of non-payment . However , a contract of marine insurance must be embodied in a policy . Section 24 of the Indian Act4 enacts as follows : A contract of marine insurance is inadmissible in evidence unless it is embodied in a marine policy in accordance with this Act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time when the contract is concluded , or afterwards . By the Indian Stamp Act , 1899 , Section 7(1) , no contract for sea-insurance shall be valid unless the same is expressed in a sea policy . Accordingly , where the appellant had sued the respondent for damages for breach of a contract to issue policies of marine insurance upon goods to be shipped by it , it was held that the contract alleged was a contract of sea insurance and , not being expressed in a policy , was unenforceable . Surajmull Nagoremull v. Triton Insurance Co . Ltd. , ( 1924 ) L.R. 52 I.A. 126 , 129 ( per Lord Sumner ) . A marine policy , must also specify certain essential matters , and section 25 of the Indian Act ( Section 23 , English Act of 1906 ) enumerates them as follows : <p> The name of the assured , or of some person who effects the insurance on his behalf : <p> The subject matter insured and the risk insured against ; <p> The voyage , or period of time , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the insurance ; <p> The sum or sums insured ; <p> The name or names of the insurers . <p> A marine policy must be signed by or on behalf of the insurer ( Section 26 0f the Indian Act ) , and such policy may either be a " voyage " policy or a " time " policy or a combination of both . Where the contract is to insure the subject-matter " at and from " , or from one place to another or others , the policy is called a " voyage policy " , and where the contract is to insure the subject-matter for a definite period of time the policy is called a " time policy " : Indian Marine Insurance Act , 1963 , Section 27 ( = Section 25 , English Act of 1906 ) . <p> A contract of marine insurance is uberrimae fidie or , as enumerated in Section 19 of the Indian Marine Insurance Act , ' a contract based upon the utmost good faith . ' 49 The notion of utmost good faith , the cardinal principle governing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the celebrated case of Cater v. Boehm50 , decided long before the inception of the Act . With the codification of the law , the principle found expression in Sections 19-22 : In section 19 is presented the general duty to observe the utmost good faith , with the following sections introducing particular aspects of the doctrine , namely , the duty of the assured ( section 20 ) and the broker ( section 21 ) to disclosed material circumstances , and to provide making representations ( section 22 ) . Hodges , Susan , CASES AND MATERIALS ON MARINE INSURANCE LAW , Cavendish Publishing Limited , p. 213 . <p> Thus , the obligations to disclose and to abstain from misrepresentations constitute the most significant manifestations of the duty to observe utmost good faith . The only remedy available to the innocent party in case of any such breach is avoidance ab initio , that is , avoidance from the very beginning , even though the breach may have occurred during the course of the contract . Section 19 , by the use of the word ' either ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ observe utmost good faith operates on a bilateral basis . There is no doubt that the obligation to disclose material facts is a mutual one imposing reciprocal duties on insurer and insured . In case of marine insurance contracts , section 17 ( of the English Act ) in effect so provides Banque Financiere de la cite SA v. Westgate Insurance Co . Ltd. , 1987 1 Lloyd 's Rep 69 ; Good faith forbids either party , by concealing what he privately knows , to draw the other into a bargain : Cater v. Boehm , ( 1766 ) 3 Burr 1905 ( per Lord Mansfield ) . <p> In basic term there are three main type of Marine Insurance , P &amp; I Club , Hull and Machinery and Cargo . Hull and machinery insurance is to protect the ship owner 's investment in the ship . It is basically a property insurance which covers the ship itself , the machinery and equipment . The owner will be protected for losses caused by loss of or damage to the ship and its equipment . Furthermore , the insurance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( known as RDC -- " Running Down Clause " ) and sometimes also liability for colliding with other objects than another ship ( known as FFO - " Fixed and Floating Objects ) . Since the conditions vary , it is recommended that the Master finds out how the insurance is placed for the ship . Very often these liabilities are handled by the owner 's P&amp;I club . The third part of the insurance is cover for salvage and general average contributions . <p> Typical hull and machinery claims include : Total loss of the ship , Damage to the ship , engines and equipment , Explosions and fires , Groundings -- damage to the ship , salvage of the ship and possible contribution in general average , Collisions -- damage sustained to the ship and sometimes also liability towards the other ship ( RDC ) and Striking other objects -- damage inflicted to own ship and sometimes also liability towards the owners of the other object ( FFO ) . The hull and machinery cover will include a " Trading Warranty " , clause stipulating where the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any trading agreement in any charter party . It is important to check these trading limits as a breach may jeopardize the cover . Life saving is normally accepted even if trading limits are breached . <p> Hull and machinery cover is often arranged and placed in the insurance market by a professional insurance broker . It is quite common that the insurance cover is spread to many insurers in various countries . The insurers in the hull and machinery market are either companies or syndicates . The company or the syndicate will have an underwriter who signs the policy or the slip produced by the broker for his share of the cover . The biggest single market for marine insurance is Lloyd 's in London . Lloyd 's consists of a number of syndicates writing shares on insurance covers . There are many cover which Hull and Machinery insurance covers few of which are <p> War Insurance . The Hull and Machinery , and most other marine insurance covers , exclude any loss , damage or liability due to war or warlike situations ( i.e. civil commotion , terrorism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called " Listed Areas " ) where trading may be restricted or subject to additional premium . <p> Loss of Hire Insurance . To protect a loss of a charter hire or freight income many owners elect to purchase a loss of hire cover Depending on the conditions , the cover may include slow steaming as a result of a physical damage to the ship . The cover may also include time lost due to deviation to a repair yard . Correct and accurate log entries are therefore important in such situations . <p> Cargo Insurance is that where the owners of cargo , which is to be transported by sea , usually cover their financial exposure against loss of , or damage to cargo for declared value . Cargo insurance is provided byte Syndicates at Lloyd 's but more commonly by professional insurance companies around the world . They keep records of their losses and use this information to help them calculate premiums for insurance of certain types of cargo in varying kinds of marine transportation , i.e. in bulk , packaged , containerized , refrigerated , chilled , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ owner of the cargo for any loss or damage to the cargo Thereafter they may claim compensation for their loss from the carriers of the cargo . <p> P&amp;I stand for Protection and Indemnity . P&amp;I is insurance in respect of third party liabilities and expenses arising from owning ships or operating ships as principals . It is a ship owner 's insurance cover for legal liabilities to third parties . P&amp;I insurance are usually arranged by entering the ship in a mutual insurance association , usually referred to as a " club " . Ship-owners are members of such clubs . Legal liability is decided in accordance with the laws of the country where an accident takes place . The P&amp;I insurance cover for contractual liability is agreed at the time the owner requests insurance cover from the club and is usually in accordance with the owner 's responsibility under crew contracts or special terms relating to the trading pattern of the vessel . <p> Both P&amp;I Clubs and conventional marine insurers are governed by the provisions of the Marine Insurance Act 1906 . Marine insurers provide cover for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ship-owners , and Cargo Insurance for cargo owners . By contrast , P&amp;I Clubs provide insurance cover for broader indeterminate risks , such as third party liabilities that marine insurers are loath to cover . Third party risks include a carrier 's liability to a cargo-owner for damage to cargo , a ship 's liability after a collision , environmental pollution and war risk insurance ; ( although some marine insurers are also prepared to cover war risks ) . <p> The development of P&amp; I Club was considerably faster . Eventually P&amp; I Club were consisting remote descendants of the many small hull insurance . Clubs that were formed by British ship-owners in the 18th century . These were set up by groups of ship-owners , drawn in each case from a small geographical area . Until the early part of the 19th Century , the insurance industry had not felt it appropriate or necessary to offer any additional insurance to cover risks other than the cargo on board and the ship itself . <p> However , the situation was changed by a Judgment given by the English Court @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vaux v Salvador ' . The Judges ruled in this case that an ordinary policy against perils of the sea does not cover damage done to another vessel by collision . That exposed ship-owners insured under the traditional hull policies to enormous potential liabilities for which they were uninsured . The ship owners could not bear such new risk therefore they approached their Hull underwriters and requested a amendment to cover the new risk . However the ship owners will still not satisfied with their position and thus they wanted to seek more comprehensive ' protection ' from somewhere else to ensure that their business could be developed in a healthy way . This is the most obvious factor leading to the creation of the early protecting clubs . <p> In the mean time , other liabilities toward third parties were also more and more frequently imposed upon ship-owners . For example , after the application of Lord Campbell 's Act of 1846 , the injured crew members and the dependants of crew members who were killed were entitled to seek compensation from their employers . And also , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harbour authorities to recover the damage done to port property by a ship from the ship-owners , whether there was any negligence or not , etc . <p> In order to provide the ship-owners with a solution to alleviate those new burdens , Mr. Peter Tindall , an insurance broker and ex-manager of hull insurance clubs , set up the first ' Protection Club ' , the Ship-owners ' Mutual Protection Society in 1855 . The framework and system of existing hull clubs were adopted and the risks covered by that first ' Protection Club ' were limited to liabilities for loss of life , personal injury , property damage and the risk of running down other vessels which is not covered by the ordinary hull policies . At the time when protection club was firstly introduced to shipping industry , cargo claim were still not a serious burden for the ship-owners . Ship-owners were always able to take advantage of an unusual anomaly of the law that existed to avoid being responsible for any cargo damage . <p> However , again , the position was changed by a case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the vessel was carrying a cargo bound for Cape Town but proceeded instead first to Port Elizabeth and then was lost off the coast . The court decided that the ship-owner were not protected by the exceptions in the contract of carriage due to committing a deviation and held that they were liable for full value of the cargo . Following the incident , the ship-owners very nervous about the new risk and thus Mr. Mitcalfe who was an underwriter on the request of ship owner formed a new club in 1874 providing insurance to these potential cargo liabilities , called ' Indemnity Club ' . <p> The functions of ' Indemnity Club ' and ' Protection Club ' are similar in nature and the only thing different is the scope of risks covered . Thus there was no issue in combining the two clubs and save cost and also improve claim efficiency . Consequently , the first ' P&amp;I Club ' was formed by amalgamation of an ' Indemnity Club ' and a ' Protection Club ' in 1886 , providing a very comprehensive cover on ship-owners ' liability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( " RDC " ) , for example when the member 's ship is in collision with another ship , or when the entered ship strikes a fixed object , i.e. a quay , dock or buoy ( " FFO " ) . However , collision and striking liabilities are often included in the ship 's hull and machinery cover , for instance under the Norwegian Insurance Plan . Therefore , it is important for a Master to ascertain whether his vessel 's collision insurance ( collision between ships ) and striking insurance ( i.e. when a ship strikes a fixed or floating object which is not another ship ) is covered under his P&amp;I policy or under his hull and machinery policy . To be safe , it is always wise for a Master to inform the P&amp;I club , or the club correspondent , if his vessel is in collision with another vessel or a fixed object . <p> P&amp;I insurance covers an owner 's liability for all deaths , personal injuries and illnesses which occur on board , including death or injury to crew , passengers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insurance also cover a ship owner 's liability to pay for the costs of repatriating crew members who become sick or are injured onboard . The insurance also covers the crew 's hospital bills and costs offending replacement personnel to the ship if necessary . <p> P&amp;I insurance also covers the owner 's liability for loss of crew belongings in cases of shipwreck or fire on board . The cover only applies to items which are deemed to be reasonable for any crewmember to have with him on board . A crew member traveling with unusually expensive items , such as laptop computers , gold watches etc should make sure that he has such items separately insured . <p> One of the major functions of Protection and Indemnity insurance is to cover a ship-owner or the charterer of a ship , for liability for loss of , or damage to , cargo if there has been a breach of the contract of carriage . This breach of contract usually means that something has happened to the cargo while it was on board the ship or being loaded or discharged , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , i.e. shortage or damage to the cargo . The P&amp;I club will usually take over the handling of such claims on behalf of the assured . <p> Other risks covered include liability for stowaways , liability for oil pollution and other types of pollution and legal liability for wreck removal if the ship sinks and is blocking free navigation for other vessels . In short , P&amp;I insurance is a very comprehensive type of insurance cover which makes it easier for a ship-owner or charterer to trade in international shipping transportation . P&amp;I is as important to a prudent ship-owner as his Hull and Machinery insurance cover . Passenger claims are also included in P&amp; I Clubs . <p> Mutual P&amp; I insurance mean that the members of the club are its owners and share in its results . Therefore premiums are also mutual and estimated for a given policy year and finally decided when the year is closed which is minimum ( but also normally ) three years later . Premiums are therefore referred to as " calls " . An Estimated Total Call is calculated for any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the full Estimated Total Call or divided into Advance and Supplementary Calls . The benefit of charging Estimated Total Call the first policy year is that the member may be able to fully budget his costs . Before the policy year is finally closed , the club can decide to cover the claims and to charge an Additional Supplementary Call . There as on why accounts are kept open is that cases continue to develop and could over time become more , or less , expensive than initially anticipated . <p> The marine insurance has also certain risk involved which is covered to some extent by insurance like Barratry of Master Officers or Crew it means that the master , officers or crew of a vessel may commit an unlawful act that results in a loss to the owner of the vessel . Smuggling would be an example of barratry , Collision A risk for vessels at sea is that two or more vessels may collide . This can happen in adverse weather conditions , such as fog , and in busy shipping lanes , Deliberate Damage by Government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , such as an oil spill . <p> P&amp;I is a special type of marine insurance . It is a liability insurance that a prudent ship owner , manager or charterer needs , particularly if the ship is employed in international trade . P&amp;I insurance cover a ship-owner or charterer for liabilities and losses in direct connection with the operation of the ship . <p> The purpose of marine insurance has been to enable the ship owner and the buyer and seller of goods to operate their respective business while relieving themselves , at least partly , of the burdensome financial consequences of their property 's being lost or damaged as a result of the various risks of the high seas . Marine insurance is quite an old insurance term which is meant to cover the loss pertaining to shipment ; ship etc .

@@1265232 <h> Mahindra 's Aston Martin bid : An aspirational transaction <p> There 's no official word on it yet , but the corporate grapevine is abuzz with talk of a reported bid by Indian auto giant Mahindra for iconic British luxury carmaker Aston Martin , the preferred automobile of James Bond . <p> There 's a complete clampdown on information from all fronts but news reports say the Indian automobile company has put in a bid for 50 percent of Aston Martin , and is locked in a bidding war with Italian private equity fund InvestIndustrial which has also declined to comment on these reports . <p> Overdrive.com <p> Investment Dar , the Kuwaiti owner , has also denied evaluating two offers for the sale , and a Mahindra spokesperson merely told Firstpost that as a matter of policy , the company does not comment on ' speculative stories ' . <p> However , Reuters reports on 27 November that talks are continuing and a deal could even be struck by this week . <p> Whatever the exact position , the Rs 35,000 crore Mahindra is now in the spotlight with this reported bid , valued at anywhere around $400 million , though questions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the provocation for a company which is primarily an SUV maker and a tractor manufacturer to buy into a company like Aston Martin . <p> Wondering whether , bravery apart , the move made any sense , a report in Financial Times even quoted an unnamed industry analyst as saying it would be a ' stupid move ' if the Indian company were to go through with it . The Reuters report also quoted senior analysts saying they did not see synergies in a possible deal . <p> But not everyone seems to share this view . In fact , some senior fund managers suggest that while the Aston Martin bid could be an aspirational transaction for the light commercial vehicle maker Mahindra , there are also benefits to be had from such a deal . <p> " M&amp;M did turn around Ssangyong successfully after taking it over . This has given it a large brand and access to technology . Similarly , the Aston Martin bid is aspirational but can bring in a lot of learnings for Mahindra , " said Sudhir Dash , managing director of UK-based specialist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out that even when Tata acquired British carmaker Jaguar Land Rover ( JLR ) , it was seen to be an ailing brand and critics questioned the move . But JLR has since turned into a money-spinner and has even drawn up big plans for China .

While giving this important judgement , Shailesh Gandhi , former Central Information Commissioner , also disagreed with the decision of the then Chief Information Commission . <p> " The SC Rules as well as the RTI Act co-exist and therefore , it is for the citizen to determine which route s/he would prefer for obtaining the information .

Mr Misra , then approached the Commission . <p> Mr Gandhi , in his order said that it is legally established that information requested for under the RTI Act may be exempted from disclosure in accordance with Sections 8 and 9 only and no other exemptions can be claimed while rejecting a demand for disclosure . <p> Section 22 of the RTI Act expressly provides that the provisions of the RTI Act shall have effect notwithstanding anything inconsistent therewith contained in the Official Secrets Act , 1923 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or in any instrument having effect by virtue of any law other than the RTI Act . <p> " In other words , where there is any inconsistency in a law as regards furnishing of information , such law shall be superseded by the RTI Act . Insertion of a non-obstante clause in Section 22 of the RTI Act was a conscious choice of the Parliament to safeguard the citizens ' fundamental right to information from convoluted interpretations of other laws adopted by public authorities to deny information , " Mr Gandhi said . <p> The Commission said , " Merely because Order XII of the SC Rules provide for a mechanism by which certain information may be obtained by the applicant , does not mean that the citizen can not exercise her right to obtain the same information by taking recourse to the RTI Act ( subject always to the provisions of Sections 8 and 9 of the RTI Act ) " . <p> Order XII of the SC Rules provides inter alia : <p> " 1 .

Under Rule 2 , in order to determine what is ' good cause ' , it is necessary to enquire into the purpose/ reasons for which an applicant is seeking information . This is clearly violative of the statutory mandate of Section 6(2) of the RTI Act . " <p> Citizens would have to justify any request for information by demonstrating ' good cause ' under Rule 2 and the ultimate decision whether information should be provided or not would lie with the court .

( Casting director ) Dolly Thakore knew me as I was working in Marathi theatre . She told me that Richard Attenborough was coming to town , and was looking to cast Kasturba 's role . She asked me to go meet him . I did , and got selected for the screen test . <p> I was asked to lose weight , as I was to play Kasturba from the ages of 27 to 74 .

I was not sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of actors in the running -- Bhakti Barve and John Hurt , Smita Patil and Naseeruddin Shah and Ben Kingsley and me . <p> After I returned to Mumbai , I thanked Dolly , as she had worked really hard to get me to London .

In fact , she came along with me to the passport office to get the work done . <p> Working with Sir Richard was a different experience . We were supposed to do our homework . We joined the unit in Delhi about 15 , 20 days before the shoot started . We got the script when we reached so that we could study it . <p> I took elocution lessons as I came from a vernacular school in Pune . I did not know much English .

' <p> So I told him if he is eating , the best thing to do would be making rotis . <p> He gave us a free hand , but we had to discuss with him first . <p> Sir Richard knew Gandhiji 's life thoroughly . If there was any confusion in dates or events , he would give the reply immediately . <p> All of us went through different trainings . Just like I needed elocution lessons , Ben Kingsley had to take on yoga classes . He had had a hip injury in his childhood because of which he could not sit on the floor with his legs folded . But since Gandhiji used to sit on the floor , he had to practice it . <p> Plus , we both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would practice for two hours every day .

So I did , and I gave the handkerchief to Sir Richard as my Christmas gift . <p> We shot for five months -- we started on November 22 , 1980 , and finished in May 1981 .

After all , Jinnah was one of the best dressed men during the British regime in India . <p> I started preparing for the role by studying everything about him . As I went along , I found that he was a man of tremendous intelligence and was a great orator . Before he came to India , he was working as a barrister in London . <p> He was also the president of the Indian National Congress in 1916 , much before Gandhi 's arrival . <p> The shooting went on smoothly .

Richard Attenborough was a friend of a friend of mine from London , and they walked into my house in May or April 1979 . <p> I had a wall full of theatre photographs . Richard walked in and saw that , and he said , ' You are my casting director .

@@1272235 <h> IK Gujral , the good guy of politics <p> The Punjabis who came to Delhi after Partition tended to be entrepreneurial . Many went on to become millionaires , amassing large fortunes and forever changing the character of India 's capital . What made Inder Gujral different was that he chose to use his considerable talents not to make money but to make a name for himself . <p> At a time when middle-class intellectuals were reluctant to venture into politics , Gujral bravely took the plunge . He was never a mass politician nor did he have an electoral base . But so successful was he at leveraging his talents that he went on to serve in senior cabinet posts under three different Prime Ministers before , in one of the most incredible twists in Indian political history , briefly becoming Prime Minister himself . <p> Gujral 's initial rise had more to do with circumstances than with any political manoeuvring . In 1966 , when Indira Gandhi became Prime Minister , she set up a Kitchen Cabinet consisting of friends and advisors who shared a vaguely Left-wing point of view . These advisors were well-spoken , well-read , and generally , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Kitchen Cabinet 's members remained out of politics : Romesh Thapar stayed out of the frame , restricting himself to journalism . <p> Some remained civil servants : PN Haksar was once India 's most powerful man but he never sought political office . <p> Only Inder Gujral decided that he wanted to be a minister . Mrs Gandhi duly obliged and Gujral rose to becoming information and broadcasting minister ( a far more powerful position in that era than it is today ) and one of the Cabinet 's most high profile faces . <p> But when your power derives from one source , it is all too easy for things to go wrong . In Gujral 's case , the catalyst for change was Mrs Gandhi 's thug-like younger son , Sanjay . Shortly after the Emergency was declared , Sanjay summoned Gujral and admonished him for failing to properly project the government . <p> " Yeh sab nahin chalega , " Sanjay is supposed to have told him . <p> According to Gujral , he replied , " Yeh bilkul chalega . " <p> Like many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sanjay grow up and could not believe that the young man would dare talk to him so rudely . He was convinced that Mrs Gandhi would tell her son off for his uncivil behaviour . In fact , she told Gujral off . And then she sent him off . He was sacked as I&amp;B minister and packed off to an Ambassadorial posting . <p> This happened in 1975 and by all rights , Gujral 's career should have ended there given that he was a man without a base , entirely dependent on Mrs Gandhi 's patronage . It is a tribute to his resilience that 14 years later , after Mrs Gandhi and Sanjay had both died , Gujral returned to the cabinet in a post that was even more senior : external affairs minister . <p> How he got the job in VP Singh 's government remains something of a mystery . The most commonly accepted explanation is that VP Singh had relatively few followers ( his was a minority government ) , most of whom had no interest in urban affairs , let alone international affairs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the first day , he was a misfit in the government . He was routinely derided by VP Singh 's more rustic colleagues and matters came to a head when Devi Lal , the second-most powerful man in the Cabinet , told an interviewer that the government had too many effete and ineffectual ministers such as Gujral . <p> That phase ended in 1990 , with the collapse of the VP Singh government . But Gujral did not give up . In 1996 , he was back as external affairs minister in HD Deve Gowda 's government and when Gowda was forced out , Gujral put himself forward as a compromise candidate for the top job . He got it and remains one of the unlikeliest Prime Ministers in Indian history . <p> What accounted for Gujral 's resilience ? Some of it had to do with his intelligence and determination . But he also owed his success to his fundamental decency . He was never accused of any kind of dishonesty , let alone financial corruption . He was pleasant , always warm , and eager to hug @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrong ? " he asked an interviewer . " I like hugging . It is my style . " ) <p> In the complicated world of coalition politics , his warmth , decency and lack of a political base became both advantages and weaknesses . <p> They were an advantage because nobody saw him as a threat and , therefore , he was always the obvious compromise candidate . But they were also weaknesses because his colleagues routinely derided him , sometimes to his face . When he was Prime Minister , for instance , he was continually humiliated by Sharad Yadav 's public rudeness . <p> What will Gujral 's legacy be ? It is hard to say . He had hoped to usher in a new era in foreign policy , propounding the Gujral Doctrine and hoping to improve relations with Pakistan . ( This is a familiar preoccupation when it comes to Punjabi Prime Ministers of a certain age . ) His most famous and perhaps most notorious initiative in this area was the decision to ask R&amp;AW to suspend all covert operations in Pakistan . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But he did not want India to fund secessionists or arm militants . To this day , Gujral remains a much-reviled figure within the intelligence community which accuses him of causing the destruction of networks built up over years . <p> By the end , however , Gujral had become more pragmatic in his attitude towards Pakistan . For instance , when president Musharraf arrived in Delhi , on his way to Agra , for a summit with AB Vajpayee , Gujral took offence at Musharraf 's manner ( " he is talking as though he can dictate terms to us " ) and presciently forecast the collapse of the summit . <p> But his real legacy may be one that he had never intended to bestow upon future generations . His career demonstrated that even within the cesspool of Indian politics , it is possible for a decent human being with no political base to rise to the top . And as Gujral proved again and again , a good man is hard to keep down even when he has no electoral muscle behind him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @

Aeroplanes were small , flew limited distances , and were n't considered all that safe : You were considered brave and rather dashing if you flew a plane . <p> In 1919 , a hotelier , Raymond Orteig , offered $25,000 ( around 335,000 in today 's dollars ) to the first aviator to fly non-stop from New York to Paris ( or the other way around ) . There were no challengers in the five years it was on offer . When Orteig renewed it in 1924 , there were a number of efforts to claim it . The man who eventually won it , Charles Lindberg , made his flight in 1927 , flying solo ( that was n't required by the prize , but he wanted to keep the weight down ) , with maps and charts , five sandwiches , drinking water and little else . He landed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' took off : He had caught the world 's imagination , proving that this seemingly impossible thing could be done . <p> The Orteig prize , and many other similar prizes offered during those early years of flight , helped create today 's multi-billion dollar aviation industry . <p> The X Prize was inspired by and modelled after the Orteig prize . In 1996 , it offered $10 million to the first non-government entity to build and launch a spacecraft capable of carrying three people to 100 kilometres above the earth 's surface , twice within two weeks . It was officially renamed the Ansari X Prize in 2004 , after wealthy Iranian-American telecom entrepreneurs Anousheh Ansari and Amir Ansari made a multi-million dollar donation to the prize . ( Anousheh Ansari , incidentally , was the first female ' space tourist , ' paying $20 million for a 12-day round-trip to the International Space Station in 2006 . ) Twenty-six teams from seven countries competed for the prize , spending more than $100 million between them , the X Prize website says , and since it was won @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Composites .

The foundation 's mission is to " bring about radical breakthroughs for the benefit of humanity . " By devising and managing a set of high-value ( and high-profile ) prizes , it aims to meet the ' grand challenges ' that face our world . The foundation has many prizes in various stages of development , and among those already on offer are a $10 million genomics prize , a $2.5 million Nokia Sensing prize aimed at stimulating development of sensors that can be used in health care , and a $30 million prize from Google for the first privately funded team to send a robot to the moon . <p> And for the first time , there will soon be a country-specific prize , the X Prize India .

@@1286236 <p> tarting with the creation of beer over 7,000 years ago , human sleep aids have all worked the same way : By stimulating brain receptors that turn off brain cells . Newer drugs like Valium , Halcion and the bestseller Ambien are all just improvements on this ancient mechanism . <p> Now John Renger , a sleep researcher at Merck , thinks his team has created the ? rst new way in millennia to help people get their z 's . <p> Merck has done studies in almost 3,000 patients comparing Renger 's pill , suvorexant , with a placebo . The drug helps patients get to sleep perhaps 10 minutes faster and stay asleep 20 minutes longer -- not that far out of line with existing therapies and not that much of a marketing advantage . <p> But there are tantalising signs as the Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) prepares to review suvo-rexant that this drug may be fundamentally different from current sleeping pills like Ambien , Lunesta and Sonata , lacking their rare but troubling side effects , like memory loss and sleepwalking . <p> " What we 've done here is really turn the medical approach to insomnia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the ? rst time in our history we are beginning to understand how the brain controls sleep and waking . Showing that blocking wakefulness allows patients to go to sleep more quickly and to sleep throughout the night , it 's really a sea change . " Renger 's boss , Merck Senior Vice President Darryle Schoepp , calls this " some of the most exciting science I 've ever been involved in " . <p> But if this seems like a clear big pharma success story -- creating a breakthrough pill in one of the most- prescribed categories ever -- think again . Analysts doubt suvorexant can make a dent now that Ambien , which was prescribed 39 million times last year , is a cheap generic that costs under $2 per pill , 21 percent of the price of branded sleep drugs . Mark Schoenebaum at ISI Group , a fan of Merck shares , forecasts suvorexant sales of just $350 million in 2016 , only 0.8 percent of Merck 's sales that year . <p> What happens if new medicines for common ailments like insomnia ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sales by volume are for cheap generics and where health insurers and government plans alike are increasingly worried about costs ? <p> Most of Merck 's rivals have voted already , moving toward premium-priced areas like cancer and autoimmune disease . Merck is continuing not only in insomnia but also heart disease and diabetes . <p> The sleeping pill market is par- ticularly ripe for innovation . When Ambien was launched in 1992 , Time was running a story , ' The Dark Side of Halcion ' , which raised a slew of questions about whether the sleeping pill was addictive and dangerous . When the Drug Enforcement Agency classi ? ed Ambien as less addictive than Halcion , sales hit $1.8 billion by 2005 before the patent expired . <p> Now it 's Ambien 's turn . In 2001 Peter Buck , the guitarist of the socially responsible jangle-pop band R.E.M. , went crazy on a British Airlines ? ight and nearly went to jail ; he was saved partly by the defence that Ambien had caused his behaviour . In 2006 Patrick Kennedy , driving on Ambien , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thereafter the FDA added warnings to Ambien 's label saying that the drug did indeed make people go for drives without remembering what they had been doing . <p> Image : Ambien , Ambien CR , lunesta : Getty Images <p> Doctors and regulators say these effects are rare , but the reports keep coming . A story this September in Marie Claire documented cases where sleep-driving on Ambien resulted in DUI arrests -- or in drivers escaping vehicular manslaughter charges because they had taken the drug . <p> Why might suvorexant be better ? All the older drugs turn on brain switches called GABA receptors , present in half of the 1 billion neurons in the brain , causing whole-head drowsiness . Instead , suvorexant turns off a different set of switches , known as orexin receptors , which are involved in waking people up and are only present in 70,000 neurons in a particular place in the brain . <p> These orexin cells were discovered from the study of narcolepsy , a disease in which people can not stay awake , in the late 1990s by a Stanford @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defective orexin receptor gene developed the condition . In humans narcolepsy is an autoimmune disorder that destroys the orexin neurons . Merck is one of a handful of drug companies to try to turn this insight into a sleep drug . <p> Suvorexant does have critics . Daniel F Kripke , a doctor at Scripps Research Institute points out that of 521 patients who took the drug in a safety study , two had forms of sleep paralysis , which can be a symptom of narcolepsy . Merck says the real severe paralysis that occurs with the disease has not occurred in its trials . <p> Mignot says he is " not as worried " as Kripke : " It is always good for patients to have a new drug that works completely differently . " <p> But in an age where cost contain-ment is the dominant issue in medicine , better drugs just may not be as profitable as they used to be . <p> " It 's a theoretically huge market , " Schoenebaum says .

P. Krishnakumar , N. N. Rimson , Alex Mathew , Prabhakaran , K. M. Madhusudhanan , Akitham Vasudevan .

" <p> Initially , the group reacted to some of the Government policies that made the future of art students look bleak . The Radicals were upset about the growing capitalist tendencies in the art world . They observed that the function of art was being diluted for the sake of vested interests .
