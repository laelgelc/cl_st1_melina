The concept of haute cuisine continues to evolve in embracing a wider , more progressive gamut of gourmet experiences , making room for a new generation of culinary renegades and providing a refreshing shift away from the mainstream . <p> This is especially evident in Asia 's culinary capitals , where a maturing breed of patrons is savouring the attention to detail on those oft-overlooked essentials that go into delivering a truly memorable meal . And do n't think these are merely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sounds during your seafood course .

However , the dish was n't created as a novelty ; in fact , eating bee larva is a long-held Japanese tradition , particularly in the mountainous regions .

" Pigs eat leftover food and roll in the mud , while bees on the other hand eat honey and pollen , and fly around flowers . " <p> He points out that diners today are more focused on how the animals they consume are raised and how their vegetables are grown . " From that point of view , bee larva is nicely raised and is part of the Japanese food culture , " he shares . " Above all , it 's tasty .

Desert locales , which are replete with dramatic scenery like shifting sand dunes and swooping hawks , are growing in popularity as an off-the-beaten-track travel destination for luxury globetrotters . <p> From the dunes of Morocco to glamp sites in Dubai , an increasing number of travellers are gravitating towards adventures in sandy destinations , Further afield , the deadly ( but gorgeous ) Danakil Depression in Ethiopia , as well as the alluring Atacama desert in Chile , are drawing the jet-set crowd . <p> " Travellers are looking for more experiential travel opportunities , in order to gain an authentic experience of a country that delves into the culture , history and the landscape of a place , " said travel agency Scott Dunn 's Middle Eastern destination expert Emilie Mounier . <p> " And nowadays , travellers are looking to escape the stresses of everyday life and holiday to off-the-beaten-track deserts . A desert holiday allows guests to view a contrast of a country , for instance from the Middle East 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Amman , to the arid landscape of the desert . " <p> For Asians who live in all these concrete jungles packed with skyscrapers , it is the emptiness and simplicity of life in the desert that draws people in . <p> One of the reasons desert holidays are having a moment right now is thanks to the push by Middle Eastern countries to attract more tourists during a time of low oil prices . <p> In September , ultra-conservative Muslim country Saudi Arabia announced the launch of a new visa system to attract more foreign travellers to the country . While visitors will still have to follow " modest " dress codes and alcohol remains banned in the country , the government has relaxed various other social codes to target leisure tourists . <p> An estimated 250 billion riyals ( S$90.6 billion ) of investments into tourism infrastructure , which will include 500,000 new hotel rooms by 2030 , is expected to be spent by the government and private investors . <p> " Popular activities are those that allow guests to discover the expansive deserts , with experiences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soaring high above the Wadi Rum in Jordan , trekking through the vast deserts of Jordan and Oman or horseback riding in the Namib desert . For active travellers , we can arrange for sandboarding -- for instance when visiting Oman 's Wahiba Sands , " said Mounier . <p> A desert holiday allows guests to view a contrast of a country , for instance from the Middle East 's bustling and cosmopolitan cities of Oman 's Muscat and Jordan 's Amman , to the arid landscape of the desert . <p> There is already a network of luxury resorts in the Middle East to check out , including unique bedouin style accommodation . Some of the most sought-after options among the jet set are glamping outposts Hud Hud and Canvas Club in Oman and the Bespoke Hideaway Discovery Bedu Camp in Jordan 's Wadi Rum , said Mounier . Next spring , Six Senses Shaharut is slated to open in Negev 's Desert , Israel . <p> Vladislav Doronin , chairman and CEO of Aman , said , " Many of our existing Aman destinations are located in areas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ committed to preserving this archaeological wonder with our resorts that will blend into the dramatic surroundings . As part of Aman 's pathfinder spirit , we have a continued mission not only to curate resorts of architectural distinction , but to seek out and introduce our guests to new destinations and experiences . " <p> For travellers seeking a different experience , the 22,561 sq . km region of Al Ula comprises lush oasis valleys and towering sandstone mountains . This is also where Hegra , a Unesco World Heritage Site , where some 100 tombs with elaborate facades cut from the sandstone outcrops surround this ancient walled city , is located . With luxury hotels setting up in this remote region , it is likely that more travellers will be enticed to make the trek here to see this cultural landmark for themselves . <p> On the other side of the planet in Latin America and Africa , sandscapes have long been a huge draw for the intrepid .

An up and coming region is Ennedi in northern Chad , which is the " most beautiful section of the Sahara Desert " , Cortes added . <p> Over in Latin America , the high altitude altiplano in Bolivia and the Puna Desert in northern Chile and Argentina are big draws . In these regions , travellers get to go camel- and horse-riding , take an exhilarating spin on quad bikes , and indulge in desert glamping and stargazing . <p> A2A 's bookings for desert trips have increased significantly in the last two years -- bookings to Africa have increased by 20 per cent while in Latin America , they have jumped five times , said Cortes . it makes sense that Asian travellers are drawn to the vastness of the desert and are willing to travel further ashore to experience the otherworldly beauty of these sandscapes , he observed . <p> " For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skyscrapers , it is the emptiness and simplicity of life in the desert that draws people in .

Served with trays of sconces , small pastries and an aromatic selection of teas , our midday delight seems so quaint and so remarkably English , if not for the atypical weather we 're enjoying . Dubbed The Coaling Jetty , this spot on the barge also plays host to a variety of activities including outdoor yoga sessions and festive events throughout the year , set against the distinctive tall chimneys of Battersea Power Station . <p> The power station has been a distinctive part of the skyline this side of London since its construction in the early 20th century . Giles Gilbert Scott 's masterpiece combined the functional needs of the facility with art deco-influenced details that turned the industrial space into a notable architectural landmark . The present-day Tate Modern ( housed in a power station also designed by Scott ) shows a glimpse of the voluminous sense of space that the Battersea Power Station will have as a mixed-use development .

" What we 're trying to build is a new town centre in London , " says Simon Murphy , CEO of Battersea Power Station Development Company . The former power station will serve as the heart of the neighbourhood located in the Nine Elms district ; the entire development ( including the nearby public areas , apartments as well as boutiques and lifestyle venues ) measures 17 hectares . <h> Such Great Heights <p> The restoration project is a monumental task , not only due to its grand scale ; it was in such a derelict state that much of the structure had to be reconstructed in a way that was also faithful to its original design . " It 's not a typical restoration project , it was already a very derelict space ; some of the walls had already collapsed and effectively very little ( remained ) inside the main building itself , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the project team . <p> The main aim of this project was to conserve the elements that could be retained while staying true to the building 's industrial roots . " We wanted to retain that sense of scale of the building and its industrial heritage , " shares Ricard . " We are also raising the existing quirkiness of the building . We do not want this building to look like a new building when it is completed . When people enter the building , they can see what it used to be and they can understand the complexity of its ( previous ) usage . " <p> The former power station will become a retail and lifestyle complex , with an extensive rooftop garden that 's open to the public <h> Better Together <p> Built in two parts , the structure comprises two turbine halls built in distinctly different styles . Turbine Hall A was first built in the 1930s and is an elaborate space filled with art deco influences ; whereas Turbine Hall B was constructed in a more austere style in the 1950s , shortly after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the golden era of electricity ; this part ( Turbine Hall A ) was really been designed as a monument to modernity and technology , " says Ricard . " Turbine Hall B is very beautiful for a different reason ; ( it had ) very utilitarian architecture of the ' 50s and was built very quickly in four to five years . " <p> A rendering of the interior of the power station <p> The firm wanted to celebrate the voluminous sense of space in both turbine halls . Glass-fronted shops are installed around the perimeter of the six storey-high central atrium to keep the views unblocked to show its full height as well as elements of its timeworn details . " At the south entrance , we exposed the full height and kept the decay of the facade as it is , " he explains . " We wanted to create that kind of magical moment , so that wherever you are in the building you will have a bit of a glimpse of the existing ( facade ) . We kept the middle ( the atrium ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allow for maximum view of the facade . " <p> The two original control rooms of the power station will also find a new purpose ; appearing like bandstands " suspended in the air " , these will serve as event spaces that overlook the atrium . These spaces also bear significance in recent film history : cinephiles will recognise Control Room A , which was the setting of a key scene in The King 's Speech . The rooftop of the turbine halls will also house a communal garden , while the luxury apartments are sited in ways that allow for some of the best views of the neighbourhood . <p> Another outstanding feature of the building is its double-level entrance which connects to the riverfront ; this is one of the first sights that greets pedestrians alighting from the soon-to-open Battersea station , built as part of the Tube 's Northern line extension . It features a staircase inspired by the Spanish Steps , the famed butterfly-like staircase in Rome , Italy that also provides an elegant transition to the public plaza ( named Malaysia Square after the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ challenges is that the connection to Nine Elms ( district ) is about one level below the river ; it 's effectively a full site slope , " says Ricard .

@@41644232 <h> Thanks ! <p> One of the signature elements -- and perhaps the most recognisable -- of British-Nigerian artist Yinka Shonibare 's works is his use of " African " batik . The cultural hybridity of the Indonesian wax-printed fabric , which was mass-produced in the Netherlands and later popularised in West Africa , offers an insight into his art , which explores colonialism and post-colonialism in the context of globalisation . <p> The theme is also central to his latest site-specific installation , Justice for All , at The Arts House 's Chamber . Part of this year 's Singapore Art Week , the exhibition held from January 13 to 30 draws upon the history and politics in relation to the building and offers a Singaporean reinterpretation of British sculptor F W Pomeroy 's Lady Justice ( 1906 ) , located on top of London 's Central Criminal Court , also known as The Old Bailey .

It is intended as a celebration of the hybridity of these influences . " While the monumental sculptural installation may be situated indoors , it will retain the dramatic impact of public sculpture . In the last decade , Shonibare has increasingly included public art into his artistic repertoire of painting , sculpture , photography , film and installation for he says " access to art is better explored within the public realm , not necessarily within an elitist artist setting ; that 's why it 's important to me that all kinds of people can experience my art " . <p> The artist is also dedicated to facilitating international artistic exchange and developing creative practices through artist residencies and international collaborations with his non-profit Guest .

YS The work is essentially about fairness and even-handedness without prejudice , which is signified by the metaphor of the scales . The sword symbolises judiciary power and authority . The significance of Pomeroy 's Lady Justice is to reference the historical ties between " old Singapore " as a British colony , and Singapore as an independent republic today . <p> What are you currently fascinated by and how is it influencing your work ?

Miguel Bernas , lead consultant at Timber Wolf Media said while this is prevalent , it is not " really " out of bounds . In his view , the onus in such instances not on Spotify ( or any other streaming platform ) but dependent on the artist . <p> " At the end of the day if a popular artist wanted to mobilise fans , what could a platform such as Spotify really do ? How can they tell if a stream was organic or artist-triggered ?

@@41656235 <h> FOLLOW US ON <h> Ad Space <h> Article <h> Tags <h> Author Details <h> Now following : JianHao Tan <p> What started out as a project with close friends blossomed into a seven-year career on YouTube for JianHao Tan . Today , he heads up two YouTube channels -- one named after him , JianHao Tan , and a gaming channel called NotGood Gamers . <p> He works with a versatile mix of lifestyle brands , government agencies and gaming clients and has created content with technology brands such as Microsoft , telcos such as Singtel and StarHub , banks such as DBS and OCBC , and lifestyle brands such as Garnier , Durex and CapitaLand Mall Asia . <p> In this edition of Now following , Tan sits down with Marketing to talk about his YouTube career , future plans and some of the most frustrating client relationships . <p> I first started my YouTube channel in 2010 having studied overseas in an international school . When I was 18 , I came back for about two years to do my national service . After that was done , I applied to private and public universities . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted to take on YouTube as a full time job . I started making videos more regularly in 2014 with my friends , but started my work with brands much earlier in late 2013 . <p> Marketing : What is your claim to fame ? <p> I would n't say I specialise in any type of topic as I tend to make videos which are more random in nature , and I do n't have a formula or style that I stick to . I think my channel is one of the few in Singapore which is able get involved in any kind of topic of my choosing . I can upload full-length videos , a short film or a one-minute video of just my dog and it would still be something which works . <p> Marketing : How would you describe your followers ? <p> My followers tend to fall between the ages of 13 to 35 years of age , according to what is seen on my analytics . <p> For the ones which fall into the 13 to 18 age group , despite not being the largest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loudest . These followers are the ones who are the most supportive ; from being present at every fan meet to being the ones who will scream for you at YouTube Fan Fest . They are also the ones who are there for you when you open a new store or launch a new product , and are really excited to see you . <p> On the other hand , the ones which fall in the 18 to 25 group tend to be a little shyer . They do watch and subscribe to your videos , but they are less likely to approach you in public , unless they are drunk and you see them in Zouk ( laughs ) . <p> Marketing : Which social media platform is your favourite ? <p> I would say YouTube due to my highest number of subscribers , and also because I see myself as a YouTuber rather than say an Instagram influencer . YouTube also ranks the highest for me in terms of engagement . <p> Personally I do n't find Facebook very helpful . It 's not something which is for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ age of 25 to complain about their working life , write long rants and promote themselves and ask for help and recommendations . That 's what I noticed Facebook is for . <p> Twitter used to be a place where I would interact with my fans and have conversations , but it is no longer the place where we talk now . <p> Even though it is not a platform which is used as often anymore , it is a platform which is still popular with Millennials . It is a great place for memes , GIFs and for things to go viral . It is also a great place to get news as users are really fast on the platform . <p> Meanwhile , my engagement on Instagram is really strong . Instagram is really brand friendly and it reaches out to those under 30 . <p> Marketing : Why do you think Instagram works well for you ? <p> I think I am consistent with my posts . I do n't try to be like every influencer who finds utmost importance in having great photos and making their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while , unless you are a beauty blogger . <p> If you are a YouTuber , people want to know you , who you are , what you do every day rather than how you look , along with nice photos of yourself -- because they can find those on Google or on a website . <p> And I think I get very personal on Instagram with my fans . I do n't necessarily reply each one of them but I make an effort to reply at least one or two in every post . I direct my posts at my followers and I ask questions to allow for engagement . <p> Marketing : What should brands consider before reaching out to influencers ? <p> The first thing brands need to do is consider an influencer 's target audience . They need to ask " Who do you want to target ? " Brands need to know who they are targeting first before deciding which platform they should be targeting consumers on . <p> For me personally , Instagram and YouTube are the two most effective social media platforms . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be high . For example , we can charge around SG$25,000 for one YouTube advert , whereas on Instagram , I charge SG$1,200 per photo and SG$3,000 per Instagram video . This is not inclusive of the ads clients might want to buy to boost the post -- which is completely up to them . <p> Marketing : How do you seamlessly integrate client products into your social channels ? <p> It is difficult to list a general process as every client is different . <p> I think the market is currently not well developed enough to have actual measures and processes in place . <p> Every client and brand has a different way of working . However , what many brands have in common is not knowing exactly what they want . It can get very frustrating because not only do they not know what they want , they do know what they do n't want . <p> It is very hard for us to work around it . Most of the time they give us an idea of what they would like to portray , we will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the concept then we will go ahead and write the full script . The collaborative process is not difficult . If you have a message and want to hire a YouTuber , just trust him/her . Otherwise , you are better off going to a PR agency , hiring a video production company , and doing the video the way you want it . <p> If you would like to trust the YouTuber ( and I am referring to the high calibre ones ) then trust him/her . The only exception you should make is when engaging a smaller , less-experienced YouTube content creators . This includes the ones who are still new and have only worked with two to three clients . They tend to get really excited , hence as a marketer you need to know how to manage them . Pay more attention and ask about their plans for the content they are creating . <p> I think it 's quite disrespectful of brands that go to YouTubers who have done brand collaborations for many years and dictate the process . We know what the public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know what should not be on YouTube . <p> Dictating , makes our role a difficult one and can drive us to not only lose motivation but also allow us to be less reluctant for the video to do well . For example , if I worked with a client and I have an idea and I get excited about it , but they try to dictate the process , I would be less encouraged to share or promote the video -- and will quickly upload another one soon . <p> Marketing : How often does this happen ? <p> Very often , I would say one in every three clients when it comes to YouTube . I do n't get as many issues for the other platforms . On the occasion that I do I would usually not be keen on working with them . <p> Once I know if a client is a certain negative one , I would put them on a blacklist and never work with them again . <p> Marketing:What are some of the challenges of being an influencer in Singapore ? <p> The audience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -- they are the most critical and demanding . For example , viewers demand for regular content but they expect zero ads . <p> They do n't care about how an influencer earns his/her money , or how they can make a living -- they just want the content . I 'm not talking about the fans though -- but rather , the general audience on the internet . When they get a chance to put you down , they will . <p> Marketing : Any outrageous demands ? <p> Clients do n't know what they want or how to go about it , but they do n't trust us . They think they know but they do n't . And I ca n't describe how frustrating it is because they will come up with their own strange procedures and expect things that you totally ca n't do . For example , asking for changes after the video has been uploaded . However , this is impossible because the video has already gotten a significant number of views . <p> What this means is we have to take it down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we lose our AdSense money ( not that there is a lot ) , but we lose the views on the video too . It is such a difficult process but for the client it 's just " Change It " . <p> Marketing : Should brands be treating influencers more like celebrities or the media ? <p> Technically , they should treat influencers like the media , because the process of creating content can get technical . We are uploading content on a media platform , and we are doing pretty much everything that a media platform does . <p> For my case in particular , I would say media because we have sales team . They do their job , they pitch , they explain to the clients and they manage expectations . <p> Clients also need to know that there are A-list Influencers , B-list Influencers and , the " young punks " with a lot of followers . <p> Marketing : Who inspires you ? <p> I am inspired by Kim Kardashian . <p> I think it 's crazy and amazing how she built an empire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( which got her famous ) is n't even relevant anymore . There are so many people , some who are hotter than she is , who get their sex tapes leaked , but Kim K is still one of the hugest examples . <p> If every sex tape leak can achieve results like Kim K 's -- then leaking a sex tape can be an option for me right ? I think it 's amazing what she has done and how the whole family built its business . <p> Marketing : What is next for you ? <p> We are trying to get the gaming channel acquired . So once that goes through , we can just focus on gaming and producing content because I believe gaming is one of the rising industries , especially with VR and so many new games . A lot of money is being spent on VR this year . <p> For my own channel , I am trying to take on the " personality " route , because producing a skit every week can be quite resource-intensive and take at least three days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of viewers who complain about Singaporean YouTubers being really one-dimensional , and producing skits which cover the different " types " of things . However , when we choose to do something else ; we get complaints on why we are deviating from the usual content .

Moreover , RIEF managed to register annualised double-digit returns in eight years from a duration spanning between 2006 and 2018 . <p> In a nutshell , Renaissance Technologies LLC 's reputation as a distinguished quantitative hedge fund derives from its secretive and wildly profitable Medallion Fund , which has one of the best records in investing history with annualised return of almost 40% over the past 30 years . <p> The firm uses quantitative trading , where staff tap data in its petabyte-scale data warehouse to assess statistical probabilities for the direction of securities prices in any given market .

That 's why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weathered the financial crisis of 2008 down only 16% , compared to the S&amp;P 500 which was down around 40% . " <p> " They have very strong infrastructure .

They collect about 15 terabytes of data per day , and they have this kind of data backed from the last 37 years so they can simulate all the trading strategies using a quantitative and mathematical approach . And they have robot AI that never gets tired . From the idea to the trade it takes only about one second . <p> " Renaissance Technologies is wholly owned by its 310 employees , half of whom are PhD graduates from Ivy League schools , " Khomsan goes on to say . " These are notWall Street guys.They take a different approach .

The post falsely claimed that someone in Singapore had died from the virus . <p> Advertisement <p> Advertisement <p> The office overseeing the Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act ( POFMA ) issued a general correction notice to SPH Magazines over the post . <p> SPH Magazines , which operates HardwareZone Forum , complied with the correction notice in a post on Monday which included a link to the Factually article .

And that is why we have POFMA and we will not hesitate to use the powers under the law to take action against any party that spreads such falsehoods . " <p> During the media conference , Mr Iswaran also responded to a question as to why a correction notice was issued only for the Hardwarezone Forum and not to other cases involving the Wuhan virus . <p> " It 's because that 's the case that 's so far emerged clearly with respect to the fact that there 's a false statement of fact which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to our current laws and he is also satisfied that it is in the public interest to issue that correction direction , " Mr Iswaran responded . <p> He added that if any other cases come to the Government 's attention , the same kind of evaluation would be applied and appropriate action taken . <p> Mr Iswaran said the aim is to keep Singaporeans informed of the facts so that they can safely navigate the online terrain , discern truth from falsehood and know what they can do to lessen the risk to themselves and their family . <p> He said his ministry is working closely with the Ministry of Health to regularly share important public information with citizens through multiple channels on social media and websites . <p> " The situation is fluid and we need the help and cooperation of the media , all Singaporeans and the residents in this critical national effort to prevent misinformation and falsehoods about the Wuhan coronavirus from sowing fear and causing panic in our society , " he said .

Recently , Huawei has invited five local directors -- Jess Teong , Gavin Yap , Nik Amir Mustapha , Kroll Azry and Tuan Faisal -- to test the brand 's new Huawei Mate 30 Pro . Under the theme " Empowering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during the launch of the awards and prevailed . <p> Here 's a glimpse into these local renowned directors ' perceptions of smartphone cinematography . <h> Nik Amir MustapHA <p> Known for his 2011 film , KIL , director , screen writer and also former Men of The Year Nik Amir Mustapha definitely enjoys his work in the arts . After finishing his studies in electrical engineering , he took on a film course in Australia and later returned to his home country , inspired to pursue his career in the production line . With the use of the Huawei Mate 30 Pro , Nik and his team succeeded in producing the short film ANA that tells the story of a boy helping an AI robot to achieve her dreams . <h> How has a smartphone changed the way you film or direct ? <p> This is my first time using a smartphone to shoot a film . As far as I am aware , the difference for me in smartphone cinematography is the mobility , making tricky shots easier to achieve . When shooting ANA , I really tested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of any additional lighting . Since it 's a phone , it 's become more accessible especially for students or newbies who want to shoot a film for their projects . But at the end of the day , different stories call for different tools but mobile phones do open up new doors for future filmmakers . <h> WHERE DO MOST OF YOUR INSPIRATION COME FROM ? <p> Usually , I get most of my inspiration when I 'm at Mamak stores ; when I 'm chatting and observing the motions around me , ideas tend to pop out because ideas are n't muscles , they 're thoughts . I 'm also fortunate to have friends that would give me suggestions that would spark up an idea for a film in my head . <h> What 's your favourite movie genre ? <p> I love conceptual things like those in Christopher Nolan 's films . I tend to enjoy filming scenes in a conceptual take , but grounded in reality . I love to tell real human stories , without any serious topic involved . It 's where you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story with a twist of lo-fi sci-fi action to it , that 's my taste . <h> What are your thoughts on what the Huawei Film Awards is trying to achieve ? <p> I think it 's an interesting approach . Although they are selling a phone , I think it complements the type of product they have . It 's a good initiative that could one day inspire young filmmakers to push their limits and convert their imagination to a film . <h> What 's your next filming plan ? <p> I 'm currently prepping for a next feature film called IMAGINUR . It 's a love/mystery story with a storyline that involves hypnosis . <h> Gavin Yap <p> For someone who started out as a child actor at the age of eight , director and actor Gavin Yap has come a long way , making his mark in many aspects in the local film industry , including animation . Chasing Santosham is the short film that Gavin and his team did for the Huawei Film Awards screening . With the use of the Huawei Mate 30 Pro , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things he encountered in the world of film . <h> What mindset should a director have when filming ? <p> Directing is a huge headache , so it 's very important that you care a great deal about the story you 're telling . Always believe in the story that you 're telling because you need that passion to ensure that the film goes the way your head visualised it . If not , it 's not worth the hassle . <h> What 's the process of animation like ? <p> I 've only directed animation primarily in the audio department , and I still work the same way I do with feature films . It 's just that animation is much more tedious . Many people would think that it 's easy but it 's much harder , because it 's basically creating a story out of thin air . For example , a Pixar film takes up years to produce just one movie because of the animation process , and to reanimate a scene , it takes up a lot of time and money . <h> What 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? <p> The picture quality between the two gadgets is slightly different . I approached Chasing Santhosham the traditional way -- creating storyboards and having back to back meetings with my DOP to discuss what 's possible and impossible . My main concern is how far we could go with that little gadget . The main advantage of shooting on a mobile phone is that it 's easy , accessible and the size gives much versatility . No one would think that you 're shooting a film especially in strict areas , so I 'd definitely consider filming on a smartphone again . <h> What are your thoughts on what the Huawei Film Awards is trying to achieve ? <p> I think it 's great to have a competition like this , and to open it up to the younger generation , to see what other talents lies out there . I think smartphone cinematography will only become bigger and will be a more recommended filming technique in the near future . <h> Jess Teong <p> In 2015 , Jess Teong made her debut as a film director with The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the screenplay . Released to immense critical success , the film went on to nab several awards at the 7th Macau International Movie Festival and the 28th Malaysian Film Festival . Often praised for her ability to convey personal experience , perspective and value through her films , Jess is leaving her mark once again -- in Roots , a powerful story that showcases the importance of family as well as happiness . <h> In what ways do you think the advancement of mobile technology will impact filmmaking ? <p> For now , I do n't see filmmakers replacing their tools with mobile phones . However , it is a very good way for the general public to get into filmmaking . Without a doubt , the advancement of mobile technology serves as a great platform for YouTubers as well as film school students to explore the world of filmmaking . I can see a future where an entire feature film is filmed on a phone . <h> How was your experience with Huawei Film Awards ? <p> I had my doubts in the beginning . I remember bringing my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ training session , since I 'm not the most tech-savvy person out there Laughs . That being said , the process was fun because the many functions of the phone were presented to me were very interesting , the slow-motion feature in particular . When done right , it 's as if the characters are telling you what 's on their mind . The process , despite being rushed , was fun . That 's why I love to always be prepared , so that when the challenge comes , I 'd be ready for it . For the project , despite being filmed with mobile phones , I treated it as if I was preparing for a film . Well , we ca n't expect the phone to be of the same caliber as a 400,000-dollar camera , but the challenge pushed us to step out of our comfort zone . <h> WHAT 'S HARDER ? GETTING STARTED OR BEING ABLE TO KEEP GOING ? <p> To keep going . Not only do you have to muster the willpower to continue , but also maintain the quality of your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my opinion , it 's down to the character of the individual . It is within my character to give my best . <h> Kroll Azry <p> Having won two major awards at Russia 's International Motivational Film Festival , Kroll Azry 's debut film , Pekak , is regarded by many as one of the best modern Malaysian films . Naturally , filmgoers are going to be interested to see what the filmmaker brings next . Marvelled by the capabilities of the Huawei Mate 30 Pro , the idea of Kucing Air -- a tale that illustrates the significance in one 's pursuit of his dreams regardless of the limits -- was developed after Kroll discovered the many opportunities that he could explore with the device . <h> Who were some of your major influences when you first started out ? <p> I started out as a still photographer when I was back in high school . You know how every year your yearbook does that thing with the class photos ? After Form Four , I 'd try to sneak in whenever there 's a photoshoot session . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me whether I 'd like to step up and take up the task . After a while , I started to get bored and films started to capture my attention . I began watching a ton of films , during a time that I 'm not particularly proud of . And by that , I mean my exposure to films was through pirated VCDs ( laughs ) . <h> What are your thoughts on what the Huawei Film Awards is trying to achieve ? <p> I think it 's good , because there 's another major brand that 's part of this now . Before this , I believe there was only BMW with its BMW Shorties . The other one is probably Astro . Nevertheless , it 's great , because it provides opportunities for talents ; it 's not only the directors that benefit from this , but the actors and actresses who are looking for an avenue . As a result of that , it 's no longer the same group of people over and over again . It 's fantastic . <h> In what ways do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? <p> The good thing about filmmaking in Malaysia is that we are not too far behind . Whatever it is that we need , we have it here . Which is important because we need to keep up in order to stay relevant . However , if you 're talking about mobile technology in particular , I think the products are still very much geared towards consumers . For the professional devices , there 's usually more buttons . ( Laughs ) Still , when I finally get to see my film on the big screen , I was genuinely surprised that it was filmed with a phone . I could n't believe it . <h> Tuan Faisal <p> While the Huawei Film Awards marks Tuan Faisal 's debut as a film director , you 'd be severely mistaken to assume that he 's new to the filmmaking industry . Tuan is most wellknown for his efforts in writing and producing the 2014 hit film , Terbaik Dari Langit , a film that 's often revered for capturing the hearts of many with its stunning cinematography as well as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the love story between him and his wife , as well as a compelling story about empathy . <h> What are your thoughts on what the Huawei Film Awards is trying to achieve ? <p> I think I gave the organisers a shock because they thought that I was going to turn down the opportunity ( laughs ) ! I feel that they really undersold the scale of the project at the time . The way the project was pitched , led me to believe that it was a small project . After hearing the pitch , I figured that it was something that I could do within a week , and I agreed to it . It was only after that when I discovered that the project is hosted by Huawei and it 's the beginning of something great . So , you could imagine my surprise when I discovered that . Surprising , but in a good way . I 'm so glad that I participated in this , because I get to be a part of a movement that 's geared towards inspiring the next generation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the advancement of mobile technology will impact filmmaking ? <p> Very encouraging . First off , the types of content that we could produce . Next , the number of talents that will rise as a result of that . I 'm very positive as to how the advancement of mobile technology will impact the filmmaking industry . However , as of now , a mobile phone is still a mobile phone . But the thought of being able to make films with mobile phones just blows my mind . <h> What genre would you like to tackle next ? <p> I 'd still go for something humanistic . Something grounded , human . It will definitely be something about relationships , and how that dynamic could be tested . Because that 's pretty much my voice at this point in time . Not so much to preach , but to express something I observed that not many people are talking about . I hope to convoy that all things exist in grey , like the theme in my short film . It 's about empathising with others . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first published in the August Man Malaysia Jan/Feb 2020 issue .

When Myanmar opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi recently said that Singapore should learn from the more relaxed way of life in her country , it affirmed what many in the city-state were thinking . While optimistic about the future , the majority of Singaporeans want a slower-paced life , for which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is one of the findings of a survey of 4,000 citizens conducted in January as part of the Our Singapore Conversation exercise . That Singaporeans now generally want a slower place of life is not particularly surprising . Things have been hectic in recent years . While Singapore 's economic development since the 1960s has been remarkable , things really started to accelerate from early in the new millennium . Between 2002 and 2012 , Singapore 's population expanded from 4.18 million to 5.31 million , according to government data . Over the same period , the gross domestic product ( GDP ) more than doubled from S$162.3 billion to S$345.6 billion . That is some pace of growth but it has come at a price , including a high cost of living , lofty property prices and a wide income gap . Three basic areas of Singapore 's economy , namely healthcare , education and transport , are all facing the strain of this phenomenal run . This , in turn , puts strain on many Singaporeans who are struggling to get by . New challenges Going forward , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changes . In the past , the city-state could perhaps rely on at least one of the world 's biggest economies , the US , Europe and China , to take up some slack , but now all three are working out their own problems . A sustainable recovery does n't appear to be on the cards for any of them in the medium term , though in China 's case , it 's more about a downgrade in growth expectations . As such , Singapore will likely have to look closer to home to enhance its growth prospects in coming years . Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong alluded to some of these growth drivers within the city-state in his National Day Rally Speech in August . This includes plans to shift one of the world 's busiest ports to Tuas , freeing up land for property development in the Keppel area . More property development means more GDP . Another obvious source of growth opportunities for Singapore is South-east Asia . Singapore has actively sought to improve ties with members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations ( Asean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Indonesia have been ok , even with a few hiccups along the way . Further , despite Ms Suu Kyi 's gentle reservations about the path that Singapore has taken , Myanmar remains a strong economic ally . In a speech at the opening of the inaugural Network Asean Forum in Singapore in August , Finance Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam articulated something of a rallying cry to the region in his concluding remarks . " We are at a good starting point . We are also in the right part of the world where there are significant growth opportunities not just domestically but also to be achieved through greater regional integration . While our external environment has gotten tougher , it is a useful reminder that our domestic and regional fundamentals have to be enhanced if we wish to offset negative spill-over effects , and in fact improve our growth performance , " he said . The Network Asean forum got business leaders from the region to brainstorm solutions to some issues that are holding back the creation of an integrated Asean Economic Community ( AEC ) . The roadblocks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different stages of their economic development . Also , not all countries are likely as focused on growing GDP as Singapore is , even though their respective governments may harbour such views . So , it 's only natural that there have been delays . In the meantime , lessons have also been learnt from the mess that is the Eurozone , where countries like Greece , Spain and Portugal are on different economic gears compared to the likes of Germany and France . Mr Shanmugaratnam 's comments at the forum were directed at business leaders from the region , and he would likely not have heard any dissenting voices . Business leaders tend to have gone to the same schools and all are trained to think in a similar way . But how is the Singapore government going to cope with the growing view that people 's lives should not be compromised by GDP growth ? Singaporeans are not blind to the negative effects of the unbridled growth in the last decade that is evident in Singapore .

The internet also enables them to closely scrutinise every policy that the government comes up with , much to the latter 's chagrin . What Robert F Kennedy said This trend of growing awareness is only likely to gain traction and the next general election in Singapore , which has to be held by 2016 , could become a sort of a referendum about whether Singaporeans think that the government is navigating a sustainable path for the country . Will its focus on GDP be too much to bear by then ? Perhaps we should remind ourselves of what then US presidential candidate Robert F Kennedy said about the gross national product ( the market value of all the products and services produced in one year by labour and property supplied by residents of a country ) at the University of Kansas in March , 1968 . " The gross national product does not allow for the health of our children , the quality of their education or the joy of their play . It does not include the beauty of our poetry or the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ debate or the integrity of our public officials . It measures neither our wit nor our courage , neither our wisdom nor our learning , neither our compassion nor our devotion to our country , it measures everything in short , except that which makes life worthwhile . " Mr Kennedy was assassinated three months later , and never became US President . We 'll never know if his thoughts on the economy would have been put into practice . Things could have been different if it did , because the US was the global thought leader in those days . Still , the likes of Ms Suu Kyi may have been inspired by Mr Kennedy 's words . However , there are few other global leaders these days who would publicly say the same -- the corporates behind the scenes will have none of that type of nonsense . Nonetheless , one gets the feeling that Mr Kennedy 's words are likely to resonate even more today as the gap between the rich and the poor widens across the world , including in Singapore.Thusitha de Silva has been working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ By Ravi ShankarIn a nice way , the shoe was on the other foot .

But that soon disappeared when I realized that this was my own little Oscar moment . How do you feel about the award , was the first question in an online interview even before I had received it . The right noises : Thrilled , of course . An honour and a privilege to be counted as one among many greats . But I did n't wail in joy ; nor did I thank everyone from my kindergarten teacher to my golf coach . ( Cleverly , of course , I acknowledged my bosses in full sincerity . ) Of course , I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for no eureka moment or for apples falling on the head . The story was n't me . It was China Daily . And the recognition of the global operations spawned by a newspaper from humble -- though pathbreaking -- times in 1981 . A little historical perspective : Very few newspapers around the world are feted at their birth like China Daily was . Almost every major global news agency and newspaper ( in many languages ) reported on its birth like they would today about a panda birth in Edinburgh Zoo ( and yes , there was a panda story on the front page of the first edition even though it was about a lack of procreation ) . In those days , China Daily was China for the typical foreigner who did not speak the language . It was their only window into an unfathomable and unfamiliar world emerging from isolation . Of course , as China opened up , there were many more avenues of information but China Daily continues to lead the pack . It no longer was a newspaper for foreigners in China who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest of the world . In just the past few years , we have launched dedicated editions in the US , Europe , ASEAN and the wider Asia-Pacific , as well as Africa . And our multimedia platforms are your first " hits " on search engines . The response has been more than gratifying because there is such a thirst for China knowledge around the world . Readers are not interested in coverage only through a narrow prism of set agendas . They want to know the Real China . The China Story . And the Chinese Dream . People I meet in Europe , the US or Asia want to know how in the Kingdom of Bicycles the car is the King of the Road . They want to know about those incredibly fast trains . They want to know about migrant workers and how they will fit into the new urbanization plans . They want to know about social trends and social media . They want to know of marriages and divorces ; and , indeed , if concubines have made a comeback ! This is exactly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to why ( I think ) I won the award : Yes , I have been closely involved in conceptualizing , coordinating and executing many of the major projects we have undertaken in the past decade . They include the continual expansion and revamps of the paper ; special editions like The Olympian for the 2008 Beijing Games ; for the 60th anniversary of the founding of New China ; and the launch of several overseas editions . Longevity helps . I am the longest-serving expat on the paper and so have a " historical perspective " . The good thing is that there are many who are thinking long-term and they bring a wide array of talent . In the euphoria of the moment , I give myself a pat on the back . But the truth is I 've been carried on the back of a great China Daily team , increasingly being made of expats like me . Here I feel it is incumbent on me to mention Zhu Ling , our publisher and editor-in-chief . During our first encounter in China Daily Hong Kong Edition more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ verbal lashing for not correcting " Chinglish " on my first night at work . I did n't know what Chinglish was , having just come from Singapore 's " Singlish " which I was comfortable with . He has been more than kind since . I greatly appreciate the opportunities he has given me , and I hope I have learned.Ravi Shankar is executive editor of China Daily 's overseas editions . A journalist from India , he formerly worked for The New Paper . <p> A Transient Workers Count Two research team interviewed 163 injured Indian and Bangladeshi workers who come to their food programme and talked about their accommodation conditions . Under the law , employers are meant to provide accommodation for their injured workers even when they are staying in Singapore on Special Passes while their compensation claims are being considered , but in fact , many workers do not benefit from this provision . Of the 163 workers interviewed , only one was staying in company-provided accommodation -- and his employer did not know that he was there . Only 28 per cent of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by MOM ) . In many cases , these workers fled from company-provided accommodation because they feared being forcibly sent home so that their employer could avoid paying compensation . The study shows that there is a gap between the stated protection for workers under the law as it exists and the workers ' ability to make use of this measure to see themselves through a period of waiting for case settlement when they are not able to work legally and do not have an income . Read the full report . <p> Q and A : Dr Ooi Kee Beng , the deputy director of the Institute of South-east Asian Studies , talks to P N Balji about why Malaysia-Singapore relations is on a high , how attitudes on both sides have changed and whether the abang-adek relationship is still a simmering factor.Q . Malaysia-Singapore relations are at a high . Why so ? What can upset this cordiality ? <p> A. One should perhaps start by asking why relations between the two should not be cordial . There are several answers to that , but what should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the need each has of the other in various ways is too strong for mutual enmity to be a permanent feature of their relationship . While one is a city-state that is also a tiny island , the other is a conglomerate of 13 states , nine of which perceive themselves as sultanates . Of the remaining four , Sabah and Sarawak were regions at par with the Federation of Malaya when they came together along with Singapore to form Malaysia in 1963 ; while Penang and Malacca both have a long unique history of their own . Singapore was created by the British to be the centre of power , and so , in 1963 , its people had reason to see the city as the metropolis for the British Nusantara . It had to play a central role in the building of Malaysia , which in practical terms meant that a common market was necessary . Once that failed , Singapore 's economic and cultural future within the federation did not look bright . While the non-Malay population in West Malaysia envisaged a simple and smooth transition from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continued to have a strong sense of apartness from the global economy that the colonialists represented . Their political consciousness was still sultanate-based , and their ethnic identity was religion-based , which did not relate easily to the metropolitan , secular , multicultural political economy of a modern state . This difference in group consciousness spelled out different routes and different speeds in developmental strategies . In that sense , although one may talk about how the two countries had a joint history , the differences have been more compelling and relevant than the similarities have been . As long as the differences were denied , relations between the two tended to be antagonistic . The supposed deep similarities raised a lot of false hopes and a lot of unreasonable expectations . Over time , the differences have become more and more obvious -- a process that was very much delayed by the fact that the antagonism between early leaders was prolonged by their extended time in power . With new leaders , and with the growing importance of the complex regional context in which national politics and economics exist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the two countries , and a greater realisation of how much synergic advantage can be gained from working together . Q , How does the Malaysian establishment view Singapore these days ? A. A complex of anger , incomprehension , irritation and envy does remain in how Singapore is viewed by its neighbor up north . But there is now a clearer acceptance that there is nothing much Malaysia can do to Singapore without hurting herself . The obvious advantage of having a wealthy and dynamic island at one 's doorstep is now being accepted . What Singapore does not have , Malaysia can offer her , be this lack of land ; investment opportunities at medium cost ; unskilled , semi-skilled or skilled labour ; or landed properties . Q. Do you think the abang-adek relationship , as seen by Malaysia , is not a factor anymore ? A. This is not much of a factor today . Such an attitude is rare among young Malay leaders , and would in fact be very unbecoming if found in new leaders . Q. Has Singapore become more careful , more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it has . Malaysian politics is often street politics in the sense that statements are made spontaneously for whatever immediate effect it might have . Reacting quickly to such statements forces things to a head , with no side wishing to back down for matters of pride -- personal and national . Singapore is less reactive on that front nowadays . Q. The relationship soured when Dr Mahathir and Lee Kuan Yew were the prime ministers . What was their problem ? A. They both reflected the viewpoints stated in my answer to the first question . What is sometimes forgotten is that Mahathir fought with every one of Malaysia 's PMs and DPMs excepting Tun Abdul Razak , who died early . So , for him to be antagonistic towards a small neighbor like Singapore , whose leader had dared imagine becoming a major leader in Malaysia , should not be considered strange.Dr Ooi Kee Beng is a Swedish citizen who was born and raised in Penang . He is also editor of the Penang Monthly published by the Penang Institute . <p> All hands on deck ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ role of the public service in keeping the people happy with the government . The government is also shopping for an integrated system to detect , monitor and tackle public grievances and complaints . New rules were announced yesterday to keep the public service free from corruption . From today , all public officers will need to declare within seven days whenever they visit the local casinos more than four times a month or buy an annual pass . Officers who have to deal with the casinos wo n't be allowed to visit them at all except on business . The actions follow recent scandals involving public servants , the plunge in the ruling party vote in the May 2011 general election and the two consecutive by-election defeats . PM Lee said it was important that people trust the government and the public service . Only then can government policies succeed -- if the people trust the government to understand their needs . One way the public service can strengthen this trust is to act together as one and maintain the highest standards of integrity . The Prime Minister was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public service must work as an integrated whole and keep up the changing aspirations of the people , he said . People would be frustrated if they had to deal with multiple agencies and conflicting policies . The government must be customer-oriented , he added . Keeping the customer satisfied is a mammoth task . In the second quarter of this year , the government received 1.6 million phone calls , emails and letters -- that 's one in every five seconds . But service has its rewards . Public servants will continue to be paid according to their quality and the value of their contributions , said PM Lee , adding this had kept the system clean . New technology will be used to handle complaints and feedback from the public more efficiently . The Infocomm Development Authority of Singapore has called a tender for an " Integrated Case Management System " . This will provide a digital platform to resolve " complex issues " involving multiple agencies . It follows earlier efforts to solve the problem of complaints being bounced from one agency to another . The government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standards and the image of the public service . That will be a win-win for the people and the government alike if the public servants play along . <p> Maybe the TODAY paper did not realise it . The day it published the PM 's speech on how the civil service should be a more responsive organisation , it used an interview former top civil servant Ngiam Tong Dow gave to the Singapore Medical Association where he spoke about how unresponsive the Ministry of Finance has been to his suggestions/comments . Suggestion : That the $60 billion set aside for improving productivity be used instead to pay for the salaries of new graduates that employers hire and train for the first year . This is aimed at employers who do n't want to hire these young people " because they say while the graduates may have the theories , they may have not be able to do the job , " " I have not received a response ( from the Ministry of Finance ) yet , " says Ngiam . Comment : His favourite topic , he says , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stage the F1 night race . Why should we use taxpayers ' money to pay for the races . I have asked this question publicly , but the Ministry of Finance has never addressed it . " If a man who was once permanent secretary faces this kind of treatment , what chance do lesser souls have ? <p> By Tan Bah Bah There is a new arts head honcho in town . Kathy Lai Sou Tien has taken the place of Benson Puah as the National Arts Council Chief Executive Officer . Kathy who ? That would be the natural reaction of the arts community . If you Google " Kathy Lai " , you would learn that she was IE Singapore Assistant CEO . And if you search further -- on Google anyway -- for public pronouncements she has made on any subject recently , you would come across just this speech made at a conference held in Sentosa in 2012 . Subject : Developing Singapore as a Coal Trading Hub in Asia . That is as unartistic a topic as you can get . From pitching for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a global city is an interesting change of pace . In the press conference to announce her appointment , Lai said her first order of action was to get to know the arts scene better and that she was also keen to build up patronage of artists in Singapore : " I do n't think I can champion a community that I do n't know . So the first thing is to connect with the community . " That is going to be her biggest challenge -- winning over the support of the community , as their most passionate and involved advocate . Can she , as an outsider , deliver ? Many people may not remember . Benson Puah was also not part of the practising arts industry when he was asked to head The Esplanade . He said in an interview : " I was 41 when I joined The Esplanade in 2002 and my appointment was a surprise to everyone . It surprised me , too , when I was asked by the government to do the job . I have worked in several different industries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So I guess I built for myself a reputation as a builder of organisations and a developer of people . " Because of his successful stint at the Durians , he grew so much within the community that his subsequent appointment as NAC CEO in 2009 was readily accepted . It was not as if he had been a well-known playwright , sculptor , musician , dancer , writer or art gallery owner . But he was not an integral part of the community . Puah also came in with a fresh mind . His successes have been acknowledged by the overseeing Ministry of Culture , Community and Youth which cited its debt to the ex-CEO : " He has played a significant role in facilitating the development of the arts in Singapore " . Among other things , he " championed closer engagement with the arts community , personally hosting a series of dialogues and consultations in relation to major policy reviews " . Kathy Lai and Chan Heng Chee , as the NAC Chairman , seem like an excellent partnership to orientate our arts industry to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their artistic instinct . Chan was ambassador to the United States from 1996 to this year . Lai should also be familiar with the arts scene in Washington DC when she was with IE Singapore . The US is one of our biggest investors and trading partners and a major cultural influence too . Both have experienced the high standards of arts and the community 's passion for the arts in major American cities such as New York , Washington and Boston . They must have much to take away from the exposure from a personal point of view . But Chan has quickly reassured the arts community that Lai " will bring in good energy to build on what has been done by Benson " . Meaning , it is business as usual . Let 's hope so . We already have in place the theatres , museums , venues and organisational ability to host quality shows and exhibits . We have a growing ecosystem . Attendance of arts and cultural events has grown from 971,600 in 2003 to 2.14 million in 2011 . The total number of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ music and museums -- has jumped from 302 in 2003 to 856 in 2011 . Do not let this momentum lose its way as we seek to globalise ourselves even in the arts . Keep the focus on nurturing our homegrown talents and a burgeoning local interest in local arts . The more Ivan Hengs , Anthony Chens , Dick Lees , Royston Tans , Stephanie Suns , Mavis Hees and Siow Lee Chins we have , the better . They are part of our core , our artistic identity . They celebrate the Singaporean 's uniqueness in the world , even as the world is becoming our cultural oyster . The urge to carve out Singapore 's place in the global art scene is irrepressible and has only just begun . The new NAC CEO will quickly realise much has to do with providing creative leadership and giving everyone the right support and space to grow .

" <p> Q and A with M Ravi : The lawyer who takes on cases that others shy away from tells P N Balji why he does it , how he runs his law business , what laws he wants changedQ . Tell us about your journey . Your parents , your life as a school boy , your university life .... A. I was born in Singapore and brought up in the Jalan Kayu kampung , which was a multi-ethnic village near Seletar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my parents were construction workers . My mom was an extremely loving and compassionate person who influenced me immensely . She was the guiding light in my life . I applied myself in school and eventually I graduated from the National University of Singapore ( NUS ) with a degree in political science and sociology . I continued my studies at the University of Cardiff in the UK . I became an advocate and solicitor and was admitted to the Singapore Bar in 1997 . My entire life story is documented in my memoir , Kampong Boy , which is available at major bookstores.Q . You have handled many high-profile cases , many of which others do n't want to touch . Why do you fight those cases ? A. There is an unhealthy perception that lawyers in Singapore are afraid to take up human rights causes . However , our oath at the Bar requires us to be fearless in the pursuit of justice . Such a pursuit becomes even more important when we have weak institutional checks on the state , like Parliament , and the role of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' rights . As lawyers , we must be prepared to take up causes , regardless of whether they are unpopular with some members of the public -- like the issue of Section 377A of the Penal Code -- or whether they are unpopular with the government -- such as the by-elections case . These principles are informative when our firm decides what cases to take . We are often engaged , fundamentally , with helping someone get access to their fundamental rights and freedoms , to be treated with basic human dignity . When one engages in a constitutional challenge , it invariably critically affects all citizens , and hence our firm is compelled to act if the matter is in the public interest.Q . There is a view that you take on these cases just to get publicity . How would you respond to that ? A. We are forthcoming with the press . The public absolutely has a right to know when their fellow citizens ' rights are trampled , when their liberty and their lives are being taken away by the state . Often , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the criminalisation of male homosexuality , or imposing judicial caning or the death penalty -- on the basis that it is " the will of the public " . Really ? How did that consultation take place ? In truth , I believe most citizens are unaware that our government sentences thousands of persons to caning every year or the brutality of that punishment ( For a video of judicial caning , you can visit M Ravi Human Rights Network on Facebook ) . Further , I think most citizens do not know much about the lives of persons on death row for drug trafficking -- the grinding poverty that many of them have come from , the family members who will die inside . I think very few people would consent to the use of the death penalty if they know these facts . I am opposed to the death penalty , hence , there is a need to publicise the cause through activism locally and internationally . Activism and publicity at the end of the day are useless if no one cares about the client , the person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stories are told and if the public has the opportunity to participate in the dialogue on the principles and lives at stake , then there can be major changes in the way that law is reviewed and implemented . The free press -- in Singapore this would be foreign press , local online media and independent blogs -- is really essential to democracy and has an inherent duty to the people . That said , for the personal publicity I 've got , I could do without most of it . I do n't need to go into the personal information or some of the unfortunate characterisations made about me in the government- controlled media in Singapore . Publicity is a two-edged sword . However , I will not be shy when there is an injustice that needs to be made known . I worry that in Singapore we over-value shyness as some kind of virtue . A more modest lawyer who is never in the papers is a more respectable man in our quiet culture . But what if he is not ? What if he could have stuck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up for someone else ? Some causes are far more important than our public standing or our privacy.Q . Many of your clients are unlikely to afford the fees . Do you take on such cases for free ? A. In cases of life and liberty , yes , but we are limited by our resources . If we are working at full capacity and a new pro bono case would diminish our ability to serve our existing clients ( a number of whom are pro bono ) , we will have to refer that person elsewhere . Recently , we have been very fortunate to have the generous support of law professors and legal practitioners , legal interns and volunteer researchers who have given their time to support our pro bono work in Constitutional Law . This has been an immense help in these cases.Q . What case gives you the most satisfaction and which the least ? A. Obviously , Yong Vui Kong is very close to my heart . It is heartening to know that he and others are alive today as their executions have been delayed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constitutional challenges brought on behalf of Yong Vui Kong . Now they stand to benefit under the changes to the Mandatory Death Penalty . Madam Vellama 's D/O Muthu 's constitutional challenge for the right to by-elections in Singapore was hugely satisfying to participate in . We were so happy when the court agreed that the Prime Minister does not have unfettered discretion whether to call a by-election ! This was so historic and the outcome was the result of so many Singaporeans -- professors , lawyers , librarians , interns and volunteer researchers , online journalists and bloggers -- coming together and demanding with Madam Vellama that our rights be recognized.Q . It was a surprise that cleaner Madam Vellama sought you to test the PM 's powers on holding by-elections . Did she seek you or did you seek her ? A. I decline to answer this question . Q. You seem to want to test the boundaries , especially in cases that involve politics and the Constitution . You cut too close to the bone of the establishment . Are n't you afraid to take on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face when I had to cross-examine Lee Kuan Yew and Lee Hsien Loong in court in 2008 . The Singapore Democratic Party approached me when no lawyers would represent them . It is an experience I wo n't forget easily ! I think it is too late to be afraid ! Anyway , if I acted on fear I would not be helpful to myself or anyone else . This part is spiritual , like walking across hot coals . One may know that it will be dangerous or painful to proceed , but there is simply no choice . So I just let my belief in the work carry me through and I find that , in this way , the universe will provide the people and the help that are needed if the cause is just.Q . Will you go into politics ? A. I am asked this question from time to time ; however , this is not something that is on my mind right now as there is so much work to be done in my present capacity as a human rights lawyer . In addition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a team to launch human rights clinics in Asean as well as working with international NGOs to improve access to justice in Asia . I believe we all have responsibilities as citizens . You do n't have to become a politician to play your part in a democracy . Even if the opposition was in power , I would continue to take on challenges in the interest of our constitutional rights and our rights as individuals.Q . What aspects of the Singapore law would you want changed ? A. Obviously , I want the death penalty to be abolished . I want an end to judicial caning . I want to see Section 377A of the Penal Code overturned . I believe we need major changes in the treatment of the accused . The accused has a right to remain silent -- the law must not undermine that . The accused has a right to an attorney and should not be questioned without his attorney present , full stop . The police need to respect this . It is especially disheartening when the accused has a major mental disability , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marathon sessions of interrogation and he is completely distressed . What can be accomplished by this ? All statements taken from accused persons should be video-recorded . We have cameras at every street corner , but where they could actually protect our civil rights , we have none ? Nonsense . We must dramatically reform the offence of sub-judice contempt of court . Reporting on issues before the court is the function of a free press everywhere , especially in a public interest litigation . Why are we in the dark ages on this ? I add to this the offence of " scandalizing the judiciary " . The threat of such offences has a chilling effect on appropriate public scrutiny of the judicial process . I would like to see the implementation of a jury system in criminal cases , as Japan has recently implemented . One should be tried before a jury of his peers . Knowing how we excel in efficiency in Singapore , I know we can come up with an efficient mechanism to make this possible . Perhaps it could be a model for other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should provide a public defender to accused persons in criminal matters who can not afford counsel , as is the case in Taiwan and the US . I would like to see the establishment of a third tier of appeal in criminal cases in our justice system . Currently , we have the High Court and the Court of Appeal . Previously , our highest court of appeal was the Privy Council in London . It should have been replaced in our system with a Superior Court with a panel of five judges . When it was not replaced , it reduced our access to justice . I would like to see the Elections Department to be made independent of the Prime Minister 's Office . I would like to see the Coroner 's Act amended to require that full reports are completed in any case of wrongful death . I would like to see some changes to the Industrial Relations Act to enable workers with greater recourse when their unions have failed to represent them . I would like to see massive changes to protect foreign workers in Singapore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of assembly and free press ... I guess there is enough to keep me busy for a long time ! Q. How is your health ? A. I decline to answer this question .

@@41780238 <h> The age of ad blocking <p> Details <p> Staff Writer <p> 01 August 2016 <p> Have you ever been served ads that provide no purpose for your needs or interest ? <p> But with the increase in mobile consumption and advancement of technology , consumers are bombarded with more ads than ever -- not just on different devices , but also on different apps or media platforms that are being used . <p> The result of this has been the birth of an increasing number of ad blocking software/apps . There are now many choices of apps or software that you can download , with each having their own ad blocking parameters . Some serve as sweeping blankets , while others have limited restrictions that only allow static , text or non-obstructive ads on different platforms . <p> According to a study by the consulting firm PageFair with the analytics firm Priori Data , 419 million people , or 22 per cent of global smartphone users , are blocking ads on their mobile handsets as of March 2016 . This seems like a resounding public show of disapproval that publishers/advertisers should take note of . Of course , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blocking software into its iPhone and iPad iOS9 operating system , it increased access and accelerated the growth even further . <p> But are consumers too quick to block out the bigger picture ? <p> Why the need to block ? <p> First things first , it 's important to understand why consumers are choosing to block ads . Survey 's undertaken by both media owners and research companies alike indicate that the top three reasons are : quantity of ads , the increased data consumption they demand , and impacts on speed of the consumers device . <p> The study also showed that mobile ad-blocking grew by 90 per cent globally in 2015 , with most of the increase in Asia , and this will cost publishers a billions of dollars . There are so many brands now vying for attention , there are n't just more ads , but ads have also become more intrusive and harder to filter out of your normal user experience . This is not only disruptive to the user experience , but it also means an increase in phone data consumption . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when much of content is consumed on mobile , an unwanted ad could be an added cost to the consumer or result in a lack of data for important social networking . God forbid an advertiser to be seen as the culprit for lack of social media activity ! <p> Naturally , as more data is being pushed through the gates , it affects the speed of the working device . All of these provide more reasons to get that ad blocking app/software installed . In addition , unwanted ads could possible infect a users device with a virus . Based on a 2014 IAB study , consumers find themselves using ad blocking technology to protect their respective devices against viruses and to increase their computer performance . <p> So using ad blocking apps/softwares is a great move for a consumer , right ? Well , not exactly . <p> What is the impact of this ? <p> Let 's imagine a mobile world where almost everyone has decided to use ad blocking apps/software to extensively block ads . <p> With an abundance of ad blocking , the cost of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Advertisers will be forced to reconsider the efficiency of their return on investment and could pull out of digital advertising as a result . Alternatively as with consumers only the rich advertisers will be able to afford it and in turn , smaller businesses would suffer . <p> But do n't most small business use the self service options through Google search and display network or Facebook ? Will these more native based ads also be affected so impacting the small business owner ? Simple answer is yes , apps that block all ads including native ads are available . Paid search is still excluded from this . <p> What about the consumers ( they should come first ! ) . Well they could have to start paying for what used to be ' free ' ad funded content . This essentially means that the ' free web ' as a tool for universal education and social mobility could be impacted . Only the rich will be able to pay for the best content . As always , freedom does not result in equality . <p> Secondly , smaller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and alternative content , will either shut down or struggle to keep going because people wo n't pay for their content and they ca n't make money from ads . <p> Lastly , the quality of ads and hence user rich audience visual experience could be affected as some ad blocking apps only allow text or static ads . <p> Hopefully , the above scenarios will not be realised . The web has been funded by ads since its inception , well 1994 at least when AT&amp;T ran the first 468x60 banner ad on Hotwired.com . To alter the status quo now would result in an a huge correction in the economics of the web . Fundamental things would have to change . However , the mere point that we as an industry are still finding advertisers money to buy 468x60 banner ads is a major concern and a clear indication that things have to change much more quickly towards making ad better looking , more targeted , more relevant and hopefully then more welcomed by the consumer . <p> So what next ? <p> There have been various different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Firstly it is the approach to accept and comply , and as a result the industry must do a better job at producing and delivering ads that are less annoying . I believe this has a lot to do with increasing entertaining video ads or content related ads . <p> ' Nobody reads ads , they just read content and sometimes they happen to be ads ' -- Howard Gossage <p> The second approach is to engage with the consumers and explain the value exchange of ads for free content . This is something that the Guarandian has undertaken . Finally the most dramatic and hardline approach is to block the blockers . This has been adopted by Axel Springer in Germany with amazing results where 66% of users chose to turn off ad blocker as a result . Only vendors with exclusive content can take this approach . <p> No single solution is being deemed the right way to go yet . What is clear is that consumers want change and want ads that are relevant to them at a time when they need it and in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . According to an IAB study , 60% of current ad blocker users would turn off ad blocking for content , proving that to get to better content , consumers are willing to experience relevant and better targeted ads . <p> There is no need for panic but there is need for change . Targeting has improved , content based entertaining ads have improved , and video advertising is increasing . There is no doubt in my mind we must become a more responsible advertising industry . <p> It is not all down to the media vendor , agencies , advertisers and technology companies must all pitch in . We must give consumers the freedom to choose which conversation they 'd like to be involved in and to deliver better quality both in terms of formats and messages , and with less clutter . I believe then ads are served in this manner , they will have a higher impact . <p> The writer is Henry Stokes , APAC vice president , client development from Xaxis.com.

" <p> Since Pandora 's strong landing in Hong Kong in 2009 , the Danish brand 's breakneck sales have shown no mercy to its rivals . With 24 stores in the city , the Hong Kong and Macau markets account for 13% of Pandora 's Asia revenue share , representing a 3% revenue growth in local currency compared with 2015 . <p> Together with booming sales in China and Australia , Mann says Asia experienced a 18% revenue growth in local currency in 2016 , which takes up 19% of the brand 's overall business . The jewellery giant recorded DKK 1,268 million in revenue in Asia Pacific in Q1 2017 , an increase of 40% in local currency compared with Q1 2016 . <p> While Mann keeps her eyes on the hard financial figures of the business , she admits there 's a need to change its strategies in Hong Kong . <p> " It 's no longer about building the brand , but about maintaining the brand . You 're not going to see loads of Pandora stores opening any more , we are about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Keeping customers coming is going to be a main challenge for Pandora in the next few years . " <p> It 's no longer about building the brand , but about maintaining the brand . You 're not going to see loads of Pandora stores opening any more , we are about there with our store distribution . <p> The new focus will require new skill sets and mindsets , driving Mann and her team to look into improving its communication strategies , as well as making greater products and services for better experiences . <p> She says its main work is to " embrace disruption in jewellery marketing " . <p> Drawing a reference from the brand 's unique practice since 2013 -- which debuts new jewellery seven times a year with collections spaced less than two months apart -- she says the move is one of the examples of how Pandora turned the industry on its head , as a typical jeweller would only release collections quarterly . <p> " One of the reasons why Pandora has been so successful is we do n't behave like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she says . <p> The brand 's next disruption wave , therefore , aims to distance itself from being a traditional jeweller even more . <p> Dubbed " DO " , the new brand image which Pandora has endorsed globally since mid-March , changes the looks of its stores and advertisements . <p> The new campaign uses strong bright candy colours to " add personality and energy " , and introduces the new message " DO " with different variations in ads , for example , " DO bold " , so it can inspire women with positive values and link values to product points . <p> The new advertisement has shifted from featuring product images to featuring model images . Mann says the variation from product-driven to a style-oriented approach can add " a huge sense of energy and fun " into the brand 's personality . <p> " You can see in all our model shoots that none are posed in the traditional way . It 's all about women having fun with each other , supporting each other , one message that is incredibly relevant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ids= " 185483,185482,185484 " <p> While customers may think of jewellery stores as stodgy and unapproachable , Mann says the stores and advertising look completely different to competitors with their bright character , which will help Pandora stand out from other brands with its more approachable image . <p> She adds the campaign marks an important stage for the brand to " fill the communication gaps " . <p> Unlike its usual campaigns , which associate jewellery with romantic relationships , the brand now places a focus on the customers ' feminine ethics and codes . <p> As part of its campaign , the brand also resonates with opinion leaders around the world . <p> From food , music to art and culture , Mann says it 's important not to limit the opinion leaders ' industry backgrounds in the scope of fashion styling in jewellery . <p> " Just because you are a chef in Italy , does n't mean you do n't believe in style and celebrating in life .

@@41787233 <h> More than a bailout , Tencent-backed NIO needs a new strategy to survive <p> Will a provincial government be able to save China 's Tesla wannabe ? Investors seem to think so . The reality may be different . <p> New York-listed NIO Inc. , a self-described pioneer in China 's premium electric vehicle market and rival to Elon Musk 's company , said Tuesday that it has made a tentative agreement with the municipal government of Hefei in Anhui province for funding support . The company will move its China headquarters there from Shanghai and says it plans to raise more than 10 billion yuan ( $1.43 billion ) in light of the partnership . Other details were sparse . The stock surged as much as 34% . <p> Those are lofty ambitions considering the company was sitting on $1.5 billion of debt and is expected to post negative free cash flow of $1.4 billion for 2019 , according to Bloomberg estimates . Earlier this month , NIO said it had raised $100 million in one-year convertible notes , bringing the aggregate to $200 million of private placements this year . It said it was " working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uncertain at this stage . " Meanwhile , as the coronavirus hobbles China Inc. , NIO ca n't afford to pay its workers on time . <p> The company has done a few similar partnerships .

They 're manufactured by state-backed Anhui Jianghuai Automobile Group Corp. , or JAC , at a plant in Hefei -- where it 's moving -- under a five-year agreement signed in 2016 . The cost-effectiveness is questionable : For the first three years , NIO paid on a per-car basis and foot the bill for the plant 's operating losses . It is n't clear what the arrangement is now . <p> Under the new agreement , NIO plans to build a manufacturing facility . It previously scrapped plans for one in Shanghai , where Tesla has been welcomed by the local government . <p> Even though car sales have inched up , NIO has continued to spend well beyond its means .

@@41787237 <h> Guest Post : Investing in deep tech is akin to investing in the future <p> Deep technology has the potential to solve the world 's biggest societal issues . This has not gone unnoticed by nations -- Singapore , for example , has injected an additional S$300 million into its Startup SG Equity scheme in its recent Budget 2020 announcement , to support the commercialisation of startups whose businesses are based on innovative research . <p> However , with multiple layers of technicalities and complexities involved , transformational deep tech can be a tricky venture for investors , especially non-tech ones , to get into . While some practice the " spray and pray " approach by channelling funds into every technology company with hopes for one to become the next unicorn , the same approach might not be feasible for deep tech , given that larger , more " patient " capital is required . <p> Despite the challenges , deep tech can translate to impactful returns on a global scale . For investors , it pays to understand developments in science and technology . Here are some key trends we have identified . <p> AI is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been trending on almost every investor 's list , so it is unsurprising to see it remain a key investment area in 2020 . <p> While AI has been touted as the be-all-end-all technology of the future , it is still currently limited to managing simple , specific tasks . However , as we are still quite a distance from achieving " artificial general intelligence " -- the stage where machines can perform any tasks a human can -- a safer bet would be to identify gaps into which AI in its current state of maturity can readily pug . <p> For instance , AI companies in banking can resolve specific pain points such as speeding up know your customer or anti-money laundering processes . <p> The resurgence of Medtech and healthcare AI <p> As societies struggle to cope with ageing populations , demand for quality healthcare will continue to rise exponentially across the world . In fact , the medical technology market in Asia is poised to grow to about $133 billion this year , surpassing the European Union as the second-largest market globally . <p> We are witnessing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ undergoing proofs-of-concept and clinical trials .

It has the potential to be a game-changer in a wide range of real-life applications -- from superfast data processing and computing , defence and security , to managing energy use and production . Recognising this , nations and tech giants like Amazon , Microsoft , IBM and Google are pouring more money into this space . <p> This nascent sector is both new and expensive , making it difficult for investors to gauge the kind of returns they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early-stage quantum companies is to identify those that create an environment which will make quantum computing more accessible to all .

For countries like Singapore , which relies on food imports , finding solutions towards self-sufficiency is critical . <p> Consumers are also becoming more socially conscious and selective in the food they consume , developing greater appetites for more sustainably produced foods . <p> These trends are driving demand , leading to greater investor interest in agriculture and food technology startups .

In the meantime , technologies that enhance existing sensors , energy storage , navigation and decision support -- components essential for AVs -- will offer startups a chance to monetise in the interim period before Level 5 vehicles hit the road . <p> These components can be deployed as part of existing vehicles and infrastructure , giving them an earlier time-to-market , while the development of a full AV takes place in parallel . <p> Taking the deep tech leap <p> Investing in deep tech is akin to investing in the future .

Son has signaled less receptiveness to Elliott 's other suggestions : selling more of the stake in Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and reining in the Vision Fund , a $100 billion investment vehicle that accounted for more than $10 billion of losses in the past two quarters . <p> Son is personally handling interactions with Elliott , according to a person familiar with the matter . Chief Financial Officer Yoshimitsu Goto , Chief Operating Officer Marcelo Claure , head of the Vision Fund Rajeev Misra , and SoftBank Group 's Robert Townsend are also closely involved , the person said , asking not to be identified because the details are private . <p> The news of Elliott 's stake , which people familiar with the matter have said is a nearly $3 billion , sent SoftBank 's shares to the highest in a year , but have since retreated over 10% . It 's not clear whether representatives from Elliott will be at the Monday event , which was scheduled before the activist investor disclosed its stake and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Will He Fund a Big Buyback ? <p> Elliott has called for a buyback of as much as $20 billion , which would be several times SoftBank 's biggest repurchase to date . The company 's last buyback was its biggest at 600 billion yen ( $5.5 billion ) . Announced in February 2019 , it sparked a rally that pushed the stock to its highest price in about two decades . <p> Selling Alibaba shares to pay for a buyback , as Elliott has proposed , could be a point of contention with Son . In the past , Son has used its stake as collateral to borrow money for big acquisitions , including the $32 billion purchase of chip designer ARM Holdings . Son said during SoftBank 's latest quarterly financial briefing that he 'd prefer to sell as little as possible and that there 's " no rush " to do so . <p> While Elliott and SoftBank have yet to discuss specific amounts , a buyback is an easy sell for Son , since one was already in the works before the activist 's involvement , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when it announced on Feb. 19 plans to borrow as much as 500 billion yen by putting up shares of its Japanese telecom unit as collateral . <h> How Risky is SoftBank 's Debt Load ? <p> The loan has raised questions about SoftBank 's massive debt pile . SoftBank said the money will come from 16 financial institutions and pledged as much as 953 million shares of SoftBank Corp . as collateral . Overseas banks will provide the bulk of the margin loan , with JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. and Credit Suisse Group AG contributing 68 billion yen each , the Nikkei reported . <p> " It 's very worrisome that to raise just a few billion dollars of debt , Son had to go to a dozen banks . On top of that they had to put up collateral worth $15 billion , " said Atul Goyal , senior analyst at Jefferies Group . " It looks like Japanese banks are worried about concentration risks . " <p> SoftBank had 19.25 trillion yen of interest-bearing debt as of Dec. 31 , a 23% increase since the start of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with T-Mobile will lighten the load by about 4.9 trillion yen . Still , SoftBank may find it a challenge to balance shareholder returns with big-ticket investments in technology companies . The company had 3.8 trillion yen of cash and equivalents , while more than 2.6 trillion yen of bonds are coming due in the next three years . <h> What is the Vision Fund 's Future ? <p> The Vision Fund is recovering from a series of stumbles . WeWork 's plan to go public last year imploded , forcing SoftBank to arrange a rescue financing of $9.5 billion in October . Uber , despite a recent surge , is trading about 24% below last year 's offering price . The fund has suffered other high-profile setbacks , including investments in failed online retailer Brandless Inc. , dog-walking app Wag Labs Inc. and pizza robot company Zume Pizza Inc . <p> Elliott wants SoftBank to set up a special committee to review investment processes at the Vision Fund . It also argues the fund has dragged down the share price despite making up a small portion of assets under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Son himself has conceded that missteps with the original fund are making it difficult to raise money for a successor . He said in February that SoftBank may need to invest in startups using solely its own capital for a year or two . <p> " Vision Fund 1 companies will need more cash and many of them will not be able to get it at the same valuation , which means more losses for SoftBank , " Jefferies ' Goyal said . " Without a second Vision Fund , how will these companies get funding ? " <h> Will He Improve Governance ? <p> Some at SoftBank are resistant to the idea of an oversight committee . Instead , SoftBank is seeking to resolve issues at the Vision Fund with new governance standards for the companies it invests in . The new rules will encompass how the fund approaches the composition of the board of directors , founder and management rights , rights of shareholders , and mitigation of potential conflicts of interest . <p> SoftBank recognized the need for more oversight as early as 2018 , when it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ companies . The COO , formerly the head of Sprint , spent months assembling a team of about 40 executives . In the end , he was forced to cede control of the so-called SoftBank Operating Group to Misra , the head of the fund it was supposed to be overseeing . <h> Will He Support Rajeev Misra ? <p> The spat was only the latest in a string of internal conflicts centered on Misra , the veteran Wall Street trader who once ran the Deutsche Bank subprime team immortalized in " The Big Short . " News reports alleged that Misra masterminded attacks that led to the departures of SoftBank President Nikesh Arora and Alok Sama , a contender for Misra 's position at the Vision Fund . The latest revelations in a Wall Street Journal story last week detailed an alleged smear campaign that included a $500,000 payment to a shadowy Italian businessman who had worked with private intelligence operatives and computer hackers , and attempts at sexual blackmail . <p> " If these allegations are true , Misra has damaged not only his own reputation , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

And for good reason -- as it turns out , there are plenty of unwritten rules you should be aware of . <p> With the approach of the festive season , we spoke to British etiquette coach William Hanson to identify the most common faux pas people make when dining in formal company . <p> Hanson has over 10 years of experience in the subjects of manners and etiquette . He also recently began offering etiquette programmes at The Ritz and has made countless national TV appearances . Needless to say , he knows a thing or too about good manners . <p> From beginning to end , here 's exactly what you should -- and should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Hanson . <h> 1 . Do n't arrive early -- or too late <p> " I think many people today -- especially millennials -- have no idea about when to arrive and when to leave a dinner party , " Hanson told Business Insider . " If the invitation ( or text message ) says 7:30 p.m. then it does not mean you are eating at 7:30 p.m. , so please , whatever you do , do n't arrive at 7 p.m . Your host will have kittens as they wo n't be ready and probably ( if male ) are n't dressed yet . <p> " Neither does it mean you ring the doorbell at 7:30 p.m. , " Hanson said . " In Britain and America it is polite to be 10 to 15 minutes late . Those who do n't get why this is important are invariably those who do not host their own dinners . Anything after 15-20 minutes late and you need to call your host so they do n't start panicking and can adjust their cooking timings . " <p> Here 's an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Easter lunch . <h> 2 . Break your bread <p> " So many people , in social or business settings , will make the mistake of using a knife to cut into their bread roll , and then slather each half with butter , " Hanson said . " You should never use a knife on bread ( a custom that dates back to the Middle Ages ) . <p> " Instead you should break bread -- one small mouthful at a time , then use your butter knife to apply a small portion of butter to that piece , and then eat . Avoid buttering in the air , too . That is what the bread plate is there for . " <h> 3 . Know how to use your napkin <p> Do not immediately unfold your napkin upon sitting down at the table , unless the staff are already bringing out the food , Hanson said . " Take your cue from the hostess , who should unfold her napkin first -- unless there is a major guest of honour present , in which case they should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with the crease/fold facing you , he explained , while smaller napkins are left unfolded . " Never , under pain of death , tuck the napkin into your shirt collar , " he said . <p> Once the meal is finished Hanson advises guests to neatly place the napkin in a heap on the table , to the left hand side in the space where the bread plate was , to be exact . <h> 4 . Work from the outside in <h> source <p> Most people know that , if the table has been set correctly , all the cutlery -including soup spoons and fish cutlery -- will follow the outside-in rule . However , Hanson pointed out that sometimes in American dining settings they do not follow this rule , so beware . <p> " Traditionally , in grand English private houses the pudding ( never ' dessert ' ) cutlery will not be placed above the table setting , like you see today in many restaurants . All cutlery -- for sweet and savoury courses -- are set to the left and right hand side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exception to this rule and places all pudding cutlery above the plate ( with the spoon pointing left , on top , and the fork pointing to the right , below ) , " he said . " They have chosen to do this as it is the more recognised ' international ' table setting , and their guests are largely international . <p> " Very kindly they are making sure their guests are most at ease when dining in the company of royalty , which is excellent manners . " <h> 5 . If you 're left-handed , be subtle <p> The left-handed diners among us will be relieved to know that while years ago people were chastised for not eating the conventional way -- fork in the left hand , knife in the right -- today left-handed dining is not as taboo as it used to be , according to Hanson . <p> " But lefties should not arrive at the table setting and start switching the entire place setting around , " he warned . " Instead , as they pick up each set of cutlery to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the left hand to the right , and the knife from the right to the left . The cutlery is still held in exactly the same way as it would be if you were eating conventionally , however . " <p> He added : " In formal British society ( and informal , in most cases ) people will still judge someone by a lack of a proper understanding as to how to hold their cutlery . If you hold the knife like a pen then brace yourself for social solitude. " <h> 6 . Use your glasses in order -- and hold them correctly <p> The glasses should be placed in a helpful order to dining guests , Hanson said . " Namely , the glass closest to you when you take your seat is the one that is used first . The glass that is furthest away from you will be used last . The glasses will be taken away , one by one , after each course but your water glass will remain on the table throughout , which is why it is usually set a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glasses on the right hand side . <p> " For formal dining you will probably have a wine per course , so pace yourself . You do n't have to finish every drop in every glass -- you are asking for trouble that way . This is also why in more formal settings the glasses are smaller . <p> " All glasses at a table should be stemmed glasses -- there wo n't be any tumblers , even for water . Hold stemmed glasses from the top of the stem , rather than from the bowl . Not only does this stop your hot hands heating up the liquid inside ( and thus changing the flavour ) but also it stops you looking like you 're an alcoholic . " <h> 7 . Do n't ask to be topped up <p> source <p> Shutterstock <p> " Good manners are always about other people , and so we offer the people seated either side of us more drink before we pour for ourselves , " Hanson said . <p> A general rule of thumb to go by is whether or not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If it is then it 's a sign from the host that guests are free to help themselves . <p> " If it is on the side board then it means that the host is in charge of topping everyone up , " Hanson said . " In this case , do not ask directly for more wine . Hopefully they will twig as and when their guests need more . " <h> 8 . Use the bathroom before the meal , not during <p> " Remember that in formal dining -- especially when a member of the royal family is present , but not limited to this -- you do not leave the table during the meal , " Hanson said . " Bladders need to be emptied before the meal and not during so make sure you do n't overload with liquids of any variety during the meal . " <p> Hanson 's top tip for hosts is to serve water at room temperature so that it is absorbed better by the body , instead of iced water which he says flushes through the body . <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ questions <h> caption <h> Nobody wants their dinner party to be awkward . <h> source <h> YouTube <p> If you do n't know your fellow guests well or have never met them before , Hanson advises you play it safe at first and avoid topics such as sex , money , heavy politics , religion , or anything medical . <p> " Ask open questions that will give more fruitful and lingering answers than just queries that lead to yes/no answers , " he said . <h> 10 . Pace yourself <p> This refers to both eating and drinking -- wolfing down your food is impolite . " Everyone should start and finish at more or less the same time . Honourable hosts will have identified the slowest of eaters within their eye line and will be keeping time with them . " <h> 11 . If in doubt , copy what others are doing <p> It 's worth doing your own research into how to approach awkward foods if you expect to be dining in high circles this festive period , particularly if you have an idea of what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food is mussels . " After picking out one mussel with your fork , you then set the fork down on the edge of the plate and use the empty shell of mussel one to pick out all other mussels , " Hanson said . " A finger bowl should be set too , so you can dip your fingers in periodically to clean them . <p> Hanson added : " If you are ever served something that you have no idea how to tackle then just watch to see what your host or the most learned guest at the table is doing and how they are coping . Then copy . "

Photographer : Nicky Loh/Bloomberg <p> Goldman Sachs Group Inc.

Some are already doing so . <p> But health organizations and experts will tell you this is a terrible idea . <p> " Traveling to other cities will only increase the spread of infection . No part of the country is immune , " Ubydul Haque , an epidemiologist at the University of North Texas Health Science Center , told Business Insider . <p> His comments echoed Anthony S. Fauci , the director of the National Institute of Allergy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaving New York might become patient zero in their new destination . <p> But for those facing extenuating circumstances who must leave , Haque offered the following advice : <p> Use private travel and avoid public transportation . New York City is the most densely packed city in the US , with 28,000 residents per square mile . Its mass public transit system and close quarters undoubtedly helped spread the novel coronavirus . So if yours is one of the 45% of households in New York that own a car , drive out of the city . <p> Disinfect everything and use gloves at gas pumps . While on the road , Haque said , disinfect your luggage and minimize contact with anyone . Use disposable gloves , especially at gas pumps , which -- like other frequently touched surfaces -- can harbor bacteria and viruses for a long time . <p> Self-quarantine . When you get to your destination , self-quarantine yourself and any others who traveled with you . New York , for example , has such a high infection rate that the White House has officially asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lived there or were visiting -- to self-quarantine for 14 days . But even if you 're not fleeing New York , self-quarantine is a good practice since even asymptomatic carriers of the COVID-19 virus can infect others for up to 14 days . <p> As for how long you should wait before packing your bags , Haque has this advice : " If I was going to leave , I would have left a long time ago . It 's probably too late now . " <h> Why you should stay put <p> In addition to the possibility that you may spread the novel coronavirus , there are other reasons why you should stay put . <p> " The local infrastructure , especially the health-care infrastructure , is not prepared for the influx of part-time residents , " Governor Phil Murphy tweeted . " Please stay at your primary residences . " <p> Many vacation communities across the country , from Lake Tahoe to the Hamptons , have seen skyrocketing surges in rentals in March and April as schools close and people evacuate to more sprawling areas . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , asked people to stay home , as has the Jersey Shore community . <p> While big-city residents are at a greater risk of catching the disease , those big cities have more resources for handling cases . The rural south reportedly may be " fertile ground " for coronavirus due to a lack of health infrastructure and high rates of poverty . Sometimes smaller hospitals even stabilize patients and then send them to big cities for better or more specialized care . <p> Moreover , staying put is how other countries have fought the spread . Haque recently collaborated on a study that found that a lockdown in Malaysia successfully reduced the spread of the novel coronavirus . There are also signs that the two-month lockdown in Wuhan , China , has helped curb farther spread . <p> The CDC and World Health Organization have n't issued guidelines about whether people should or should not leave hotspots for the coronavirus pandemic .

So meals that we share with family and friends should be treasured . Whether it is for Christmas , a reunion dinner or a birthday celebration , it is often the times spent seated with loved ones around a dining table that form our most cherished memories . <p> As the setting for so many special moments , the design of the dining room is key to an optimal social environment .

@@41974231 <h> What business leaders really think of executive education <h> Matthew Ensor , business director ( advisory services ) at Beca , and an alum of INSEAD executive education , explains what happened when he found himself eager to grow his skill sets to the next level . <p> Asia 's rise has created unique opportunities for both foreign and local companies . However , these come in a environment that forces leaders to become comfortable with uncertainty and define strategies that work at home , regionally and globally . <p> In responding to this landscape , companies have n't lost sight of the need to enhance the skill sets of existing executives . After many years as a leader , this was a position I found myself in . <p> I asked myself how I could achieve the growth required , and realised executive education programmes have become an effective tool in grooming high-potential candidates for leadership roles . <p> It was also clear that both companies and executives need considerable return on their investments -- particularly when an organisation wants the results , but is unfamiliar or inexperienced with the process . <p> Stepping stones <p> Having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company 's 95-year history , the uncertainty both on my part and within my company was high . <p> There were considerable expectations on my shoulders to show that the investment would be worthwhile -- even if what I was expected to deliver was unclear at the time . <p> I encountered some challenges early in the process . <p> To begin with , you only have one chance at choosing the right programme , and it is vital to select the right course at the right business school and -- almost most importantly -- at the right time in your career . <p> Each school has a unique teaching approach that will resound with different people , which makes research important . <h> You only have one chance at choosing the right programme , and it 's vital to select the right course at the right business school and , at the right time in your career . <p> I chose to complete my programme at INSEAD , having found their philosophy that business can be a force for good agreeable with my personal outlook . <p> I also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the New Zealand government ; demonstrating a fit between executive education and my career plan ; securing the buy-in of my company 's CEO and MD ; and ensuring the support of my family . <p> I can confidently say I was able to bring these together , but only through careful planning . <p> My experience delivered on honing existing skills , teaching new ones and creating opportunities to absorb best practice from fellow executives . <p> Personally , I was interested in learning how I could scale my role across Asia , and I was pleased to learn international best practice that I could take back to my company . <p> Despite scepticism , I came away with a strong belief that great global leadership can indeed be taught . <p> However , executive education can also help individuals achieve so much more than tangible , ' hard ' benefits . <p> It not only changed my approach towards business -- putting into a new context everything I had done in my career -- but also addressed aspects of my personality that I never would have otherwise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tools to understand any situation that comes my way , as well as the confidence to use these tools . This new-found self-belief means I always know where to start , regardless of the threat or opportunity at hand . <p> My underlying approach to decision-making was also influenced . <p> Where my preference had always been to make business decisions based on all the information I could find , it was emphasised that with moving up the ladder comes a need for making decisions quickly and intuitively , perhaps with conflicting or ambiguous information . <p> The true discovery was that many executives make those intuitive decisions heavily based on their past experiences , and I was able to improve my instincts on how business works , so that I can make better ' quick ' decisions for my company . <p> Longer term effects <p> For perhaps the first time , I had been opened up to honest , unabridged feedback , receiving coaching from both my professors and fellow participants . <p> This candid approach showed me where I could improve to get more from myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my company . <p> It also gave me confidence in my potential as a leader through being able to benchmark myself against other world-class executives . <h> I was able to improve my instincts on how business works , so that I can make better ' quick ' decisions for my company . <p> The impact continues to be felt every day .

@@41974234 <p> The conservationist has seen some dark days , yet she retains an unshakeable sense of hope . We speak to the celebrated anthropologist about resilience , her forthcoming book -- and why humans and chimpanzees really are n't so different after all <h> Stay in the know <p> Sign up for our weekly newsletter to get all our top stories delivered <h> Thanks ! <p> Jane Goodall is telling me a story from her childhood . One day , as a toddler , she brought earthworms from her family 's garden into her bedroom . Her mother came in to find her observing them intently . She was " wondering how they got around without legs " , Goodall says she told her mother . " While most mothers would get angry , my mother said to me , ' Jane , these poor little worms , if we leave them here , they 'll die . They need to be in the garden ' . So we took them back . " <p> This memory is interrupted when Goodall 's phone rings . Excusing herself , she picks up the call and tells the person on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm on a Zoom call , you see , " straining her voice as she draws out the word " zoom " . Then hangs up . " Sorry , " she says , " that was John Hare -- or the man I call my camel man . His organisation is working to save the last of the wild Bactrian Camels in China and Mongolia . " <p> Digital correspondence is n't her preferred method of communication , but in light of the coronavirus pandemic , video conferencing has become the new normal . Even late-night television has had to reinvent back-and-forth banter with slightly awkward Skype calls between hosts and celebrities . As writers , being in rare positions where we 're able to meet our heroes -- Goodall being one of mine -- we always prefer to speak face-to-face . I make a comment to Goodall that , despite a near-global lockdown , at least technology allows us to carry on with our work and stay in touch with loved ones . She sighs , " Yes , I suppose so . " <p> Goodall with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in northern Tanzania ( Image : Getty Images ) <p> Anne Pusey , primate and lion researcher at the University of Minnesota-St . Paul , suggested to Goodall that she set up a centre to analyse years of data accumulated on primates ( Image : Getty Images ) <h> The Nature of Resilience <p> Goodall is a woman of action who , at age 86 , continues to travel the globe advocating for a better world . In fact , she 's meant to be on a tour across North America , but instead , she 's on lockdown in her home in England -- the home she grew up in , which once belonged to her grandmother . " I 'm working harder than I 've ever worked , getting my voice , and our message , out there on Zoom calls , videos and blogs , " she says , adding that she 's no stranger to the importance of adaptability in nature . <p> In her lifelong career as a conservationist , Goodall has spent 60 years observing and researching wild chimpanzees in Gombe Stream National Park @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jane Goodall Institute , a leader in running **34;4186;TOOLONG programmes across Africa . During this time , she has had a front row seat watching the natural world change , and watching humankind demolish and then rebuild entire ecosystems . <p> " I 've seen places that have been utterly destroyed but , given time and some help , can once again support nature . Animals on the very brink of extinction have been given another chance , " she says , crediting nature itself for instilling an unshakable resilience that has been the driving force behind her life 's work . It 's a kind of resilience that the world could learn from at a time like this . Goodall also lived through World War II as a child , during which she recalls rationing two squares of chocolate and an egg for a week . It was an experience that , she says , taught her never to take anything for granted . " I 've been through the darkest of times and nevertheless , we survived . We emerged . " <h> Story continues below <h> Holding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , one thing is certain for Goodall -- losing hope is n't an option . Ever the optimist , she 's currently working on a book titled The Book of Hope , in collaboration with Doug Abrams , author of the bestselling The Book of Joy . It is scheduled to be published next year . According to the publisher , Celadon Books , " The Book of Hope will serve as an extraordinary exploration of our very nature as human beings and offer a compelling path forward to create hope in our own lives and in the world . " <p> When asked what inspired her to write the book , Goodall admits that it was n't really her idea . " Doug had spent a year with Bishop Tutu and the Dalai Lama before writing The Book of Joy , so when he approached me with the idea for The Book of Hope , I thought he was going to spend some time with me and then write the book . I said that he could have four days , not a year , with me , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " As it turns out , he sold it to the publisher with me as the author . So here we are . " <p> To be fair , a woman on a mission to save the natural world is a busy one -- there is poaching to be stopped and dying species to revive -- and she 's not doing it alone . Books are just one of the many tools Goodall uses to inspire future generations to become better custodians of the planet . Goodall 's previous books include My Friends the Chimpanzees , In the Shadow of Man and The Ten Trusts : What We Must Do To Care for the Animals We Love . <p> Jane Goodall ( Image : Marco Grob/Trunk Archive/Snapper Images ) <p> Goodall attends the Vanity Fair New Establishment Summit at Yerba Buena Center for the Arts in 2015 in San Francisco ( Image : Getty Images ) <p> " I maintain hope partly because everywhere you go , there are young people who are dedicated , passionate , begging to make a change . You ca n't help but be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to mention our amazing brains . We 're now developing technology that will help us live in better harmony with nature , and if we do n't , then I believe that 's the end , because we are a part of , and depend upon , the natural world for our own survival . " <h> Raising Warriors <p> To promote that message , Goodall 's youth programme , Roots &amp; Shoots , was founded in 1991 following a conversation with 16 local teenagers on her back porch in Dar es Salaam in Tanzania . Today , the organisation has more than 10,000 groups in over 100 countries and territories , including Hong Kong . I ask her what decades of teaching starry-eyed , aspiring environmentalists has taught her , and like a reflex , she responds , " It 's not so much teaching , it 's about listening to them : listening to their ideas , encouraging and empowering them to roll up their sleeves and take action . The main message of Roots &amp; Shoots is that each of us makes some impact every day , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> Goodall 's passion for conservation and anthropology began in 1960 , when she was just 26 years old . Travelling to what we now know as Tanzania , armed with a notebook , binoculars and a desire to learn about chimpanzees , she unknowingly embarked on what would become her legacy . In her 60 years of research , Goodall has observed countless parallels between chimpanzees and humans . <p> " Like human mothers , chimp mothers can be good or bad , " says Goodall , who has found that , like with humans , a supportive and nurturing upbringing has the power to shape a chimpanzee 's nature and its ability to lead or influence its peers . " The offspring of supportive mothers always do better in life ; the males reach a higher position in the hierarchy , probably have more offspring , and the females make better mothers . It teaches us how important a mother or a mother figure is for a child , and that the early years are really important for shaping their future . They need to feel supported @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be allowed to explore . " <p> Her words reminded me of a quote by contemporary Canadian poet , Atticus : " Watch carefully , the magic that occurs when you give a person just enough comfort to be themselves . " <h> Embracing the Individual <p> In a roundabout way , Goodall 's approach of gentle guidance circles back to that day she brought earthworms home with her . That same patient observation , which eventually led to decades of groundbreaking research and a lifetime of activism , could have easily been squandered by a mother more concerned with a bit of mud in the house than embracing her daughter 's sense of curiosity . <p> " That 's the sort of mother I had , which is so desperately important . I think children have an inherent affinity for the natural world , if they 're given the chance at a young age , " says Goodall , who believes with such conviction that if guided correctly , we 'll find that a sense of separation between us and nature -- like most , if not all , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Children want to be part of saving the environment , but they 're pressured by their parents and their teachers to go into business . They 're told that they need to go out and make money . But you can help nature even while you 're making money . What we 're in danger of losing now , is empathy . "

The era of the internet has redefined it and has given the people an ability to create content and publish it on social media . In previous years to create videos of different types , one needed corporate backing , a movie studio , a music label , or a venture capital firm . But ever since the era of smartphones things have changed . Arya Toufanian built an empire using viral content and published it on social media . <p> At the age of 18 , after dropping out of The George Washington University he built ' I 'm Shmacked ' , a digital media empire that has created multiple viral videos of the college party scene broadcasting them on Facebook , Twitter , Instagram , and YouTube successfully . The happening shots of college campuses tempted many students as the video showed the campus and the academic environment as well as the party scene of their potential college choices . Arya signed a deal with a management company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he achieved tremendous success . He was the first to film the colleges and publish the videos .

However , his firm a couple of years ago faced backlash by a small group of students who launched a competitor business and tried desperately to ruin his business using false accusations and hate campaigns . Explaining his work , he said that the brand ambassador program launched by him was a program meant to help provide supplemental income to college kids around the country . He details his plan of creating around one hundred brand ambassador pages , one for each major college market he operated in . The goal was to use his main Instagram account which had over 1,200,000 followers to help them grow , eventually making a profit off of local promotions , merchandise , and business dealings with vendors . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was serious and who was n't so he put a price barrier to help filter the less serious candidates . <p> He charged between $300 - $500 as a franchise fee which he thought was reasonable enough for use of his trademark without ostracizing the college market , he says , " I came to that number by basically realizing it is $10 to $16 a day for a month . It 's a one-time payment and the business model allows them to recoup rather quickly if they work . " To begin the brand ambassadors would post content at their college and quickly they grew thousands of followers in the first month . They could sell $11 promotions , ideally three a day resulting in $1,000 a month in total sales . The pages would eventually scale and Toufanian 's vision was to see around one hundred I 'm Shmacked sub-pages creating $3,000 - $5,000 a month where the business would generate gross revenue of $300,000 to $500,000 monthly while building its infrastructure around the nation 's colleges .

If we ca n't make it work then I fear for next season . The game might never fully recover . <p> " The issue of player and staff welfare has to be treated with the utmost seriousness , " Parish wrote in The Sunday Times . " We must bring the players with us , we must listen to them , we must put the health of them and their families front and centre whenever we play again . It should be not just about rendering it safe for them but also making sure they feel safe . <p> " However I 've seen all the proposals for training and travel and while there are challenges , those proposals offer a level of protection to players , staff and officials that I believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in society to co-exist , much safer than a journey to the supermarket at present .

" And we should all care about the money . I 'll tell you why . Nobody wins if the Premier League receives less money . Nobody . We are already facing losses no one can quantify -- and if we do n't finish the season we are entering uncharted waters . "

@@42011235 <h> Guest post The founder 's guide to understanding down rounds <p> During the surge in VC activity and booming startup valuations in Southeast Asia , no one has needed to look at how down rounds work . The economic impact of Covid-19 may change that for startups in the region . Here 's the download . <h> What 's a down round ? <p> A down round is a fundraising transaction in which a company issues shares at a lower price than the price at which it issued shares to investors in an earlier investment round . This is bad news as the company 's valuation has therefore fallen . <p> Does it matter if a company does a down round ? Down rounds in normal economic times can be viewed somewhat negatively . The growth in valuation is critical for existing VCs valuing their portfolio and for companies to attract quality follow-on investors . Down rounds can also put stock option plans underwater and be damaging for founder and employee morale . <p> Aside from this , if founders are considering doing a down round , the key issue they should consider is if their company 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impact the share capital . <h> What are anti-dilution rights ? <p> Anti-dilution rights compensate existing investors for the falling valuation when a down round occurs . The rights are generally attached to preference shares issued to investors . <p> This compensation can happen in a couple of different ways . Some anti-dilution rights are structured so that existing investors are immediately issued extra shares as part of the down round transaction ( as a bonus issue ) . However , in Southeast Asia that mechanism is very rare . Instead , the conversion price is simply adjusted . For example , if an investor invests in a company 's series A round , and then the company goes on to raise their series B at a lower price , anti-dilution rights adjust the conversion price that applies when the existing series A investors finally convert their preference shares into ordinary shares on an exit . <p> The effect is that investors will hold a higher percentage of the company 's overall share capital and receive more proceeds on any exit . It also means that ordinary shareholders , such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> There are two main types of anti-dilution protection : full ratchet and weighted average . <p> Full ratchet anti -- dilution protection gives investors rights to convert their preference shares into ordinary shares at the lower price of the new financing round . This can be brutal for founders in terms of dilution . Thankfully , in Southeast Asia , full ratchets are hardly ever seen . <p> Most investment documents therefore incorporate broad-based weighted average anti-dilution protection . This again results in lowering the conversion price and increasing the number of ordinary shares for investors on an as-converted basis . <p> However , the size of the adjustment is much smaller and depends not only on the price of the down round but also the company 's total share capital . The result is significantly less dilution for ordinary shareholders . <h> The maths involved <p> For those who are interested in seeing how the math of broad-based weighted average works , a typical formula looks like this : <p> The Formula <p> CP2 = CP1 * ( A+B ) / ( A+C ) <p> CP2 = Series @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CP1 = Series A Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to new issue <p> A = Number of Ordinary Shares outstanding immediately prior to new issue ( includes outstanding ordinary shares , all shares of outstanding preference shares on an as-converted basis , and all outstanding options on an as-exercised basis ; and does not include any convertible securities converting into this round of financing ) <p> B = Aggregate investment in new round of financing divided by CP1 <p> C = Number of shares issued in the new round <p> An example of the formula in action . Source : Singapore VIMA lexicon <h> Tips for founders <p> In this new world , startup founders raising capital may need to revisit their startup 's valuation if the economic impacts of Covid-19 mean that the last round valuation can no longer be supported . Down rounds and anti-dilution adjustments are not the only option , however . Founders may want to get creative and consider the following alternatives . <h> Negotiate with investors <p> This is a balance between existing investors ( who expect to be compensated for the lower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but only at the lower valuation ) . If cash is low , existing investors may need to support a new financing . So if you 're a founder , negotiate . Existing anti-dilution rights can be fully or partially waived in connection with the next round . Indeed , this often happens . <h> Founders incentives <p> If you are a founder , you will need to ensure that you are sufficiently incentivised following any dilution of ordinary shareholders . One way could be to agree with investors that an increased portion of any ESOP can be allocated to founders . <h> Convertible notes <p> If your startup needs capital quickly , then a convertible note which converts on the closing of the next equity financing may be a solution . This avoids the dilution caused by the down round . Of course , this does to some extent just kick the valuation discussion down the road and you will need to consider carefully the terms of the note , particularly around the valuation cap and discount . <h> Warrants <p> Startups can also use warrants , which allow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the option of the investors . This de-risks the transaction for investors but gives them the option to double down in the future at the same conversion price if the business is successful at riding out the impacts of Covid-19 . <h> Other investor-friendly terms <p> Finally , startups can keep new investors happy in ways other than valuation . For example , mitigating downside risk by providing other economic rights to the investors , such as higher than market standard 1x liquidation preferences , participating preferences , or other future price adjustment ratchets . Founders will need to weigh up the overall impacts of these as opposed just running with the down round . <p> Lee Bagshaw is a partner at law firm Simmonds Stewart and advises tech startups and venture capital funds in New Zealand and across Southeast Asia .

@@42011236 <h> India : PEs , VCs write to RBI for clarity on NBFC licensing <p> Private equity ( PE ) and venture capital ( VC ) funds have written to the Reserve Bank of India ( RBI ) seeking clarity on its licensing policy for non-banking finance companies ( NBFCs ) . <p> According to two people aware of the matter , RBI has been returning NBFC applications on the grounds that the parent entity of the proposed NBFC entity is not regulated or listed in the headquartered jurisdiction . The central bank has also been rejecting and returning licence applications of those NBFCs that have funding from Mauritius , contending that the country is included in the Foreign Action Task Force ( FATF ) grey list . Simply put , the funding entity is located in a jurisdiction identified by the FATF with weak measures to combat money laundering and terrorist financing . <p> " RBI is unable to carry out satisfactory due diligence for grant of registration , " said the first of the two people mentioned above . <p> In a representation sent by the Indian Private Equity and Venture Capital Association ( IVCA ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foreign funds and have a cascading effect on a cash-strapped NBFC sector . <p> NBFCs have been facing a liquidity shortage since the payment default by Infrastructure Leasing and Financial Services Ltd in 2018 . After the covid-19 outbreak , lenders are investing only in better rated NBFCs . The government and RBI have been taking several steps to ensure that NBFCs , or last-mile lenders , have access to credit for onward lending to small industries . However , the majority of steps have not addressed the need for long-term cash flows . <p> " The position taken by RBI is expected to deprive NBFCs of offshore capital as well as leave them dependent on funds from the domestic market . It will also aggravate the continual liquidity woes of NBFCs and discourage the emergence of innovative NBFC models that PE and VC investors support , " IVCA said in the letter . <p> It requested RBI to reconsider its stand on these issues . One of the reasons for RBI 's reluctance is the varying regulatory and supervisory framework governing PEs and VCs globally . For instance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the fund manager , Singapore requires the exact opposite . <p> " Between full regulation to no-regulation , all sorts of regulatory regimes govern operations of PE and VC investors globally . In such a scenario , rejecting an NBFC application on the grounds that its investors are not regulated or listed in the home jurisdiction seems like a unilateral approach being adopted by India , " said IVCA in the representation . <p> The investors also argued that there is a contradiction in the stance adopted by RBI as far as Mauritius is concerned . Mauritius continues to enjoy free accessibility to Indian companies both under the Foreign Direct Investment ( FDI ) route and the Foreign Portfolio Investor ( FPI ) route . <p> According to Vatsal Gaur , associate partner , HSA Advocates , as of now , there is no clear regulatory answer . <p> " The policy of the government does aim at boosting AIFs ( alternate investment funds ) and that is one reason new NBFC applications have been on hold . Further , many PE funds had been investing in the NBFC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ highly favourable valuations , " Gaur said . <p> With the change in policy surrounding Chinese investments in India , it is possible that the government is therefore relooking at fund structures via Mauritius till such time that there is adequate reliability on Mauritius ' FATF compliance . Mauritian domiciled ECBs ( external commercial borrowings ) are still not restricted , so there may be some ingenuity in structuring of NBFCs that could occur till such time that the regulatory creases are ironed out , Gaur added . <h> Singapore Reporter/s <p> In Singapore , we are looking to double our reporting team by this year-end to comprehensively cover the fast-moving world of funded startups and VC , PE &amp; M&amp;A deals .

The airline was later renamed Malaysian Airways Limited and then Malaysia-Singapore Airlines ( MSA ) . In 1972 , MSA split into Singapore Airlines ( SIA ) and Malaysian Airline System . Initially operating a modest fleet of 10 aircraft to 22 cities in 18 countries , SIA has since grown to be a world-class international airline group . <p> SIA is the world 's most awarded airline , and is committed to the constant enhancement of the three main pillars of its brand promise : Service Excellence , Product Leadership and Network Connectivity . The SIA Group fleet and network have expanded in support of the development of its portfolio strategy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ airline operations . This portfolio of airlines serving short- , medium- and long-haul markets gives the SIA Group more flexibility and nimbleness , with the right vehicles to serve the right markets . <p> In 2018 , Singapore Airlines launched the world 's longest commercial flight , with non-stop services between Singapore and New York , as well as non-stop services between Singapore to Los Angeles , and increased non-stop services to San Francisco , using the new Airbus A350-900ULR ( ultra-long-range ) . In September 2019 , Seattle became the fifth US city in Singapore Airlines ' route network - and the fourth to be served non-stop from Singapore . <p> SIA has invested in new-generation passenger aircraft , which means that it has one of the youngest airline fleets in the world . Operating these fuel-efficient aircraft such as Airbus A350s and Boeing 787s allows SIA to substantially reduce its carbon emissions , and support its goal of operating a more sustainable business . 
@@42014234 <p> Airlines have cut thousands of employees ' work hours in recent weeks , despite a provision of the federal coronavirus bailout prohibiting layoffs or furloughs before September 30 . <p> Now , lawmakers are questioning those airlines and the US Treasury Department , which is administering the bailouts , saying they 're effectively allowing furloughs in all but name , and accusing the Treasury of violating the spirit of the bipartisan relief package that passed in March . <p> Airlines including United and Delta have cut schedules of hourly workers , despite accepting large portions of the $25 billion set aside under the CARES Act for airline payroll support . <p> The airlines have argued that while the law prohibits job cuts , or reductions in pay rate , reductions in hours due to the lack of demand are permissible . Lawmakers , however , argue that the hourly reductions amount to the same thing . <p> In a series of questions sent to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin this week , Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts asked why the Treasury was not taking action against airlines that were cutting workers hours . <p> " Why has Treasury taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cut worker hours , thereby reducing take home pay for workers , " she wrote . <p> Section 4114 of the CARES Act states that airlines receiving payroll assistance through the program must " refrain from conducting involuntary furloughs or reducing pay rates and benefits until September 30 , 2020 . " <p> According to Warren and other lawmakers , cutting hours -- while not explicitly prohibited -- is essentially a pay cut because workers take home less . <p> While the Treasury has issued guidance on several other requirements for airlines receiving the aid , it has not addressed the topic of cuts in work hours . <p> Warren also asked whether Mnuchin or any other Treasury personnel had met with Delta Air Lines representatives to discuss requirements under Section 4114 , and whether any airline had approached Treasury seeking guidance on whether cutting hours or mandating unpaid time off was permissible . <p> Earlier this month , Warren wrote to Delta and JetBlue describing cuts to workers ' hours as " inconsistent with congressional intent and is a blatant and potentially illegal effort to skirt your requirements to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several House Democrats sent a letter to Mnuchin demanding to know whether he had explicitly permitted airlines to cut work hours , but not pay rate . <p> " The creative position held by these airlines is that an hours cut is somehow unrelated to compensation , which is protected under the CARES Act , " Reps . Jan Schakowsky and Jesus Garcia of Illinois and Katie Porter of California wrote in Tuesday 's letter . <p> " The hour cuts imposed by these carriers have made some workers eligible for unemployment assistance -- a circumstance the legislation was explicitly designed to prevent . These carriers are very clearly out of compliance with the letter and spirit of the law . " <p> Some workers , including flight attendants and pilots , often have a minimum number of monthly pay hours in their employment contracts . While many typically work more hours than the minimum during a regular schedule month , and are consequently making less now than they did before , the airlines are prohibited from reducing hours below the minimums.

@@42014236 <p> Some hospitals in the US have established new teams in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic that have been tasked with one very specific duty : flipping patients onto their stomachs ( and then back again ) . <p> The method , called " proning , " has helped save lives during this pandemic , according to healthcare workers on the frontlines . The specialized teams that perform the task help keep some of the burden off nurses , who would otherwise have to coordinate times to come together to flip a single patient . <p> COVID-19 , the disease caused by the coronavirus , is infamous for how it attacks patients ' lungs . As a huge influx of patients with breathing problems flocked to hospitals in recent months , doctors turned to the longtime method of improving breathing . <p> When patients with breathing problems are flipped onto their stomachs , it helps open up the airways in the lungs and makes it easier for oxygen to travel in . In some COVID-19 patients , whose lungs may be filled with fluids , being in this position also helps parts of the lungs that have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The idea of proning patients , or flipping them on their stomachs to help them breathe , has been around for a while , according to Colleen Snydeman , director of the Nursing and Patient Care Services Office of Quality and Safety at Massachusetts General Hospital . <p> Snydeman told Business Insider that as a staff nurse in the 1980s , she proned patients who would benefit from the position , but that the method has " gone in and out of vogue over the years . " <p> At Massachusetts General Hospital , proning is a method that was in use before the pandemic , for example on patients in operating rooms , and hospitals have long used the method to treat patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ARDS ) . <p> Snydeman says that healthcare workers in countries like Italy and China that were hit earlier by the coronavirus than the US also reported the benefits of proning patients with COVID-19 . <h> Creating enough proning teams to meet the surge of COVID-19 patients coming in is like ' flying a plane without really learning how to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ US became inundated with COVID-19 patients with breathing complications , proning became a straightforward way to improve survival rates in patients on ventilators , and a way to keep less sick patients off the machine altogether . <p> The issue with proning is that it requires a lot of hands : at least four individuals have to be ready and around the patient in order to flip them properly without causing complications or further damage to physically weak patients . <p> " It was something that was being done , but definitely not at the rate that it 's been done now with COVID-19 patients , " Snydeman said . <p> This has led some hospitals , like Massachusetts General Hospital , to develop and train " proning teams " who go around the hospital in groups of four flipping patients onto their stomachs , and then back again . <p> Karen Miguel , a registered nurse at Massachusetts General Hospital 's Patient Care Services department is one of the leads on the hospital 's new proning program . She told Business Insider that setting up and organizing the team @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to prone patients day in and day out was like " flying a plane without really learning how to do it in flight " because of how quickly things had to move and change amid circumstances . <p> " This was , try things and if it did n't work in real-time , change it , " said Miguel who helped recruit , train , and dispatch dozens of healthcare workers for teams who would be on watch 24/7 for patients who needed to be flipped onto their stomachs . <p> The process of flipping a patient is similar to making a bed while a patient is in it , said Miguel , which is a common practice for nurses caring for patients unable to move easily . <p> After disconnecting all the wires and tubes that can be safely removed for a minute or two , the patient is carefully moved away from their ventilator and then turned on their side . Sheets are placed underneath their body to help the transition . <p> Then they 're placed on their stomachs as the dirty sheets slide through and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things like pillows that help position thems comfortably . Afterward , every wire and tube is placed back where it 's supposed to be . <p> The process may sound simple enough , but any slight movement can cause a patient to become unstable , especially because those on ventilators tend to be in critical condition . The flip itself can be nerve-wracking , especially at first . <p> " It 's a pretty intense time for the staff , " Miguel said . " There 's always an anxiety when you 're not good at something . You 're always worried that you 're going to miss something . " <p> But the good part of being on a team , Miguel says , is that there are eight eyes on the patient at all times as they 're being flipped , meaning there 's no shortage of people giving feedback and making sure things are going smoothly . <h> Flipping COVID-19 patients is especially difficult because they 're often " the sickest of the sick " <p> Cooper Health , in New Jersey , is relying on proning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The teams include CRNAs , EMTs , physical therapists , and other workers . <p> The act of proning a patient is much harder to do than it might seem because the patients tend to be very sick . <p> " It 's a challenging job because of the meticulous care and caution that needs to be done when you 're turning these patients who are among the most fragile , " said Dr. Stephen Trzeciak , chief of medicine at Cooper University Health Care . " They 're just barely clinging to life and you have to be very careful as you do that . " <p> And it 's not just critical patients on ventilators that are being proned in hospitals . <p> Dr. Mangala Narasimhan , regional director for critical care at Northwell Health in New York , has been helping her hospital 's coordination of critical care for COVID-19 patients .

In this episode of Prestige Detour , we discover Egypt 's old treasures and new glories . <p> A small riverboat manned by two brightly dressed Nubian men rushed at our ship seemingly out of nowhere . They lassoed a rope to our vessel to keep pace with our cruising speed . This " pirate " move in the middle of River Nile had us darting to the starboard side wondering what would come next . Three more local boats joined us . <p> " 200 ! 200 ! " yelled one man , who threw a bundle an impressive four decks up onto our poolside while the other furiously paddled to steady their boat . We curiously peered through the transparent plastic bag to find a colourful Egyptian galabeyya ( traditional Egyptian garment ) inside . One guest threw it back at them , shouting , " 100 !

This unplanned shopping spree in the spirit of supporting the locals and testing our aim on the world 's longest river was a first for us . This experience would in fact be one of several firsts during my fascinating 10- day journey across the land of the Pharoahs . <h> An Ancient Wonderland <p> Pompey 's Pillar in Alexandria <p> Some of my friends had felt it was lion-hearted to visit Egypt with the family . " Is it safe ? Do you need police escorts ? " they asked earlier . At one point during the trip , our Egyptologist guide Ivy from well-reviewed tour agency Abercombie &amp; Kent had reassured us of our safety : " The media hypes up Egypt 's former troubles . " In a world where caution is required while travelling to any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our holiday with a reliable vendor , we had every confidence that our week-long sojourn , which kicked off in Alexandria , would be enjoyable and fruitful . <p> Situated on Egypt 's northern coast along the Mediterranean Sea , Alexandria was once the largest city and most influential cultural centre in ancient times , and an important trading hub between Asia and Europe . It was founded by Alexander the Great in 331BC during his conquest of the region , but it was his Ptolemies ( local rulers ) who then buried his body there and developed the city . <p> During the heyday of its Hellenistic period , it was home to the legendary Lighthouse of Alexandria , one of the seven wonders of the ancient world , as well as a storied library that housed 700,000 books . We visited the reincarnated library in the disc-shaped , ultra-modern Bibliotheca Alexandrina , which also houses four major museums and a planetarium . The day continued with a trip to the Catacombs of Kom El Shoqafa , a well-preserved necropolis featuring a series of tombs cut into solid rock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ levels . Next was Pompey 's Pillar , a Roman triumphal pillar in Egypt and one of the largest monolithic pillars ever to be created ; then onwards we went , to the Alexandria National Museum showcasing artefacts that brought to life the city 's importance to the Egyptian narrative . <p> The archaeological site of Abu Simbel , which is made up of two massive rock temples , dates back to around 1265BC and is now a UNESCO World Heritage . <p> A well-deserved respite from the heat and dust at the end of the day came in the form of the luxurious 19-storey Four Seasons Hotel Alexandria in San Stefano , which is a swanky waterfront neighbourhood right on the shores of the Mediterranean . Although it is a decade old , the <p> property adorned in classic European elegance remains the city 's most exclusive and upscale tourist address . In addition to its prime location within the San Stefano mall , which offers a convenient spot of shopping , it is connected via an underpass to its own sandy and sheltered private beach that is open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several casual or family-friendly dining options , which serve both local cuisine and international fare , my two kids preferred dining in the comfort of our room wrapped in fluffy bathrobes .

My children were delighted that the hotel provided them with their own check-in counter . An opulent , 331-room retreat fabulously located on the River Nile overlooking the Cairo Column , it offers endless views , including a breathtaking sunset on the rooftop that evening . Below us the Nile was serene , the traffic manic and the ancient structures bathed in an orange glow . This is Cairo , a heady mix of chaos , calm and character . <p> With nine dining establishments at The Nile Ritz-Carlton , Cairo , we were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NOX , we were greeted with the mesmerising backdrop of Cairo lit up to the nines .

At the Museum of Egyptian Antiquities , it was astounding how casually the artefacts were exhibited -- unsealed and almost carelessly placed such that we were able to get up close for an intimate experience . We examined the Palette of Narmer and Tutankhamun 's tomb items , and also purchased a special pass to the mummies room that featured famous royalty such as Ramses II . <p> A visit to the ancient city ruins of Memphis rewarded us with the arresting sight of an 84-tonne statue of Ramses II . To my delight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Sah Rah " , which prompted me to snap a picture to send to my friend Sarah . At the Saqqara necropolis , which is northwest of Memphis , we marvelled at the commanding Step Pyramid , the earliest colossal stone building in all of Egypt . The Pyramids of Giza were enroute back to Cairo , and the Great Pyramid was larger than I had expected . A venture into its core by crouching through tunnels was thrilling and highly recommended . In the pyramid complex , we even had time to relax on camel-back and take in the mighty Sphinx by sunset . <p> Camel rides across the pyramid plateaux complete the exotic experience . <p> Old Cairo , which is the city 's most historic area pre-dating the founding of modern Cairo , gave us an insight to some of the oldest religions of the world . Al Moez street has the largest gathering of Islamic artefacts and mosques globally . The highlight among the many Coptic Christian churches there is the Al Muallaqa , also known as The Hanging Church dating back to the 3rd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two towers of the Babylon Fortress gate .

A few hours prior , in the early morning , we had taken a side trip further south to the colossal temples of Abu Simbel , which were built by Ramses II 30 centuries ago in the Egyptian part of ancient Nubia . Abercrombie &amp; Kent reps then escorted us onto our abode for the next five days -- the Sanctuary Nile Adventurer .

The daily adventures -- interspersed with opportunities to sample Egyptian wines and essential oils , and buy alabaster vases , Egyptian cotton and papyrus art -- were undertaken in the lap of sheer comfort . For instance , cold towels and chilled fresh lemonade awaited us upon our return . Out on the water , the affable staff continuously ploughed us with snacks and drinks . For meals , we were served gourmet fare prepared by award-winning chefs aboard . <p> Learning to read hieroglyphs is part of the fun of an Egyptian escapade . <p> Our first afternoon was spent riding a felucca ( a traditional Egyptian sailboat ) in the waters of Aswan -- around Elephantine Island and Kitchener 's Island , and past the Agha Khan Mausoleum .

After hopping onto a short motorboat ride , we landed on Agilika Island where we visited the romantic and majestic Philae Temple , and also saw the granite quarries that used to supply the ancient Egyptians with most of the hard-stone blocks . Following this , we headed north towards the magnificent Temple of Kom Ombo on the mainland by the river . It was dedicated to the crocodile god of fertility Sobek , and is home to many mummified crocodile remains . <p> On the third morning , we stopped along Edfu and explored the extraordinary Temple of Horus before arriving at the city of Esna . There , Ivy took us around the Greco-Roman Temple of Khnum whose beautifully preserved Great Hypostyle Hall was built during the reign of the Roman Emperor Claudius . While strolling in the nearby village , we encountered yet more mummified crocodiles hung over doorways for good luck .

Interestingly the word " ammonia " traced its roots to this very sanctuary , as the food offerings here would rot and give off an odour . <p> Winter solstice at the Sanctuary of Amun . <p> Both Karnak and the Temple of Luxor slightly further afield were strikingly graceful and sprawling .

Take this time to wish your Muslim staff a healthy and happy Ramadan . <p> A simple " Ramadan Kareem " ( Have a generous Ramadan ) or " Ramadan Mubarak " ( Blessed Ramadan ) , for the start of the month , and " Eid Mubarak " to signify the last day of Ramadan ( Eid-al-Fitr ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> As for prayer timings , Malaysia and Singapore differ in their stipulated timings . Further , each state in Malaysia could also have their own set of rules . As such , be sure to check out the designated websites to know these timings , so you can be aware when your employees have to head out for their prayers . <h> Be sensitive to those who can and can not fast <p> Ensure you and your colleagues are sensitive not just to those who are fasting , but to the Muslims who are n't fasting , or ca n't fast for certain reasons . Chances are , the latter groups may feel conscious eating or drinking while their fellow Muslims are fasting . <p> You could remind everyone to be aware of this . Try and encourage those who ca n't fast to have lunch with their colleagues as per usual instead of eating alone , so that they do n't feel awkward when surrounded by supportive colleagues . Do also remind non-Muslims not to eat right in front of their Muslim colleagues , unless these colleagues are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flexibility as required <p> As those observing Ramadan will have to prepare for Iftar ( evening meal where they break fast ) , it will be really helpful if they are allowed to leave work 30 minutes to an hour early . This way , not only do they get to prepare early , but they also do get to rest on time to wake up for their pre-dawn meal ( Suhoor ) the next day . <p> Further , if your work allows , this would be a great time to introduce flexible working practices such as shift work or job swapping - so that , colleagues are able to work in tandem with each to get the job done , albeit with tweaked or flexible work timings . <p> When it comes to holding meetings , try to keep them in the mornings when those who are fasting still feel relatively more fresh , as opposed to the afternoon where energy levels can take a dip given just how humid Southeast Asian climates can be . <h> Ultimately , be the most supportive you can be <p> At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plays an important role in ensuring Muslim employees have a good , fruitful Ramadan at work . Fasting for 16-18 hours a day is no easy task , therefore it is important for managers and colleague to be mindful of how this can impact behaviours and work practices . <p> In line with this , if your budget allows it , it would be lovely to host an Iftar at office itself , allowing fasting staff to break their fast and sharing a glimpse of an important part of their lives with their non-fasting colleagues . <p> Your full support will help your colleagues grow during this period , which will in turn help everyone else make use of the safe space to grow spiritually , mentally and culturally . <p> The Human Resources team wishes all our Muslim readers a Blessed Ramadan . <p> We use cookies and other tracking technologies to improve your browsing experiences on our website , to show you personalised content and targeted ads , to analyze our website traffic and to understand where our visitors are coming from .

@@42067230 <p> TAIPEI , TAIWAN - Media OutReach - 20 June 2020 - The 2020 Tang Prize in Sinology was awarded to renowned historian Wang Gungwu " for his trailblazing and dissecting insights on the history of the Chinese world order , Chinese overseas , and Chinese migratory experience . As the leading scholar on Sino-Southeast Asian historical relations , he developed a unique approach to understanding China by scrutinizing its long and complex relation with its southern neighbors . His erudition and critical discernment have significantly enriched the explanation of the Chinese people 's changing place in the world , traditionally developed from an internalist perspective or in relation to the West . " <p> Born in Surabaya in the Dutch East Indies ( today 's Indonesia ) in 1930 to Chinese parents , Prof. Wang grew up and received education in British Malaya , and later pursued advanced studies in London , where he got a PhD degree from SOAS , the University of London in 1957 . His subsequent academic appointments brought him to Singapore , Malaysia , Hong Kong , Australia and the United States . He was president of the University of Hong Kong from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All Souls College , a Rockefeller visiting fellow at the University of London and recipient of Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1991 . Currently , he is university professor at the National University of Singapore . <p> Spending much of his life immersed in different cultures gives Prof. Wang diverse personae as a scholar . He is an " insider " in the academic tradition of Chinese Confucianism and British elite education , and an " outsider " in the interpretation of China 's perception of the world . " What drew me to that subject ( Chinese overseas ) was what China meant to the world outside , especially to those Chinese who had left the country and settled abroad , " so remarked Prof. Wang in his memoir , Home Is Not Here . His original approach to understanding China from the southern perspective is in part a natural choice given his personal experience . This same experience provided him with abundant inspiration in his formative years as he matured into an authoritative voice in the analysis of China 's worldview . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refer to words such as hua qiao ( Chinese expatriates ) commonly seen in Chinese-language newspapers . The word qiao is defined as people who lodge in places or countries other than their ethnic origin . Qiao first appeared in Wei Shu ( The Book of Wei ) and Jin Shu ( The Book of Jin ) , written during the period of China 's Six Dynasties , and referred to sojourning in a foreign land . However , when reality forced Chinese migrants to extend their stay , their sojourn turned into long or even permanent residence , and what changed was their sense of identity . Enlightened by his family and educational background , Prof. Wang knows too well that the development of an identification is more an emotional process than a rational decision . In addition , because one 's identity implicates one 's psychological state , it can undergo a transformation whenever one 's circumstances change . Therefore , there is never a clear-cut answer when it comes to identity . Prof. Wang , taking advantage of his western academic training , is able to look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by tracing the history of qiao and eventually came up with the idea known as " Chinese overseas . " <p> His many books , written with first-hand life experience and erudition on Southeast Asian history as well as sophisticated analysis of the role of the Chinese in the region past and present , are now classics in the field . Among dozens of pioneering works he has published , there are A Short History of the Nanyang Chinese ( 1959 ) , The Structure of Power in North China During the Five Dynasties ( 1963 ) , The Chinese Overseas : From Earthbound China to the Quest for Autonomy ( 2000 ) , and Renewal : The Chinese State and the New Global History ( 2013 ) . <p> Prof. Wang 's research is an integration of a variety of histories , including the history of Chinese overseas , of China 's relation with the outside world , of Southeast Asia , and of commerce and maritime history . Examining shifting world orders with a sophisticated mind is what puts him in the vanguard of Chinese overseas studies . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ History and Philology , Academia Sinica , pointed out that Prof. Wang 's academic achievements are characterized by his ability to " look at the big picture , reference the present with the past , and put forward his original views , " which has allowed him to develop a panoramic view of the history of China and of the Chinese overseas . Together with Prof. Yu Ying-Shih , inaugural Tang Prize laureate in Sinology and academician at Academia Sinica , Prof. Wang is also widely recognized among the top living authorities on Chinese history . <p> Established by Taiwanese entrepreneur Dr. Samuel Yin , the biannual Tang Prize consists of four categories , namely Sustainable Development , Biopharmaceutical Science , Sinology and Rule of Law , with NT$40 million ( approx . US$1.33 million ) in cash and a research grant of NT$10 million ( approx . US$0.33 million ) allocated to each category .

@@42074236 <h> Performance vs potential : The age-old debate among managers <h> Aditi Sharma Kalra 's take on how to reap the benefits of a multi-talented team that features both high-performers and high-potentials . <p> You 've been staffed on a high-impact , high-risk project that needs to be delivered " yesterday " : would you rather pick a high-performer or a high-potential to join you on this mission ? Perhaps on another occasion , you would n't have to make the difficult choice at all -- as one candidate is more proactive than the other , thus putting up their hand after analysing the big-picture perspective . <p> Do n't worry , this is not a particularly puzzling episode of Would You Rather ? , but instead a humble take on solving the age-old conundrum of potential versus performance , and how to reap the benefits of a multi-talented team that features both high-performers and high-potentials . <p> It 's easy to confuse the two though , and not just for relatively new managers . The reason being is that not many organisations clearly define the attributes and competencies valued in their ideal employees . <p> " That means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assess potential . As a result , they focus exclusively on performance , that is , KPIs , project achievement , and event-based evaluation , which can be a problem , " explains Haileena binti Husin , Senior Manager -- Talent Acquisition &amp; Management , Composites Technology Research Malaysia . " High performance is so extremely easy to observe that it drowns out the less obvious attributes and behaviours that characterise high potentials -- like managing change or learning capabilities . " <p> Put another way , high-performers undergo a more objective assessment , while the assessment for high-potentials tends to be more subjective , says Sally Tang , Regional HR Director , Asia Pacific , Soletanche Bachy . She also finds that typically , high-performers are " good at a particular task , expert in their own field , so more of an IQ person " , while for high-potentials , their ability to adapt to changes typically means they have a good mix of EQ as well as IQ -- thus making them more employable . <p> This trait of high-performers being exceptionally good at their given task @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Haileena explains : " High-performers stand out from average performers and consistently exceed expectations . They are great at their job , but may not have the potential ( or the desire ) to succeed in a higher-level role or to tackle more advanced work . " <p> Mausami Arora , Singapore Head of HR , British American Tobacco Singapore , agrees : " High potential reflects the capabilities required for the next level , while high performance reflects the capacity to deliver outstanding results with significant stretch at the current level . <p> " A common misconception is an assumption that your high performer by default carries the aspiration to move to the next level . With all good intention , you push them to uncomfortable territory for development , only to realise the disengagement and sub optimal results later . " <p> I agree on the ability of high-performers to lead the toughest of projects , yet , get the job done fabulously and well on time ; while high-potentials bring skills that focus more on collaboration , empathy and the bigger picture . <p> I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teams , and it is evident how important the contribution of each demographic is to the end result , given each one 's strengths at the table . In that case , the next question is how we can engage and reward both types of talent better . <p> One surefire way to lose our top talent , and this is derived from feedback sessions in Haileena 's organisation , is to lack clear direction or transparency on the employee 's career path . <p> Mausami attests to this : " An inability to stay in sync with top talent 's needs is a surefire mistake to lose them . What goes a long way in building connect is the line manager 's investment in regular conversations on performance with an emphasis on their development and career-next steps . " <p> Jaya Mittal , HR Director , Sealand -- Asia Pacific , and Maersk -- Thailand , Malaysia , Singapore , weighs in with her experience on her number one strategy for top talent . " The best strategy for developing and rewarding high-potentials is to give them larger and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get the high-impact experiences that help them take on larger and bigger responsibilities to create an impact , " she says . <p> " Of course , we do need to match it with the necessary compensation . However , more important , is the role and growth they can look forward to . " <p> Similarly , for high-performers , she explains : " High-performers also need to experience meaning , engagement and challenge in their assignments . They need respect and recognition for the expertise they bring . Rewards and bonuses , especially the short-term bonuses , are important to recognise their contribution to the organisation . " <p> However , she adds they also need to experience rotations and take different and challenging tasks to keep them engaged -- albeit with a caveat , in their case there may be more lateral movements rather than vertical ones . <p> Concurring with the HR leaders , I agree on the ability of high-performers to lead the toughest of projects , yet , get the job done fabulously and well on time ; while high-potentials bring skills that focus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Both bring to the table qualities that a winning team absolutely can not do without !

The reason I was finally convinced was because my mentor , Yuen Woo-ping -- the man who brought me into the industry -- was going to direct it , so I said yes because it was a matter of respect and face , but that 's it . I said it to the producer 's face , too . I was n't that interested . " <p> But then came Star Wars and Yen signed up . The prevailing reason is because of his children 's enthusiasm for the franchise , but there 's more than that , Yen saw an opportunity . " When I took on the role in Rogue One , I felt it was important for me to take a step forward , to develop it so that it would be less clich ? d , " he says . " I know they wanted Donnie Yen because he 's Ip Man . They wanted Ip Man in Rogue One . I get it .

But if you think he 's a clich ? on screen , you should 've seen the original script they offered me . It was why I was initially hesitant to take on the role . But I understand why . They ca n't have an overhaul overnight . There 's a large audience that has never watched Asians in films before , so it takes time for them to process an Asian actor . To realise that he 's no different from a Caucasian actor or a black actor . " <p> While studios are still taking their sweet time introducing Asian faces to Western cinema , the very same ones are casting Chinese mega stars for films that want to make bank in the booming market of the Middle Kingdom . Big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been slotted into feature-length blockbusters and given one line to mumble , to cater to the Chinese market . Unsurprisingly , this tactic has failed . <p> When I mention this to Yen and suggest that Hollywood might be wise to adjust , he 's quick to jump in . " They 'd better adjust , " he says . " They need to learn from their mistakes . Look at all these actors and actresses that now say no . It proves it does n't work . You ca n't just put an Asian actor in there and expect that , because they show up for a second , you 've covered the Asian market . That is a joke . <p> Jacket and Trousers : Dsquared2 , Jumper : Sandro <p> " I 'm glad Asian actors are stepping up and saying no . If you 're gon na spend months away from home and devote time in your life to work on a film it had better be worth it . " <p> So what does Yen find worth his time ? Constant revolution , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way for Asian actors to have more depth in American movies , he 's working on reshaping the perception of action stars -- and it 's to his credit that he 's beginning to be lauded as much for his acting as his martial-arts mastery . <p> This year , Yen produced Chasing the Dragon , a film directed by Wong Jing and set in 1960s and ' 70s Hong Kong , in which he also portrays Crippled Ho , based on the notorious Hong Kong gangster Ng Sek-ho ( or Limpy Ho , as he was known at the time ) . To prepare for the character , Yen asked for the opinion of stage actors to bring an added dimension to his years of screen acting . He reworked his standard Hong Kong Cantonese into a bawdy Chiu Chow accent . The usually nimble Wing Chun master becomes a feisty cripple with a bad leg . Yen even made the trip to Ng Sek-ho 's hometown in China to give himself the space to enter the mind of the man . <p> But what Yen really loves is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day one of filming Chasing the Dragon I knew I wanted to incorporate soul train , disco and funk , " he says . " I lived through the ' 60s and the ' 70s so I said , ' You know what , you put these elements into a Hong Kong gangster movie , you 'll give it a new flavour . ' Most traditional gangster movies use saxophone scores , sad stuff . Other directors use more pop stuff , John Lennon , straight-laced white stuff . It occurred to me that Hong Kong movies rarely use strong black music . " <p> " If you look at films like Martin Scorsese 's Goodfellas , everyone is a gangster , but you do n't get that sense of melancholy and depression . They 're all happy and really cool . That 's what I wanted Chasing the Dragon to be . The film might be telling a sad story at the end of the day , but throughout the journey , for the characters , I wanted there to be a sense that it was a big long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as it 's sad . Yen is more than happy to delve into and grapple with the relationship between British colonial rulers and Hong Kong subjects . " These are all facts , " he says without compunction . " Hong Kong was a British colony and for decades places like The Hong Kong Club were inaccessible to the local Hong Kong Chinese . It 's all very true . We Chinese were suppressed for the longest time , and during that era this was just a fact of life . " <p> There 's a difference between knowing that there 's an elephant in the room and blowing it out into the open , I posit . " But why would n't I tell it ? " he says . " I think it 's not told enough . I mean , it was only a two-hour film , so we could only touch on the political circumstances and the racial discrimination . But it 's been going on for hundreds of years . Not only in Hong Kong . This is a social ill . White supremacy has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're telling a story about the 1970s there 's no way to avoid this . " <p> Is this , then , what Yen wants audiences to take away ? For all the tough stories he loves to tell , that 's emphatically not the message . " At the end of the day , " he says , " a successful film delivers a story about humanity . No matter the subject matter . No matter the political message . The most important thing is humanity . <p> " It 's about the human propensity to face any hurdle regardless of caste or creed . Crippled Ho 's hurdle was to live under British rule because he was born into that era . So he faced a lot -- but I wanted to use this character to say that in life , for anybody , what matters at the end of the day are family , friends , principles , and above all , integrity .

SMPs ( Small and Medium Accounting Practices ) in Singapore , in particular , are facing issues in meeting reporting deadlines due to a reduction in employee mobility and widespread lockdowns ; posing difficulties in gathering audit evidence and finishing audit assignments . SMPs are also confronting technical issues , for example , audit and advisory risks relating to uncertainties in the valuation of inventories and receivables ; assessing going concern assumptions ; and relevant disclosures in the financial statements . <p> If there is a bright spot in all of this , we can reflect on the fact that while Covid-19 has generated many challenges , it is also spurring SMPs to relook their current business models and the services they provide . SMPs are being motivated to step out of their familiar environments to generate greater business value for themselves and their clients . <p> As an SMP , you may wonder how you will be able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resources , talent , expertise and the uncertainties in moving ahead into a new service line when it is not clear to you whether there is a critical number of clients who will use your service . <p> However , there are two important questions that you will need to ask even before you embark on providing a new service : <p> Is there industry data available to confirm that there is demand for your new service ? <p> Will implementing the new service be accompanied by a rise in productivity ? <p> Tip #1 : Digitalise your business then diversify for higher productivity . Industry data shows that SMPs in Singapore that embark on diversification ( before digitalisation ) appear to suffer from lower productivity ( see the Figure below ) . However , those that digitalise before they diversify , showcase higher productivity levels . Therefore , we would advise SMPs to avoid the natural urge to diversify ; without first reflecting on your productivity levels to decide if digitalisation is necessary . <p> Tip #2 : Diversify services beyond regulatory compliance to stay competitive . According to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3 out of the top 5 service lines demanded by SMEs and other corporates , were non-regulated services , as follows : <p> Statutory audit ( regulated ) <p> IT solution business ( non-regulated ) <p> Tax Compliance ( regulated ) <p> Risk Advisory ( non-regulated ) <p> Tax Advisory ( non-regulated ) <p> One of the most critical observations from the report is that there is a significant increase in demand for non-regulated services in recent years . Moving forward , your firm would do better if it explores advisory services , rather than remaining firmly fixed on compliance services . <p> Tip #3 : Be aware and anticipate the demand for professional services to ensure a more sustainable practice . Review and scan the latest industry data on the most demanded professional service lines . The ACCA-SAC Market Demand report ( 2018 ) is a good source for this information . It tracks demand for professional services in the Asia-Pacific region . When embarking on new services , it is equally essential to ensure that it also leads to higher productivity . <p> The Top 10 Demanded Services @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ competencies to ensure efficient use of resources and lower transformation costs . To identify your firms current readiness to embark on a new service or transformation journey , you will need to assess where the company is presently with regards to digitalisation and diversification . The matrix below can help you in identifying your firm 's current ' ' persona ' ' for this purpose ; as well as your ' ' target ' ' persona . <p> Tip #5 : Start from your strengths and work on it ! Your current skillsets may very well be the starting point to developing expertise that enables you to provide new and innovative services in the future . So , begin with your current strengths . For example , we usually think of a service line like ' ' statutory audit , ' ' for example , as a single service . However , look more closely and you may be surprised that it is actually a bundle of different services : risk assessments , internal control evaluation , valuation and other services . <p> See below for an illustration of how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For example , inherent risk assessment is an integral part of a statutory audit . If we intensify the development of skillsets in your firm relating to the evaluation of inherent risks , we can generate a new separate risk advisory service . Similarly for the other tasks . <p> So do scrutinise your current services and unbundle the distinct tasks that could be used as the starting points for new services . <p> Tip #6 : Move incrementally towards greater diversification . To minimise pain points , use specific progression pathways towards best practice and higher productivity . Review the illustrative progression pathways in the SAC-ACCA Quick Guide below to help you to review your current service and see how it could help you reach your target service , through incremental steps . <p> The SAC-ACCA Quick Guide and the six crucial things you should do in this article requires you , the SMP business owner , to assess your environment , as well as your strengths and weaknesses , while keeping an eye on the demand for various professional services , that changes in response to business practices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about your journey ; and not to imitate what others are doing but independently decide for yourself what is the correct transformation pathway for your firm , considering profitability and productivity .

@@42103232 <h> Share <p> Singapore 's largest bank has rolled out a finance framework and taxonomy to guide carbon-intensive clients towards a low-carbon economy . <p> With its latest framework , DBS will evaluate the economic activities and strategy of their clients to assess if they are in line with the Paris Agreement . <p> " There are many interpretations of what constitutes transition finance . The bottom line is we can not afford to dismiss clients who carry out activities which are less than dark-green but are nonetheless part of the mainstream economy instrumental to getting us below a 1.5-degree temperature increase , " said Yulanda Chung , DBS 's head of sustainability finance , in a statement . <p> Transition finance refers to any form of financial support that helps high-carbon companies implement long-term changes to become greener , while dark-green describes companies that are in line with a low-carbon future . <p> " Green finance is still a niche market . If we look at green bonds for example , the majority of issuers will be looking at underlying assets , for instance green buildings and renewable energy projects . We have n't seen many other types @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into green finance , and for good reasons , because we do n't want to adopt the practice of greenwashing , " Chung told Eco-Business . <p> Research has shown that 83.7 per cent of Southeast Asia 's current and planned fossil fuel generation assets are incompatible with the Paris Agreement , leaving a large market eligible for transition financing . <p> Under DBS 's framework , projects will be classified under three categories -- " green " , " in transition " , and/or " contributing to the United Nations ' Sustainable Development Goals ( UN SDGs ) " . The third category specifies which UN SDGs and targets that the project contributes to . <p> " Take the example of a steel producer that is installing a more energy-efficient blast furnace to significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions at the plant . We might consider that in transition , but not green because fossil fuels are still being used , " said Chung . <p> DBS will conduct the evaluation and categorisation of each client project through an internal three-tier process , and said it would enlist the help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of fossil fuel lock-in or rebound effects <p> DBS has received a second-party perspective for its transition framework from independent research-based organisation CICERO Green , which has published a qualitative review of the environmental strategies and risks companies can take . <p> In its report , CICERO Green highlighted that some " project categories contain a risk of fossil fuel lock-in that will require active follow-up during implementation " . <p> Some of the transition projects such as the shipping , aviation , automotive industries and technologies that use oil , natural gas , shale gas , biofuels and alternative fuels may not promote the scale of ambition needed to achieve the Paris agreement climate goals , CICERO Green opined . <p> Echoing similar concerns , Helena Wright , vice president of Asia Sustainable Finance at World Wide Fund for Nature ( WWF ) said : " To further strengthen this approach , it will be important to ensure that financing for incremental improvements does not inadvertently lock in emissions , but leads to improvements over time towards the overall goal of reaching net zero emissions . " <p> Projects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may also lead to rebound effects , CICERO Green reported . With reduced costs due to power pollution levels or emissions intensity , companies might be incentivised to do more of the same activity . <p> Chung explained that DBS is aware of these climate risks , and that what is considered " in transition " is contextual . The taxonomy takes different considerations into account , such as the type of asset , location and lifespan before labelling a project as in transition . <p> " Rather than looking at the economic activity in isolation , we will also look at the company 's overall strategy . So the categorisations are based on a combination of both asset-specific and strategic evaluation of the company as a whole , " Chung said . <p> " Take the example of a gas fired power plant . What is the system-wide transformation that is needed for that country to make the transition to clean energy ? When it comes to power generation , we 'll look at the transmission and distribution network .

@@42121235 <h> GE2020 : SDP fails to make inroads despite change of strategy <p> The Singapore Democratic Party 's ( SDP ) strategy of focusing its firepower on single seats failed to bear fruit last night , as the party lost in all five constituencies it contested - even as a nationwide swing towards opposition parties helped raise vote shares . <p> The party 's top two leaders - secretary-general Chee Soon Juan and chairman Paul Tambyah - both improved on their party 's performances in Bukit Batok and Bukit Panjang , but neither did well enough to secure a Non-Constituency MP ( NCMP ) seat as one of the best-performing losers . Professor Tambyah was the party 's best performer with 46.26 per cent of the votes in Bukit Panjang . <p> The party 's candidates in Holland-Bukit Timah GRC , Marsiling-Yew Tee GRC and Yuhua SMC all received less than 40 per cent of the votes . <p> The results mean the SDP has been usurped by the Progress Singapore Party ( PSP ) in the opposition party pecking order .

Somehow , word had gotten around that Mr Lori was the client in the reenactment . <p> Mr Lori began to reconsider whether Talkspace was the dream employer he 'd imagined -- and whether it could be trusted to protect the privacy of its users . <p> " Everything was done with employee-informed consent , " said Ms Sacco , who no longer works @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Talkspace , said : " At the time , the employee expressed great pride over their Talkspace treatment with their therapist and willingly told multiple co-workers that the transcript was theirs . " Mr Lori said he did so only after it became clear that his identity was widely known . <p> Despite the embarrassing episode , Mr Lori stayed with the company for two more years , until he was let go in 2018 . He sued Talkspace for discrimination and wrongful termination , claiming he was told that his anxiety and depression were interfering with his work . The lawsuit settled at the beginning of 2020 . Mr Lori asked the company to take down his blog post ; the company did n't , which is part of why Mr Lori decided to share his story with a reporter . <p> Mr Lori and other former Talkspace employees , who asked not to be named for fear of being sued , describe a company with an admirable ambition to destigmatise therapy -- but that they say has questionable marketing practices and regards treatment transcripts as another data resource @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a venture capital-backed startup to grow quickly can sometimes be in conflict with the core values of professional therapy , including strict confidentiality and patient welfare . <p> This year , with a pandemic , a recession and an election shredding Americans ' nerves , those concerns are relevant to more people than ever before : In May , Talkspace told The Washington Post that its client base had jumped 65 per cent since mid-February . <p> " The app-ification of mental health care has real problems , " said Hannah Zeavin , a lecturer in the English department at the University of California , Berkeley whose book about teletherapy is scheduled to be published next year by MIT Press . " These are corporate platforms first . And they offer therapy second . " <p> Neil Leibowitz , Talkspace 's chief medical officer , said : " Talkspace has democratised access to therapy and psychiatry by meeting patients where they are in their lives and making treatment more affordable . The need is profound , especially now in this time of unease , and we are so proud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> BURNER PHONES <p> Signing up with Talkspace is quick . Users create an account , fill out a questionnaire and get a choice of therapists , who work for the platform as independent contractors . Those who sign up for the " Unlimited Messaging Therapy Plus " plan , at US$260 a month , can send a therapist messages at any time and are promised daily responses . Higher-priced subscription tiers offer " live sessions " of 30 minutes . While users can send messages by text , audio and video , Talkspace is known popularly as a platform for texting . <p> The company was founded in 2011 by Oren and Roni Frank , an Israeli couple who felt inspired after their relationship was " saved " by marriage counselling . Mr Frank had a background in marketing , and Ms Frank was a software developer . <p> Ms Frank is the company 's head of clinical services ; as at Aug 6 , her LinkedIn page said she had a master 's degree in psychoanalysis and psychotherapy from the New York Graduate School of Psychoanalysis , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deleted after an inquiry from The New York Times ( NYT ) . Mr Reilly said Ms Frank " studied for an M.A. but left her programme before completion to launch Talkspace . Her LinkedIn profile was created while she was studying , the inadvertent error was corrected as soon as the NYT brought this to our attention . " <p> The app launched in 2014 to positive press but lukewarm customer reviews , with ratings of about three stars out of five on both the Google and Apple app stores , according to a Timesanalysis . Users complained about glitchy software and unresponsive therapists . <p> In 2015 and 2016 , according to four former employees , the company sought to improve its ratings : It asked workers to write positive reviews . One employee said that Talkspace 's head of marketing at the time asked him to compile 100 fake reviews in a Google spreadsheet , so that employees could submit them to app stores . <p> Mr Lori said Talkspace gave employees " burner " phones to help evade the app stores ' techniques for detecting false @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it here . Do it at home . Give us five-star ratings because we have too many bad reviews ' , " Mr Lori said . <p> Mr Reilly , the Talkspace lawyer , disputed this account , saying that employees were free to write reviews any way they liked . " We alerted employees if they were to leave a review , to do it from their personal phones -- not from the Talkspace office network , as that would cause issues with the app store , " Mr Reilly said in an emailed statement . " To be clear : We have never used fake identities or encouraged anybody to do so ; there is no event involving ' burner ' phones , and the idea in and of itself is nonsensical relative to the large number of reviews outstanding . " <p> Mr Lori still has the iPhone 4 that Talkspace gave him . On the back , there is a white sticker on which someone has written " #7 App Store login " , along with a Yahoo email address and password . Two other former @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Fake reviews are deceptive to consumers , " said Eric Goldman , co-director of the High Tech Law Institute at Santa Clara University . If the Talkspace employees did n't disclose their role when leaving reviews , " then the company-encouraged reviews are problematic on multiple legal fronts " , Mr Goldman said . <p> Posting fake online reviews is considered a deceptive business practice and can violate laws against false advertising . The New York attorney-general and the Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ) have fined companies for posting such reviews , though consequences can also be less severe . After the FTC accused cosmetics brand Sunday Riley of posting fake reviews , it simply made the company agree not to do so again . <p> Google and Apple forbid developers from soliciting fraudulent reviews . Apple says violators may have their apps removed from the App Store . <p> ' WE NEED DATA . ALL OF OUR DATA . ' <p> Karissa Brennan , a New York-based therapist , provided services via Talkspace from 2015 to 2017 , including to Mr Lori . She said that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outside of Talkspace , a company representative contacted her , saying she should seek to keep her clients inside the app . <p> " I was like , ' How do you know I did that ? ' " Ms Brennan said . " They said it was private , but it was n't . " <p> The company says this would only happen if an algorithmic review flagged the interaction for some reason -- for example , if the therapist recommended medical marijuana to a client . Ms Brennan says that to the best of her recollection , she had sent a link to an anxiety worksheet . <p> Talkspace also has been analysing transcripts in order to develop bots that monitor and augment therapists ' work . During a presentation in 2019 , a Talkspace engineer specialising in machine learning said the research was important because certain cues that a client is in distress that could be caught during in-person sessions might be missed when a therapist is only communicating by text . Software might better catch those cues . <p> Last year , Mr Frank wrote an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ data available to researchers . " We need data . All of our data . Mine and yours , " he wrote , arguing that analysis of anonymous data sets could improve treatment . <p> The anonymous data Talkspace collects is not used just for medical advancements ; it 's used to better sell Talkspace 's product . Two former employees said the company 's data scientists shared common phrases from clients ' transcripts with the marketing team so that it could better target potential customers . <p> The company disputes this . " We are a data-focused company , and data science and clinical leadership will from time to time share insights with their colleagues , " Mr Reilly said . " This can include evaluating critical information that can help us improve best practices . " <p> He added : " It never has and never will be used for marketing purposes . " <p> ' ENGAGEMENT ' -BASED THERAPY <p> Many licensed therapists sign up with Talkspace for reasons similar to why drivers work for Uber . The company provides a steady stream of clients , takes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " The beauty of text-based therapy is we are meeting clients where they are and giving them access to something different , " said Reshawna Chapple , a Talkspace therapist whom the company made available for an interview . " It 's about convenience for me . " <p> " The thing that Talkspace allows me to do is to put my hands in a lot of different pots , " said Dr Chapple , who communicates with 30 clients via Talkspace , treats 15 in person and works as a full-time professor at the University of Florida . She also has a contract with Talkspace to advise other therapists . <p> The approximately 3,000 therapists who work on the platform are paid by " engagement " , according to the company , based on the number of words they write to users or how often they talk by video or audio , with bonuses for client retention . <p> According to multiple therapists , Talkspace paid special attention to their interactions with clients who worked at places like Google , Kroger and JetBlue -- " enterprise partners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( NYT offers Talkspace to its workers as a benefit . ) <p> Last year , Talkspace introduced a new feature : a button that users could press after sending a message that required the therapist to respond within a certain time frame . If the therapists do n't respond in time , their pay can be docked . <p> Some therapists on the platform were alarmed , in part because the function required them to work on demand , rather than on their own schedule . More significantly , they asked : Is it harmful to give clients with anxiety and boundary issues a button to press for immediate gratification ? <p> " That 's a corporate model : You need to respond to the customer no matter what , " said Shara Sand , a psychologist with her own practice in New York . " Limit-setting and boundary-setting is part of the therapy . If you ca n't manage not to talk to your therapist for four hours , you are very ill and need a higher level of care than a texting app . " <p> PUSHBACK @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unlimited , " 24/7 " messaging therapy . " Your therapist will see your messages and respond to you throughout the day , " the company says . Therapists get a different pitch : " Set your business hours , and check in on your clients daily , five days per week . " <p> The company says the two messages are not in conflict . " I do n't think it 's a discrepancy in expectations , " said Rachel O'Neill , a licensed therapist at Talkspace whose title is director of clinical effectiveness . " It 's not 24/7 therapy , it 's 24/7 ability to communicate . " <p> There has been limited study into how effective teletherapy is . Much of it either has been conducted by Talkspace itself or has involved therapy via video sessions , not just text . <p> " Talkspace 's No 1 priority is quality of care for patients and driving the clinical outcomes desired by patients , " Dr Leibowitz said . " Talkspace has conducted research in partnership with many of the top academic universities , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ papers in peer-reviewed journals " . <p> Lynn Bufka , senior director for practice transformation and quality at the American Psychological Association , or APA , said the research on text-based therapy has been based on surveys of whether people find it satisfactory . <p> " There 's been much less research into whether there 's a clinical benefit , " Dr Bufka said . " We would offer cautions around relying on text therapy , particularly when there is greater severity in terms of symptoms . We would urge people to seek direct care , which at this time would be by phone or video . " <p> In 2018 , a therapists advocacy group called the Psychotherapy Action Network wrote a letter to the APA and to Olympian Michael Phelps , who has appeared in ads for Talkspace , calling the company a " problematic treatment provider who aggressively sells an untested , risky treatment " . After receiving the letter , the APA changed its policy on therapy-tech ads and stopped letting Talkspace exhibit at conferences . <p> In 2019 , after Talkspace signed a deal with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to provide teletherapy to its two million customers , the advocacy group wrote another letter of " alarm " to the APA . Talkspace sued the group for defamation , claiming damages of US$40 million . The lawsuit was dismissed for jurisdictional reasons . <p> " Maybe their products and services are helpful to certain people , " said Linda Michaels , a founder of the Psychotherapy Action Network . " But it 's just not therapy . " <p> Until 2018 , the Talkspace user agreement said the same thing : " This Site Does Not Provide Therapy . It provides Therapeutic conversation with a licensed therapist . " The company has since removed the clause . <p> " That is very old , " said Dr Leibowitz . " The company has evolved quite a bit .

@@42208232 <h> Promoting Fiscal Policies to Improve Fuel Economy in the Philippines : Evaluation of Excise Tax Reform for New Vehicles and Transport Fuels <h> Share <p> The use of fiscal policies can be an effective means to promote sustainability in the transport sector . Such policies can help to reduce wasteful consumption of fossil fuels in the transport sector , alleviate rapid motorization , contribute towards improving the efficiency of transport systems , and contribute to the internalization of associated environmental and health costs , such as those from air pollution . Air pollution is a key environmental concern for the Philippines and places a major burden on the health of citizens . <p> The Department of Finance ( DOF ) of the Republic of the Philippines is pursuing several fiscal policy reforms in the country . In December 2017 , the current administration signed into law Republic Act No.10963 , otherwise known as the Tax Reform for Acceleration and Inclusion ( TRAIN ) Act , which is the first of the five planned tax reform packages in the Comprehensive Tax Reform Program of the current administration . The first package amends select provisions of the National Internal Revenue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tax reform . <p> Such fuel and vehicle excise tax reforms can potentially contribute towards mitigating the negative impacts of transportation , such as on energy use and on the environment , by influencing consumer choice and consumption behavior . This study analyses the impact of the vehicle and fuel excise tax reform of the amended version of one of the bills originally proposed by DOF , henceforth referred to as House Bill No. 4774 or the " price-based " taxation on the fuel economy of newly registered light duty vehicles until the year 2020 using the Fuel Economy Policies Implementation Tool developed by the International Energy Agency . The study then estimates the impacts of the improved fuel economy on energy use , emissions , and fuel costs from road transport using the Asian Development Bank 's Transport DataBank Model . Finally , the study suggests an alternative vehicle taxation scheme , which aims at providing more incentive to the consumers to purchase more fuel-efficient vehicles while ensuring a similar level of tax revenues .

@@42208234 <p> Do you know what it feels like when something sparks joy within you ? If not , then a good place to hone that feeling would be at Hotel Vivier , the universe imagined by Roger Vivier 's newest creative director , Gherardo Felloni . Only the third designer to head the footwear maison that 's created shoes for the likes of Catherine Deneuve , Queen Elizabeth II and Christian Dior , the task would be a daunting one for anybody -- but Felloni is approaching his enormous responsibilities with a cheerful , even easy , mien . <p> " It was always a dream of mine to work for Roger Vivier , " Felloni says as he sips an Americano on the patio at Sevva , having arrived in Hong Kong from Paris the previous afternoon . " He 's always been my reference . I never met him , but the lightness , the colours , the femininity , I think those elements have always been things that attracted me to the house . And I think he was a happy person . When you see the shoes he made , you feel that he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we both share . We were both architects before we were designers , so that 's also a link . In life , when you really love your career , there 's always a touch of coincidence that will bring you there . " <p> What brings Felloni to Hong Kong is Hotel Vivier , a fanciful set created to anchor his vision for the house . First introduced in Paris during Fashion Week , his vision was expressed in a private maison just off Jardin du Luxembourg . Set over three opulently appointed storeys , it was a glimpse into a world of whimsy and quirkiness that might become hallmarks of his tenure at Vivier . <p> In Hong Kong , this is confirmed . The concept is brought to China Tang , whose restaurant is divided into four rooms , each with a Chinese twist on an escapist fantasy . Guests walk past the reception desk , where the shelves that usually hold keys display a Tr ? s Vivier shoe in each cubbyhole . A stroll down a corridor reveals rooms occupied by a master calligrapher , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ qipao surrounded by peonies in full bloom , and a brooding Chinese damsel reclining on a bed that looks as though it has been pulled out of Wong Kar-wai 's In the Mood for Love . On set are buckles , feathers , strass -- all key tenets of the house of Vivier , but used by Felloni in ways that are just a smidge more decadent than his predecessors . <p> Hotel Vivier 's front desk in Paris . <p> " Hotel Vivier was a format that I invented for Vivier because it was necessary for me not to do something static , something boring , " Felloni explains . " I worked 10 , almost 20 years in brands that made ready-to-wear , where they did shows , created campaigns -- I was always involved in a process that can not go on if you do n't have a silhouette . And the shoes would complete that silhouette . <p> " At Vivier , we do n't have ready-to-wear , so I thought it was necessary for me to explain my imagination of Roger Vivier using actresses and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a conscious decision because Felloni wanted a sense of legitimate interaction , something he achieved in both Paris and Hong Kong . " A model is not an actress , so you ca n't ask her to act or sing because it 's going to be a mess , " he says . " I really liked the idea of having real women who can do something and interact with people because , for me , it was really important that everyone interact . I 'm a happy person and I hate being bored or when things are boring . I ca n't stand it . But this is basically a way for me to explain my vision interactively . It 's a fake place but everybody goes to a hotel and everybody leaves . So , it 's like , a place for everyone , like the store . It 's imaginary but in a way it 's also very real .

" Catherine is more than a client , she 's a friend . She comes to the store , but I realised that she was n't present in the communications and she 's never been used as a face . But she gives something to the brand , she 's part of its identity , so when she agreed to do this movie I was so happy . And of course , she 's giving the shoes as a gift to her daughters so it makes it cross-generation . " <p> The star presides over a mini concert given by her two ' daughters ' while Felloni is the maestro who plays piano for the guests . The atmosphere is plutocratic and lush .

She was a young bourgeois girl so these shoes were not supposed to be something for an old lady but something young and revolutionary , because it was a time of social revolution , " Felloni explains . " The women of this period were freer and that 's why I decided to do the Tr ? s Vivier with a chunkier heel and change the last so that there 's more space for your foot . The attitude is more casual and a little bit more masculine . " <p> " When I went into the archive , I learnt many new things because it 's incredibly big .

" For me it 's clear , it 's myself at Roger Vivier , so I set about creating the running shoes -- which was not the biggest challenge , as they 're completely new -- and took on a big challenge , which was to update the buckle pump , a very iconic shoe . " <p> Both shoes did tremendously well and the squared-off buckle of the new Tr ? s Vivier is proving to be a hit , if the oohs and aahs of guests at Hotel Vivier Hong Kong and Paris were anything to go by . Viv ' Run , the footwear maison 's first running shoe , contains the brand 's signature Choc heel proportions and a rubber buckle because , as Felloni puts it , " there were no running shoe references in the archive so it 's something completely new , but I 'm very happy because you really feel that it 's Vivier .

" When I was in the archive there were pieces from when Roger Vivier created the shoe collections for Christian Dior in the ' 50s and ' 60s .

It 's something I want for women coming into the store -- to be happy , to be free and have no fear . To have a sense of humour and feel powerful . " <p> Maharaja sandals . <p> Inspired by women such as Manuela Pavesi , who gave him the courage to experiment with his personal style , matching his collection of parures to collared shirts and Nike jackets , Felloni 's vision for the brand is , yes , eclectic and , yes , fantastic .

Pathmanathan , a convicted Malaysian drug trafficker , last week , human rights groups have called for the death penalty to be abolished . Malaysia had appealed to Singapore to halt the execution for humanitarian reasons . <p> A statement from the MHA read , " The Ministry of Home Affairs ( MHA ) is conducting the survey to give us a better understanding of Singapore residents ' attitudes towards the death penalty . " <p> - Advertisement - <p> Official data states that last year 's execution of eight persons who had been convicted of drug charges was the highest in the last ten years .

The deputy director for Asia at Human Rights Watch , Phil Robertson , said , " There 's been no indication whatsoever that Singapore 's position on use of the death penalty is softening .

@@42215235 <p> Corruption by Indonesian local governments and weak law enforcement are blamed by environmentalists for the recurring forest fires that spew noxious fumes over to Malaysia and Singapore . <p> Greenpeace Indonesia warned of more forest fires to come as the country approaches 2014 general elections as historically , local authorities give out land concession in exchange for funds for their respective political campaigns . <p> " This has happened in the past . I ask the public to be aware of this , to make sure that our forests and peatland are not sacrificed for political deals , " said Bustar . <p> Corruption by local governments often resulted in authorities turning a blind eye on fires started in the land concession held by large plantation companies . <p> " There are lots of corruption taking place at the local level . Foreign investors operating in Indonesia should not pay bribes so that they can carry out wrongdoings , " said Bustar Maitar , head of Greenpeace Indonesia forest campaign . <p> While the central government has strengthened its efforts at reducing deforestation by placing a moratorium on the issuance of new land concessions since 2011 , local authorities have not fallen in line . <p> " It is very difficult to control everything at the local level , " said Greenpace 's Bustar . <p> On June 14 , Riau governor Rusli Zainal was detained by the Corruption Eradication Commission ( KPK ) for his alleged involvement in two separate graft cases . One of them involved a forestry permit case . <p> Indonesia 's Forestry Ministry confirmed the central government has not issued any new land permits since 2011 but admitted there were instances of local authorities giving out licences . <p> The regents ( in a province regency ) has the authority to issue land permits , " said Hadi Daryanto , secretary-general of Indonesia 's Forestry Ministry . <p> Prior to Indonesia 's ousting of the late autocractic President Suharto in 1998 , land matters was controlled by the central government . <p> As part of the reform process , Indonesia devolved power from the center to the provinces right down to the regencies in 1999 . <p> Consequently , deforestation increased exponentially as provincial governors and regents used their newfound authority to issue land permits at will . <p> In 1998 , deforestation totaled two million hectares per year . In 2001-2003 , the rate rose to 3.5 million hectares per annum , according to the Forestry Ministry . <p> " The euphoria of 1999-2003 over Regional Autonomy without governance resulted in the high rate of deforestation , " Daryanto added . <p> Currently , the central government practically only holds 15 per cent of the authority to protect the forests , with the other 85 per cent in the hands of local administrations due to regional autonomy , according to Daryanto . <p> To rectify the problem , the Indonesian Parliament is currently debating a bill to withdraw the right to decide land matters from regents and instead place the authority in the hands of provincial governors . <p> " The Parliamentary debate is still going-on , " said Daryanto . <p> Greenpeace 's analysis of NASA hotspot data in Sumatra 11th to 21st June revealed hundreds of fire hotspots in palm oil concessions that are owned by Indonesian , Malaysian and Singaporean companies . <p> Bustar said large Malaysian and Singaporean corporations need to " clean-up " their suppliers to ensure they are not engaged in setting fires to clear the land . <p> Large companies source for supply from smallholders who typically cultivate between 2 to 5 hectares of land . Small holders account for 35% to 40% of Indonesia 's total palm oil output . <p> " They ( large plantations ) need to raise the awareness of smallholders not to burn the land and supply them with machinery to chop down the trees , " said Bustar . <p> " As plantation companies are large corporation with much resources , they must bear the greater responsibility for preventing fires , " Bustar added . <p> Forest fires from the Indonesian islands of Sumatra and Kalimantan have emitted noxious haze to neighbouring countries in 1997 , 2002 , 2005 and 2008 . <p> The haze in 1997 was one of the worst ever , as the fires burnt for months before they were put out , causing an estimated economic loss of US$4 billion to the region . <p> The severity of this year 's haze highlighted that little has been done despite the passage of time to eradicate this problem . <p> Indonesia authorities also face great difficulties in investigating the fires in the effort to bring guilty parties to justice . <p> " Quite a few ( plantation ) companies will put up a fight to prevent us ( investigators ) from entering their land to investigate , " said Indonesian fire investigator Bambang Hero Saharjo . <p> " Often , they ( companies ) also falsify their maps ... making it difficult and time-consuming to verify the location of hotspots , " said Bambang . <p> When I was studying in Singapore , I too had felt the stress of exams . I did what everyone else was doing -- memorizing notes , regurgitating textbooks , mugging through " 10 year series assessment books " -- and got good grades . <p> However , rather than focus on creativity , capability and intelligence , I find this approach favors diligent scholars . Our system is skewed so students who do well academically are given opportunities for highly paid government positions or entry into politics . The over emphasis on grades in an exam-centric system creates tremendous stress on students . This is because exams and streaming end up tied to the value of the people . No surprise many parents pay for private tuition and enrichment classes for their children . <p> In his latest National Day Rally speech , PM Lee acknowledged the current system was stressing parents and students and announced upcoming changes . But , will the changes be too little too late for the tiny red dot ? <p> " Every School a Good School " sounds like a good start . The top 5 Junior Colleges in Singapore produce 80% of the top scholars . This however , is because they only accept top students . It is socially unhealthy when most students in elite schools come from similar socio-economic backgrounds . This reinforces notions of exclusivity . It also threatens social mobility through education . ( http : **39;1329;TOOLONG ... Because Singapore 's education system is centralized , best practices are shared and new " innovative ways " are introduced constantly . Based on this systematic approach , many students do very well in exams for Math and Science . However , people like Apple Co-founder Steve Wozniak have questioned Singapore 's creativity . <p> In 2006 , the Ministry of Education launched a new policy : " Teach less , Learn More " to create a flexible system which promotes independent thinkers . According to feedback from teachers and parents , this drew mixed reviews . While teachers thought students spoke with greater confidence , some shared they still relied on rote learning to help students clear exams because assessments had remained the same . ( http : **39;1370;TOOLONG ... ) <p> A centralized bureaucratic education system poses many challenges . At planning stage , more initiatives seem ideal . However , implementation is a different story . " Innovative projects " are supposed to encourage students to be creative and to develop critical thinking . However , due to their training and pressure to maintain school rankings , well-meaning teachers may steer students towards scoring good grades for the project and remove most of the decision making process . <p> Because creativity and critical thinking are difficult to measure , the effectiveness of a new initiative can be judged on students ' feedback . While some new initiatives may give students room to do research and learn to think critically , many will not try them , as they are afraid mediocre grades will affect their future . Those who do try them may not like the ambiguity and lack of defined scope in the syllabus . This is the challenge in a grades oriented environment and the learning culture built up from young . <p> With too many reporting procedures and accountability structures to align schools with national direction , teachers spend more time on paperwork than teaching . They are also expected to think outside the box while performing well -- within the box . <p> Society also has a part to play when it comes to " lack of creativity . Talent in the arts , sports , music , leadership ability , etc. is not sufficiently recognized . There may be a few outspoken and bold students but they are probably also labeled as trouble makers . In an orderly society that follows rules and regulations , creative people who do not conform get into trouble with the law . Local artists , Samantha Lo and Leslie Chew have got into trouble for expressing their views with art . <p> The challenge of Singapore 's education system goes beyond education . It will not happen by planning and through innovative ways of teaching and borrowing models from other countries will not work . It has to come from societal change and having more meaningful conversations with the people . Empowering citizens to co-create our future maybe the best move for a brighter future for Singapore . <p> The exit of Vincent Wijeysingha from the Singapore Democratic Party can be traced to the change in the party 's political strategy in the last three to five years . <p> The party has steadily moved towards the centre , perhaps to win more votes . Wijeysingha gave me an interview some time ago and I remember asking him : What made you join the SDP ? " He said that back in 2007 the SDP had stated that it was in support of repealing 377A and it also reiterated that point in its vision : <p> " As a nation , we must not only show tolerance but also acceptance of our fellow citizens regardless of their race , religion , sexual orientation , or political persuasion . " <p> In what appears to be an email exchange published on their website between John Tan , the Asst Secretary General of SDP , and a SDP supporter , John wrote : <p> " The SDP , on the other hand , while trying to be as practical as we can at some level , must constantly be guided by our foundational tenets . When we say equality for all , we mean equality for all . " <p> Prior to GE 2011 , SDP often championed non-mainstream issues such as the abolition of the death penalty , repealing of 377A and promotion of free speech and assembly . <p> The party 's run-ins with the law were notable and their activists took pride that they made sacrifices for the greater good of the country . <p> All this stopped , partly due to the influx of new members who have begun to influence the core team with a more " moderate " positioning . <p> Transitioning from a radical left wing party to the middle is not an easy undertaking . It is a delicate process and sometime it requires a leadership change to make that paradigm shift . <p> Like other political parties , SDP looks unified from the outside ; they look like a team with strongly-driven values of liberal democracy , but in actual they are split along the lines of morality . The irony is , while the liberals in the party saw Wijeysingha as the likely successor to Dr Chee Soon Juan , the conservatives thought that he was a liability . <p> " We are not pursuing the gay agenda and none of our MPs will , " he says at the beginning of the video , and repeats himself near the end : " Will the SDP pursue the gay cause ? I answer forthrightly and without equivocation : No . " <p> There was a perception among the party conservatives that the middle ground comprises those who are opposed to any extension of rights to the LGBT community and having a gay candidate would cost SDP precious votes . <p> To add insult to injury , some of the more statistically-inclined members have put a number to it . According to them , having Wijeysingha on board would mean a loss of 4 to 10 per cent of the popular vote . <p> Needless to say , the grapevine had it that SDP lost in Holland-Bukit Timah because of Wijeysingha 's sexuality . <p> There was also concern that his recent outing on his Facebook before the Pink Dot event would cost them more votes in the next election . <p> In order to mitigate the risks of losing the previous 20+ per cent vote swing , SDP on the other hand made a tactical move to " side-line " LGBT issues and to focus more on the bread and butter issues . <p> As recently as July 11 , Chee posted this curious statement on his party 's website : : <p> " I had stated in 2011 during the general elections that the SDP would not pursue a gay agenda . I say again : Neither the Party nor any of our members , including Vincent , will embark on a gay agenda . " <p> In pursuit of the political middle ground , it appears that the SDP has let down the LGBT community by rescinding on their liberal values . It is no longer guided by its " foundational tenets , " that there will be equality for all . <p> Wijeysingha found that the party he helped to build has shifted away from its core values . But he has vowed to bring those values , including equality for all , to the civil society space . <p> From a strategy point of view , SDP 's shift to the middle ground might look like an expedient political move . But it may not work . <p> Both Workers ' Party and the People 's Action Party have crowded that space ... For the SDP to enter that fray at this juncture can be suicidal . <p> As Singapore politics matures , what might look like fringe causes can become vote winners in the years to come . <p> Look at how the Green Party has performed in Germany . Although they are far , far away from forming the government , they do influence politics in a big way . <p> SDP needs some patience and the will to stick to its principles to make headway in Singapore politics . <p> For his unwitting role in shaping Singapore , Abraham Maslow can be seen as the modern equivalent of Sang Nila Utama . Like the Hindu prince , the American psychologist was central to defining this island-state on the back of something imaginary . <p> Popularly known as ' Maslow 's hierarchy of needs ' , this theory states that human needs are structured and incrementally fulfilled . We operate by first satisfying our basic physical needs such as sleep and food , then working our way through a series of other needs before finally seeking to attain self-actualisation through the pursuit of virtues like morality and creativity , among others . <p> Agreeing that material needs matter most when Singapore first gained independence , political elites were quick to profess economic pragmatism as our national philosophy . Policies were crafted to ensure that resource-scarce Singapore attracts foreign investment and stays that way . <p> Almost 50 years later , signs are suggesting that Maslow was not quite right -- people do not necessarily pursue their needs in stages , but all at once . <p> Take the recent Institute of Policy Studies ( IPS ) survey that found Singaporeans expressing a desire for a less competitive and more compassionate society . Also consider the emergence of a greater number of ordinary Singaporeans championing non-economic , organic causes like the anti-death penalty campaign , LGBT rights and Internet freedom . <p> Things are changing even in the business sector , as more young Singaporeans venture out to set up SMEs with some degree of civic conscience . A good example is Poached , an online lifestyle magazine that injects their otherwise ' fluff ' articles with a dose of social commentary . <p> Despite these indications , policymakers are not quite ready to rethink their appropriation of Maslow 's theory . <p> Having proposed that Singapore is fast becoming post-pragmatic at a closed-door conference three years ago , a senior political figure said to me that Singaporeans have not fully resolved their bread and butter issues . I distinctly remember him saying with conviction : " Recall what Maslow said . " <p> Newer political leaders are no different . Reacting to the above-mentioned IPS survey , MP Zainal Saparin was quoted as saying : " When ours was a growing economy , and survival was a key concern , there was a lot of emphasis on being hardworking , accumulating wealth , fighting for a better life . " <p> But contrary to Maslow 's postulation , Singapore is proving to be a place where even the poor dreams . We are capable of self-actualising even if we have not slept nor ate enough . <p> One possible way of sidestepping the tyranny of Maslow 's hierarchy of needs is to look for alternative measures of progress . A viable example is the Social Progress Index ( SPI ) introduced just this year . The SPI tabulates national progress by measuring GDP growth in relation to social and environmental outcomes . Some ASEAN member-states like Thailand , Vietnam and Indonesia have already become signatories to this index . Why not Singapore ? <p> Another suggestion is to establish a national body that will fund serious study of the arts and humanities in the same manner that the National Research Foundation ( NRF ) and A*Star sponsor science and technological research . Such an institution will be different from the National Arts Council , which focuses on funding practitioners , because its aim is to build up a repertoire of cultural critics and experts who can help Singaporeans make sense and appreciate this much-ignored aspect of human life . <p> This disjuncture at this juncture of the Singapore story has placed us in danger of losing the plot . What will be our next move ? <p> Nazry is a lecturer at the Singapore University of Technology and Design , and research fellow at the Middle East Institute-NUS . <p> You may have noticed that some commonly prescribed drugs for long-term conditions such as diabetes and high blood pressure cost more in Singapore than across the Causeway in Malaysia , or other parts of the world . There are a number of reasons why the same drugs are priced differently across countries . <p> Drugs fall into two broad categories -- generic drugs and branded drugs . Generic drugs , which are copies of branded drugs whose patents have expired , are generally inexpensive throughout the world . Branded drugs are much more expensive because of the start-up investment , research , and marketing expenses that go into producing a new drug from scratch and bringing it onto the market . <p> Most pharmaceutical companies set the price for a branded drug based on a country 's ability to pay for that drug . So , it can cost more in one country than in another . <p> Drug makers expect countries with a high per capita GDP to pay more for branded drugs than countries with a low per capita GDP . This can lead to a huge price differential between countries . This price differential is further amplified by the difference in foreign exchange rates . <p> Focused on getting a handsome return on their investments , pharmaceutical companies are keen to sell branded drugs at the highest price a market can bear . Say , for example , the best available treatment for a particular condition is surgery that costs $30,000 , and there is a 5 per cent risk that the patient undergoing the surgery may die . Now , if a pharmaceutical company develops a drug that is as effective and has only a 1 per cent mortality risk , even if that drug costs 30 cents to produce , the company will price its new drug regime higher than $30,000 , because the best available treatment is the benchmark , explains Dr Jeremy Lim . Dr Lim , the principal consultant at Insights Health Associates in Singapore , is the author of the book , Myth or Magic : The Singapore Healthcare System , which will be available in bookstores in mid-September . <p> " The pharmaceutical company would think that , if , its drug is as effective as the current surgical treatment and has five times lower mortality risk , it deserves to charge a premium . Hence , the company would charge $30,000 plus whatever premium it deems to be appropriate , " says Dr Lim , whose previous experiences include being a senior consultant with the Ministry of Health ( MOH ) in Singapore , and director of research and education at SingHealth , Singapore 's largest healthcare group . <p> Another reason why branded drugs cost less in some countries , and more in others , is that , in certain countries , people can buy prescription drugs over the counter because of lax regulatory controls . Although laws in those countries may state that certain medicines are to be made available by prescription only , or by a registered pharmacist , in practice , it is often possible to get those drugs over the counter . This means , a patient does not have to bear the costs involved in having the drug prescribed to him . <p> " When it is a prescription-only drug , the administrative cost goes up because you need a doctor to prescribe the medicine , a pharmacist to dispense it and the storage of the drugs needs to be audited and monitored , and you need paper trails . The control mechanisms are tighter and they cost money , " says Dr Lim . <p> A third reason why drug prices vary from country to country is limited economies of scale resulting from smaller volume drug purchases . The more a healthcare provider , whether it is the government or a private hospital , buys of a particular drug , the cheaper the price gets . <p> Government subsidies for drugs also play a role in price differences . The Singapore government does not subsidize branded drugs unless they fall within the Standard Drug List maintained by MOH , or come under one of the government 's subsidy schemes . Patients taking a non-subsidized branded drug would therefore have to pay the full price of that drug , and hence , would end up paying more than patients in a country where that drug is heavily subsidized , Dr Lim notes . <p> Even within a single country , the same drug can cost differently at different hospitals . One reason for this is that hospitals buying more of a particular branded drug can benefit from economies of scale . According to Dr Lim , hospitals mark up the selling price of their drugs up to about 35 per cent to defray operating costs . <p> " While this percentage formula is administratively easy for hospitals and healthcare facilities , it can lead to substantial cost pressures on patients . A 30 per cent mark-up of a one-dollar drug is 30 cents , but the same mark-up for a thousand-dollar drug is $300 , " he adds . <p> HATTRICKS are an achievement usually scored by strikers on a football field . So when a city is named the most liveable city in the world by an independent panel for three successive years , then that city must be doing something right to receive such a rare accolade . Melbourne scored 97.5% for stability , healthcare , culture and infrastructure . <p> According to the Economist Intelligence Unit ( EIU ) latest rankings of 140 cities , the best ones to live in are Australia , Canada , Austria , Finland and New Zealand -- except for Austria and Finland , it is no surprise the other three are huge immigration targets . <p> Following closely on the heels of Melbourne , were Vienna ( 97.4% ) in Austria -- the home of The Sound of Music -- Vancouver ( 97.3% ) and Toronto ( 97.2% ) , both in Canada , completing the top four . It is significant that four other Australian cities were in the top 10 : Adelaide ( 96.6% ) was 5th again ( jointly with Calgary in Canada ) , Sydney 7th and Perth 9th . It is also remarkable that Canada has three in the top 10 . Helsinki in Finland was 8th , while Auckland in New Zealand rounded off the top 10 . <p> In Asia , Osaka in Japan managed 12th ; Tokyo , Japan 18th ; Beijing , China 74th ; Mumbai , India 116th . So where was Singapore ? Research , unfortunately , could not unearth anything on the island republic , which was ranked by Business Traveller Asia-Pacific last year as " the most livable city in both Asia-Pacific and the world . Within Asia-Pacific , the Lion City is followed closely by Kobe and Hong Kong . " <p> As expected , prominent Melbournians waxed lyrical about the city 's latest achievement . They pointed to the heritage architecture , lovely gardens and parks , hub of arts and culture , beaches and the string of major events hosted by Marvellous Melbourne . Often dubbed the ' Sporting Capital of The Word ' , it is home to Formula 1 motor racing , Australian Open Grand Slam tennis and the Melbourne Cup -- a horse race that stops the nation on the first Tuesday every November . <p> Add to that the multicultural precincts , such as Carlton , Richmond , Springvale and Boxhill , which offer distinct flavours in cuisine and shopping . The friendly people living in harmony , well-planned streets and expressways , trams , trains and buses are vital ingredients in a success story . <p> Jumping on the bandwagon were an exuberant Lord Mayor Robert Doyle , Tourism Minister Louise Asher and former premier Jeff Kennett -- all singing a litany of praises in rare accord about how easy it was to sell the attractions of the Victorian capital that they love : from the fine hotels to the exhibition venues and sports stadiums . <p> The Herald Sun reported that Lord Mayor Robert Doyle had said continuing to drive down crime and an underground rail line linking North Melbourne to Domain on St Kilda Rd were crucial to retain liveability status . " Overall it is a remarkable testament to our remarkable city , " Cr Doyle said . " That does n't mean there are things we ca n't improve . " <p> Meanwhile , The Advertiser in Adelaide trumpeted that the South Australian capital has overtaken Sydney as one of the world 's most liveable cities , with recent major infrastructure boosting its international profile.Economist Intelligence Unit survey editor Jon Copestake said from London that just 1.6% separated the five Aussie cities surveyed . " ' Australian cities continue to thrive in terms of liveability ; not only do they benefit from the natural advantages of low population density , but they have continued to improve with some high profile infrastructure investments . " <p> The release of the EIU rankings has been criticised by the New York Times for being too anglocentric in that " The Economist clearly equates livability with speaking English . " This view may have been goaded by the fact that the best US cities in the survey were far down the list with Honolulu 26th and Pittsburgh at 30th ! <p> The rankings also had the worst city as Damascus ( Syria ) , followed by Tehran ( Iran ) and Douala ( Cameroon ) . Obviously , cities with war and acute poverty scored very poorly in the survey . <p> Make no mistake about it , the EIU assessments are not geared to find heaven on earth . On the contrary , they source the ideal places where there is an array of goods and services easily available , effective infrastructure and low personal risk . What is not included is the cost of living . <p> Yet , more immigrants are arriving Down Under , particularly in Melbourne . Asad Sheikh , of Indian Spice Pavilion in Scoresby Village , was born in India . He moved to Singapore from 2002 to 2008 before emigrating with his family to Australia and is in the process of taking up citizenship . He said that , despite working as a chef in Singapore 's four- and five-star hotels , the lure of Australia was too much to resist : " I wanted better education for my children and a peaceful lifestyle , so I came to Melbourne . I am now building a new house for my family . " <p> Having lived in the world 's No. 1 city for 23 years , I have seen the Melbourne sprawl extend from a radius of about 30km from the CBD to about 40km . Outer suburbs in the south-east , such as Ferntree Gully , Boronia , Wantirna , Rowville and Dandenong were considered in ' the sticks ' ( rural ) . Today , property in these areas have more than tripled in price as the newer suburbs of Berwick , Narre Warren , Packenham and Skye are not so desirable because of the peak hour traffic snarl . <p> Medical facilities , including hospitals and research are well established . Monash , Melbourne and Deakin universities spearhead tertiary education here . Various types of cooked food originating from different immigrant source countries are easily available , while most of the ingredients and spices are sold at the local supermarket and Asian grocery outlets . <p> Housing affordability is debatable within local circles , but when compared to overseas houses they are reasonable . Singaporeans could buy a house in the outer suburbs for less than the price of a HDB flat . <p> As for weekend leisure trips or week-long holidays , there are many places on the fringe of Melbourne , including the Mornington Peninsula and its seaside towns , the famous Philip Island and its Penguin Parade , the Bellarine Peninsula on the other side of Port Philip Bay and the coastal towns of Portarlington , St Leonards , Torquay on the Surf Coast , Lorne , the Twelve Apostles and Apollo Bay to name a few . Add the historic regional towns of Bendigo , Ballarat and Geelong ; the Dandenong Ranges ; country attractions in Nurmukah and Lakes Entrance to widen the choice . These enjoyable trips are only a few hours away . For those who have Lady Luck in their pocket , the Crown Casino Complex offers a myriad of food and shopping besides the cards , dice and poker machines . <p> To be honest , much more can be done to improve Melbourne -- from the frequency and quality of the trains and trams to the congestion and high parking costs in the CBD . Perhaps that is the hallmark of a popular metropolis , which also has a very busy container port on its doorstep . With the high frequency of international and domestic flights zeroing in on Tullamarine Airport and the smaller Avalon Airport , perhaps the ' earmarked ' land for a Frankston Airport in the south-east -- to ease the load -- should be seriously considered now and work started within the next two years . <p> Anyone out there fancy a wager that Marvellous Melbourne could steal the coveted crown once again in 2014 ? <p> P. Francis is an English tutor in Melbourne , who has more than 20 years ' journalism experience with newspapers , books and magazines in Singapore and Australia . <p> Australia has big dreams and high hopes for Asia . So big that politicians on both side of the fence are calling this the Asian Century for Australia -- and they 've produced a government White Paper called Australia in the Asian Century to prove it . <p> A government website , asiancentury.dpmc.com.au shows just how serious about it they are -- there are links to country strategies and cultural exchange programs with Indonesia , India , South Korea , South-east Asia and of course the grand-daddy of them all , China . <p> As the website states : " The scale and pace of Asia 's transformation is unprecedented and the implications for Australia are profound . " <p> There is perhaps no better time to be an Asian in Australia than now . <p> Into this fray comes ex-Singaporean and businessman Henry Heng , who is the CEO of Refresh Water , a Perth bottled water company that has six factories in four Australian capital cities . <p> Heng , 57 , was a stockbroker with Singapore stockbroking firm Vickers Ballas and ran a small but successful chain of daycare centres and a bookshop in Singapore as well . <p> He is a soft-spoken man with a passion for profit whether it be business , politics or his persona life . <p> " Being a businessman , I do n't like to do something for no results . I decided to go into politics when I realized that today , with the current political climate , I can make a contribution , " he says . <p> Asians make up 10 per cent of the population in WA . This state , with its mineral wealth , has benefitted more than any other in Australia from resource-hungry China . <p> " Yet there are no Asians in state government , " says Heng . " With such a large number of Asians here , we could really do with an Asian voice to represent and familiarize Australians with the culture and the politics of the region . <p> " For instance , it 's quite pointless to try and sell eco-tourism to the Chinese market ; generally when Chinese travel , they want to eat , they want to shop . These are valuable insights to a country trying to appeal in a big way to a huge market . " <p> So this year , Heng made the big move into politics and stood for election to the WA state government . <p> In addition to being Asian , Heng is also a Christian , which explains why he is standing with Family First , a party that campaigns for Australia to return to biblical and family values , to its Christian heritage and roots . <p> " I 've always been passionate about public service , but being an Asian I never thought there was any hope for me , " he said . " But things have changed . <p> " Australia is now aggressively building ties with the region on both sides of the political fence I think , and Asian ownership of Australian businesses and cattle stations is becoming quite an issue . <p> " At the same time , Australia is suffering from an erosion of values and I believe we need to see the country return to its Judeo-Christian roots . Strong families I believe are the foundation of a strong country . " <p> He feels he has found the perfect platform for these twin passions -- business and family values . " A vote for me is a vote for small business and a vote for strong families , " he says . <p> He was not successful in his bid , even though a simple election jingle written by a friend got more than 40,000 views on YouTube and attracted publicity from all the major media outlets who , never ever having seen this kind of election tactic before , were frankly quite bemused at its corny but catchy Sunday School flavour . <p> Unfortunately for Heng , the views did not translate into votes even though people in the street were recognizing him as ' the man with the jingle ' by the end of the campaign , but he is undaunted and has thrown his hat in for a Federal seat by running as second ticket to the party 's primary candidate , Linda Rose , in Australia 's General Election this Saturday ( Sept 7 ) . <p> He knows that he will not win , but under Australia 's system of voting preferences , he can give all his votes to Ms Rose and thus bolster her final count . <p> But are Heng 's dreams too big ? How does such a minority party make any kind of difference in Australia or in its legislation ? <p> The answer lies in Australia 's two-tiered political system -- an Upper House and a Lower House . <p> The Upper House consists of senators from a variety of political parties . It has the power to block legislation initiated by the government . To push legislation through , the government can and does barter terms with minority parties for their support . <p> This is where Heng hopes he and/or his party , if elected , will have a voice . <p> When he and his family moved to Perth 17 years ago , entering politics in Australia was the last thing on his mind , though in Singapore he was active in grassroots organization and was vice-chairman of the Queenstown community centre youth group . <p> " I never entered politics in Singapore because firstly it 's not an easy thing to be selected by the PAP , and opposition parties then are not like they are now . Singapore has become much more open , " says Heng . <p> " I was in Singapore during the 2011 election campaign and I saw people at opposition rallies unafraid to be seen on camera . In my day , anybody who attended an opposition rally would hide behind their umbrellas , their handbags , anything just to make sure they were n't seen . " <p> Whatever the circumstances were that kept Heng out of politics then , he now stands firmly in the spotlight . <p> BARBARIC to some , has capital punishment gone past its use-by date ? Is the march to the gallows obsolete ? Does the electric chair or death by lethal injection strike fear in would-be criminals ? These questions have sparked fiery debates for years between the righteous and the ' bleeding hearts ' . <p> Today , how many countries still have the death penalty ? The USA -- the world champion of human rights -- is one of 58 countries continuing with it ; 97 nations have abolished it and the rest have not used it for 10 years , according to wikipedia . However , Amnesty International has reported 140 nations have abolished the death penalty . Last year , only Latvia abolished it while 21 countries had executions and 63 passed the death sentence . <p> An eye for eye comes from the best-selling book of all time -- the Bible . However , freedom fighter Mohandas Gandhi , who always advocated peaceful means of civil disobedience , has been attributed the quote : " an eye for an eye will make the whole world blind " . The great Mahatma ( Sanskrit for ' Great Soul ' ) seems to have had a valid point and huge support . <p> Meanwhile , over seven weeks this year , there has been a strong move to galvanise the world against the death penalty : <p> 12-15 June : Madrid hosted the 5th World Congress Against the Death Penalty in Spain this year -- attended by 90 countries . Anabel S ? nchez Sierra wrote in Periodismo Ciudadano : " Key issues discussed included the abolition of the death penalty , along with the related issues of adherence to human rights treaties , the procurement of a moratorium on death penalty convictions , and the establishment of penal code reforms . The idea for this international event was generated at the previous convention , held in Geneva in 2010 . At that time , Spain committed to creating the ' Comisi ? n Internacional Contra la Pena de Muerte ' , or International Commission Against the Death Penalty ( established that same year at the World Day Against the Death Penalty ) for the purpose of achieving a universal moratorium on the death penalty within the next five years . " <p> The attendees at the congress heard messages from South Africa 's Nobel Laureate Desmond Tutu , UN secretary-general Ban Ki-moon , Pope Francis , and other influential leaders . Rachel Zeng of the Singapore Anti-Death Penalty Campaign ( SADPC ) , who was there , confirmed : " Ms Ong Xiao Yun from Think Centre and myself from SADPC were in Madrid for the congress . I was there as part of Anti-Death Penalty Asia Network ( ADPAN ) . " <p> So did Singapore send an official representative to the congress ? Ms Zeng said : " Not that I know of . " However , Madasamy Ravi , a lawyer and member of ADPAN , Singapore was involved in the plenary session on Asia . <p> 28 June : The UN News Centre said that Ban Ki-moon urged United Nations Member States to move towards the abolition of the death penalty , and called on countries where the procedure is still practised to increase transparency to allow a serious debate on capital punishment . " The taking of life is too absolute , too irreversible , for one human being to inflict on another , even when backed by legal process , " Mr Ban said opening the high-level event and panel discussion at UN Headquarters in New York , on ' Moving away from the death penalty -- Wrongful Convictions ' . " We have a duty to prevent innocent people from paying the ultimate price for miscarriages of justice . The most sensible way is to end the death penalty . " <p> 27 July : A report on news.com.au said that fewer executions of death penalties occurred last year according to the Italian NGO Hands off Cain . The report said the worldwide figures fell from 5,004 in 2011 to 3,967 in 2012 . The total of nations without capital punishment rose from 155 to 158 for the same period . " The significant decrease in death penalties is to a great extent thanks to China , where they dropped from 4,000 to 3,000 in just a year , " Italian Foreign Minister Emma Bonino said at the presentation of the report . China saw a drop of 10% each year from 2007 because a new law required death sentences to be heard in the Supreme Court , the report added . However , China remains top of the Hands off Cain blacklist , ahead of Iran ( 580 in 2012 ) and Iraq ( nearly doubled to 129 in 2012 ) . The report added : " Although 33 of the 40 countries that still have the death penalty are ruled by despots , some ' liberal democracies ' returned to capital punishment in 2012 . " <p> Singapore still enforces death by hanging -- the last Australian hanged in the republic was Van Tuong Nguyen on 2 Dec 2005 for drug trafficking about 396.2g of heroin -- more than 26 times the amount for which the death penalty is mandatory in the Lion City . Despite pleas for clemency by the Australian Government , the Pope , Queen Elizabeth and Amnesty International and other groups , the Singapore Government stood firm , perhaps on principle -- so much so that Australian PM John Howard could not sway his Singapore counterpart Lee Hsien Loong to help the accused , who was remorseful , co-operated with the police and had been baptised as Caleb while in Changi prison . <p> Australia 's Special Broadcasting Service ( SBS ) last month screened a two-part dramatised miniseries produced by Khoa Do -- called Better Man -- which relived the trauma and tragedy of the events and how it affected Van 's mother and twin brother . It was a powerful performance and sent an unmistakable message to those travelling overseas that there are severe penalties in some countries , especially Singapore , and to respect their laws . <p> However , a minute concession has been made to Singapore 's capital punishment law . On 9 July last year , Deputy Prime Minister Teo Chee Hean told parliament that he was easing the death penalty for traffickers , but only if they had acted solely as a courier and did not supply or distribute the drug . <p> Meanwhile , there will be a stay of executions at Changi since the laws have now been amended to accommodate the tweaking on 14 Nov last year . The more than 30 prisoners on Death Row -- mostly on drug offences -- will be able to re-apply for sentencing . This could mean life imprisonment with the rotan ( caning ) . <p> With regard to murder , Law Minister K. Shanmugam told the House -- on the same day as the DPM -- that the government wished to retain capital punishment only for murders with an intention to kill . If there was no outright motive to kill , the sentence could be either the death penalty or a life sentence . <p> This begs the rhetorical question : If Van Tuong Nguyen had been arrested in Singapore for drug trafficking this year instead of more than 10 years ago , would he have avoided the hangman ? Perhaps not , because nothing may have changed until his case generated wide publicity to prompt the amendment . <p> Only this week , Gopinathan Nair Remadevi Bijukumar , 37 , had his murder conviction reduced to life imprisonment and 18 strokes of the cane -- the third re-sentencing since Singapore 's law on the death penalty was amended . <p> Indonesia , too , has a Death Row where two Australians await execution for drug offences committed in April 2005 . Ringleaders of the group dubbed The Bali Nine by the media , Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran , were sentenced to death by firing squad . Appeals for clemency to President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono have been in vain and their execution is imminent . <p> However , some Australians have said : " Do the crime , do the time ! " They have argued that these drug mules cause widespread pain , suffering and sometimes death to youngsters and they deserve the maximum sentences . <p> But , in the Ten Commandments , made famous in the blockbuster movie of the same name by Cecil B DeMille -- starring Charlton Heston as Moses and Yul Bryner as Pharaoh his half-brother -- in 1956 , the sixth commandment proclaimed Thou shall not kill . <p> In Australia , the death penalty was fully abolished in 1985 . Last September , the horrific rape and murder of Irish woman Jillian Meagher made headlines around the world . She was attacked as she walked home on a busy street after Friday night drinks with colleagues in inner Melbourne . Subsequently , more than 30,000 people marched down Sydney Road in Brunswick -- the scene of the crime -- demanding safety for women in the streets . The killer , Adrian Ernest Bayley , had been on parole and sought yet another victim . He was sentenced to life imprisonment with a 35-year non-parole period . In this instance , some people asked if Australia should bring back the death penalty for repeated offenders or serial killers . <p> The other high-profile murder happened two months later and centred on Sarah Cafferkey , who was murdered by someone she knew -- after a row over drugs in his house at Bacchus Marsh in outer Melbourne . The killer , Steven James Hird , who had killed before and served time in jail , had stabbed the victim 19 times before stuffing her in a dustbin and covering it with cement . The court sentenced him to life imprisonment without parole . " Was that enough ? " some concerned citizens have questioned again . <p> Looking back to 2011 , the Herald Sun reported that Victorian Liberal MP Bernie Finn called for the return of the death penalty , especially for drug kingpins . He received a backlash . Opponents of the death penalty said the re-introduction of capital punishment would make Australia a pariah in the eyes of the world . However , Finn found support in Crime Victims Support Association president Noel McNamara , who said : " I think the death penalty should be brought back for anyone who takes a life or causes a ( loss of ) life like happens with drug traffickers . Of course , there 's nothing like permanent rehabilitation on the end of a rope . " <p> But Melburnian mother of two girls Ms M Go , who grew up in Indonesia , disagreed . She said : " I do n't believe in capital punishment . You can not bring back the victims , who died . Instead of capital punishment , they should be sentenced to life imprisonment without parole . They are the product of parents and society and were not corrected at home and in school . The Bible also said to offer the other cheek and not hit back . " <p> Ferntree Gully 's Debra Weston , a working mother of three girls , is not comfortable with the death penalty : " Basically , I would like to say ' yes , bring it back ' -- but mistakes can be made . People may be framed or wrongly convicted . " <p> On the other hand , Wellington Village newsagent Isaac Awat , a Catholic from Iraq , felt strongly about the weak sentencing of hardcore criminals . He said : " Australia should bring back the death penalty for the dangerous people , like those who killed Jillian Meagher and Sarah Cafferkey . " <p> Basically , there are two schools of thought for and against enforcing the death penalty . In between , there are some who believe that the death penalty still has a purpose as a strong deterrent to serious crime , such as repeat , multiple or serial killers . Under their plan , the condemned would be held on Death Row for a few years until all avenues of appeal are exhausted . This ' middle ' group believes even a life sentence without parole would be a drain on taxpayers ' funds . More importantly , these high-risk killers have nothing to lose by attempting a jail break and even kill again if they escape . <p> For the moment , the jury is out on the relevance of the death penalty and in some countries the noose still dangles on the gallows -- perhaps even gathering dust . Make no mistake about it , this problem will fester and not go away for a long time ! <p> P. Francis is an English tutor in Melbourne , who has more than 20 years ' journalism experience with newspapers , books and magazines in Singapore and Australia . <p> Tan Jee Say The empty ballot boxes deserve a thoroughgoing police probe , says Tan Jee Say . Mr Tan , who contested the 2011 presidential election , is surprised by the sudden discovery of two empty ballot boxes . This is irregular . The ballot boxes are supposed to be discarded after the elections , said the Elections Department . The Elections Department filed a police report after it received an email from a member of the public on Tuesday about the empty ballot boxes found . The Elections Department did not say where the boxes were found or which elections they were used for . But they were purportedly found in a school room and based on pictures circulating online appear to be from two polling stations in the Bishan-Toa Payoh GRC and were used in the 2011 presidential election . Mr Tan , who contested the election , said : " I am surprised this has happened . Looks like there is unfinished work by some people . Now that a police report has been lodged , I hope the police will thoroughly investigate into it . " The Elections Department , which is under the Prime Minister ' Office , stressed the discovery of the empty , used ballot boxes had no implications on " the secrecy of the vote and the electoral process " . " They ( the boxes ) are supposed to have been collected by the Elections Department 's contractor , along with other discarded items , from the counting centres for general disposal , " it said . The discovery of used empty ballot boxes would mean that " these were missed by the contractor at the point of collection for disposal " , the statement added . Police said : " The persons interviewed by the Police have told the Police that the ballot boxes were empty when they found them , with no ballot papers inside . Preliminary investigations indicate that these were empty boxes left behind in the counting centre intended to be disposed of . " Investigations are continuing , police added . <p> SINGAPORE 30th August 2013 : Russian diplomats did not respond with love when gay activist Vincent Wijeysingha and his friends went to present a petition , " To Russia with Love " on Friday . They were refused entry into the Russian embassy . Fourteen policemen in eight patrol cars showed up as they were leaving . The police filmed Wijeysingha , Jolovan Wham and Leow Yangfa . They were also asked to produce their NRICs . <p> The activists went to the embassy to present a petition protesting against laws which discriminate against the LGBT ( Lesbian , Gay , Bisexual and Transgender ) community . The petition was signed by 200 individuals at an event , " To Russia with Love " , held at Hong Lim Park last Saturday . It was part of a series of activities organized by Indignation , Singapore 's annual LGBT pride festival . <p> Vijeysingha resigned from the opposition Singapore Democratic Party earlier this week , saying he was leaving party politics to focus on civil society activities . <p> UPDATE on 31st August 2013 -- Media statement from the activists <p> Officials of the Russian Embassy in Singapore have refused to accept a petition signed by 200 members of the LGBT community and their allies when four activists visited their premises on Friday morning , 11am Singapore time . Instead , the embassy called the police and the activists were interviewed for almost an hour before they left the scene . The petition was signed at an event last Saturday ( 24 August ) , ' To Russia with Love ' , held at Hong Lim Park as one of a series of activities organised by Indignation , Singapore 's annual LGBT pride festival . ' To Russia with Love ' was organised in response to the Russian parliament 's adoption of legislation banning the dissemination of information on " non-traditional " sexuality . The Russian government claims that the law will protect children and young people from information and propaganda that are harmful to their well-being and development . There has also been an increase in the number of violent incidents , assaults , harassment and bullying of Russian LGBT people and their allies since the passing of this law . At least two people were reported to have died as a result of homophobic attacks . Vincent Wijeysingha , who was the first politician in Singapore to come out as gay said ' This small act will not change the mind of the Russian government . But it should be left in no doubt that people the world over hold it in contempt . ' Russia will host the Winter Olympics next year and its government has banned demonstrations and rallies in the city of Sochi where the games will be held , in a move that was denounced by rights activists . Last week , an email was sent to the Russian Ambassador requesting a meeting to deliver the petition . The Head of the Consular Section , Bulat Dondukov , replied with this message : <p> The Embassy has received and considered your request for a meeting with an Embassyofficial with the purpose of submitting a petition from Singapore 's LGBT community.We believe that your protest is prompted by gross misconception and is ill-advised . You have misconstrued developments in Russia.First of all , we want to remind that discrimination of any minority is legally prohibited inRussia by the Constitution . Unlike the former Soviet Union homosexual behaviour is not punishable by the Criminal Code . The recently adopted law has one well-defied purpose -- to ban promotion of homosexuality among minors , but not " promotion of homosexuality " , as you claim . The law prohibits promotion in aggressive forms of non-traditional sexual practices among minors.Law enforcement officers now have the right to detain persons who violate the law intentionally ( for example , by conducting public actions near schools and other children institutions ) . And last , but not least : violation of this law is an administrative , not criminal , offence . In a joint statement , the four activists said ' We have been pressing the bell outside the embassy for the last thirty minutes and obviously nobody is coming out to receive us even though they have just let the newspaper man in . So clearly , they are ignoring us which is rather telling , because Putin appears to be a tough man in his own country but his representatives abroad do n't even have the courage to come out to accept nothing more dangerous than a letter . So , we will leave the letter here and go away , but we would like to tell our LGBT friends in Russia from here in Singapore that we support you , and this is done in friendship across the many miles .

@@42215239 <h> Smart data : Designing better learning and measuring its effectiveness <p> The learning and development ( L&amp;D ) industry has several challenges to solve in the years ahead . Two of the more prevalent ones are related to learning design and measuring learning impact . On one hand , L&amp;D professionals tend to recognize that learning has to be more engaging , relevant , and personalized for it to cut through the clutter and have the desired impact . On the other hand , there 's an increased need to quantify and demonstrate that impact and the value of training for the businesses we operate in . <p> Now , what do these two challenges have in common ? Both are a source of frustration for L&amp;D professionals , myself included . But perhaps the more meaningful commonality is in the solution . We could potentially solve both of these problems with smart use of data . <p> On the design front , smart use of data and analytics can help us to personalize learning . Instead of one-size-fits-all courses , we could provide our people with learning activities that work for them and which take into account @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and even career paths , among many other things . As a learning designer myself , the more I know about my learners , the better job I can do . And it tends to make a world of difference to the learners too . <p> But learning design work , of course , does n't stop at the delivery . Ultimately , it 's quite unlikely that we get everything right the first time . At least in our work , we quite often find that the learners did n't engage with the content the way we initially thought . Sometimes we might even realize that we 've addressed an entirely wrong set of problems as we begin to uncover the real ones . Therefore , it 's very important that we utilize data to formulate an understanding into what actually works , how learners engage with the content and the areas we could improve in , and then iterate accordingly . And that puts us on the path towards more impactful learning . <p> Impact , though , is easier said than measured . The learning impact part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , most organizations are looking at the wrong things . The reality is that most common corporate learning metrics such as completion rates , time spent , or results of immediate summative assessment do n't tell us very much about the actual learning at all . But neither do the happy sheets filled in at the end of a classroom session , if that 's a point of comparison . Thankfully , comprehensive tracking , data collection , and analytics enabled by technological developments of recent years enable us to move beyond those metrics , use more formative approaches , and understand learning in a deeper way . <p> But the fun certainly does n't stop there ! After all , we still need to make the case for the value of the learning to the business , do n't we ? To understand that , we need to move beyond the conventional data sources available to the L&amp;D function . First , we 'll want to find out whether learning transfer actually happens , i.e. do people apply the knowledge on the day-to-day . Secondly , we 'll want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , do these new practices have on the business and its performance . <p> Naturally , adding salt to the mix is the fact that none of this happens in a vacuum : behaviors , and especially performance , are influenced by many other factors too . And learning or the impact does n't occur overnight either . But even taking that into account , the only credible way of even getting closer to demonstrating the impact and value of learning is through data . At the end of the day , the more information we have , even if it 's not perfect , the better equipped we are to make those important business and learning decisions . <p> We use cookies and other tracking technologies to improve your browsing experiences on our website , to show you personalised content and targeted ads , to analyze our website traffic and to understand where our visitors are coming from .

@@42260235 <h> A US$103.8 million payout for Indonesia has been approved by the UN 's Green Climate Fund in exchange for reducing emissions by avoiding deforestation . But observers have questioned the way the Indonesian government arrived at that figure . <h> Share <p> A UN fund has approved a $103.8 million payment to Indonesia for preventing deforestation-based carbon emissions -- its biggest payout yet , and one that critics say ca n't be justified . <p> The Green Climate Fund ( GCF ) was set up in 2010 to distribute money , largely from developed countries , to developing ones to keep their forests standing . Last November Indonesia submitted a proposal claiming it had prevented deforestation that could have emitted 20.3 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent ( CO2e ) from 2014-2016 . On Aug. 21 , the GCF approved the proposal during an online meeting , making Indonesia the biggest recipient of the fund to date , and the first one outside Latin America . <p> But the proposal drew expressions of concern from several GCF board members , specifically over the way Indonesia had calculated its prevented emissions . Board member Hans Olav Ibrekk , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Ministry of Foreign Affairs , said Indonesia 's proposal " has some characteristics that in our view affect environmental integrity of the result . " <p> For one , Ibrekk said the reference period used by Indonesia in its proposal was too long . <p> To measure its performance in reducing emissions , Indonesia used average forest-related emissions over a 20-year period , 1993 to 2012 , as its baseline , or Forest Reference Emissions Level ( FREL ) . It then measured its average emissions from 2014 to 2016 against this baseline . <p> In its technical guidance , however , the GCF recommends a baseline of 10 to 15 years , although it allows a maximum of 20 years . <p> " We note that the GCF scorecard permits this , but would highlight that the shorter reference period than 20 years would provide higher environmental integrity , " Ibrekk said during the GCF 's online meeting . <p> He cited Indonesia 's use of 10-year baselines in similar programmes that the country participates in as part of efforts to reduce emissions from deforestation and forest degradation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the World Bank 's Forest Carbon Partnership Facility ( FCPF ) programme . <p> Other observers have also seized on this discrepancy to denounce how REDD+ programmes can be gamed by governments to maximise funding rather than reflect true levels of avoided emissions . In an open letter to GCF board members signed by 85 civil society groups , including 15 from Indonesia , activists say baselines determined from periods of peak deforestation mean that any claimed reductions now " must thus be regarded as paper reductions that bear little resemblance to the actual emissions that were avoided . " <p> " By using inflated reference levels , a country can calculate emission reductions from avoided deforestation even if deforestation rates are rising , " they say . <p> Indonesia has shown actual progress in reducing deforestation , so the country should use a more recent baseline period , said Anggalia Putri Permatasari , a researcher at the environmental NGO Madani . But for the government this would yield a smaller volume of reduced emissions , and thus a smaller payout from the GCF , she said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if the baseline period is shortened ? Not really , " Anggalia told Mongabay . <p> GCF board member Tobias Von Platen-Hallermund , from Denmark , acknowledged that Indonesia has experienced consistent deforestation in recent years and that it 's therefore best to focus the funding on " countries that have been successfully keeping deforestation rates low during the GCF 's reporting period to claim payments , " which runs from 2014 to 2018 . <h> Double counting and indigenous rights <p> Ibrekk also raised concerns over the possibility the Indonesian government had double counted project-level reductions under other REDD+ initiatives and claimed them in its proposal to the GCF . <p> Fellow GCF board member Paola Pettinari , from Italy 's Ministry of Economy and Finance , said there 's a need to coordinate strategies and work with other actors to avoid double counting of emission reductions , given that Indonesia is involved in multiple REDD+ financing initiatives , both multilateral and bilateral . She called the risk of double counting a " very serious issue . " <p> Another concern raised during the GCF 's meeting is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ REDD+ . <p> Erika Lennon , a senior attorney at the Center for International Environmental Law ( CIEL ) and an observer to the GCF , said Indigenous peoples in Indonesia still face an uphill battle in getting their rights respected and recognised . <p> " Respecting the rights of Indigenous peoples is still a major challenge as land use planning , forestry licensing and agricultural policies do not respect or acknowledge that community 's rights , " she said during the GCF meeting . <p> To provide better protection for Indigenous communities ' land rights , the Indonesian government has run a programme called social forestry in the past few years , aiming to grant access to 12.7 million hectares ( 31.4 million acres ) of land to communities across the country . <p> But Lennon noted that the programme only allows communities to access forest resources and does n't give them the right to ownership of the land , forest and resources . <p> " They could only use the forests for 25 years and then return the land back to the state , " she said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ claim their rightful ownership over the land and forest . " <p> Under the social forestry programme , Indigenous groups can submit a request to the Ministry of Environment and Forestry to reclaim their ancestral forests from state control , but it 's a costly process that can take years as they first need to gain formal recognition of their Indigenous status through a local bylaw . As a result , only about 72,000 hectares ( 178,000 acres ) of customary forests have been recognised by the Ministry of Environment and Forestry to date , with recognition for another 915,000 hectares ( 2.26 million acres ) still pending . <p> That figure is still a far cry from the total area of customary forests where Indigenous groups live , estimated by the NGO-run Ancestral Domain Registration Agency ( BRWA ) at about 11.1 million hectares ( 27.4 million acres ) -- an area 11 times bigger than what the environment ministry 's map identifies . <h> Deforestation despite a moratorium <p> Besides the lack of Indigenous rights protection , Lennon also criticized Indonesia 's forestry moratorium policy , saying it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in place since 2011 , bans the issuance of new permits for commercial exploitation of primary and peat forests , in a bid to limit the expansion of oil palm , pulpwood and logging concessions into natural forest areas . <p> The government says the policy has proven effective in curtailing deforestation , but environmental activists call these claims mere " propaganda , " citing evidence to the contrary . An analysis of satellite imagery by Greenpeace shows that deforestation rates in areas protected by the moratorium actually increased after 2011 . <p> Another study , published in 2015 in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , also looked at the effectiveness of the moratorium in reducing deforestation and the resultant emissions . It found that if the same moratorium been imposed a decade earlier , from 2000 to 2010 , it would have resulted in a less than 3 per cent reduction in deforestation and less than 7 per cent reduction in emissions from what actually occurred . <p> Activists attribute the moratorium 's lack of effectiveness on loopholes inherent in the system that allow the " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Notably , the ban on new permits does n't extend to areas categorized as secondary forest , defined under Indonesian law as those that have previously been logged to any extent . As a result , some parties have deliberately cleared areas of primary forest within moratorium zones for the express purpose of degrading them . Once that happens , these areas are recognized as secondary forest , and thus fall out of the scope of the moratorium . <p> Activists have long called on the government to include secondary forests in the moratorium . Failing to do so will leave large swaths of forest unprotected from industrial expansion , they say . The government has not heeded the calls . <p> A new study by researchers at the University of Sheffield 's Grantham Centre for Sustainable Futures and the National University of Singapore found that 83 per cent of Indonesia 's rainforests , mangroves and peatlands most vulnerable to being cleared for palm oil production are completely unprotected by the moratorium . <p> GCF board member Pettinary said there 's a need to strengthen the moratorium to prevent leakage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serious problem regarding REDD+ financing . " She said this need was n't fully addressed in Indonesia 's REDD+ proposal to the GCF . <p> The concerns over deforestation in Indonesia come as the country experiences an increase in the rate of forest loss this year , linked to measures aimed at slowing the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic . The rate of deforestation was up 50 per cent in the first 20 weeks of this year compared to the same period in 2019 , according to data from the Global Land Analysis and Discovery ( GLAD ) laboratory at the University of Maryland , which operates a global warning system for forest loss , and analysed by Greenpeace . <p> Analysis of the same data by WWF Germany found that in March alone , forest clearance in Indonesia was up 130 per cent compared to the three-year average for March 2017 to 2019 , with an estimated 130,000 hectares razed -- the greatest recorded loss of any country that month . <p> Activists have warned of an even greater rate of deforestation as the government looks to jump-start the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open letter to the GCF , the activists highlighted the Indonesian government 's deregulation agenda , in the pipeline since before the pandemic . This includes the loosening of environmental protections laws in the amended mining law , which was passed by parliament in May 2020 . <p> " How can the GCF Board award US$100 million of REDD+ funding to a government that actively promotes deforestation on such a massive scale ? " the letter says . <p> Lennon said the GCF should not have approved the payout to Indonesia until all the concerns had been fully addressed . <p> " We feel that the proposal is n't ready for approval at B26 the GCF meeting and in its current form , it does not reflect the real needs of local communities and indigenous people , nor addresses the real drivers of deforestation and forest degradation in Indonesia , " she said . <h> Funding gap <p> Indonesia 's environment minister , Siti Nurbaya Bakar , acknowledged the concerns raised in the NGOs ' letter but said Indonesia 's proposal and the GCF approval of the payout were both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Development Programme , which is supporting the REDD+ programme in Indonesia , also said Indonesia 's proposal had been evaluated accordingly and passed the GCF 's criteria , including the use of an FREL baseline spanning 20 years . <p> Despite the shortcomings in Indonesia 's efforts to combat deforestation and protect Indigenous peoples ' land rights , Madani 's Anggalia said the approval of Indonesia 's REDD+ proposal is ultimately a good thing as long as the money is well spent . <p> " In REDD+ , we do need the money , " she said . " If we deprive the Indonesian government of the money , will it make Indonesia better ? I do n't think so . " <p> The government has estimated it will take $247.2 billion to achieve its voluntary emissions reduction goal of 29 per cent from the business-as-usual scenario by 2030 . But it has only been able to allocate about $6 billion a year toward that goal , or less than 4 per cent of the national budget , over the past five years . And as the country faces the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has to reduce its climate spending even further this year . <p> " Until 2020 , Indonesia has funded 34 per cent of the total cost " of cutting its emissions , said Sri Mulyani Indrawati , Indonesia 's finance minister . " There 's a 66 per cent gap in that need . This funding gap is actually part of the international commitment of $100 billion every year until 2020 . " <p> The GCF itself has raised only about $21 billion since 2014 , far short of the $100 billion per year pledged by rich countries . Yet even that target is only a fraction of the amount needed by developing countries to tackle climate change , estimated at $1.5 trillion per year . <p> " Developed countries have an ecological debt , with the coffers of the GCF not fully filled yet , " Anggalia said . <p> What 's important now that the GCF payout has been approved , she said , is for the money to be used wisely and transparently . Based on its proposal , the government plans to use the money for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serve as the first line of defense against deforestation and degradation . But to date , these units have been underfunded , Anggalia said . <p> " They exist , but there 's no budget , that 's why they rely on money from companies and NGOs , " she said . " That 's why they need to be strengthened by giving them a mandate , resources and authority . Their job is to monitor Indigenous peoples , land tenure issues , and permits . " <p> The government should also push for the swift passage of an Indigenous rights bill , which has languished in parliament for years . The bill was supposed to be passed in the wake of a landmark Constitutional Court ruling in 2013 that rescinded state control over Indigenous lands and gave it back to Indonesia 's Indigenous peoples . Since then , various laws and regulations have been issued that touch on the issue of indigenous rights to some degree , but the central bill that would tie them all together remains locked in legislative limbo . <p> A lawmaker on the committee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ draft of the bill but ca n't technically start deliberating it without a letter from the president . Anggalia said the government needs to step up its game . <p> " The government has n't been active in pushing for the Indigenous bill , " she said . " It seems like they 've left the bill in the hands of lawmakers . " <p> She called the Indigenous rights bill the " missing piece of the puzzle , " which could get rid of the Byzantine bureaucracy that currently prevents Indigenous communities from having their land rights recognized by the government . <p> " Indigenous peoples ' presence is n't acknowledged , and so the Indigenous bill is really an enabler , " Anggalia said . " What 's sad is that the bill is perceived as not having anything to do with climate change commitments and REDD+ . That 's a misunderstanding because our NDC " -- Indonesia 's emissions reduction target lodged with the U.N . -- " clearly says that land tenure security is an enabler in reducing emissions , especially in forest areas . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over Indonesia 's accounting of its REDD+ emissions reduction , the country could have justifiably claimed a far greater reduction . <p> That 's because the proposal it submitted did n't account for emissions from peatland fires . The annual burning constitutes a significant source of emissions in Indonesia ; during the particularly disastrous fire season of 2015 , the burning of forests and peatlands in Indonesia emitted more greenhouse gases than Japan emits in a year . <p> Yet despite being a significant carbon pool , Indonesia does n't include emissions from peat fires in its FREL , due to the complexity and high uncertainty of the data , including hotspot detection , size of burned area estimation , fire frequency , burned peat depth , and mass of fuel available for combustion . <p> In its proposal , the government said it 's in the process of including emissions from peat fires in its updated FREL , due to be submitted at the end of 2020 . It said it was making progress on peatland fire emissions estimates by collating new findings from published studies . It added @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of those calculations . <p> Anggalia said the omission of peat fires from Indonesia 's FREL and REDD+ proposals was a lost opportunity in terms of the payout that Indonesia could have claimed . <p> " The biggest peat fires in Indonesia occurred in 1997-1998 , " she said . " If our baseline includes that , then we 'll actually get more money . Regardless of whether it 's acceptable or not , we need the money to rehabilitate the environment and for the social forestry programme . If that money can help those programmes , then why not ? But it 's true that there ca n't be foul play " in calculating reduced emissions . <h> Thanks for reading to the end of this story ! <p> We would be grateful if you would consider joining as a member of The EB Circle .

@@42265237 <p> Suddenly , over the week , the mainstream ( controlled ) " media " has been flooded with government press releases and pronouncements on the hiring of foreigners in Singapore . They amount to what look like a concerted attempt to manipulate public discussions on the issue . But they may inadvertently be revealing more than it should about some internal contradictions in government . <p> The Ministry of Manpower came out wielding a shining sword on behalf of beleaguered Singaporean workers . From Sept 1 , firms applying for new Employment Passes for foreign professionals will need to pay them a fixed monthly salary of at least $4,500 , up from $3,900 now . <p> The bar will be set higher for those in the financial services sector -- from Dec 1 , new EP holders will need to be paid at least $5,000 , MOM said .

The elephant in the room is , of course , foreigners working in our banks . Just a week ago , Temasek got very agitated about reports and allegations that it has been inundated with foreign staffers and issued a strong defence of its policy of having a diverse work force . It appealed to Singaporeans to be fair-minded and so on . And it described as " racist " , " false " and " divisive " Facebook posts targeting its Indian employees , standing by its hiring policies while calling for more civility on social media . <p> DBS Bank and Standard Chartered Bank have also come under similar criticism on social media , in what observers said are " real inter-group tensions " that need to be resolved . <p> The other minder of one of our ( Singaporeans ' and NOT the ruling party 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Singapore , also criticised the spreading of falsehoods on the hiring practices of financial institutions . It said it was unhelpful and unfair to foreigners who worked and contributed to Singapore . <p> " We hear the views and concerns of Singaporeans who have spoken up on the issue of local representation in the financial sector , " the central bank and financial regulator said . <p> " But the propagation of falsehoods by some individuals is unhelpful for an informed discussion on these issues ; not to mention , unfair to the financial institutions concerned as well as to the foreigners who work here and contribute to Singapore . " <p> MAS said overall , the picture is a positive one for Singaporeans . Singapore citizens take up seven out of 10 jobs in the financial service sector . <p> Quite adroitly , the government has been manoeuvring the debate on unfair policies which have placed true-blue Singaporeans at a growing disadvantage in their own country into one that it says Singaporeans should avoid . It sidetracks and avoids the main issues to talk about things almost irrelevant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the real professionally disgraceful purveyors of falsehoods otherwise known as mainstream " media " . <p> The overall mantra being chanted seems to be : " Do n't be racist . " <p> Question is : How does expressing one 's perception that so many citizens of a particular foreign country seem to be " enclaving " certain companies become a racist comment ? It is the legitimate right of Singaporeans to bring this to the attention of the authorities -- unless the authorities prefer to monitor everything themselves and simply expect citizens to suffer in silence . <p> The very fact that all the companies which seem to be targeted by the online postings have come out with figures which show foreigners do not dominate the companies is good . Indeed , MOM itself has said it has put 47 more firms in its Fair Consideration Framework watchlist introduced in 2016 to identify employers suspected of having " discriminatory hiring practices " . <p> Of the 47 firms , 30 are in the financial services and professional services sectors . <p> A number of these employers have exceptionally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> At one wealth management firm here , almost three-quarters of its PMETs are of the same nationality .

Either that -- or we are now witnessing various arms of a government not quite agreeing with one another . <p> A ministry under fire takes the correct nationalistic line to protect Singaporeans . Simultaneously , at least two of the three organisations in charge of Singapore 's sovereign funds are saying to the face of true-blues : We are not beholden to you . <p> MOM is right . Well done .

Given this , TOC did not deserve to be issued a correction order , the lawyer said . But the Attorney-General 's Chambers said a responsible news outlet would have made reasonable attempts to verify information that could threaten public interest before publishing it . <p> TOC had sent an e-mail to MHA for verification moments before the article was published , leaving scant time for the ministry to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The issue of how the Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act ( Pofma ) interacts with journalism was canvassed yesterday . <p> TOC was issued a correction direction in January over a story - quoting Lawyers for Liberty - that alleged Singapore 's prison officers were told to kick the heads of death-row prisoners to snap their necks when the rope breaks during hanging , among other things . TOC filed an appeal under Pofma to have the correction direction set aside . This was dismissed by High Court Judge Belinda Ang . <p> Yesterday , Mr Thuraisingam said the Government should issue a correction direction when a news outlet refuses to carry its response .

@@42292230 <h> How to get $4m by the age of 65 through your CPF ? <p> On Money and Me , Michelle Martins speaks with Loo Cheng Chuan , Founder of 1M65 , who has proven that we can build our retirement nest egg to 4 million dollars by 65 using our CPF . We find out how this works . <p> Michelle Martin ( MM ) : Most of us manage our CPF balance in the Ordinary Account ( OA ) through our employer contributions at 2.5 per cent interest , but that is nowhere near the 4 per cent rate that the Special Account ( SA ) and MediSave enjoy . <p> So what do you need to do to build your retirement nest egg up to 4 million dollars ? <p> Loo Cheng Chuan ( LCC ) : In 2015 , I started the movement called 1M65 , a million by 65 years old . I 've always felt that the CPF gives very high interest rates , especially the Special Account ( SA ) and MediSave accounts . <p> CPF SA has a 4 per cent interest rate , and you can go as high as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over a long period of time , you can actually earn a lot of interest . <p> I know that many people are upset with the government because they 've set many restrictions on the SA , but the truth is that it helps you to make a million dollars . <p> When I was 30 , my wife and I filled up our SA and MediSave accounts to the maximum limit of $130,000 at that time and after we did the calculations , we found out that we will have 1 million dollars combined by the time we retire . <p> What surprised me was that this formula simply showed that even if we do not work for the rest of our lives , we will still have a million dollars waiting for us upon retirement . <p> This means , if I continue to work to the age of 65 at 30 years old , I will have much more than 1 million dollars in my CPF . <p> When I crossed 45 years old , our combined CPF has exceeded 1 million dollars so I know that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> MM : Most people are unhappy because they want to get their hands on their money in the CPF and spend it , but is the essence of your programme really about transferring money from your OA to SA for the highest interest rates ? <p> LCC : Let me give an analogy . Many of our forefathers , including our grandparents or even our parents , made a lot of money from their properties by simply buying and leaving it there . <p> They do n't look at its price or buy and sell their properties every day . They let the power of compounding do its job and as a result , the price of the properties doubled or tripled 10 to 30 years later . <p> This is the same for most investments , including the CPF . You have to let the power of compounding take its course and accumulate over time . <p> nid:493749 <p> While you want to touch the money in your CPF , the act of touching will be analogous to buying and selling your property on multiple occasions . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in your CPF on multiple occasions , you are not letting that power of compounding take place . <p> Therefore , the lock-up of the CPF plays to our favour so , I 'm a big supporter of a prolonged lock-up of the CPF until the time you retire . <p> MM : This is the best of passive investing , is n't it ? <p> LCC : For me it is , because the risk is nearly zero . Taking political and policy risks aside , this is the most riskless 4per cent interest I 've seen in my life . <p> MM : Although there are no sales charges , setup fees or transaction fees , there are opportunity costs . When you move money from your OA to your SA , you ca n't move it back and people use their OA to pay their mortgage . <p> LCC : I would suggest buying a humble house just to meet your needs . You should still have some remaining money in your Ordinary Account ( OA ) after paying for mortgages for most HDB BTOs . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money . Over time , you 'll find that you 've hit the maximum limit in your SA , that 's when your OA will start to accumulate . <p> MM : So what are the targets I should set for myself if I want to reach 4M65 ? How much should I have to have in my SA and MediSave ? <p> LCC : First , I 'm reaching out to all the young adults . Time is on your side . Allow yourself to fill up your SA and MediSave accounts as fast as possible . Keep your Full Retirement Sum ( FRS ) of $181,000 in the SA . <p> Try to actively transfer your funds in OA to SA to fill it up as much as possible . With that amount , it will compound and you will see a phenomenal number when you retire . <p> Secondly , both you and your partner are encouraged to continue working . Some people asked whether it is possible to hit 2M65 alone ( half of the target of 4M65 as a couple ) . <p> I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both you and your partner work , you can do load sharing of expenses for house mortgages and so on . <p> And have the guts to just actively put your OA into S&amp;P 500 without the need to time the market or need to feel if you are putting in the right time , right place , and just let power compounding do its job . <p> nid:466887 <p> MM : Why did you make that jump to up the limit from 1M65 to 4M65 for your movement ? <p> LCC I 've always wanted to know how much I will have when I reach 65 . So , I crunched the numbers using my rudimentary excel skills and found that I could shoot beyond 4 million . <p> I got about 10 fans who are good at excel and finance to help me with the excel spreadsheet and most of them came back with higher numbers , way above 4 million dollars . <p> That 's how I discovered and developed the 4M65 strategy . It took the industry by storm because nobody believes that you can make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Is there a limit to how much money I can make off this 4per cent rate in my SA and MediSave ? <p> LCC : Yes , there are limits but there are ways to work around it . The limit is imposed by the FRS cap of $181,000 . <p> However , your salary and bonus can go beyond this amount . On top of that , the interest you get from your FRS will stay within the FRS . Therefore , it is possible for you to exceed $181,000 if you continue to work or put in money . <p> Here is an exclusive CPF hack for MONEY FM 89.3 listeners : <p> This is an interesting hack I 've found by accident and I do n't think CPF thinks of it as a loophole , but rather , it is something they encourage everyone to do . <p> Listen to the full podcast to hear why Loo Cheng Chuan has faith in his OA investments in the S&amp;P 500 : <p> This article was first published in MONEY FM 89.3 .

@@42292239 <h> 5 of Singapore 's Most Ridiculously Expensive Restaurants <p> At MoneySmart , we 're all about providing you with an independent and humorous view of personal finance with one goal in mind -- to save you money . So let me start off by saying ... this article IS N'T one of them . If you 're a frugal spender with heart problems , now would be the time to stop reading . Today , we 're taking on a subject dear to all Singaporeans , food , but not with our usual money saving approach . Instead of looking at restaurants that leave you and your wallet happy , we 're going to look at 5 restaurants that are so expensive -- you 'll probably cry harder after seeing the receipt than that time you watched The Notebook ! Let 's caveat this first by saying ANY restaurant can be expensive if you decide to go overboard on ordering , but these are the ones where a glass of water costs as much as your monthly utility bill . Here are 5 of Singapore 's most ridiculously priced restaurants : <h> 1 . Waku Ghin <p> Waku @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -- unless you know of some " member 's only " restaurant with some shady initiation ritual that I do n't know about ... on second thought , I do n't want to know . Like Restaurant Andre ( below ) , it features a main dining room that accommodates a limited amount of diners -- only 25 at a time . And if there 's something that makes discerning diners jump ahead of the line to sacrifice their wallets on the altar , it 's beating out hundreds of other diners for a seat at a high-class restaurant . <p> Cheap Alternative : Honestly , as Singapore 's most expensive restaurant on the list , it 's safe to say that just about anything you can think of is cheaper by comparison . Hell , the other restaurants on this list are cheaper alternatives ! <h> 2 . Restaurant Andre <p> Its nondescript exterior gives people walking by the impression that it 's like any other shophouse , but that illusion is part of the " exclusivity " of this place . And when I say exclusive , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Restaurant Andre is a small restaurant with highly trained chefs that 's already received international acclaim for its cuisine . At least the restaurant has some very nice loveseats for you to sit in while you 're crying over the bill . Here 's some more info on Restaurant Andre : <p> Cheap Alternative : I never hear " French food " and " cheap " in the same sentence . But in this case , I think you 'll find a great tasting exception in places like The French Ladle and Saveur , which cost you less than 10% of what you 'll pay at Restaurant Andre . <h> 3 . Shinji By Kanesaka <p> A restaurant that 's tied to an internationally renowned chef ( in this case , omakase chef Shinji Kanesaka ) , means 2 things : 1 ) the cost of the ingredients used will rival the per ounce cost of some precious metals , and 2 ) expect to cry when you see the bill ... and to add insult to injury , you 'll probably feel hungry again an hour or two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chef Shinji specialises in omakase cuisine , which is Japanese for " I 'll leave it to you " . You have NO say at all in the menu ( unless you 're allergic to something ) and well , you have no say in the price as well . <p> Cheap Alternative : I love sushi just as much as the next guy , but $300 bucks for some sushi and sake is almost as much as I spend on food for a month ! Nah , there 's plenty of other sushi places that are 10% of what you 'd pay at Shinji , such as Umi Sushi , Itacho Sushi , and an army other others . <h> 4 . CUT Singapore ( by Wolfgang Puck ) <p> - Advertisement - <p> CUT Singapore is the " perfect storm " when it comes to washing away all of the bank notes in your wallet in one meal . Why ? For 3 reasons : 1 ) it 's in an expensive setting ( MBS , enough said ! ) , 2 ) it serves prime , imported @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than silver per ounce , and 3 ) a world-renowned chef has his name tagged to it . Here 's some more info on CUT : <p> Cheap Alternative : Personally , I 'd rather pay only 10%-15% of the bill by buying a Wagyu rib eye steak at a meat market and cooking it at home . Of course , if you 'd rather not , there 's always Chilli 's or Astons. <h> 5 . Catalunya <p> While Catalunya does n't have a big name chef like Wolfgang Puck to add another 20% markup to the menu price , it has something that none of the other restaurants on this list have -- a unique , dome-shaped setting that 's built right on top of Marina Bay . Combined with the novelty of Spanish cuisine and Singaporean 's love of suckling pig , it makes the experience a deliciously painful experience for your wallet . <p> Cheap Alternative : Now , at the risk of getting hanged by the Spanish population here in Singapore , I 'm not going to recommend a cheap Mexican food alternative . Thankfully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cost you 25% less in Salt Tapas &amp; Bar and Serenity Spanish Bar and Restaurant .

Grow your wealth , preserve your legacy and start planning ahead for your needs with this indexed universal life insurance policy by Manulife Singapore <h> Newsletters <h> Newsletters <p> The world is currently experiencing one of the worst health crises that will inadvertently have an impact on the economy . Understandably , it is now more important than ever to safeguard your wealth and protect your family , including your children and the generations ahead . <p> If preserving and growing your accumulated wealth for future generations is important to you , Manulife 's Signature Indexed Universal Life Select policy could be suitable for your needs . It is designed for those who are seeking greater control over their legacy , with the advantage of potentially higher returns via an index account while limiting your exposure to market risks .

One possible way of doing this is for him to divide US$20 million between his two children by will , so each child receives US$10 million .

@@42334233 <h> PAP has been enjoying the mother of all free rides -- until GE2020 <p> Life is no longer a free ride for the People 's Action Party . If last week 's Parliamentary proceedings are any indication , it will get tougher for the ruling party and it has to seriously up its act in the battle for the hearts and minds of Singaporeans . <p> The party seems anxious to put on an appearance of accepting Singaporeans ' growing desire for checks and balance and diversity of political voices . Even before PM Lee Hsien Loong 's NDP Rally replacement speech in Parliament , it allowed a number of its MPs to sound more like Opposition MPs than PAP ones . <p> For example , Patrick Tay ( Pioneer ) , an NTUC assistant secretary-general , in an earlier session debating the President 's address , noted the many MPs had argued that more had to be done to strengthen the Singaporean core -- a big issue during GE2020 . " In fact , I was doing a count as we progressed through the speeches -- and the phrase ' Singaporean core ' has been mentioned over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said . Well , what do you know , good for him . <p> By the time Parliament debated the PM 's own speech , one could be forgiven for believing that the party has clearly got the message from GE2020 and will declare UNEQUIVOCABLY -- no ifs no buts -- that the interests of true-blue born and bred , especially NS-serving , Singaporeans will be the top priority of every government policy . Any other variation would be a debasement of citizenship and an insult to Singaporeans . <p> - Advertisement - <p> That 's just one issue . I do not want to belabour my point about the undesirability of having an of-age male minister who has never served NS . The party will have to live with that seriously ugly blot -- which will not go away by the way just because it has been ignored and wrongly regarded as unimportant . <p> More revealing . We now know that all this posturing about the importance of the Singapore core sounds hollow when we have to witness an over-the-top reaction to a perfectly fair observation about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mun Wai , from the PSP , said he was disappointed that the DBS has not been able in 22 years to find and groom a homegrown talent to head the bank whose current CEO became a naturalised citizen on the day he was appointed . <p> " I am not sure what you mean by ' homegrown ' , " Minister for Communications and Information S Iswaranasked Leong . " Because what we say can not be unsaid ... And everyone -- Singaporeans , new citizens , Singapore-born , others who are here -- will all be looking at this .

And they will continue to be sorely disappointed that no one from the Singapore core is considered good enough to head a national bank .

I also note that lawyer Soh has been offering pro-bono legal services as a grassroots leader . They are Singaporeans.to.the.core . <p> The PAP should also move on and grow new bonds with Singaporeans . It ought to get out of its sense of self-entitlement and rely less on the legacy of its first-generation leaders .

From his point of view , you vote for the party to take charge of the country and should not risk any other result , that 's how the system works . You can not have a free ride . <p> Unfortunately , an unnecessary , maybe inadvertent , side comment in reply to Pritam Singh 's remark about the WP 's troubles in carrying out its constituency work as a loyal constructive Opposition seemed to suggest that Opposition parties have to accept that they were not going to get a free ride in a system which has not been built by them . <p> That turned out to be a monumental PR disaster . <p> Social media responded with a tsunami of memes , videosand comments about all alleged manners of PAP free rides and riders .

@@42359237 <h> Analysis : PR rule book amidst a data breach <p> Details <p> Grace Ong <p> 22 October 2020 <p> Cybersecurity has been a increasing prevalent issue in recent times . Most recently , COURTS was found to have a data breach for the second time in two years , which saw it being slapped with a SG$9,000 fine . There also has been a slew of data breaches from brands such as ShopBack , RedDoorz , Razer , and Shopify . <p> While data breaches are becoming far more common , it still does n't take away the fact that when an actual breach occurs , the trust between the consumer and the brand is put on the line . Pamela Tor Das , managing director , LEWIS Singapore , told MARKETING-INTERACTIVE that once the trust is broken , consumers will become wary of providing their data with the brand in the future . <p> With the increased adoption of digitalisation , especially during the COVID-19 era , efforts to prevent data breaches should now be integral . As such , the possibility of a data breach must now be part of a standard crisis preparedness and planning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , investigation taskforce , activating the crisis management team , as well as communication strategies and holding lines need to be prepared in advance , " she added . <p> According to Kunalan Chakravarthy , chief executive of Priority Consultants Group , <p> A data breach can whip up a perfect storm of cascading events with a broken trust being just the tip of the iceberg <p> Aside from risking the loss of customer confidence and loyalty , a data breach may also lead to a fall in market confidence , resulting in tumbling share prices and difficult questions to answer from investors and analysts . <p> Weighing in on the conversation , Nadia Chan , general manager , PR Communications , added that brands may also suffer financial losses in terms of compensation to affected customers , heightened security costs , as well as regulatory fines . " Data breaches can also significantly damage brand value and reputation when the incident is covered by news sources and spreads widely on social media , " Chan said . <p> Align your narrative <p> Should a breach occur , transparency and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Das added that the PR professionals involved need to find out as much information such they can such as what types of data have been impacted , and ensure those impacted are contacted swiftly . " It is also up to the brand to assess what would be critical data they need to capture versus other sensitive data they can omit capturing , " she added . <p> Agreeing with Tor Das , PR Communications ' Chan said when involved in a data breach , brands should firstly have a full grasp of the incident -- when and how it happened , what data was compromised -- and quickly acknowledge the issue by communicating it to customers . In such cases , putting one 's customers first is vital and practicing clear , transparent and proactive communication with empathy is critical to rebuilding trust among them . <p> " Brands should always aim to be the first source of information for the public when a breach has occurred . This will allow them to control the narrative around the issue , before news of it spreads quickly on mainstream media @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The information deployed should also be clearly communicated to all internal stakeholders such as employees and investors , with a communication plan in place to ensure consistency , along with regular updates at every stage of response . Brands should also not forget to restore trust with its external stakeholders such as suppliers and partners , and shareholders . <p> PR teams need to be quick on their feet to sieve through information that is widely available offline and online -- whether it 's through media coverage , forums or social media , Chan said . It is vital to stay on top of what is being said about the brand in real time to prevent anything from escalating , and to address areas that are not factually true through a media statement or press release . <p> The aim here is to diffuse any possible speculation among those affected . <p> It is also essential to ensure that the communications plan and messaging developed by the PR team stay consistent with all relevant stakeholders , which is vital when communicating with the press during interviews or press conferences and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Ninemer Communications added that PR teams need to understand the context of the data breach , and how it affects the users to respond swiftly and effectively . " More importantly , brands should not shy away from addressing the gaps and putting in place measures to close these loops . They should have the mindset that consumer outreaches after a breach is a way to constantly stay connected with their stakeholders , to improve the system , " Ho also said . <p> When it comes to addressing the issue , Chakravarthy told MARKETING-INTERACTIVE that it is important to have pre-prepared statements and more importantly , a clear understanding of responsibilities across the team on how to stop the data breach and generally manage the entire data system . These pre-emptive measures should be made public on the company 's website and shared via direct communications with partners and clients . <p> Additionally , he cautioned that should a breach occur , rather than play the " blame game " , brands need to be transparent and through decisive actions , try to limit the reputational damage . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respective role and responsibilities when it comes to data security and breaches . " Many mistakes are not malicious but just come from a lack of training , " he said , adding that brands should always use communications tools and techniques to keep all the stakeholders updated on the company 's commitment and pre-emptive actions that are in place to protect digital assets . <p> Not the end of the road if breached <p> Although data breaches are definitely detrimental to brand trust , PR players are of the view that all is not lost for brands should it occur . <p> Chan said while many believe companies ' reputations will be severely tarnished by data breaches , sometimes data breaches can actually foster a deeper sense of brand loyalty and stronger customer relationships if brands are able to handle it well . <p> While the issue has already taken place , what matters is how well one responds to it . <p> Good practices include showing empathy towards those affected , being proactive and transparent , according to Chan . To reduce the risk of future data breaches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and develop a business continuity plan outlining the various steps for responding and reporting data breaches should it occur again , Chan added . <p> Holding a similar sentiment , Lewis ' Tor Das is of the view that to regain consumer confidence after the breach , brands need to communicate clearly the measures they have put in place to protect the data , whether that 's through website security during a registration process or through proactively lending their voice on the topic in the media space . <p> Having an optimistic outlook is Ho as well , who said there have been brands which were involved in data breaches and bounced back from the glitches . She added that these brands are usually well prepared , and deliver strong post-breach solutions and communications to assure their stakeholders . Hence , it is crucial to be well prepared because a confusing and evasive post-breach communications efforts can magnify the problem , causing more damage than the breach itself .

A group of scientists led by the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and thwe National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research reveals that the virus can take hold in the salivary glands as it replicates and in few cases causes prolonged disease when infected saliva gets swallowed into the gastrointestinal tract or the lungs where it can lead to pneumonia . <p> While the majority of the coronavirus research had focused on the lungs and nose , this is the first research for identifying the mouth as a primary site for the infection and underscores the importance of wearing a mask and physical distancing .

@@42374233 <p> Here 's your ticket to incisive commentary and insights from the celebrity sphere . Sign up for our newsletter . <p> Email Address <p> Yes , I agree to the Privacy Policy <p> At press time , The Queen 's Gambit is the No. 5 show on Netflix Singapore . If you have n't watched it yet , you should -- we had early access to this limited series , and enjoyed every minute of it . Thomas Brodie-Sangster stars across Anya Taylor-Joy in the drama about a fictitious chess prodigy 's trials and triumphs , and suffice it to say that it 's yet another wildly different role from what you 've seen him portray . This time , he plays the mysterious and aloof chess champion Benny Watts , who serves as the foil , mentor and more to Taylor-Joy 's Beth Harmon . <p> If there was a recurring theme in the production of this cover story , it was how people seemed to recall Brodie-Sangster so differently . A few people remembered him as " the kid from Love Actually " -- a good 17 years after the polarising movie 's release ( couples @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love ) . Others brought up his starring role as Newt in The Maze Runner trilogy . Of course , many recalled his part as Jojen Reed in the HBO hit Game of Thrones . Indeed , this 30-year-old English actor 's career , which spans nearly 20 years now , has been characterised by diversity . From critically acclaimed cult films to blockbuster trilogies and award-winning TV series , Brodie-Sangster has done them all . Along the way , he 's even managed to dabble in various other things , from voice acting to music . Brodie-Sangster has repeatedly demonstrated his versatility as an actor , and his easy chemistry with his fellow cast members . It 's clear that he 's transitioned very well from a child actor , and continues to expand on his craft with depth and scope . We certainly have much to look forward to from this young thespian . <h> The upcoming Netflix miniseries The Queen 's Gambit sees you playing chess champion Benny Watts . How did you come to work again with director Scott Frank , after 2017 's Godless ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had a great time working with him on Godless in 2016 . Anyway , he called me up and said that he had this general idea about a world of chess , and how he had this character he was working on that he 'd like me to attempt . That got me excited , and I trusted him , so I read the script . It was really interesting , but the telling of the story as a whole was challenging as well , so I decided to go for it . <h> It sounds like a return to familiarity in some ways . <p> Oh , yes . It was quite bizarre actually , because many crew members from Godless were going to return as well , from the director of photography to the first assistant . The Queen 's Gambit was largely shot in Berlin , but during its production , I was with a bunch of Americans that I was previously hanging around with out in the middle of the New Mexico desert . <h> It looks like the role of Benny Watts was written @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much input did you have when it came to developing this character ? <p> I think what you normally find is that directors who have written the project themselves are a lot more comfortable with allowing people the space to give their own input . Scott is very generous and open that way . In terms of characterisation , I personally find that things really start coming together once you get into the clothes that the costume department has prepared for you . You get a feel of what feels right and what works , and that 's when the character begins to come alive and feel tangible . When I saw how they were going for a strange-looking , pirate-like character for Benny Watts , a chess player from a very different time period , it clicked for me : he 's a rebellious figure , but also a bit of a cowboy . From there , it 's playing as much chess as possible to work on the tactile parts of the role . There 's a lot of work with the hands and fingers , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the little details like that . <p> Coat and Shirt , Paul Smith ; Clash de Cartier ring , Cartier <h> Yes , I noticed that every character has his or her little set of mannerisms and habits during a game in THE QUEEN 'S GAMBIT . <p> Yes , that was a very personal thing . It was very interesting when we came together to play chess , because we saw that everyone had been working on developing their little habits . We had some chess champions who were working as consultants with us too , and sometimes we 'd do nothing but practise handling the pieces . Making these actions look authentic requires finesse , whether it 's how you move your piece to how you press the clock . We had to develop spatial awareness too , in terms of being aware of the pieces on the board , especially when you were playing speed chess . You do n't want to knock pieces over there , or you 'll just look sloppy . <h> Did Scott Frank specify anything for how you 'd play your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the character to have as much facial hair as possible , and he gave me plenty of time to try and grow that mustache . What you see on screen was all that I could muster on my face . ( laughs ) <p> Accent-wise , I asked Scott if he would like me to do a bit of the New York twang . But because the characters were from all over the world , he did n't want the series to turn into a show with multiple accents , or the audience would n't be grounded anywhere . That was the only thing , I think , that he said no to . <h> This is a tad premature , but do you think there 'll be a second season for The Queen 's Gambit ? <p> I do n't know . We had the same thought about Godless as well , because everyone loved making it , and thought that it was such a good story . I think Scott likes to tell a story with a clear beginning , middle and end . We live in an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and repeating ideas that work just to make more money . But it 's not always about that , because you can lose track of that lovely narrative structure . Maybe Scott has an idea for a sequel , but I do n't personally see it , and we have n't spoken about it . <h> TV is , of course , just part of your overall work . You 're involved in films like The Maze Runner series as well , and you 've done some voice acting . Do you have a preference between them ? <p> I love the magic of filmmaking . I absolutely love being on set , watching hundreds of people working together in such a small environment . Each person is n't just talented , but also very good at what they do . That , to me , is very impressive , and makes me want to do the best that I can myself . It 's all fictitious , of course , but it 's also grounded in the reality of our efforts , and when the energies combine in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it seems almost real in some ways . That 's when you have the most productive sets that create the best stories and films . It 's gratifying and rewarding . <p> I think voice acting is fun too , because you get to play characters that you 'd never get cast as . Maybe you 're just not a match for this character visually or physically . Maybe it 's some other reason . Voice acting is a little less restrictive that way . There 's also the opportunity to play around with your voice , and even take on multiple characters in a single show . It 's fast too : you 're in a studio dressed in whatever you want , and there 's no makeup involved . Instead , it 's all very techy -- you 're just there with a sound engineer and your fellow voice actors , and focusing on things like microphone technique . It 's interesting for sure , but it 's not my first love . <p> Turtleneck and suit , both Berluti <h> How do you choose which roles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like what you did with The Queen 's Gambit ? <p> Yes , and it 's still something that I still struggle with . I 'm mildly dyslexic , so that does n't help , but it 's really in trying to work out if something is good or not , and whether the way you envision things is the way they will turn out . The script is all you 've got to go on though , along with the director and producers and what they 've done in the past . That 's why it was lovely doing The Queen 's Gambit , because I knew the people who would be behind it . Coming in fresh , however , it 's difficult to know what 's what , honestly . <h> You 've played a varied assortment of characters since starting out in 2001 . Was this a deliberate choice ? <p> Yes . And no . Yes , because it 's much more fun to play characters from all over the place . And no , because these were just what came up , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I got to try doing a variety of roles . <h> Looking back , were there any roles that you regret taking up , or wish you 'd done differently ? <p> The broad answer is no , but you 're always going to be critical because that 's how you learn and develop yourself for the next role . Part of the beauty of playing a role is that you go through things in the moment , but whether you 've got it down or not is up to the director and the creative team . They are the ones who pick the exact take to include in their show , and cut around it however they want . It 's none of your business at that point . There 's something a little scary about that because if you mess up -- or feel like you did -- then there 's really nothing that you can do about it . The best that you can do is to let it go . <p> Jacket , turtleneck , trousers and boots , all Bottega Veneta <h> And you 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think I did that from a very early age . When I started out in this industry , I had no insecurities or issues like being overly critical . I kind of did n't really care , even .

These attitudes do contradict one another sometimes . <h> What 's next on the cards for you ? <p> That 's a hard one , because you only have a certain amount of control over your career , while the rest of it just kind of happens around you .

@@42380230 <p> It 's this passion that has inspired the Singaporean real estate entrepreneur , whose company 8M Real Estate owns popular boutique hotels such as Wanderlust , KeSa House and Ann Siang House , to create new communities that are bringing even more buzz to the city <p> Even in October , when we met Ashish Manchharam , the man behind these two properties , for a photoshoot at KeSa House on Keong Saik Road , the hotel was still not up and running . In the few areas that we had access to , beds were wrapped in protective plastic , and utensils and kitchen equipment remained covered up . <p> But this is not a sign that things have taken a turn for the worse . Rather , Manchharam , the founder and managing director of 8M Real Estate , says he has been busy implementing plans for the future . Since Singapore 's circuit breaker measures to curb the spread of Covid-19 was lifted , the two hotels , which are located in heritage shophouses , have been undergoing improvements that he had long been meaning to implement . <p> " Occupancy has been great since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not fix while there were guests . So having the closures gave us the window of opportunity to make some refurbishments to the spaces , " he says . " We are optimistic that when things open up further , Singapore will be well-positioned for recovery given that we have been better at managing the pandemic than most places . " <p> Both hotels , together with the recently revamped Wanderlust hotel , are slated to finally reopen this month . <h> A NEW WAY OF LIVING <p> Soon , Manchharam will find out if the company 's concept of " flexible living " will resonate in this new world of social distancing and global travel restrictions . In recent years , with the rise of digital nomads and millennials who value experiences over material luxuries , this hospitality trend -- where the focus is on longer-term stays , unique amenities such as interesting F&amp;B options and access to a community of like-minded individuals -- has been in the ascendant . <p> At 8M 's portfolio of hotels , this concept is literally built into the rooms . Manchharam points @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ installed high enough to roll a suitcase underneath , and the cubbyholes built into the bed frame double as extra storage space . The room where we conducted the interview in even opens out to a private patio that is large enough to unroll a yoga mat ( or two ) for a private exercise session . <p> " Our designs offer you the option to stay for a night , a week or a month , depending on what suits you best . It 's not just about being creative with small spaces , but making it really liveable and cosier than a hotel room , so that it feels a bit more like your own , " he says . <p> With travel restrictions still in place , the hotels will have to rely on the local market for the demand . With his characteristic frankness , Manchharam acknowledges that staycations are but a stopgap measure for Singapore 's hospitality industry . " With low visitor arrivals , it is hard to fill rooms . The staycation market is not big enough for everyone , " he states @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shortfall by renting out rooms for " workcations " or pivoting their public spaces into co-working spaces for those who need a break from working from home . What Manchharam is banking on is that there will be a demand for longer-term stays among those who are seeking out a change in environment away from their homes during these times . <p> " We see some demand for alternate spaces to live in . For example , people who share an apartment or live with their families may wish to get a space just for themselves for a couple of months , " he observes . <p> His hotels also offer options for those who may still not be convinced about sharing communal spaces . While there are some common facilities such as a kitchen and laundry room , there are also rooms that come with a personal kitchenette for those who prefer cooking in private . " It is about having your own space the way you choose it , so you could pick a room that allows you to be more isolated . But at the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vibrant and historically significant location that you can draw inspiration from , " he points out . <p> Our entire portfolio is focused on bringing new energy and life to these locations by curating lifestyle destinations within the city . We realised that by curating these clusters , we were also developing the community in these different areas . <h> How he began his career <p> Indeed , establishing these dynamic communities are exactly what Manchharam has set out to achieve from the get-go . His affinity for old buildings runs deep -- the Singaporean grew up in the Kampong Glam area where his family was involved in textile trading and conducted business in the retail shophouses in the neighbourhood . In the early 2000s after he graduated from college , he pitched in to help the family enhance its real estate portfolio by acquiring shophouses in the vibrant enclaves of Haji Lane and Arab Street . <p> He founded 8M Real Estate in 2014 to focus exclusively on revitalising historic buildings located close to the CBD by establishing new concepts in F&amp;B and hospitality within their premises . Its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lane , Boat Quay and Circular Road . Last December , the company acquired four adjoining conservation shophouses on South Bridge Road and another three along Tanjong Pagar Road for $70.35 million . <p> Manchharam says , " Our entire portfolio is focused on bringing new energy and life to these locations by curating lifestyle destinations within the city . We realised that by curating these clusters , we were also developing the community in these different areas . " <p> For example , the F&amp;B outlets at Ann Siang House include the cool basement pizza joint Blue Label , while Michelin Bib Gourmand eatery The Coconut Club is located around the corner . At Hong Kong Street , the company operates Base Residences apartments in an art deco building , which also houses Gully , a dine-in eatery and Vios , a cloud kitchen , both by Greek restaurant Blu Kouzina , as well as a boutique office space . He quips that he is carefully considering options for the eatery on the ground floor of his office space on Amoy Street , since it will be one that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next , the company will reopen Wanderlust , the edgy boutique hotel in Little India , which 8M Real Estate acquired from hotelier Loh Lik Peng in 2018 . It has been reimagined as a flexi-living alternative to co-living or serviced apartments . The space will also house Kotuwa , the new Sri Lankan restaurant by renowned chef Rishi Naleendra . " This is more ' extreme ' than what we have done to date as Wanderlust is in a more up-and-coming location as compared to our other destinations , which are already more established , " he says . " We thought through what would work in this space on top of having a beautiful building you can come in to see and experience -- and the idea is to have Sri Lankan food in Little India . " <h> Overcoming Covid-19 together <p> It is this focus on introducing unique F&amp;B concepts that has kept many of 8M 's tenants -- and by extension the real estate company as well -- afloat through the recent tough times . Part of this is due to the range of like-minded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a combination of having a great relationship with the operator and being able to understand their needs so that we can suss out a space that works for them , " he says . These forward-thinking restaurateurs include the SJS Group , which launched New York cocktail bar Employees Only on Amoy Street and Bar Milano at KeSa House , and chef Travis Masiero 's group of restaurants , which include Luke 's Oyster Bar and Chop House , and Blue Label , as well as a soon-to-open taqueria . <p> The company also extended help to tenants facing cash-flow issues especially during the circuit breaker months , such as by negotiating more flexible repayment terms .

And as any foodie worth their salt will know , reservations are now strongly recommended as walk-in tables are hard to come by . <p> Manchharam is not surprised by the restaurants ' popularity . " If you ca n't travel , then the next best thing is to go and have a meal in an Italian or a Mediterranean restaurant , and we have seen that demand is strong , " he says . " It is also a testament to how we have brought life to these older spaces and building a community around that . "

It 's glitchy playback and jump cuts makes the entire image all the more unnerving and gears us up for more horror to come ... and that 's where most of the creepy atmosphere built up ends . <p> We go on to see Yaeji , who is a severely overweight woman working as a makeup artist for the number one actress , Miri . Unfortunately , unlike her gorgeous appearance , Miri is predictably ugly on the inside and lords over her staff with a cruel hand . Her cruel words only serve to further stoke Yaeji 's insecurities about her self-image . And while the talent manager tries to smooth out the situation , a new handsome actor , Ji-hoon ( Jang Min-hyuk ) , enters the scene . He is the first and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yaeji , or more specifically her eyes and says the usual spew of kind words to her . He even finds her crying alone later on and gives her a cheer up and confidence boost by allowing specifically her to do his makeup , cliched but cute . <p> Yaeji woes do n't end there . On her way home , she meets a judgmental convenience store clerk and a sleazy , mean-spirited old security guard who tuts at her plight . These encounters only serve to further break Yaeji 's confidence and the final straw was a circulated footage of her eating being mocked as grotesque online . Despite her meek demeanour when faced with real cruelty , Yaeji , unleashes her pent up anger in the ugliest way possible , by trolling people online . She uses her anonymity as a shield to attack others and it gives us an insight to her propensity for cruelty too . She even ignores her parents and yells at her mother who is ever only concerned for her and will do anything , literally , even sacrificing their own flesh to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a text message from an unknown number and a box of Beauty Water right at her house . Frightened but desperate , she uses the water on herself in an attempt to peel away her fats along with her insecurities . We get a more graphic view of the process when Yaeji seeks the Beauty Water surgeon for help . It can also be seen as a ritual for Yaeji to release her baggage alongside her bodily imperfections . <p> Advertisement ? <p> And usually as a trope , all this peeling away at the layers of her imperfections will serve to reveal the person 's true beauty , aligning their inner beauty with that of the outside . Like a butterfly reborn , Yaeji sheds her old self to become the ultimate beauty . Yet , the film subverts our expectations of revealing a complete , confident and beautiful soul to instead making us scrutinise how at the core of it all , Yaeji 's downward spiral is only fueled by her ugly personality . With a scalpel in hands and lots of fletch-sculpting , the film attempts to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appearances . <p> Yaeji 's stint as the beauty queen of the film 's world allows us to see the flip side of all things glamorous in society . We see the other side of the media industry through how lecherous the same talent manager from the beginning actually is . We see how the security guard remains antagonistic towards Yaeji ironically via his extra kindness towards her . We see how she scores a date with her crush and now ex-celebrity Ji-hoon , which comes at a price . And ultimately we see how Yaeji continues to mistreat her parents and even commit murder out of rage , in which the death of that character felt unjust . <p> These are highly interesting plot points we are thrown with ; all pockets of commentary on our disturbing society , especially with Korea being known as the place which set a high-bar for beauty and sometimes unrealistic standards allowing for the festering of lookism . All these which could have been further explored . However , the film constantly misses out on the opportunity to delve deeper into them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the nature of the crude cut and lack of atmosphere led them to feel tacky . <p> We are given insight to her constantly deteriorating inner psyche , yet pulled out of it just as quickly . Dipped into tacked on snippets of her memories as a failed ballerina , we are careened off just as soon , leaving us reeling from the jump in events . <p> Yaeji 's actions are sometimes so unwarranted that it made it hard to root for her . We see her doing things such as repeatedly demanding things from her parents and spending money thoughtlessly . She judges her potential dates like how she was judged for being overweight in the past . Yaeji 's behaviour only serves to further alienate us from any empathy we have for the character and thus lose our sustained interest in the plot . The more the film tries to push for Yaeji 's psychological breakdown , the more its weakness of the story starts to show in its attempts to squeeze in jumpscares . <p> Most humorously is when she was led ( willingly ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something uncanny going on . Yet she breezes past all of them and only freaks out when she discovers hidden stores of Beauty Water in that house . Her unbelievable obliviousness , coupled with the choppy animation made the climatic horror scene seem slightly absurd . Which is interestingly and unintentionally cemented by the thick , almost clown-like makeup sported by her mother and her in the nightmare sequence . <p> Advertisement ? <p> Overall the animation felt like it would have worked better as a webtoon due to its pacing . The pace was so jerkily fast that we barely have the time to comprehend one event before it moves on to another . This also leads to the collapse of the horror scenes as there was no build up to the scare . There were no longer lingering shots but instead rough edits tha rendered jump scares ineffective . The accompanying music was also too hyper at points , killing the eeriness of the scenes . <p> Themes and scenes which could have been further explored felt glossed over . The film plays on many cliches too . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " girl being revealed as one bearing ulterior motives , we see the beautiful but cruel , the lecherous old man , and many other tropes . This is not necessarily a bad thing . <p> In fact , we have so much mediation and remediation ongoing today that it is inevitable that some tropes are recycled . Plus a plot that is criticising society can all the more leverage onto caricatures and well-worn tropes to further push the unravelling of the hypocrisy of society 's double standards . But this is only effective if they are recycled for good use . Like Yaeji 's body pieced together with the flesh of others , the plot is haphazardly meshed together forming more of a chimeric being which parts that work more out of than in tandem with one another . <p> It is commendable that the movie and director Cho Kyung-hun attempted to tackle this subgenre of body-horror in the face of a world obsessed over beauty standards . It is something that is not widely explored yet in mainstream media and more creators could take a leaf out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mediatised society . The film itself is an adventurous venture away from Korea 's usual style of animation . <p> Beauty Water reveals to us how laughable humans are with their centuries old obsession with the outward appearance . It also brings a mirror to society 's obsession with inner beauty , the pressure that people , even those who are beautiful have to undergo to behave a certain way , be nice ; in order to be moulded into society 's expectations . That being " good hearted " makes you a better person is also a failing of human nature . We should instead be good for goodness sake and not to parade yourself above others . <p> Humanness is the struggle and the strive . To be human is to be imperfect , maybe it 's time we embrace the fact that we do n't have to attain perfection in order to be happy lest we become the abject creature we try so hard to cast aside . <p> In a time whereby we can exist both virtually and physically , people more than ever strive to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into something perfect . That we are touched by a constant desire to adapt to neet society ' standards is suffocating . The film casts a mirror on society 's unrealistic beauty standards that unveils a deeper and more disturbing psychological condition . The human struggle for perfection . <p> We caught Beauty Water at The Projector , an indie film space in Singapore serving up a chic lineup of films from all over the world and of all genres ; and a scrumptiously curated blend of food and drinks at their Intermission Bar .

@@42382238 <p> As per the scientists , digging into the feces of animals can help to understand their diets and mostly to know more about nocturnal or rare species . When animals eat , prey DNA travels all the way through animal digestive tracts and comes out again . At the Panama-based Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute ( STRI ) , a team of scientists explored the eating habits of the fringe-lipped bat ( Trachops cirrhosus ) by examining its poop . <p> Bats hunt at night . This makes it challenging to observe their foraging behavior in nature . Analyzing DNA traces in bat guano offers a more specific way to explore how bats feed in the wild and to study how bat behavior changes depending on their eating habits . <p> " Because bats forage at night , and in the dense forest , you ca n't observe what they are eating the way you can with a diurnal bird or mammal , " said Patricia Jones , former STRI fellow , assistant professor of biology at Bowdoin College and main author of the study .

" <h> The Food Habit <p> The fringe-lipped bat , also known as the frog-eating bat , is well adjusted to hunting frogs . The bats ' hearing is adapted to their low-frequency mating calls , and their salivary glands may neutralize the toxins in the skin of poisonous prey . Fringed-lipped bats also feed on insects , small reptiles or birds and other bats . Researchers knew that these bats often find their prey by eavesdropping on mating calls , but it was unknown if they could find prey that was silent . <p> As expected , most of the DNA recovered from the poop samples in the study belonged to frog species and plenty of lizards , but researchers also found evidence that the bats were eating other bats and even a hummingbird .

" Detecting silent , still prey in the cluttered jungle is thought to be a really hard task for echolocation . This is because when the bats echolocate in the jungle , the echoes of all the leaves and branches bounce back along with the echoes of their prey , and they ' mask ' the prey . " <h> Nocturnal Predators of Tropics <p> These results may offer a new line of research on the sensory abilities and foraging ecology of T. cirrhosus .

Every fossilized remain is a time capsule waiting to be unlocked , and its ancient secret waiting to be learnt . Uncovering one such mystery , scientists have discovered the very first fossils of a duckbilled dinosaur in Africa , which suggests that the creature traversed across hundreds of kilometers of open ocean to arrive on the continent . <p> The fossil of the newly identified pony-sized dinosaur , Ajnabia odysseus , was found in modern-day Morocco , at a mine near the famed city of Casablanca . Ajnabia 's reliquiae unearthed amongst rocks dating back to the end of the Cretaceous period 66 million years ago . According to the international team of paleontologists , finding the remains of the duckbilled dinosaur in Africa was astonishing . <p> " It was completely out of place , like finding a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - so how did they get there ? " expressed Dr. Nicholas Longrich , lead author of the study , in a statement . <h> Making An Impossible Journey <p> Duckbill dinosaurs evolved in north America , spreading to South America , Asia , Europe , and finally AfricaRaul Martin <p> Duck-billed dinosaurs were a heterogeneous group of herbivores who reached lengths of up to 15 meters . However , in comparison to all the other larger members of the family , Ajnabia stands dwarfed at only 3 meters in length . Analysis of its jawbones and teeth revealed that the dinosaur belonged to a subfamily of duckbills known as Lambeosaurinae . These dinosaurs had intricate elaborate bony head crests . <p> Lambeosaurinae had the same evolutionary trajectory as all the other duckbills ( i.e ) they evolved in North America , and gradually spread to Asia , Europe , and to South America . Therefore , find the relatively puny dinosaur in Africa left the scientists amazed . Through the reconstruction of duckbill evolution , the authors concluded that after revolving in North America , they reached Asia through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they headed to Europe , and eventually Africa . Keeping in mind this exceptional journey that the duckbill undertook , the authors christened it Ajnabia odysseus . Ajnabi is Arabic for " foreigner " while Odysseus is a reference to the legendary Greek explorer . <h> Finding Their Way to An Isolated Land <p> Silhouette showing the size of Ajnabia compared with humans and the contemporary Maastrichtian dinosaur fauna of MoroccoDr . Nick Longrich <p> So the important question that baffled the researchers was , " How did the Ajnabia make its way to Africa ? " Africa was a geographical pariah at the time that was isolated from other continents by deep oceans . For the duckbills to reach such an inaccessible land , they would have had to cross several hundred kilometers of open water . The authors concluded that Ajnabia simply did . Probably swimming , or floating or rafting of debris ; they arrived and colonized Africa . <p> The case for them swimming their way to the continent may be a strong one as duckbills are said to possess the physical requisites of strong swimmers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , their remains have been found in marine rocks and river deposits , thereby , suggesting that they just swam to Africa . <p> " It was impossible to walk to Africa . These dinosaurs evolved long after continental drift split the continents , and we have no evidence of land bridges . The geology tells us Africa was isolated by oceans . If so , the only way to get there is by water , " emphasized Longrich . <h> Drawing A Logical Conclusion <p> While Ajnabia 's feat seems like an impossible one , it is not an undocumented one . Despite being rare , ocean crossings have been observed in the distant past . For example , green iguanas are known to have hopped from one island to another in the Caribbean through debris carried by a hurricane . <p> " Over millions of years . Once-in-a-century events are likely to happen many times . Ocean crossings are needed to explain how lemurs and hippos got to Madagascar , or how monkeys and rodents crossed from Africa to South America , " said Longrich . <p> Nevertheless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spite of extremely high sea levels , indicates that dinosaurs journeyed through oceans also . " As far as I know , we 're the first to suggest ocean crossings for dinosaurs , " noted Longrich . <p> Pointing to the rarity and the importance of the finding , Dr. Nour-Eddine Jalil , co-author of the study , said , " Ajnabia shows us that hadrosaurs have set foot on African land , telling us that ocean barriers are not always an insurmountable obstacle .

@@42467230 <h> Geek Review : Pixboy ( iOS ) <p> Classic 2D platformers may have first appeared in the early days of gaming but they seem to be making a comeback recently , alongside the blockish pixel look . Rather than a throwback to nostalgia , it 's likely that such games are relatively cheaper and easier to make . Still , we have yet to come across a game that fully dials back to the dual-tone minimalistic basics of the early Game Boys or Nokia phones , that is , until Pixboy came into the picture . <p> A mischievous pack of dogs may brighten up anyone 's day , but not when you 're a genius scientist who 's specially created formula was stolen from under your nose by said dogs . Like a dog with a bone , you are pushed to set off on a quest through four different terrains , evading enemies and scary bosses as you chase after the thieving hounds . <p> The plot of Pixboy is easy enough to follow and is shown through a simple yet delightful cutscene at the start of the game . Although , it quickly becomes evident @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the gameplay aside from explaining why your enemies are a bunch of doggos dressed in beanies and the like , and pooping all over the place . <p> Advertisement ? <p> Starting off your adventure in the Forest , Pixboy launches you right in there , with no tutorials aside from a few floating " ? " to deliver hints . Despite that , the game mechanics are easy enough to grasp by yourself as you progress through the levels . The controls are fairly simple , allowing you to move left and right and jump up , and shoot slingshots ( though this is only available from level three ) . You can even press on the jump button twice to pump out a cute parachute , enabling you to soar over short distances . <p> There 's also a good distinction between what can or can not be interacted with ; even with additional moving background elements such as drifting clouds and swaying flowers which may confuse players in any other format . And speaking of the background , the two colour blocky graphics may seem simplistic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by it . <p> It soon becomes apparent how much love went into Pixboy 's creation with the addition of details such as penguins , trees , cacti , pyramids which all correspond to the four worlds in the game , Forest , Desert , Snowland and Cyberspace . Even the mini enemies aside from the dogs will change depending on the environment , allowing you to meet spiders , snails , birds and other unidentified creatures . And of course , the territories are dotted with " dogified " versions of iconic monuments such as a dog-headed sphinx . <p> You can even use the coins collected during the game to purchase 24 different two-colour graphics such as black-yellow , pink-turquoise or green-black , allowing you to somewhat customise the background . The many icons representing each colour choice are a small nod to early consoles and gaming systems like the Game Boy and floppy discs . To top off the retro experience , the graphics are accompanied by peppy chiptune music , transforming the game into something that feels like a trip back into the time of vintage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ runs on a categorical scoring system , similar to that of Mario . You can achieve between one and three stars ; which are summed up by the number of coins collected , the number of hidden items obtained and the time spent completing a level . <p> During the game , you will be spending most of your time jumping on mini enemies such as the dogs , avoiding mini but deadly arrow-shaped spikes , cannonballs , swinging spiders and collecting coins and ice lollies . The ice lollies can only be found when you stumble across a secret room , however , beyond tripping a cute thrilling tune when these rooms are discovered , there is n't much incentive to find these lollies . <p> As for the mini enemies , they take on various forms and hence provide a good variety of challenges as they dog your steps throughout the levels . The most basic one are the dogs who roam around a fixed area between the platforms . A little opening is provided for you to jump onto them whenever they stop moving to poop . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard to aim at ; spiders which when triggered will jump off their original platform to chase you , and even arrow-shooting creatures which you have to dodge and kill . <p> However , despite their different movements , the main trick to defeat them is by jumping atop of them . This also allows you to accumulate shots for your slingshot , which you may also use to shoot down the creatures which are harder for you to get atop of . However , be careful not to get too greedy when collecting coins or shots as you may end up losing more precious lives by bumping into the enemies in the midst of attempting to kill them . <p> Pixboy gets progressively harder as you move up levels . You will meet new obstacles such as doors that can only be unlocked after you have recovered all the keys from the areas . The spikes also start appearing on the ceilings and sides of the platforms instead of simply protruding from the ground , hence challenging you to device different movement routes in order to navigate past them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is further complicated by the fact that you do n't have much manual control over the height of your jumps , hence for ceiling spikes and swinging spiders , you may have to crack your brains over finding alternatives , such as , taking a detour to a lower platform to launch up from . <p> Advertisement ? <p> To leap onto higher ground at certain points , you will also have to hop onto moving platforms . And even after lots of sighing and teeth gritting from badly timed jumps in attempt to get on , you have to be careful not to be pushed off when the platforms slide under blocks . On a friendlier note , there are easier footholds to leap onto like the friendly snails lined along some walls . <p> With all these challenges lined up , there are no saving points within each section so once you lose all your hearts , you have to restart the entire level . Collecting hearts along the way may help spare you from swift death , but even those may not be sufficient to save your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be the touch screen controls of Pixboy specifically for iOS and Android . Though it does n't greatly affect the overall gameplay , the lack of solid buttons under your fingers may make it a little disorienting and thus harder to navigate and estimate the timing needed to push the buttons for jumps over enemies and through narrow gaps . <p> While you may be uncaring about setting a good speedrunner of each level , being hounded by the final bosses of each terrain will really set a pace that 's enough to get your hackles up . The bosses only come in at every tenth level of the 40 levels of the game and as soon as the giant dog head appears , you are forced into a hair-raising chase . You are made to utilise all the skills you 've practiced for the past ten levels to evade obstacles as well as zoom to the finishing line as fast as possible without dying . <p> Coupled with the fact that the challenges stack up and that you 're forced to restart the entire level instead of from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may find it frustrating to be continuously thrown back to the Game Over screen and rage quit after a while . <p> On the bright side , you can go back to replay levels to get a better rating for it , challenge yourself to get a better speedrun time or collect more coins if you feel like you 've underperformed a particular section . You can even choose to avoid all the annoying mini enemies and earn a Pacifist badge at the end of your run . <p> Platformers making a comeback with new games like Celeste , Gris , along with pixel-style games like SuperEpic : The Entertainment Wars . Pixboy is truly a blast from the past jazzed up with many intricate details and exciting though sometimes frustrating challenges . The cute overarching plot involving doggos is also an attractive point . <p> The retro-styled game is also made more appealing as developers from Oaky Games chose the 2D platformer style not out of necessity but out of their love for it , thus enabling them to push the envelope of possibilities for the game to greater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for iOS and S$5.49 on the Google Play Store for Android . The price is worth it considering the number of challenges and levels available for you to while away at whenever you need a brain break from work . <h> GEEK REVIEW SCORE <p> Summary <p> By cleverly working around the limitations of 2D platforming , Pixboy is an adorable 1-bit game with a simple yet addictive gameplay style , filled with cute enemies that will dog your steps . It is perfect for those who have some spare time to while away , though it will require more than one sitting and some patience to complete various exciting challenges . <h> We 're geeks , &amp; proud of it ! <p> We are a collective bunch of geeks who love to share our passion with the rest of the world .

@@42517237 <p> The lead up to the holiday season is a good time to consider how merchants can capture cross-border opportunities and how they can capitalise on the boost to online shopping in different markets . <p> Even before the pandemic , global e-commerce had been steadily increasing , according to a report from Forrester Analytics . Cross-border sales represented 12% of all e-commerce in 2015 and were expected to reach 17% by 2023 , worth an estimated US$736 billion . <p> Recent PayPal research reveals that 45% of surveyed e-commerce merchants in Hong Kong are actively looking to reach customers in new markets as part of their efforts to recapture lost business . No matter which season we are approaching , a good cross-border strategy can diversify risk , create a larger addressable customer base , and balance slow domestic sales periods . <p> Understand how consumers in different markets shopConsumer insights compiled by PayPal during COVID-19 have found there were several markets around the world , such as India , the UAE , South Africa , Israel and Colombia , where consumers are more receptive to making cross-border purchases than local ones . <p> The reasons behind this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consumer trust in foreign merchants than local ones , or simply having limited local shopping options . Although this makes these markets highly attractive for cross-border merchants , it is important to also understand common pitfalls and how to address them.For example , 73% of Indian consumers shopped cross-border for lower priced goods , particularly for beauty , lifestyle , and fashion items , yet shopping basket abandonment is high due to shipping prices . Therefore the key focus for merchants looking to crack India 's online market is to be able to offer low-priced goods , with budget delivery options . <p> There is also a second group of large consumer markets that can also offer sizable opportunities for cross-border merchants . The UK and Germany , for example , are among some of the largest consumer markets in Europe that have experienced a boost in online shopping during the pandemic . Yet in a PayPal commissioned study , it was found that unlike India or Israel , consumers in these markets prefer to shop from local merchants over cross-border ones . <p> To crack these markets and achieve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the skin of how consumers in these markets shop online . <p> For merchants looking to crack the UK market , the main motivation for people to shop online , beyond convenience , is the ability to obtain unique products ( 41% ) ; consumers were also generally less price sensitive . This may be a lifeline for merchants who have unique products or collectibles to promote as gift items during the festive season . In Germany , on the other hand , purchasing decisions are largely based on the ability to obtain fast , free shipping and returns , as well as post-purchase payments . Like in India , offering an international courier versus a national postal service could boost appeal . <p> Know your consumers ' payment preferencesIn addition to understanding local shopping habits , it is vital to know each market 's payment preferences . The UK has a diverse payment landscape , with credit cards , debit cards , pre-paid cards , and buy-now-pay-later products popular among consumers . Yet in Mexico and Japan , consumers prefer payment upon pickup at convenience stores . Therefore , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before an e-commerce business ventures into a new market.Here in Asia , it will be of no surprise that consumers in Japan and South Korea tend to shop from local merchants as language is the biggest barrier for consumers . This is usually a big oversight for e-commerce merchants when it is so easy to function in language and currency translation to an online commerce site . <p> Ensuring you are m-commerce readyThe same rule applies to mobile-friendly sites . Having a good mobile commerce ( m-commerce ) strategy is critical for any cross-border merchant , especially those targeting Asia . These markets often have an overall younger demographic , and they tend to be ' mobile first ' . Today 's on-the-go Chinese people live on their mobile devices . Almost 75% of all eCommerce sales happen on a mobile device , making China the world leader in m-commerce , with US$873 billion in annual sales and 36% predicted annual growth .

The trend is creating unprecedented opportunities for businesses looking to expand beyond their local market and it is encouraging to see merchants beginning to reshape their strategy to capitalise on peak trading cycles and grow cross-border business . <h> Masterclass Series <h> Social <h> Other Links <p> We use cookies and other tracking technologies to improve your browsing experiences on our website , to show you personalised content and targeted ads , to analyze our website traffic and to understand where our visitors are coming from .

She tells us how she , along with NVPC , is championing a better world in Singapore . <p> ' ' I never considered myself a philanthropist until someone educated me on the definition , " confesses Mildred Tan . For her , its meaning was once synonymous with monetary donations . Years ago , she was asked to give a talk in which she was described as one . When she refuted the title , the organisers explained that being a philanthropist is not about money . " They said , ' You are a philanthropist because you give your time , skills and knowledge to promote philanthropy for the betterment of others .

" <p> Outside of school , her family paved the way for a lifetime of charitable giving . Her mother was actively involved in the Singapore Children 's Society and often fundraised through setting up stalls at the charity 's funfairs where Mildred and her siblings would help out . " It became a way of life for me , " she adds . <p> Today , she is the Chairman of the National Volunteer and Philanthropy Centre ( NVPC ) , an independent not-for-profit organisation that advocates giving . While she has spent decades in business management , organisational development and restructuring work , her devotion to community work has never faltered .

For her contributions towards the nation , she was also conferred the Public Service Medal in 2007 and the Public Service Star award in 2014 . <p> The word multi-hyphenate is frequently thrown about , but it encapsulates Mildred in a nutshell -- aside from being a former Nominated Member of Parliament from 2009 to 2011 , she also serves on numerous councils , boards and committees . <p> Despite the diversity of her roles , it all culminates in a single end goal for Mildred . In any role she takes on , her mindset is to " build a better world for Singapore " . <p> Tan with Steve Loh , CEO of YMCA Singapore <p> The Greater Good <p> Mildred declares that Singaporeans have big hearts , and this was proven during the pandemic . She cites the viral #GiveYour600 Giving.sg campaign , where Singaporeans could donate their Solidarity Payments of $600 to charities that were raising funds for Covid-19 causes .

If I see my friend doing it , I , too , will be inspired to move in that direction . We 've seen it time and time again . " <p> This is where NVPC 's City of Good vision comes into play . It hinges on three pillars where people , organisations and leaders come together to give their best for others . <p> Under this vision is its programme that connects organisations to collaborate on giving efforts called Company of Good , formed in 2016 .

" People think it 's mainly the big companies who do good but our SMEs are doing a fantastic job .

Mildred highlights Tan Chuan-Jin , the current Speaker of Singapore 's Parliament , as an unsung hero . " Unknown to many , he volunteers during one of the morning shifts at Assisi Hospice when the nurses have a heavy workload . He helps out with the vigils as part of the ' No One Dies Alone ' team , " she shares . <p> " His responsibilities range from preparing and serving breakfast , changing diapers and cleaning patients when they soil themselves , bringing them around the grounds in their wheelchairs , to quiet moments where he would just sit with the patient and hold their hands during their last moments .

@@42553233 <h> Exploring The Demon Avenger Class In MapleStoryM As A Returning Player <p> Since its worldwide release in 2018 , MapleStoryM has seen the introduction of a number of jobs , including the Demon Slayer , Mechanic , and Wild Hunter in order to keep the game fresh . <p> In true , tried and tested , RPG fashion , the advent of an anti-hero in the form of a demon joins the world of MapleStoryM . <p> He is none other than the Demon Avenger . <p> Advertisement ? <p> Based on his lore , our protagonist , Demon , was born to a devil father and human mother . We begin their story in the Temple of Time , with Demon going head to head with the Black Mage , who they have served for many years . It is through a flashback that we learn that the Black Mage 's order had resulted in the death of Demon 's mother and brother . From there , Demon embarks on a path of revenge with his loyal sidekick Mastema as a Demon Avenger , to track down the Black Mage and avenge his family . <p> Unlike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no need for other stats like Strength and Dexterity , Instead , they rely solely on their HP for their skills and overall damage dealt to enemies and monsters . Avengers also come with no MP , meaning players that choose the class on MapleStoryM get to save on the in-game currency mesos , since only health potions will need to be bought and the game gives them out rather generously whenever a mission is complete . <p> The Demon Avenger comes with a new Exceed ability which includes four different Exceed skills such as the Exceed : Double Slash and Exceed : Demon Strike . The use of each Exceed skill will add a stack of buff to your Infernal Exceed passive . <p> The Infernal Exceed buff , which will be available to players from the start , greatly enhances the Demon Avenger 's attack and attack speed , turning your attacks from blue to purple . However , the job also comes with an Exceed Overload passive which decreases the ability for your Demon Avenger to sap the life out of someone to increase your own health @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passive . Fortunately , once the Exceed Overload reaches a significant amount , players will be able to apply the Overload Release skill to undo this effect . <p> For anyone looking to try out MapleStoryM , the new Demon Avenger is the type of class where players are bound to have plenty of fun with . <p> Once you 've overcome the heavy sense of nostalgia that washes over you on the character creation screen , it takes less than a minute to have a Demon Avenger created and ready to go . <p> No matter how long a hiatus one might have had with MapleStoryM . It 's a fun experience to delve back into the game . Much would have changed since playing it back in the day . For one , levelling up is now much faster . <p> With the Demon Avenger , we only needed to worry about our health , with the mana bar completely void . This way in battles , which are often fully automated , players only need to occasionally pay attention to our health bar and keep our health @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ potions , Demon Avengers also come with the Life Sap skill which can be used to help counter the massive consumption of the character 's HP . As such , Demon Avenger just might be the easiest class for new MapleStoryM gamers to play . <p> Aesthetically , the Demon Avenger also comes with very flashy and visually appealing skills , with skills like Exceed : Double Slash and Shield Charge having cool purple coloured animations followed by the very satisfying row of numbers signifying the damage we 've dealt . The Demon Avenger also uses Desperado as their main , and only , weapon . <p> MapleStoryM also makes it incredibly easy to build your Demon Avenger , with the ability to auto-assign skill points every time after levelling up . This way , you wo n't need to spend too much time worrying about which skill to increase as the game simply does it for you . <p> Quests are also easy to complete , with MapleStoryM giving players the ability to put battles and travelling on ' auto ' . With this feature , we easily traversed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> What 's more , to help celebrate the launch of the Demon Avenger on MapleStoryM , the game is holding a number of limited-time events , such as the Demon Avenger Growth Support Event where players who reach certain level milestones from now till 12 January 2021 will receive additional in-game items , and the Demon Avenger Burning Event where any new Demon Avenger character can be levelled up by three times for every level increase , between level 3 to 100 from now till 12 January 2021 . This way , you can easily and more quickly have every Demon Avenger skill at your disposal . <p> All in all , Demon Avenger is an extremely forgiving and easy-to-play job for someone returning to MapleStoryM after not playing the game for a while . Though that is not to say that it is boring or not fun to play , there is still an interesting storyline concerning the Black Mage and the Demon Avenger 's path to revenge for players to follow , and if they so choose , players can also opt to not have their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ winning their battles and clearing their quests instead . <p> Germaine is a fun-sized introvert who loves nothing better than sleeping in on rainy days .

@@42555236 <p> AXA Insurance wanted to educate and drive conversations about the importance of planning early and being financially prepared for critical illness . At the same time , it also wanted to build top of mind recall when consumers think of insurance plans for cancer and critical illness protection . Hence , it worked with Viddsee on a campaign that showcased a multi-generational Singaporean family . This led the team to clinch bronze for Excellence in TV / Video Advertising at MARKETING-INTERACTIVE 's recent Marketing Excellence Awards 2020 . <p> Challenge <p> According to AXA 's Better Beyond Survey 2018 , 55% of the public are aware of major health conditions , but are unaware of the financial cost . Meanwhile , 84% of the public are aware of the importance of critical illness plans . However , AXA found that majority are not prepared for the worst . In fact , only 20% of working adults in Singapore have insurance coverage that would on average meet financial needs if critical illness occurs , according to the Life Insurance Association Singapore . <p> Meanwhile , 42% of young adults surveyed have critical illness insurance , a lower proportion than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , 44% of those aged 20 to 34 years old have the intent to buy critical illness plans but at a later stage , and 28% of individuals from the same age group would rather spend their money on other commitments . Hence , AXA realised that its campaign messaging had to connect to a range of working adults , from young adults starting out in their first jobs to those entering the sandwich generation who are likely to be financially stressed with supporting their children , aging parents and grandparents in the longer term . <p> Another challenge AXA faced was the sensitivity of the topic of death and illness and how it would upset some consumers , given that they are not favourably discussed among family members . Hence , AXA had to engage with the audience persistently through multiple layers of messaging across different market segments through several channels . <p> Strategy <p> AXA decided to focus its message on decision making , anchoring its campaign to a central message of " Today , I Decide " . The psychology behind this focuses on the now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( I decide ) . The big idea aims to empower the viewer to take responsibility and turn intent into action . <p> With the aid of Viddsee 's Audience Insights , which draws from viewing habits of millions across 4,500 short films on Viddsee.com , AXA found that Singaporean audiences reacted well to films that carry themes of sacrifice and gratitude , especially when it comes to family . These universal values and themes will also appeal to a wide age group . <p> To emotionally target consumers , AXA and Viddsee decided to use a storytelling approach to showcase a multi generational Singaporean family having difficult conversations and struggling to make important decisions for their future when an elderly member of the family is suspected to have another critical illness or a cancer relapse .

Digital OTT channels including Viddsee , Viu and Toggle were used to disseminate the film , as well as 30-second and 60-second cutdowns . OTT channels formed a main component of its strategy as the narrative-driven short film matched well with Singaporean audiences ' consumption trends on these platforms , which have shown a tendency towards family dramas . Meanwhile , Viu and Toggle were chosen for their well-established reputation in showcasing local Asian films . <p> The full film was available on AXA 's YouTube channel and promoted through TrueView via the film cutdowns .

@@42575232 <h> As cryptocurrencies are difficult to track and prices are surging , criminals have shifted to demand ransoms in Bitcoins of late . <p> Not so long ago , kidnappers demanded hard cash as ransom . Since other forms of payment were traceable , criminals preferred liquid cash due to its difficulty in tracing . However , with the introduction of cryptocurrency , their problem seemed to have been solved . Now , in many countries , there is a so-called rise in crypto kidnappers , who demand ransom in Bitcoins instead of cash . <p> Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin have gained popularity amongst criminals as they are portrayed as an untraceable currency that can be converted into cash from anywhere in the world . While cryptos are not completely untraceable , it is definitely difficult to track . The other potential advantage is unlike conventional currencies , authorities find it difficult to seize cryptocurrencies . Hence , even if a criminal is caught in the act , if their Bitcoin wallet and hard drives were not seized , they could still access the amount later . <p> " Bitcoin is money that can not be seized , unlike cash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bank account , it could be frozen , but you can only access the Bitcoin once the owner gives you a password , " Sidharth Sogani , a blockchain researcher told VICE World News . <h> Rise of Illicit Dealings in Crypto <p> Considering the advantages , in many countries , criminals have resorted to Bitcoins or other cryptocurrencies , especially after its first boom in 2017 . In the U.S. , a huge amount of transactions related to drug trafficking has shifted to virtual currencies as authorities continue to seize millions of dollars in cash . While such large drug operations can still overcome those , it is difficult for small-time kidnappers . Hence , there is an upward trend in moving to cryptocurrency . <p> In the U.K. , last year , the Scotland Yard faced difficulties in nabbing kidnappers who demanded Bitcoins . In September 2018 , an American businessman William Sean Creighton was kidnapped in Costa Rica . The kidnappers demanded $5 million in Bitcoins but the family was only able to pay $1 million and his body was later found in an unmarked grave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rica . Kidnappers demanded $500,000 ransom in Bitcoins for a Canadian businessman in 2015 . <p> While crypto-kidnapping was mainly becoming a widespread problem in the west , soon countries like South Africa and India began reporting such cases . Since 2018 , dozens of countries have reported cases of crypto-kidnapping . For a country like India where cryptocurrency enthusiasm is a niche and growing at a slow pace , there has been an upward trend in crypto-kidnapping . <p> Recently , in the Indian state of Karnataka , an eight-year-old boy of a renowned businessman was abducted and the kidnappers demanded $2.3 million in Bitcoins ( 100 BTC ) . However , the police nabbed the criminals without needing to pay the amount . <p> " The fact that cryptocurrencies are unregulated and that law-enforcement agencies can not easily monitor transactions , identify wallet holders or freeze crypto-wallets in the way they can freeze other assets is very attractive to kidnappers , " Control Risks , a global consulting firm said in a report . <p> Demanding cryptocurrency as ransom has mainly been associated with hacking ( representational image @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Demanding cryptocurrencies as ransom has mainly been associated with hacking .

@@42575237 <h> Share <p> In May the Asian Development Bank started a major drive to promote solar power across the region . Last year , the Indian government approved an ambitious National Solar Mission , which seeks a huge increase in the country 's solar-energy capabilities . Bangladesh , with the support of the World Bank , is aiming to have one million remote rural homes supplied with solar panels by the end of 2012 . <p> And in India , where nearly 40 percent of households have no access to electricity , companies like Selco Solar and Orb Energy have helped tens of thousands of families and small entrepreneurs purchase solar panels . <p> All worthy causes . So worthy and sensible , in fact , that you may well ask why on earth they did not take off much earlier . <p> The answer , as is so often the case , is political support -- or , until relatively recently , the lack of it -- and , inevitably , cost . <p> " The upfront costs of installing **28;850;TOOLONG farms , plus high borrowing costs and the fact that developing nations struggle to access long-term capital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Seethapathy Chander , chairman of the committee on energy issues at the Asian Development Bank in Manila . <p> " It takes a long time before investment costs are recouped , and you need long-term financing until that stage is reached . " <p> That also applies to small , single-household roof panels that provide enough electricity for a few extra hours of lighting , which can make a huge difference -- adding study time for children and extra hours for making and selling goods . <p> Rooftop solar energy can replace kerosene , which generates smoke and poor-quality light and eats heavily into the scarce resources of the poor . <p> " A street vendor in India might make 800 rupees a month -- that 's about $16 , " said Harish Hande , founder of Selco Solar in Bangalore . " But he might have to spend as much as 210 rupees of that on kerosene or candles .

But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a small solar home lighting system -- which typically costs 8,500 to 11,000 rupees -- is beyond the reach of many families , Mr. Hande said . <p> In developing nations like Sri Lanka or India , said Damian Miller , an American-British citizen who set up Orb Energy in 2006 , the cost of a panel can be 20 percent of the annual income of a poor off-grid household . <p> In terms of the scale of the investment , he said , " it 's similar to a Western household buying a car . " <p> Banks were long reluctant to lend to the poor . Increasingly , however , companies like Selco and Orb Energy have been able to convince some local banks that low-income earners are creditworthy and that solar-related credits bring in solid business in much the same way that car financing does . <p> " The trick to making it work commercially is to make it affordable : To allow for bite-size financing that the poor can pay for , on a monthly basis , rather than in large chunks , " said Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ farms that feed the overall electricity grid -- activity also is picking up . <p> " Many parts of Asia have three or four times the amount of sun that Germany gets , " said Mr. Chander of the Asian Development Bank .

" <p> At the same time , governments have become more willing to promote alternative energies and , because of falling costs , more able to do so . <p> Over the years , technological advances have made panels cheaper and more efficient , while the global financial crisis created a glut of panels as many projects in Western countries stalled . China has become a major manufacturer and exporter of solar energy equipment , though it has yet to generate solar power on a large scale . <p> Cheaper panels , combined with lower interest rates since the financial crisis , have helped put solar energy systems within the financial reach of poorer nations , said Anil Cabraal , an alternative energy expert who , until his retirement from the World @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solar projects in Asia and Africa under way over the past decade . <p> Under the solar initiative it announced this year , the Asian Development Bank hopes to help put in place solar power projects with a total capacity of 3,000 megawatts by 2013 . <p> The total operating capacity now is less than 500 megawatts .

While it was clear that large periods of uncertainty lay ahead in the months that followed , we also had to prepare our employees for the long-term fundamental impacts that Covid-19 would have on the workplace . <p> First and foremost , it required us to be upfront with our employees about the challenges we were facing . Then working with our teams to rethink and re-engineer how we were going to work towards our objectives , and this really played to our strengths of being an agile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ digital agenda was accelerated in response to the pandemic , transforming the way employees and agents work and enhancing the experience for our customers . So being agile and flexible enabled us to quickly adopt new working practices that would support the digital transformation strategy . <p> Ensuring our employees understood how this would enable us to operate through the pandemic but also build resilience in the years ahead , was vital . <p> Moving towards a virtual way of working necessitated an approach that was supportive and understanding of each employee . Central to this was providing employees with appropriate control and flexibility over how they do their work , regular communication , offering information and practical tools to support positive mental health , regular check-ins and ensuring the lines of communication were accessible and always open . <p> Interestingly , in the virtual workplace we have discovered that our more introverted employees have thrived . They said they feel more comfortable speaking up and expressing their ideas on a conference or video call than if they were in a physical meeting . <p> At the regional level this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business units to ensure they were well equipped and supported to work with a changing environment and ensuring they remained engaged . <p> How is the leadership team at Generali steering a course through the pandemic ? <p> The pandemic has forced us to reimagine the way we work and do business . For our leaders it has made us recognise the importance of leading from the front , to create the right environment for transformation to take place , and to ensure we exhibit the values and behaviours that we expect from our teams . <p> Everyone has been impacted by the pandemic and I feel in many ways it has made us more human . For example , seeing your colleague 's children in the background when you 're on a video call and regularly touching base with your team members to understand how they are feeling . <p> It has really forced leaders across the board to adapt their style because being an effective leader under the current circumstances requires greater empathy , humility , and transparency . <p> Interestingly , in the virtual workplace we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have said that they feel more comfortable speaking up and expressing their ideas on a conference or video call than if they were in a physical meeting . <p> We are looking at how to leverage this understanding back to the office environment and exploring ideas to help introverts feel more comfortable in the physical workplace . <p> What is the biggest lesson you have learned about employee management during the pandemic ? <p> The pandemic has been a stressful time for everyone . In the context of the workplace this has created a heightened reliance on managers to maintain the wellbeing , health and safety of their teams and at the same time , ensure they remain engaged and productive . This sounds like a lot and that 's because it is . <p> The lesson here is to take care of your own needs as a leader because it is difficult to lead effectively if you 're also struggling . <p> I do n't believe in hierarchy . For me it is all about collaboration and working together as a team , and this is why I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ level . <p> There is also the importance of leading with empathy , transparency , and humility , which I mentioned earlier . Difficult times reveal why these attributes are important in leadership as teams led by people who possess high emotional intelligence tend to work hard and persevere . <p> Describe your leadership style ? <p> I am very hands on and consider myself to be an authentic and honest leader . I can also be very direct . <p> I do n't believe in hierarchy . For me it is all about collaboration and working together as a team , and this is why I am so respectful of people 's time , irrespective of their level . <p> Best advice on how HR can ascend to the C-suite level . <p> In many organisations , such as Generali , HR has already ascended to the C-suite .

I need to stay motivated to keep morale and motivation high for our employees . But , at the end of the day , I am only human . <p> There have been times this year when everything has just felt overwhelming and this goes back to what I mentioned earlier .

@@42579240 <p> When it comes to powerful hardware , bigger does n't always mean better . It is still a common dilemma between picking the versatility of a laptop , or having the most powerful rig to meet any hardcore gamers needs . <p> High-end gaming computers tend to be huge and can take up an enormous portion of desk space , and the explosive cost of owning a high-end branded PC deters those who have a smaller budget . <p> Conversely , gaming laptops , while having the added benefit of being portable , lack the flexibility of customisation that PCs have , which limits their longevity as compared to the desktop . While one can definitely snag a lower-end gaming laptop for a little under S$1,500 , it will ultimately buckle under the weight of the increasingly high RAM , CPU and GPU demands of AAA games , as well as content creation software . <p> Advertisement ? <p> With a combination of convenience , preference , and style , the Aftershock Vault Mini-ITX PC is all prepped to bring the best of both worlds . The Singapore start-up , which has made its name and machines , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in-between rather well . For all you folks doing content creation at home or on the side , or are perhaps simply in need of an upgrade from your 5-year-old PC , there 's no real need to spend an exorbitant amount of money on machines supposedly catered " for content creators " , as here 's a great , more affordable alternative . <p> As Geek Culture 's video producer , it 's often hard juggling multiple projects , with numerous deadlines to meet in a week and tough to hit deadlines . With so many projects to work on , it is important for the programmes I work on to be able to keep up with my intense workload , be it for video editing or visual effects . <p> Measuring just 187mm x 387.7mm x 187.6mm , the Vault uses a beautifully petite NZXT H1 Mini-ITX case that houses everything a PC needs , while maintaining a full-sized GPU . It saves a lot of space and is a dramatic difference from our old PC that had to be put under the desk . Another wonderful feature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three panels at the front , back and sides are a simple snap-on-and-off or slide-on-and-off . SSD trays and riser cards are incredibly simple to install and despite the desktop 's compact build , everything seems to fit just nice and snug .

Rather , it 's a compact small form factor PC that puts larger machines to shame . That said , this powerful rig also looks good , with just a tinge of lighting coming from the RAM and GPU , and the rest being stealth . It runs very quiet with only the fan going into its initial turbo upon booting . <p> While the Vault is n't the most powerful rig out there , it stores more than enough horsepower in its compact body to beat out the performance of our old rig . From boot times and preview rendering in the background , to multitasking between photo editing and running multiple tabs on Google Chrome , this competent desktop is able handle demanding tasks without so much as breaking a sweat . <p> All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy , however , so some gaming is certainly in order .

The Vault comes in 2 variants , the base spec and the recommended spec , with customers having the ability to customise their very own Vault with the slew of hardware options available , including the motherboard , CPU , RAM , and storage .

@@62403234 <p> Most parents will gift their children the latest toys or clothes that they want . <p> But for 10-year-old Calvin Chu , his mother surprised him with a gift of a fossilised trilobite , an ancient extinct arthropod which roamed the seabeds of eons past . <p> Looking at the small rock which nestles perfectly in one 's palm , the rough-hewn edges perhaps smoothened by Chu 's hands over the decades , it 's hard to imagine it alive and scuttling about on an Earth that scientists can only attempt at envisioning . <p> The trilobite fossil Chu 's mother gave him . Photo by Ashley Tan <p> Like many kids ( me included ) , Chu already had a healthy curiosity for ancient beings like dinosaurs . <p> Little did he know though , that the small gift would spark a lifelong love for fossils -- now 43 years old , Chu has a jaw-dropping array of over 1,000 fossils stored in his two-storey terrace house at Upper Thomson . <p> " It just opened up a world of fascination for me , you 'll never ever see this kind of creature today , " Chu @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one batch of fossils he bought consisted of around 800 pieces , mostly comprising teeth from prehistoric creatures like ancient crocodiles , Spinosauri and Mosasaurs . <h> Living in a natural history museum <p> And of course , the home of a fossil collector like Chu is n't like any other . <p> One wall of his light and airy living area is lined with white floor-to-ceiling cabinets .

The largest species in the group , the Mosasaurus , can grow up to 17m in length . <p> Photo by Ashley Tan <p> That 's not it though -- opening the doors of the cabinets reveals a hidden treasure trove of prehistoric remnants . From the the skull of an Ankylosaurus , coprolites ( fossilised poop ha ha ) , the tooth of a Tyrannosaurus Rex , the fossil of a gigantic extinct dragonfly-like insect called Meganeura ; you name it , Chu ( probably ) has it . <p> Photo by Zheng Zhangxin <p> Photo by Zheng Zhangxin <p> I 'm even more amazed when Chu brings us up to his study to reveal a stash of even more fossils , including the huge leg bone of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ashley Tan <p> It 's almost akin to living in a mini natural history museum . <p> Photo by Zheng Zhangxin <p> When asked what his family thinks about the fossil displays , Chu says he tries his best to be considerate to his wife and two young children . <p> " I ca n't force my wife to like something she may not be very fond of . She 's told me before like ' You know I do n't like to have all these skulls all over my house ' , " he chuckles . <p> Keeping some of the fossils out of sight is thus something he kept in mind during the design of the living area . <h> Fossils on eBay ? <p> Amassing such an extensive fossil collection does require some expertise and intuition . <p> And contrary to what some might think , not all fossils are rare and some can actually be easily found online . <p> Fossils are sold on auction sites like eBay and Catawiki ( a cursory search for a trilobite on the former yields hundreds of results with prices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Screenshot from eBay <p> More experienced fossil collectors like Chu leverage on a network of contacts , including fossil prospectors ( those who actually dig up the fossils ) in the U.S. and Morocco , and liaise with them directly for interesting finds . <p> Chu 's work occasionally brings him overseas , during which he tries his best to pack time in to scour museums and its shops for fossils despite his hectic schedule . <p> " All my trips are packed back to back with meetings , so I 'll visit five states in five days . I will fly in the night before , then I wake up the next morning , cover all my meetings , and I will finish around four to five o'clock , then I 'll rush on to the museum , check out the museum and museum shop , then rush to the airport , hop on the plane to the next state . Then repeat this five times . " <p> However , Chu warns of the risk of purchasing fake fossils , especially when buying them from online marketplaces . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reputable . <p> Bringing out a clutch of fossilised oviraptor eggs , he explains that listening to the sound a fossil makes is one of the ways to check if fossils are real . <p> Cocking his head as he taps on it with his fingers , Chu elaborates on the intricacies of the different sounds as I simply nod my head in agreement , unable to tell the difference . <p> Photo by Ashley Tan <p> He goes on to mention how to check if fossilised amber is real -- stick a heated needle into the amber and check if the smell is that of a sweet fragrance or burning plastic . <p> " There are also a lot of people who do n't know what they 're selling even , and sell like dragon bones , " he said . <h> Every fossil is more than just a monetary value <p> Considering the number of fossils in his possession , acquiring them must not have been cheap . Dinosaur fossils in particular , cost quite a pretty penny , Chu said . <p> However , he did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his collection . He says though , that the Mosasaur skull alone costs somewhere in the five digits . <p> Chu is quick to note that to him , each fossil is priceless -- " Every one of them is one of a kind in the world , every one of them is unique " . <p> These pieces are also more than just a financial investment for him -- they 're precious because of the intangible values they bring . <p> " When you are beholding a fossil , you might be the first person in perhaps 60 million years to lay your eyes on this strange creature . There 's nothing quite like it that humbles you and gives you a sense of wonder about the world , that sense of excitement , a sense of where we are in the universe , in the big scheme of things . " <p> As do all communities , the Singapore Fossil Collectors started with a realisation 10 years ago . <p> " At some point in time , I felt it would be nice to not just collect fossils @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collecting can be quite a solitary hobby you know . " <p> He then decided to reach out to The Straits Times , and the resulting feature was seen by fellow fossil collectors in Singapore , who then reached out to Chu . <p> Now , the Singapore Fossil Collectors group is 1,000-strong , and prior to Covid-19 , regularly held large gatherings to swap knowledge , trade fossils , or simply catch up with each other . <p> A gathering at a member 's house in 2019 to trade fossils . Photo from Singapore Fossil Collector 's / FB <p> Chu , however , does not see himself as a leader of any sort . Instead , he merely sees himself as the vehicle to bring together this group of like-minded hobbyists . He quips : <p> " You 're really a crazy guy , until you have your first follower right ? " <p> When asked if he does consider himself a " crazy guy " , Chu heartily agrees : " Yeah yeah I think so ! " <h> ' Am I the only crazy guy ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ encyclopaedia of dinosaurs I had and loved when I was young . I still have it but it is now collecting dust on my bookshelf , and it 's safe to say I have n't opened it in more than a decade . <p> Which leads me to wonder -- what happened to people 's childhood love for dinosaurs ? Did this natural curiosity and wonder fade out alongside the drudgery that accompanies adulthood as childhood ambitions to be astronauts and archaeologists do ? <p> This sentiment is echoed by Chu , who ponders aloud : <p> " I mean logically , it should n't be just me being the " crazy guy " , because most of us were probably fascinated by these ancient creatures of the past at some point in time . " <p> " Why is everybody not interested , am I the only one interested , is there something strange with me ? Should I just follow everyone else and be interested in just getting a job and a condominium ? Is that really the point of my existence or should I hold on to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Despite his doubts , Chu emphasises the importance of sustaining that passion . Looking back on how his avid interest suffered a small slump during his late adolescence , Chu says he has since found a new way to sustain this passion : <p> Spreading the sense of wonder , magic and excitement he feels when he lays his eyes on a fossil , to the next generation . <p> As part of the Singapore Fossil Collectors , Chu often organises and takes part in outreach events at schools where they let students touch real fossils , and learn more about dinosaurs and palaeontology . <p> " The tacit experience of actually holding onto a fossil , and inspecting it is so much more real than what any textbook or YouTube programme can offer , " Chu said . <p> Photo from Andy Chua / FB <p> This love for fossils and history is something he tries to inspire in his eight-year-old son and five-year-old daughter too . <p> He amicably shares that he even visited his son 's school for one of the outreach sessions and " gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Chu says , his fossil collection will eventually be passed down to his children ( if they are interested to inherit them ) . <p> When asked if he has any fossil-related plans for the future , Chu reveals that he 's thought of setting up a fossil shop at one point in time , but has since reconsidered . <p> Unlike those who often conflate their passion and their source of income , Chu believes otherwise and does n't want his hobby to become a source of stress for him . <p> He has , however , entertained the idea of conducting trips for people to carry out their own fossil prospecting . <p> At the moment though , he will be focusing on the group 's outreach , with his goal of turning the Singapore Fossil Collectors into the " de facto place " for parents seeking knowledge and resources to support their children with similar interests . <p> " What I 'm really hoping for is that this will continue to inspire the children not to give up on what was once a passion for dinosaurs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inspire them to be interested in nature and science . And this branches into many other fields like geology , biology , palaeontology , even robotics . I think all of these sciences can be a very nice offshoot of some of this work that we do . " <p> At the end of the interview , Chu opens a large chest filled with ancient teeth , and asks us to choose one each despite our protests . <p> I 'm inexplicably excited at the prospect of having my own dinosaur tooth , and carefully select one belonging to a Mosasaur , my mind already jumping to ideas of how to display it despite the fact that frankly , my love for dinosaurs died out many years ago . <p> And perhaps it really is as simple as this -- to ignite , or reignite such an interest -- like gifting someone a prehistoric tooth .

Do is great actor and one of those idols who can act . He deserves success . He will have a great acting career when he comes back . Technically exo members do nt even care anymore for group . And he will be 27 or 28 when he comes back . Still so young So he did right by going army early . Because he had already made millions from music and cfs . Now he will have his second journey as top actor . <p> I gave them credit when it was due . It was a comeback to them who disrespected lmh . And i also said i shouldnt have done that unlike u who said all 90s actresses are over and your fave is untouchable . Difference lmao . I atleast own my faults ! <p> All they said is that his acting is not up to par with other top actors listed and most of his " hallyu " fame came from late @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his work , not him as a person , so what disrespect ? I do n't " own up to faults " or whatever because I will speak my mind and anyone here is free to call me hater , delusional , or whatever . It 's their right . I 'm not pretending to be righteous unlike you who discredits others who are n't LMH but pretends to be unbiased lol . <p> @marie u r the one to talk about acting when u stan suzyy and lol hirl i praise them a lot . Yeah i just pointed out the facts and how he topped south korean govt poll of halkyu stars while being in srmy . Ur favr wasnt even mentioned . She is that local And u discredit ever 90s gen actresses who stomp over your fave . So u should be last to talk . Hypocrite marie alert <p> i liked her the most ( Nam ji jyun ) in SKL. she looked so cute and innocent in that drama . Her chemistry with her ML was good . actually i want her to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in IG and she seems to be a kind and humble person thats why i have a soft spot for her . I do hope and pray that 2020 is a better year for her . i wish her all the best . <p> Absolutely agree with you 100% @lev . My all-time fave pair Bok Shil and Louis . I want her to work with SIG again , maybe in a different genre . These two are like Jang Nara and Jang Hyuk . Nam Ji Hyun is born in the year of the wood pig , that 's why she is gentle , kind , compassionate , easy to get along with . Whoever marries her will be the luckiest guy . This is from my perspective and experience of an ajumma who seldom match-makes people but once I see a potential great couple , I totally want to sail their boat . Lol . <p> I love Nam Ji Hyun to bits . First saw her in What Happened To My Family when I switched on the hotel 's TV while on vacation overseas . Like Shopping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when she appeared on the TV screen , lol . Since then , I have been loyally following her in every drama . She is the chemistry queen after PMY . Every male lead she co-stars with , she hits the right note . From Park Hyung Sik , Seo In Guk , Ji Chang Wook to Do Kyung Soo , she elevated her male lead 's acting and make the drama super cute , heartfelt , buzzing with depth and warmth . Totally into her . <p> I love Nam Ji Hyun the best in Shopping King Louis . The ajumma in me naturally looks at her birth year to understand why she seems to have amazing chemistry with my babies Gukkie and Wookie . Turns out she was born in the year of the pig who is a great match for male rabbits . No wonder their natural affinity shows on the screen which translates into an OTP that is filled with kindness , tenderness and such sweet harmony . I seldom ship a OTP this hard but Bok Shil and Louis is my all-time favourite couple . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 10 . The only reason being Gukkie did n't participate in an OST for that drama . Otherwise , it 's " perfect " to quote Loui 's favourite word . <p> Love her to bits and have been faithfully following her career , I 've loved her in every drama she 's starred in . I 'm proud of her accomplishments and she does have chemistry with each of her costars , so much so that she elevates the performances of her male lead actors . To all detractors I have said this before , and I 'll say it again , D.O . would not have been able to shine so much in 100 Days my Prince if Nam Ji Hyun did not do the heavy lifting in her role , so let 's give credit where credit is due . I forsee a bright future ahead for her . Hope she keeps choosing interesting roles . <p> Update : According to MBC IG post , 365 a year of defying fate will premiere on March 23 , 2020 at 8:55 pm . Monday and tuesday slot . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it looks promising . i just hope that even it is a mystery drama it would still be entertaining to watch . Good luck NJJ and LJH and team . hope the viewers will love and suort your series .

Japanese idols Yamashita Tomohisa and Kamenashi Kazuya have reunited for a May 2020 mini dome tour starting in Osaka and ending on Tokyo . The two worked together musically first as the fictional Shuji to Akira named after their characters in hit dorama Nobuta wo Produce ( still my absolute fave ) . They reunited in 2017 for Kame 's dorama You Are My Destiny as Kame to Yamapi and that duo is back for a 2020 twirl with a Latin themed single " Amor " that sounds like Shunji and Akira grew up to become emo Latin lovers brooding down in Bogota . The first single is out so check it out for yourselves as a weird 2020 throwback to 2005 , except the beautiful amazing Horikita Maki is now retired and the mother of two . Oh how time never looks back .
