The last couple of years have seen seismic movements in the sukuk industry despite the global economic downturn . In this time , we have seen newcomers to the global sovereign sukuk market such as the Republic of Indonesia , greater facilitation of cross boarder liquidity penetration such as the National Bank of Abu Dhabi 's Malaysian ringgit issuance ; growth and innovation around asset type . Such asset type growth is evidenced by the Trans Thailand Malaysia ( TTM ) Malaysian ringgit issuance , the first Thai entity sukuk and first project finance sukuk in Asia , as well as the innovatively structured Sabana Shari'ah Compliant Reit , which was a credential showing the growth of the Islamic capital markets within the equity capital markets space and generally the continual development of the Islamic wholesale finance market . <p> The Sabana Shari'ah Compliant Reit was the largest Shari'ah-compliant Reit in the world . It was one of the first Singapore Reits listed under Shari'ah compliance standard applicable to both the Asian and Middle Eastern standards . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ due to innovation and strengthening of an asset class Islamic finance should develop . HSBC believes that this is the tip of the iceberg in terms of what we will see in the future with regards to Shari'ah-compliant Reits , both regionally within Asia-Pacific and also in the global Islamic finance market . <p> These are a selection of the transactions HSBC Amanah was proud to be involved in and lead . Out of the global sukuks issued this year HSBC played a lead role in over half of the issuances , displaying the trust customers have in our HSBC Amanah franchise . Our capabilities within HSBC Group to support end-to-end Shari'ah-compliant transactions are unrivalled . The Sabana Shari'ah Compliant Reit transaction saw HSBC Group provide sole services across structuring , advisory , capital markets and various agency roles . We also were one of the three financing parties . The transaction was co-ordinated across multiple geographies and the financial solution delivered in a seamlessly integrated fashion . HSBC , from our Amanah platform , was uniquely positioned to provide cross geography Islamic finance solutions meeting customer needs , maintaining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the industry . <p> We talk about a price advantage for Malaysia-based investors/borrowers participating in the sukuk market . How far away are we from seeing this same trend regionally or globally ? What is HSBC Amanah doing to extend its global reach ? The sukuk market appeals to a wide investor class of both conventional and Islamic investors . As the market develops we see an increase in acceptance from conventional investors and growth in both size and sophistication of the Islamic investor base . As a result we are now witnessing more diversity across investor class and geography . The expansion and diversity of the investor base can potentially create a price tension , thus potentially result in a finer pricing for sukuk issuance . This dynamic will only come of age when there is an optimal mass of participating conventional and Islamic investors . However , the market has seen the early signs through the 2009 TDIC global issuance of both conventional and Islamic debt capital market instruments with the sukuk pricing tighter than the conventional versus sovereign premium . <p> To maximise global investor liquidity in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continual education of sukuk as an alternative investment in the debt capital markets , standardisation of sukuk offerings as well as the development of greater tenor flexibility to take advantage of sweet spots in the market when they arise . HSBC Amanah has access to a global investor pool and is a leader in sukuk structuring . Thus it is uniquely positioned to promote crossborder issuances and subscriptions contributing to development of sukuk awareness and participation . <p> Overall there is still a lack of depth and infrastructure to what Islamic finance can provide in comparison to conventional asset management . What are the inroads made at HSBC Amanah to keep it competitive ? Islamic finance is a rapidly growing and evolving industry . There are over 500 Islamic funds across various asset types and the demand for Shari'ah-compliant assets is not limited to institutional investors , but includes retail investors , which is pretty good for an industry that has only really come of age in the past decade . Asset management will become increasingly important in the years to come as Shari'ah-compliant asset management solutions increase , driven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the case with sukuk in its infancy , with increasing demand there will be a development of depth within asset management . HSBC have dedicated Islamic finance professionals within the wider asset management business across multiple geographies . We cater directly for demand in key Amanah geographies and can provide access otherwise to customers globally . HSBC Amanah is committed to growing this part of the business and we believe it is one that will be of primary importance in both the wholesale and retail space over the next decade . <p> Generally there is a point to make regarding the growth of asset classes within Islamic finance . In the traditional wholesale banking and asset management space , after sukuk , asset management is one of the next big things for Islamic finance due to the demand being responded to by regulators looking to facilitate supply and market growth . However , we also see that other asset classes such as Reits and project finance sukuk are making an impact on the global Islamic finance scene . As such we believe that it is an exciting time for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sukuk market . This is a direct indication of the maturing nature of the Islamic finance industry . <p> Following the Gulf crisis , Islamic finance was seen as a scapegoat to many of the flaws in the system set up by the Gulf Cooperation Council ( GCC ) . How did this impact your business ? What has been done to re-educate the market ? The entire financial system was impacted by the severe downturn in the GCC . It was a bad time for both conventional and Islamic financial services . Banks particularly exposed to real estate had a very tough 18 months . As the market recovers today we see both Islamic and conventional financial services industries benefiting . An area Islamic finance benefits from is in terms of certain maxims currently adopted in the industry such as prohibition on speculation and other principles that inhibit exposure to exotic and then potential toxic asset classes . What the market has seen is that at the same time there was an unfortunate environment in the GCC for Islamic finance , whereas Asia was seeing a continual evolution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finance and regional neighbours Singapore , Indonesia , Thailand as well as Bangladesh have seen positive steps to promote the growth of the industry either locally or globally . It should also be noted that Hong Kong , Japan and South Korea are currently putting in place or looking into legislation that will support sukuk issuances . The East meets East theme is one with high relevance to Islamic finance . <p> Asia is a region where consumption and growth will be strong and is backed by well developed financial markets . As Islamic finance regulation spreads in the region there is a large potential to see Middle Eastern investors seek interest in financial instruments and vehicles that are within the standards of Shari'ah . <p> What are your expectations of the Islamic Liquidity Management Corporation ( ILMC ) that was launched at this year 's Global Islamic Finance Forum ? We applaud the ILMC initiative and we believe that this will help in the issuance of high quality Shari'ah-compliant instruments , particularly short-term instruments , to create and facilitate liquidity management for the global sukuk market and thereby creating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relevant instrument for conventional and Islamic investors . To cater for the widest investor audience , a liquid secondary trading environment is an important requirement .

@@3961233 <h> No More Bank Lending Quota in China ? A Dream Distant <p> Will China scrap its bank lending quota and replace it with a " dynamic adjustment of differentiated reserve requirement ratio ( RRR ) " ? This is the most frequently asked question of late after the People 's Bank of China ( PBoC ) issued a statement on 6 Jan saying to use such a method to guide a stable loan growth . Interestingly , that statement did n't mention anything on loan quota as it did in 2010 . Ms. Hu Xiaolian , the first deputy governor of the PBoC , said on 24 Dec 2010 that the PBoC will adjust RRR individually and frequently , based on each bank 's systemic importance , level of prudence , financial ratios and past record of lending behavior . We believe scrapping bank lending quota is a distant dream in China . China still imposes lending quota , and the " dynamic adjustment of differentiated RRR " is used to allocate quota among individual banks . <p> No more lending quota in China ? That 's a distant dream <p> Some media hailed this move of the PBoC as on big market-oriented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leap after heavy-handedly setting loan quotas for so many years ? We are definitely less sanguine on this . In our view , it will take several more years ( perhaps beyond the 12th Five-year Plan in 2011-15 ) for China to truly stop setting lending quota . Though Beijing may not explicitly announce a number , it will have to set the annual ( or even monthly ) loan quota for the banking system , and we think the core of " dynamic adjustment of differentiated RRR " is about how to allocate total lending quota among individual banks . <p> The rule of game changes at the micro level <p> In previous years , the rules of quota allocation were not clear , and the implicit rule was to allocate quota according to banks ' existing sizes .

Some overly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forced purchase of central bank bills with below-market yields , but it seems that benefits always exceed costs . In our view , the new mechanism " dynamic adjustment of differentiated RRR " is used first to calculate lending quota for individual banks ( given the total annual quota ) , and then is used to restrain ( or punish ) banks with more frequently adjusted RRR . <p> A realistic approach in the first year of 12th FYP <p> If setting the total lending quota is macro policy , the allocation of quota among banks could be defined as " macro-prudent policy " , a fancy term increasingly popular after the global financial crisis .

In fact , he painted his first rendition of the cartoon character Popeye the Sailor Man as a gift for his young son ; when a buyer saw Lichtenstein 's painting , it was sold right away and Lichtenstein was requested to paint more . " So in a way , most of the American pop artists were stuck with their subject matter , " says Blake . <p> The concept of mass producing images , however , is not something Blake deems as negative .

There is this sort of populist ideal to it . " <p> In his coming retrospective exhibition in Hong Kong , the artist will be showcasing both iconic and recent works in his 60-year career , including a new variation of his Butterfly Man series , a set of computer generated images based on postcards of the old Hong Kong . When asked about the butterfly motif he shared with his younger peer Damien Hirst , Blake is unreserved in acknowledging his source of inspiration . " I appropriated it from him .

Pepper 's Lonely Hearts Club Band remains one of the most iconic images in music history , the veteran artist believes that his contribution has sometimes been underappreciated . " I still feel that the whole thing was unfair . The cover is just as important as the music -- it 's an integral part , and should be rewarded as such . The Beatles have never really been aware of that , or they 've consciously decided to not do it . " And does Blake ever get sick of being asked about The Beatles ? " I do , yeah , " he bluntly adds . <p> Interview : Fiona Ng ; additional reporting : Steven Hsieh <p> Sir Peter Blake 's exhibition , New Territory , is at The Space from May 27-June 17.

He talks to Edmund Lee ahead of his Hong Kong exhibition <p> Sebasti ? o Salgado is always on the go . An economist by trade before taking up an acclaimed career in photography , the 67-year-old Brazilian has been taking his poetic vision to every last shore on which human civilisation meets the natural world . As we caught him on the phone at his Paris studio , Salgado , a UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador , had just returned from a month 's stay with the nomads in the north of Siberia , and was already preparing for his next trip to the Kluane National Park in Canada . All these will constitute part of the tireless photojournalist 's ongoing Genesis series , for which he has spent years -- since 2004 -- documenting the eco-regions of the planet , from Africa and the Amazon to Alaska and Siberia . A small sample of these is being showcased at Salgado 's current exhibition in Hong Kong , his first solo presentation here . <p> How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 've been photographing it for such a long time ? Well , you know , we have in Brazil a big environmental project to restore parts of the Atlantic Forest , of more than 20 years now . We have the advantage of having rainforests in Brazil , and our involvement with nature is very close . I say " our " because we work in a team : my wife L ? lia Wanick Salgado is the designer of my book , and we organise this project in Brazil together . We created this foundation in Brazil , where we employ more than 100 people who work very hard on this operation . As my wife is the president of this foundation , when I say " we " it 's because I 'm not alone in this . My relation with nature is very close , and the decision that we do this Genesis project -- that I started more than seven years ago -- was to do a kind of homage to this planet .

And for many years , I 'm doing a new presentation of the planet . <p> When it comes to describing your work , the term " sublime " often comes into the discussion . Do you think these sublime images can only be found in nature ? Or also in the urban world ? What , what 's the question ? <p> The sublime quality of your work . My English is not that good . What other word does this mean ? <p> ' Sublime ' is an extraordinary kind of beauty that ca n't be easily put into words . Ah . Put me to the question again now . <p> Do you think you can only find that kind of extraordinary images in nature -- instead of , say , the modern world ? No , no , no . You can find that everywhere . That 's not special for nature . It 's a problem of identification with what you are photographing . To photograph something real and deep , you must have identification . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be 100 percent inside the environment you photograph . What you bring from there is something more than just going there and taking a picture -- you put your life inside , you know ? It 's quite different . <p> So when you decide on the subjects for your photographs , what exactly is going through your mind ? You know , my subjects are my life . It 's a complete coherence with my way of life , with what I trust . My philosophy , my etiquette , my concept of beauty ... they are all mixed inside . I have the motivation , and I go ! I like very much to work on long-term projects . At least I can have total dedication , and that 's become my way of life . When you put in eight years to photograph a project , it 's become my life . I must have a big identification ; if it 's the contrary , I can not do that . <p> You began as an economist , and then you changed to become a full-time photographer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's relatively slow . It took me three years to take a decision to become a full-time photographer . Before , I finished my PhD in economics in Paris , and I went to work as an economist for the International Coffee Organization , doing mostly trips to Africa . The first picture I took in my life was in 1970 ; until then I had never made a picture -- I had no interest , and I was concentrating on other things . But the moment I got a camera and started to photograph , photography took a total invasion in my life . I had a total identification with it . I dedicated three years of preparation for it , and then I went to a school . I saw many books , and I went to many shows and many museums . By that time , photography was so exciting for my life that I made the big decision to abandon my career and become a photographer . That was 1973 . <p> Since then , you 've always worked in black and white , often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or is there a conceptual rationale behind it ? You know , I started in black and white from the beginning . I tried also to do colour , but colour for me ... I lose my concentration because of colour . If I photograph , let 's say , something in colour , and I have one red spot there , this red spot becomes so red it takes so much of the visual part of the thing that , for me , it 's a huge disturbance . The sky becomes so blue . In reality , it was a little bit of an exaggeration . In black and white there 's no distraction . But for me , all the greys represent the old colours , the old things much better . When I 'm photographing something very important and want to concentrate on this point , it was much more possible to identify what was most powerful in black and white than in colour , for me . And little by little , I took a decision to do black and white , and after a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became my life . <p> Your choices of subjects regularly revolve around developing countries or nature . Is this a nostalgic response to your childhood in Brazil ? Well , I do take into considerations my origin . I was born in a developing country ; I was raised in a developing country ; I 've spent most of my life in a developing country . This for me is my life . It 's not because I do n't believe in life in the north part of this planet , but I was born on the other side . I was always in shadows because the sunshine is so strong in our country . Probably that 's made most of my pictures against the light -- but I love to photograph against the light . These kinds of things made a big influence on you , because it 's your origin and you can not deny it . And , it 's true , I photograph a lot in nature , of course . But I was born in the nature . I was born in a farm in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lived in the fields , I lived inside a farm . My liaison with nature is very big . And if you go back to my old pictures , when I photograph human beings they 're always inside the nature -- most of them were . <p> Looking back at your career , what 've been the most memorable moments ? Ah ! Laughs Well , I have a few important moments in my life . One of them was probably when I was 15 years old . I was living on a farm until then , and when I was accepted to a secondary school in a large town , it was a big shocker . It was a big , big change for me . And I had a big stabilisation in my life when I knew my wife . I started with my wife very young -- I was 19 years old -- and I 'm with my wife until now . I love her very much , we live in a very special way . We were able to get away from Brazil to France because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1969 . The moment I abandoned my work as an economist to become a photographer , to start a new life , this moment was a very important one for me as well . <p> You wrote in The Guardian a few years ago that urbanisation has put our existence in danger . How do you feel about the recent earthquakes and nuclear crisis in Japan , and the predictable pattern of natural disasters setting off human ones ? Today , Japan is one example , but only in China , there 's a big consumption of oil that 's polluting everywhere with its residues of oil , plastics , and all the things that come from the same origin -- this excessive consumption of energy . You see this in Hong Kong , you have a huge consumption : there must be air conditioning all year long . Why are we using energy that we do n't have the right to use , while destroying so many things in the planet ? We made a choice being human -- that 's nonsense . Because we forget that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made us survive other species until now was our spiritual part and our instinctive part . We use the planet only for us ; in a moment , it will be very difficult for us to go back to our planet . I hope we soon realise that we are nature , so we must respect nature . We must choose a much sweeter way of life and be less aggressive . The contrary would be very complicated for us , and for the other species . This disaster in Japan now , you see the power of nature in a second . Things can happen in a fraction of a second in a way we do n't understand . <p> For the public , you 're already considered one of the greatest photographers in the world . But personally , what kind of a legacy do you want to leave behind ? No ! Laughs Working is my life and my way of life . If my work lights up a store and becomes a resident , it 'll become a legacy . If I 'm wrong , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my life , I love what I 'm doing , I put my full life inside my work .

@@4153232 <h> Chinese Opera Festival <p> Chinese opera is cool . Your grandma , who ca n't help singing along to her Yam Pak Cantonese opera recording every morning , knows it . So did Bertolt Brecht , who was wise enough to borrow from Peking opera and conceive his signature " distancing effect " theory . The German dramaturge did n't just admire Mei Lanfang for the heavy make-up , elaborate costumes and high-pitched singing of his art . Equally stylised and mutually inclusive , each regional sub-genre of Chinese opera has developed its own set of aesthetic and bodily nuances . <p> The Chinese Opera Festival is perhaps an apt occasion to find out what have been captivating our grannies since their teens and what has , in part , been influencing Western theatre for decades . Initiated last year by the Leisure and Cultural Service Department ( LCSD ) , the annual festival is showcasing a wide range of Chinese opera performances and seminars in the next two months . Many regional classic titles are being performed here for the first time and this may also be the last stage appearance for some of the visiting old ( and retiring ) masters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opera and Kunqu will also undergo a face-lift and be presented with contemporary interpretations . <p> One of the unprecedented collaborations is a Cantonese and Peking opera cross-cover of King Chu Bids Farewell To His Concubine ( ? ? ? ? ) , led by well-loved , local Cantonese opera artist Law Kar-ying and Shi Yihong , a National Class One Performer from the Shanghai Peking Opera Troupe . While Law is no stranger to cross-genre productions -- he once played Shakespeare 's Macbeth Cantonese-opera style and took up comedic roles in Stephen Chow 's wacky comedy movies -- Shi has been receiving rigid , traditional Peking opera training since the age of 10 . The two are going to remain faithful to the vocal articulation and body language of their respective genres , playing the tragic couple King Chu and Lady Yu in the war-worn nation . <p> " The greatest difference between Peking and Cantonese opera probably lies in their spoken language and music , whereas they share similarly abstract and formulated executions in story-telling and emotion expression , " Shi remarks on the collaboration . " This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opera scene so we do n't really know the outcome until it 's performed to the public . " <p> Kunqu opera , marked by the beauty of its lingering end tones that work according to the phonology of Chinese ( Han ) language , has been included on UNESCO 's list of Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity for 10 years . To celebrate this anniversary , four weighty Kunqu operatic troupes have been invited to perform excerpts from classic works and a rejuvenated version of The Story of the West Chamber ( ? ? ? ) . <p> Characterised by its diversified puppet-like clown roles ( chou sheng ) , Gaojia Opera 's serious humour will be brought to its height by the Jin Liansheng Gaojia Opera Troupe of Xiamen City . Also worth noting is the fantastical Qi opera .

Fredric Mao , an influential figure in Hong Kong 's Western dramas and a follower of Cantonese opera , has based his version on Yip 's blueprint and sees space for a modern theatrical treatment in this less frequently staged classic . " The intention of my work is to win both new and loyal audiences , which is not easy , " says Mao . In this new rendition , the veteran director has trimmed the script and rearranged the mise-en-scene , but promises to stick by the original melody and conventional vocalisation and body movements . <p> " It 's less about how to do it than why to do it , " stresses Mao , whose Cantonese-opera-inspired , modern musical The Liaison recently completed its well-received China tour . Despite its popularity with younger audiences , the veteran director is concerned about the isolation of traditional Cantonese opera in Hong Kong . While @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young theatre-goers never spare a moment 's thought for the genre . <p> " There are a lot of precious things in Cantonese opera , but we have to keep studying and exploring them , " Mao asserts .

The Raft represents the journey of the storm before these people cobble together a raft to refuge themselves from the deluge , but in a very simple narrative ; it 's like a storybook narrative . I thought of G ? ricault and tried consciously not to do an obvious take on that , but the connotations are there . My raft is much more of a storm .

Anyway , there was no question in my mind I was positive . <p> What made you finally get tested ? I was in a relationship , and I wanted to know .

As Mr. Fan noted , many of his competitors increasingly book expensive international travel to Bali , Australia and New Zealand . " People intend to spend more than in the past , " he said . <p> For Ctrip , however , outbound travel remains a small revenue source compared with its mainstay China hotel business and the company is likely to keep most of its operations close to home .
