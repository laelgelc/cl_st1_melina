@@96126231 <p> James Gunn 's DC Universe is stirring things up with a Warner Bros . Discovery . Now that it has been confirmed that Henry Cavill wo n't be returning as Superman , despite the announcement they had made before James Gunn and Peter Safran took over , anything could happen in the DC Universe . The pair are looking for a younger actor to play a version of Superman that we have never seen before , as he establishes himself as a hero and starts to work at the Daily Planet . Does this mean they will also look for younger versions of the other heroes to follow suit ? <h> Alan Ritchson Would Be Perfect for Aquaman <p> Many of us grew up watching Smallville , with the young and dashing Tom Welling playing Clark Kent as he discovers his powers and learns to be a superhero , ending with his move to Metropolis and the story we know about him being a reporter at the Daily Planet . During the series , many other characters from the DC Universe made a brief appearance , such as Supergirl , Kara Zor-El ; Green Arrow , aka Oliver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even Cyborg , aka Victor Stone . <p> One of the sweetest superheroes that appeared in the series was none other than Arthur Curry , aka Aquaman . Alan Ritchson stood in as Aquaman , a young man with the power of Atlantis behind him , an intense sense of justice for marine life , and the ability to control water and breathe underwater . Alan Ritchson 's portrayal of Aquaman differed from how Jason Momoa played him , as his character was much younger . <p> Although older now , Alan Ritchson could still play Aquaman in James Gunn 's new universe if the co-CEOs of DC Studios attempt to completely break away from the old DCEU . I 'm not the only one who thinks so , as many fans are offering his name as a suggestion for who should be next to play the King of Atlantis . <p> Multiple social media posts have harkened back to Ritchson 's days in Smallville , and the handsome and well-built actor is young enough to convincingly play the character . " I know Alan played Arthur Curry in Smallville @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out . How would you feel if he came back and played Aquaman on the big screen ? I 'll go watch it . I thought he did a great job as Arthur , aka Aquaman . I 'm not saying let 's bring Smallville to the big screen . I 'm saying he already played it , so why not let him do it for the big screen ? " <p> Considering the way that he left an impression that was truer to the character in the comics , with innocence and a love for not only humanity but also the marine world and the Atlantians , it would be amazing to see this actor back in the saddle of a more positive portrayal of Aquaman that might fit into a younger universe , something that it looks like Gunn is heading for . <h> Actors Being Booted <p> Everyone 's favourite Man of Steel is one of many who have possibly been booted from the DC Universe as of late . Gunn and Safran , as the new co-heads of DC Studios , are effectively trying to put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started . After the controversies that followed Zack Snyder and his DCEU , it is n't surprising that Gunn and Safran would want to make a clean break from the creative universe that came before them . <p> Along with the former The Witcher actor , there have been no signs of Gal Gadot 's Wonder Woman returning for her proposed third movie . The movie has come to a complete halt for all intents and purposes . A few rumours were going around at one point that the director was the reason the film was n't moving forward at this point . Still , these rumours were quickly put to rest when the director took to Twitter to explain that this was n't the case . With Gunn and Safran changing the plans of the whole DC Universe , and their 10-year plan , it seems that Wonder Woman just does n't factor into it right now . <p> Another Zack Snyder 's Justice League member that has not been seen since the movie is Ray Fisher 's Cyborg . There is also no surprise on this front because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the time to get them to let him release his version of Justice League after another director had taken over and ' ruined ' it , according to him and many fans . Of course , Fisher was only involved in the DC Universe because of Snyder , so his loyalty made sense , but his belief may have prevented him from having any future opportunities with the film production company . <p> Jason Momoa 's Aquaman : The Lost Kingdom may also be his last venture as the character . There have been several reports that once the current slate of movies is released , many of these actors will find that their contracts will be terminated . After the lukewarm reception of Black Adam and the controversies with Dwayne Johnson releasing financial statements , the wrestler-turned-actor will probably find himself in the same boat as the Aquaman actor . <p> Although the actor 's versions of the characters may not be a part of the DC Universe anymore , they will forever remain a part of their IP , meaning they will be looking for new actors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already a lot of unique options available . As it is , with Gunn looking for a younger version of Superman , does this mean they might be looking for younger versions of the rest of the Justice League ? <p> James Gunn and Peter Safran have an entire universe to create and play with . The director turned CEO has always had brilliant ideas for the superhero world . Whatever comes out of them is sure to be an enjoyable experience . If they are looking for new actors to fill the roster , they need look no further than Alan Ritchson to reprise his role as Aquaman.

The co-CEOs of DC Studios have said they are looking for a younger actor , presumably someone in their 20s to early 30s , for the role . They have plenty of actors to choose from . As usual , the internet has plenty of suggestions for who would be a perfect fit for the role , and they have found some excellent choices . There have been some whispers that some actors are closer to winning the role than others .

You ca n't deny that he fills out the suit really well . <h> Some Other Popular Choices <p> You can find countless suggestions on the internet for filling the role of Superman . Many of them are handsome with dark hair and a body that would suit a superhero , so here are some of the more popular choices amongst fans . <p> First among the popular suggestions is Ben Barnes . An English actor like Henry Cavill , Barnes is just as handsome . He has given some intense performances during his acting career .

While he is similar to Henry Cavill and has the perfect jawline to play Superman , this actor has a solid shot at being the next man in tights . <p> Still , a very young actor on the scene , Jacob Elordi , has come up in many a conversation about who should have the honour of being the next Superman . He is known mainly for his role in series like Euphoria and movies like The Kissing Booth and Pirates of the Caribbean : Dead Men Tell No Tales .

The SCA agreed with us that the Minister had acted ultra vires and the Regulations were set aside . <p> The SCA also ruled that fracking could not be utilised as a method until it was lawfully and adequately regulated . <p> In the circumstances , the SCA agreed with the landowners ( " lunatic greenies " ) on these important legal issues . <p> The SEA was completed as was a report commissioned by Government on South Africa 's Technical Readiness to support the shale gas industry ( compiled by the Academy of Science @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these peer-reviewed reports , compiled by hundreds of specialists in various disciplines recognised the fact that there were significant unknowns which required further research to better inform decision making . <p> Subsequently the ASSAf and Government have conducted a number of conferences and workshops aimed at developing a Science Action Plan for shale gas exploration in the Karoo Basin . The process is ongoing . <p> The Ministers of Water Affairs and Environmental Affairs have published draft Regulations aimed at regulating SGD and the public participation process was followed . <p> The Regulations have yet to be published in final form . This office has filed comment on behalf of landowners and if the Regulations ( including those relating to financial provisioning ) are inadequate , these will be challenged on review . <p> Government , through various state departments and agencies ( including the Council for Geosciences and PASA ) and various universities are conducting research to augment the state of knowledge significantly , on the extent of shale gas reserves , groundwater and the unique geology ( and geohydrology ) in the Karoo Basin . <p> It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hogg and Hersov ) what the extent of shale gas reserves are . They have clearly been over-estimated before . <p> So , by way of example , the results of the University of Johannesburg 's recent drilling on the perimeters of the Karoo Basin are described by the ASSAf to be " somewhat disappointing since the shale was found to be over-mature " . They found no exploitable shale gas reserves . This is in keeping with recent data from exploration drilling by De Kock et al ( 2017 ) which suggests that the White Hill Formation and other carbonaceous shale beds are over-mature and that the technically recoverable shale gas resource may be in the region of 13 tcf . This is substantially lower than the trillions of cubic feet previously suggested . <p> The Soekor exploration well reports to which Hersov has reference do reveal some gas finds , but the flow depleted quickly . The gas reserves were not viable at that time . <p> No viable shale reserves in the Karoo Basin have been reported on by any of the entities involved in research and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> At a conference arranged by Government and the ASSAf in August / September 2017 for Government and the industry , a spokesperson for Shell informed the conference , inter alia , that they were of the view that that there was a less than 10% chance of discovering viable shale gas reserves . <p> The authors of the SEA , chapter 5 thereof , suggest that the water resources of the Karoo should not be employed in the fracking process , which suggests that water would have to be imported . <p> Hersov suggests that Minister Mantashe should be bold , lift the moratorium and allow for SGD and in the process , telling the " leftists " , " lunatic " , " foreign funded greenies " to " stuff-off " . <p> He is critical of our President , Cyril Ramaphosa as being " spineless " and prone to bullying by foreign governments . <p> This tirade is extremely offensive . <p> Government is obliged to follow a risk-averse approach and in applying the precautionary principle , have regard not only to what is known , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ informed decision making . <p> Government must also meet its obligation to properly and lawfully regulate these activities . Mr Hersov is poorly informed on the facts , or deliberately misrepresents the facts to promote an undisclosed agenda . He certainly promotes the political narrative of Gayton McKenzie and appears to promote the business interests of Nigerian investors . <p> Our involvement in the opposition to SGD has been deliberate and responsible , promoting research and proper regulation aimed at protecting the environment and an industry vital to food security . It has been funded by individual landowners involved in agriculture ( which employs in excess of 100 000 people in the area under application and sustains over a million others ) , the game and eco-tourism industry . Organised agriculture has also contributed to cost as has the Rupert Nature Foundation . We enjoy the support of business leaders including Mr Johan Rupert who Hersov erroneously suggests may be supportive of SGD in the Karoo Basin . Hersov 's assumptions are unfounded and incorrect . We have also not received foreign funding and if aimed at us , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ report of the late Tony Twine has since been discredited . The SEA has established that large SGD would create only 2275 jobs in the drilling phase and approximately 300 during the operational phase with approximately 390 -- 900 direct job opportunities for locals . <p> SGD will not create , as suggested by Hersov and Twine , " millions " of jobs . It may in fact undermine thousands of existing jobs in agriculture and tourism . <p> Hersov believes that the moratorium should be lifted in January and that the next 30-45 days are critical , suggesting further , that gas " both on-shore and off-shore " could be produced in the next 24 -- 36 months . <p> This is absurd and could not be achieved , either practically or lawfully . <p> The ASSAf report suggests periods of up to 11 years for exploration , 5 years for development and production from year 16 . If there are viable reserves and these are exploited it may not , as suggested by Hersov , be in his life-time . He may however escape the negative effects of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> It may be so that gas should be considered to form part of the energy mix to meet South Africa 's energy needs , but to do so utilising an invasive drilling method with potential catastrophic effects on the environment to access unconventional shale gas does not make much sense . There are conventional gas reserves which can be exploited with less invasive less costly conventional methods . <p> Government has a duty to ensure the lawful , sustainable exploitation of our Country 's mineral resources including the beneficiation of affected communities , especially those previously disadvantaged whilst preserving an environment which is not harmful to our health and well-being . <p> To be critical then , of a risk-averse approach , is irresponsible . <p> Given the current state of knowledge and the lack of proper Regulation , affected landowners will pursue responsible opposition to SGD. 
@@96205235 <h> Why I still have n't taken the Covid-19 jab and accept the label of anti -- ( these injections ) -- vaxxer -- Dr Nathi Mdladla <p> Frequent critic of the Covid 19 vaccination policy , Dr Nathi Mdladla , delves into how his distrust of the injections came to be , which he believes are novel therapeutics with still as yet no proven evidence of efficacy but with serious debilitating side-effects for some people . He details being given the label " anti-vaxxer " , a term that was only useful for shutting down debate and gaslighting those who had valid concerns and requiring clarification before taking an uncertain experimental product eventually led to an acceptance of the term . Dr Mdladla gives a stirring analysis of the current world of medicine and data , a tool used to manipulate the direction of narratives depending on who is paying for it . He believes doctors , as the main group with the relevant knowledge to challenge and ask for reasonable and more nuanced approaches to the pandemic , were silent -- opening up a gap for politicians , unscrupulous business people and corrupt big corporates to channel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suit their interests . -- Nadya Swart <p> By Dr Nathi Mdladla* <p> The gaslighting against those who challenged the narrative around the COVID-19 injections has been so aggressive and personal , to the extent of tearing families apart and making colleagues enemies of each other unnecessarily , for a medical product that is still to this day under investigation ( experimentation ) . The root cause for this was the religious fervour with which the injections were adopted by some before they were even on the market . There was an unprecedented fanatical take on these products reminiscent of the Steve Jobs era at Apple when a new version of the iPhone was to be launched ! <p> Background <p> Being a medical skeptic , I was highly skeptical of these particular vaccines while the original Pfizer trials were being run in 2020 for various reasons : <p> Vaccines against respiratory viruses never reached more than 60% efficacy against preventing infection before COVID-19 for many reasons with the main one being the high mutability within these viruses ; <p> There has never been a safe successful vaccine against the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the market in spite of proven efficacy in animals but a high adverse event rate <p> Immunity gained from the original SARS-1 virus infection was proven to be robust and durable for more than a decade after exposure to that virus in those tested <p> The fact of the matter is nobody could have predicted with certainty what these new vaccines would achieve irrespective on what platform they were built on , in 2020 . What we had learnt before was the obvious guide , with the natural assumption that it would take years to come up with an effective vaccine that had few serious side effects . Most of the initial " blind adopters " were only using faith and non-critical outlook for the COVID-19 vaccines , in their adoption and recommendation . When it came to the mRNA vaccines , one needed to be even more cautious and highly skeptical because they were built on a new platform hitherto unknown and targeting one part of the virus ( the spike protein ) that was erroneously deemed to be a clear target for neutralising the SARS-CoV2 virus . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ injections all over the world because of their purported higher efficacy at preventing infections of &gt;95% , from the initial Pfizer and Moderna trials . Yet these particular injections have been marred with controversy from the outset , with Pfizer refusing to divulge their raw data to scientists looking to make sense of their " impossible " &gt;95% efficacy against infection , which was more than double of whatever we had been able to achieve prior to COVID-19 . <p> The other often missed fact by those either outside of medicine or those within medicine ( who are not skeptics ) was how much investment had gone into vaccines for various other ailments including cancers prior to 2019 and the challenges these new vaccines often faced . A new platform like the mRNA one and all other vaccines studied under EUA 's , would mean less time on tedious animal experiments ( with often poor results ) , leading to massive financial savings in research and drug development for the manufacturers : This was an obvious opportunity created by COVID-19 and exploited by those with a financial bias as governments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was available and deemed effective against SARS-CoV2 . Vaccines soon took the Messianic label and position as the only way we would end the pandemic ! <h> Initial optimism drowned by emerging evidence <p> By November 2020 , a new variant called Beta was sequenced and declared by South Africa first , but an earlier mutation could have been circulating even earlier in the UK as the Kent Variant subsequently dubbed the alpha variant became dominant in that county . Even in the US , there had been documentation of some variants that were deviating from the original Wuhan virus in the early North American winter as the vaccine studies were under way . <p> With the emergence of variants , which was what we had always known about most respiratory viruses that cause seasonal flu , my first concerns about whatever was being developed at " speed " , was the natural concern that they should be less effective against variants , as whatever vaccine was in the market and being developed at that stage was to the Wuhan Virus . I in fact posed this question to one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our medical research council . Virology 101 dictated that " when a virus mutates , the vaccine made to that virus will be less effective " . The latter is what we have known for decades of virology and immunology , the question being why would this one differ ? What I appreciated was the response I got from this scientist -- " the spike protein is a few acid bases , we therefore do n't expect it to change that much " meaning the vaccines would retain efficacy . She however followed this up with this -- " but we do n't know ... " . That last sentence said everything for me -- nobody knew , so naturally everyone who either recommended or did not recommend these new vaccines needed to clearly state what was known or not known to their patients ; with the patient ultimately making the final call on the balance of provided evidence . <p> The emergence of mutations was my first dampener of enthusiasm for vaccines as the only solution to the end the pandemic . The Beta Wave of COVID-19 in Dec @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dr George Mukhari Academic Hospital , to the extent that I felt desperate for anything that could help limit hospitalisation and deaths . This is when I started looking at available repurposed therapies that had promise with treating late COVID-19 , which led me on the Ivermectin trail of evidence and soon I was linked with physicians that were treating COVID-19 early in the out-of-hospital setting , and some who were treating late COVID-19 with great success . What I was beginning to learn in Dec 2020 and January 2021 was that we had a highly treatable respiratory illness that needed a thinking out-of-the-box mentality , with physicians sharing their observations timely to limit unnecessary patient deaths . From January 2021 we adopted the use of some of the available protocols from colleagues all over the world albeit haphazardly but with exciting outcomes in those we tried them on . <p> At this stage it became clear to me that with every " flu season " to come in future , and with the next one being predictably coming in June 2021 in South Africa , we needed to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -- effective repurposed therapies and early treatment protocols seemed a cheap and obvious goal to me . Vaccines under investigation held some promise but we needed more evidence to balance their need versus their adverse event profile . So from the beginning I sought to try and determine who should be receiving these injections and this was my guiding principle based on what I had observed treating outpatients and those with severe disease in the hospital : <p> Those with proven previous infection to SARS-CoV2 did NOT need to be vaccinated <p> The young ( &lt;30 ) with no comorbidities did NOT need to take an experimental injection with uncertain future outcomes when the disease was less significant for them in the majority <p> The elderly with comorbidities should have been prioritized with the usual standing informed consent , none should have been coerced or forced to take it . <p> The known ethical principles enshrined in the Helsinki Declaration needed to be adhered to bearing in mind we hard a treatable disease with a very low mortality rate , until we got to really know what the efficacy of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's challenges would be ! <p> Primum non-nocere ( first do no harm ) <p> Beneficence ( benefit for the individual and community ) <p> Non-maleficence <p> Informed consent <h> My Individual choice <p> Right from the beginning when there was news that Pfizer had started a human trial and rollout of its candidate vaccine in Israel , I decided I was going to forgo this injection for a number of reasons : <p> I was a healthy non-overweight 46 year old male = low risk for severe disease and death <p> I had COVID-19 in August 2020 -- treated it intensely with regular flu medications for two days at home and was back working in a COVID ICU at Day 3 <p> My infection-acquired immunity should have put me in a better position against future infections <p> There could be no benefit for me in taking the injection but could be exposed to all of the unknown and still to be studied adverse events <p> As the results from Israel started coming out , an obvious picture of vaccination drives followed by COVID-19 surges of cases and deaths was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " why were highly vaccinating nations experiencing high infection rates ? Was it a direct vaccine effect ( spike toxicity ) , a significant weakening of immunity making patients susceptible to both influenza and SARS-CoV2 infections , or another acute event that resulted in debilitation with a positive swab at admission to hospital . Pfizer 's data was too sketchy and not easy to interpret without raw data to make sense of what was happening in Israel , and subsequently Seychelles , Peru , Gibraltar , UAE and many other countries that early on adopted COVID-19 vaccines and mandated them aggressively . <p> A picture was clearly emerging from the world -- there was something seriously wrong with the first injection of the mRNA vaccine with many coming down with acute events and something resembling COVID-19 . The second injection did not seem to be as deleterious but the problem was that the stats produced to understand adjacent causality to the vaccines were masked ( probably deliberately ) by the definition of " vaccinated/fully vaccinated " . This definition had nothing to do with medicine but clearly with what was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mRNA vaccines for an example -- it did n't matter what happened to you for &gt;8weeks from your first injection ( or two weeks after your second injection ) as you were deemed unvaccinated until the time to maximum antibody response/formation after the second one . This was too long a time period for a pandemic that seemed to have a middle aggressive two week period , and lasting approximately a month . This long period for determining vaccine efficacy was clearly prone towards exaggerating efficacy while downplaying adverse events by manipulating end-points . <h> The watershed moment <p> February 7th 2021 was the eve of the rollout of the OXFORD ASTRA-ZENECA ( OA-Z ) vaccine in South Africa . There was high anticipation for Day 1 of the rollout on the following day Monday the 8th . Then an article out of the Financial Times was published overnight on the 6th and I was sent an early copy anonymously late in the evening quoting a South African trial that spelled doom for our rollout . This article confirmed what I had feared in Dec 2020 -- this particular vaccine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ population . This for me called into question all the available vaccines modelled on neutralising the spike protein . In my clinical mind , this meant OA-Z could not be rolled out , and more importantly South Africa and the world needed to be more circumspect in making financial commitments in COVID-19 vaccine contracts . <p> This watershed moment dictated my change in description for these so-called vaccines to therapeutic injections -- for myself " if they were not stopping infection , nor stoping spread -- they were no longer vaccines " . Strangely enough this was the first time I got to hear that vaccines in 2021 were " only supposed to prevent severe disease requiring hospitalisation and death " and that " breakthroughs infections " were no cause for alarm ! This , in spite of the knowledge that these vaccines had to prove a &gt;50% efficacy to reduce transmission for emergency use authorisation to be granted . This for me meant the injections were not doing anything different to what other repurposed therapies purported to reduce infection , limit severe disease and death were doing . Therefore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drugs meant to limit the severity of COVID-19 and not stop the spread of disease eg. Hydroxychloroquine , Ivermectin , and monoclonal antibodies . <p> I sent this Financial Times article to a WhatsApp group of influential people that included the then MoH Dr Zweli Mkhize , the Head of the MAC on COVID , various vaccinologists , Big Tech players , lobbyists and advisors to the government around 23:00 on the 6th of February 2021 . This was a very active group , but for more than 16hours no response message was posted on the group . A scramble ensued documented elsewhere resulting in an emergency media statement and meeting at 20:00 on the 7th of February where the challenge with OA-Z trial was mentioned and the proposed Phase 1B J&amp;J Trial for healthcare workers that was going to be launched as the initial " rollout " for South Africa . Politicians could save face as there would be " a rollout " and Big Tech and other lobbyists , some of whom had skin in the game like Sisonke , could then get funding to run studies on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run by Pfizer themselves , meaning none of the data on their product would be published without their blessing or being overseen by their employees . <h> A scramble to be at the front of the queue <p> When the J&amp;J Phase 1-B Trial was being run on healthcare workers , something unethical emerged with no shame from perpetrators to observers ! I had worked in a COVID-19 ICU for two waves already , mostly not wearing PPE because I did not believe in its efficacy in the hospital setting of late COVID-19 , and because I believed my infection acquired immunity stood me in a better position than what the vaccine could achieve for me . I also believed for the low risk individuals whether previously infected or not , infection immunity was still more sensible -- it could save the country spending more money unnecessarily and would ensure the avoidance of yet unknown but emerging adverse events internationally . <p> Yet , while high risk healthcare workers were being enrolled in the " study " , those at low risk or had been infected already , were either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sneaking in office staff and family relatives who were low risk -- for an experimental drug with no proven efficacy or know adverse events . To me this spelt in full detail the observation from March 2020 , when the healthcare professionals endorsed and supported lockdowns for a low risk population of South Africa , for a disease that was clearly not going to be an issue worst than a bad seasonal flu back then and has been proven such to this day to be so . <p> While the J&amp;J Trial was afoot , Pfizer stock had already made it into the country under some study protocols . Certain people with connections started accessing these vaccines unofficially even if they were not part of the studies , and some business people either accessed these in the country trough connections or went overseas where they could get these through arrangements . This was before the ramp-up of the general population vaccination drive initially targeting high at risk individuals even commenced in South Africa , beginning in June 2021 .. <p> At about this time ( between the second wave and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be on one of the Working Streams of the Vaccine Ministerial Advisory Committee on Vaccine Rollout . One thing that was clear on these meetings was that SA did not have enough money to vaccinate everyone . It was clear though that we did not need to vaccinate everyone -- community clinic studies had already shown &gt;80% infection rate in poor communities , the profile of those at high risk was clear and they are the ones that should have been prioritised using limited tax-payer money . With the clear lack of efficacy in preventing infections in studies to date , the choice to get the injections should have been left to the individual and physicians and clinical workers told the relevant known information at that point . <p> Within the first weeks of the J&amp;J Trial , we started getting stories in the early COVID Treatment community : <p> Thrombosis events were the first to come up with the J&amp;J injection -- either as transient mild events of overnight blurring of vision to full-blown neurological fallout ( strokes ) , deep vein thrombosis with pulmonary embolism <p> Flu-like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with COVID-19 <p> Other ill-defined ailments with swelling of limbs , face and just general non-wellbeing <p> What was more worrying to us was that these people were often turned away from the clinics they were vaccinated at , with their details and complaints either not captured nor taken seriously . The staff at these clinics and hospitals ( if they were able to access that level of care ) , often told them that it was impossible that whatever they were experiencing could be due to the " vaccine " as this was deemed " safe and effective " by the WHO , government agencies and top scientists . The system that had told these people to take the experimental injections was not listening to those suffering nor suggesting potential therapies to help them with their complications . Once again the early treating physicians and naturopaths who have never shied away from helping desperate patients during the initial phases of COVID-19 , where no solutions were offered except to " go to home to isolate and only go to hospital when blue and unable to breathe " , had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eventually dub " spike-protein toxicity syndrome " <p> When my 70 year old aunt , who is like a mother to me , asked me if she should take the vaccine or not in August 2021 as she was having a lot of pressure from the grandchildren , I gave her my " balanced view " as informed consent , and left the choice to her . She was at high risk from multiple fronts , with the additional emotional pressure of having lost her daughter to complications of the virus 6 months prior . She was scared to take it and asked me for my opinion . This is what I said to her then -- " you are high risk for severe disease if you have not had the infection already ( she lived with her daughter and chances are she had it and survived it already ) , and the concerning side effects so far seem to be in the 40-55 year old females for the J&amp;J vaccine with regards to clotting complications and for teenagers with the mRNA vaccine with regards to myocarditis . There are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and still monitoring everything " . On my advice , she decided she would take the vaccine based on the informed consent I provided and the balance of outcomes . <p> A few weeks after her first dose of the mRNA vaccine she messaged me again and informed me that although she had been suffering from headaches before the vaccine , these had become more frequent and more intense . Her blood pressure which was under control was also now a challenge to control . Her exact words were -- " I would rather get COVID and take my chances than having to endure what I am experiencing after the first injection " She got COVID a few months later after her first injection ( she never went back for the second dose ) and I treated her through a local GP with repurposed drugs and she made an uneventful recovery . <h> The subsequent emerging evidence and my conviction I had made the right decision <p> From December 2020 -- all available vaccines were to the spike protein of the original Wuhan virus which had mutated by the late @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Beta in the summer flu season of December 2020 in South Africa . All the vaccines getting emergency use authorization ( EUA 's ) by 2020 were already out of date for the circulating variants . The boosters that came beyond May 2021 were containing the same mRNA to the Wuhan strain until the current bivalent boosters -- which still target the original ( extinct mild Wuhan strain ) and the even milder and also extinct Omicron from Dec 2021 . <p> Almost all of the in-vivo studies looking at vaccine and booster efficacy initially looked at antibody levels after the injection or booster , besides this parameter telling us nothing about infection prevention against circulating variants . The results of these studies informed the adoption by major agencies like the FDA and CDC for EUA 's in even less at risk groups and for more boosters . As many countries follow the lead from the FDA/CDC , this informed the adoption by these other agencies of all the flawed recommendations coming from these agencies , including SAHPRA in South Africa . The problem is that these studies failed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explain why with so many billions if not more of antibodies circulating in the bloodstream , people with up to 4 boosters and a recent bivalent booster are still getting infected and infecting others ? If the antibody response was effective , these people should not get infections and should not be vessels of infection , something that even all the major COVID injection pushers had to admit at some point from Bill Gates to Albert Bourla . <p> The original two dose Pfizer vaccine efficacy eventually also dwindled to less than 12% -- placebo should be 30% effective . Subsequent studies have only been playing a game of " musical chairs " , with your last booster ( delayed by a period convenient to the manufacturer dictating who is boosted or not ) which once more serves to only exaggerate the efficacy of subsequent injections while downplaying adverse events . <p> It has now become common knowledge that none of these injections are safe , something NOBODY should have declared as fact in 2020/2021 -- yet it was the mantra of almost every politician on earth ! Nobody can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what that means . When it comes to adverse events , the problem becomes the noise signal of minor events which underlie major events . A headache or blurring of vision for an unknown therapy where a mechanism for that symptom is unknown , should never be dismissed as minor when it is known that some people eventually have central vein thrombosis ( and strokes ) and some die suddenly in their sleep with no autopsy proof of what caused the death . <p> The same applies to cases of myocarditis experienced by teenagers and mostly young men . What presents clinically is a tip of an iceberg for what is in the community . Worst so for underdeveloped nations with poor access to specialist cardiology care and hospital screening for such problems like in SA . To mandate such therapies when one can not ensure proper follow up and support of those affected , is not only unethical in terms of the tenets of the Helsinki Declaration , but is outright criminal in terms of the Nuremberg Code of 1947 . Yet we had university professors from top medical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a narrative that sought to mandate , force and deny human rights to individuals for an experimental product backed by huge funding and lobbying even at the highest echelons of government . This they did without allowing diverse voices to weigh in for a balanced judgement and outcome . <h> How I was forced to be " **25;1541;TOOLONG " <p> I have been called an anti-vaxxer by top university professors ( almost uniformly on Big Tech payrolls ) from the time I asked questions about these vaccines before Delta in 2021 , and have ever since been thrown into the bin of conspiracy theorists and tin-hat wearing anti-science individuals . I initially tried to deny the " anti-vaxxer " label as derogatory and unfounded as I was a person that appreciated how limited respiratory virus vaccines were before COVID-19 , but had taken a flu vaccine and convinced all our hospital staff to do the same in May/June 2020 so that we would not confuse COVID with the regular flu . I have taken all my other recommended childhood vaccines ( obviously not by choice ) and all other recommended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became apparent though that this term was only useful for shutting down debate and gaslighting those who had valid concerns and requiring clarification before taking an uncertain experimental product . <p> COVID-19 injections are not vaccines irrespective of the manipulated change in definition made by the WHO . They are novel therapeutics with still as yet no proven evidence of efficacy but with serious debilitating side effects for some people . They have predictably not ended the pandemic in the most highly vaccinated countries in over two years of availability and in some comities mandatory requirement . The more worrying concern raised by Geert van den Bossche to the WHO in March 2021 was the dangers of massive vaccination in the midst of a raging pandemic with regards of immune pressure and mutations . Even the WSJ recently published an article asking if this was indeed what we were observing with the recent major outbreak in China and the emergence of the recent XBB strain and other variants driving waves of infection in the US . <p> The high rates of excess mortalities in highly vaccinated countries that are not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the contribution of these injections into this phenomenon . Lockdowns definitely could have a contribution considering the warnings the likes of the Great Barrington Declaration made around the collateral damage of such measures for a respiratory virus . But there 's an undeniable and often-talked about increase in sudden deaths that coincided with the major vaccine drives in almost every country and perpetuated by frequent boosting in the developed nations . Sudden deaths in the young are at an all-time high , insurance claims and payouts for significant debilitation and death not related to COVID infection are at an all-time where they are documented in developed nations . In South Africa , Discovery , the biggest insurer and medical funder has alluded to a similar picture for 2021/22 for their members when COVID was at it 's mildest in South Africa <p> What South Africa 's data should be teaching the world <p> It is unfortunate that data these days is a tool used to manipulate the direction of narratives depending on who is paying for it . From the early days of lockdowns , modellers had to align @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Predicting the worst outcomes and advising more stringent regulations was the bread and butter of modellers . It kept them in the game , and all they had to do subsequently was collaborating with other desperate/greedy scientists seeking relevance or funding to publish supportive narratives of the success of the initial model and how many lives have been saved even with weak proof . The journals and mainstream media publications where all of this information is propagated without question , abrogated their role as independent promulgators of messages and information when they decided to align and not allow contradictory views . They saw themselves as defenders of a funded narrative as they themselves received funding if they aligned with what was considered a stance of the WHO , government and captured top scientists , irrespective of the clear conflicts of interest each of those organisations and individuals had . <p> South Africa has a contingency of the best Grade A scientists in the world , we have a reputable base of world class researchers studying a majority of vulnerable people who either do n't know their rights or are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Like many developing nations including India and other parts of Africa , we provide the best in human experiments for Big Tech companies . If things go awry , they will not have to pay as much compensation as they would have to pay in their home countries . Yet , with the deliberate direction and obfuscation of compromising data , these countries can produce the best data supporting safety and efficacy of these products . <p> With all our top scientists , there is an anomaly as to why no major scientist would venture to analyse and publish a hypothesis on mainstream media explaining why since Dec 2021 with dwindling COVID-19 vaccination , South Africa has been seeing a significant decline in COVID-related admissions and deaths ? Booster uptake for the single dose J&amp;J and double-dose Pfizer vaccines declined to &lt;6% by the Omicron wave of Dec 2021 . With some people still due for their first booster , and some on their second/third and probably due for a bivalent booster , the rate of uptake is probably close to &lt;1% . With this low uptake of vaccines and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an increase in COVID deaths .

Re-adapting to office life will be a challenge for some as a lot has happened since the pandemic outbreak . Image : 123RF <p> Many companies have been summoning their employees back to the office after spending most of the past two years working remotely or in a hybrid environment . Understandably , there is some reluctance to make this shift , as working remotely has changed many people 's lives , giving them more flexibility to spend time with family while saving money on fuel or daycare costs . <p> So why should employees come back to the office ? Because there really is no substitute for face-to-face personal interactions in business , particularly in Africa . As people return , it will become increasingly important to reintegrate them through training and upskilling to equip them to make the most of the transition into a post-Covid business world . <p> Employees are resistant to return , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say they are likely to look for a new job if their employer required them to work exclusively on-site . <p> Coming back to the office is not just for the benefit of employers -- there are benefits for employees too . Reconnecting with team members fulfils one of the most important basic human needs -- the need for socialisation . In the office , people feel more connected to each other and the company culture . It is challenging to facilitate collaboration and boost employee satisfaction when some people are in the office , while others are still working from home . <p> Being physically in the office provides a critical opportunity for networking , forming connections and engaging with others in the company . It 's tough for entry-level employees to feel welcomed into the office culture if remote work continues . Even with video meetings , socialisation still suffers . Furthermore , having people physically present exposes them to informal learning opportunities , which helps to facilitate individual skills transfer and growth . <p> We learn better when we are working and interacting with others and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Workers also have the opportunity to be more visible to leadership , something that is much harder to achieve working remotely . All of this contributes to an individual 's ability to advance their career prospects . Working from home might be more attractive in the short term , but how will this contribute to a five- or 10-year career plan ? <p> Physically working together also helps people to feel more in tune with what 's happening in the business , while giving them access to a better workspace set-up . Whether it 's better connectivity or physical resources , a return can also facilitate a better balance between work and personal life . It improves general well-being , as getting dressed and having in-person conversations can help support mental and physical welfare . <p> So how can businesses facilitate the return ? It all boils down to fairness . Whether a company chooses a continued hybrid model or a full-time return , it is essential that employees consider it to be fair . <p> It must be negotiated with employees , and they must be given the chance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right kind of leadership is also essential . Leadership is the glue that holds everything together , and with the right training and skills development , leaders can get their people re-energised and feeling positive about returning . <p> Specific training to equip leaders with the right skills to facilitate the return is essential . Navigating issues of fairness and helping people to deal with the challenges of daily work life will not be easy . There is no one-size-fits-all approach that will ensure that the chosen working model is successful . <p> This makes it critical to ensure that leaders have the necessary tools to treat their people with the empathy and grace required to ensure that productivity can be achieved , along with sufficient levels of employee engagement and satisfaction .

@@96628231 <h> Chris Pratt Should Play Booster Gold In James Gunn 's DCU <p> Now that James Gunn is almost done working at Marvel , everyone is wondering who will appear in his and Peter Safran 's DCU . He has mentioned that he would be more than open to working with his cast from Guardians of the Galaxy again , so fans have been making some suggestions for who they think the cast will play . One of the top suggestions is for fans wanting to see Chris Pratt as Booster Gold in the DCU . <h> Chris Pratt As Booster Gold <p> When Gunn first took over as co-CEO of DC Studios alongside his co-head Safran , he had asked fans what characters they 'd like to see most in their new DC Universe . Surprisingly , one of the most significant responses was that fans wanted to see Booster Gold finally remerging into mainstream movies . Gunn said that the question was just out of personal interest and that the answer did n't mean that fans would see anything specific in the franchise . Gunn and Safran have planned the DCU based on what will make the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they want to see next . <p> Since fans responded that they wanted to see Booster Gold , they have wondered who would best play the charismatic but tortured DCU character . Chris Pratt would be the perfect fit . He is charismatic and funny , and James Gunn will probably cast him in a future project in the DCU anyway , so why not someone fun like Booster Gold ? Fans like @CaptainRipstar and @Roderick57493571 say they would love to see Chris Prat playing " the great Booster Gold . " <p> At the same time , many fans do n't agree . Booster Gold is a college comic student who is too young for Pratt to play . He is a fun-loving guy , so he could probably pull it off , but why would they put effort into making him look much younger when they could hire a younger actor ? Fans have had some harsh things to say in response to the suggestion . " in what f***ing world is Chris pratt good as booster gold ? Chris lost all the charisma he ever had as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kiara ( @flxshallens ) , Jan 18 , 2023 . " Anyone that says Chris Pratt should be Booster Gold , does n't understand the character . Also , Chris Pratt is too old . Booster is college age . " -- Mike ( @boostermike1 ) , Jan 18 , 2023 . <h> Booster Gold In The DCU <p> Booster Gold first appeared in comics in Booster Gold #1 in February 1986 and has even stood as part of the Justice League . He is a time-travelling football star and usually comes off as a glory-seeking showboat from the future . In addition , he has often staged high-publicity heroic events through his knowledge of history and futuristic technology . Still , when it comes down to it , he is a lovable character who has been through terrible ordeals . <p> He has previously appeared in live-action in the form of TV series like Smallville and DC 's Arrowverse series Legends of Tomorrow . However , Chris Pratt is a few years younger than Eric Martsolf , who played Booster Gold in Smallville , and a few years older @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ season of Legends of Tomorrow , so perhaps age does n't have to be the feature that prevents him from appearing as Booster Gold in the DCU . <h> James Gunn 's Guardians of the Galaxy <p> James Gunn taking over the DCU marks his end in working with Marvel , as he will be exclusively writing and directing for DC in the future . This means that Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 3. ends the trilogy , and he will no longer be making any movies with them . This is unfortunate as he has come to love the cast , but he has already mentioned that he will " probably " work with them again , suggesting he has plans to offer them roles in upcoming DCU movies . They are busy finishing the film , which is set to appear in theatres on the 5th of May , 2023 . Making the film seemed to be a bittersweet moment for Gunn . " It 's a big movie , and it 's so different from the special because the special is so wacky and insane . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real joy to make it , " he shared . <p> He has no doubts that he will be working with the Guardians of the Galaxy cast again . Of course , we will have to wait and see what they will be cast in , but fans think that Chris Prat would make an awesome Booster Gold . <h> Chris Pratt Might Move To The DC Universe As James Gunn Has <p> James Gunn has become one of the two CEOs of DC Studios . He and Peter Safran are working together to bring the DC Universe to life , so he wo n't be working on non-DCU projects anymore . Unfortunately for fans of Guardians of the Galaxy , the upcoming Vol. 3 will be the last instalment of the trilogy under Gunn as the director . Luckily , he seems keen to work on future projects with the cast . <p> James Gunn has mentioned that he might work with Chris Pratt and other members of the cast of Guardians of the Galaxy again in the DC Universe . During a conversation with Empire , Gunn spoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an era . This marks the end for him working with the cosmic heroes he has come to adore , both the characters and the cast . <p> He emphasised just how important the cast has become to him and that he would always be open to working with them in the future . " This cast is like my family . I can not tell you how close I am to Chris Pratt and Pom Klementieff and Dave Bautista and Zoe Saldana and Karen Gillan . But I also know I will work again with all those people individually again . Probably at my other job . " <p> This is not a massive shock concerning Zoe Saldana and Dave Bautista . The two have recently talked about the pressure they feel in being part of an enormous franchise like the MCU , and both have expressed interest in leaving . Does this mean they would want to lock themselves into another big franchise ? Only time will tell . <p> Does this mean we will see the Guardians of the Galaxy cast in the DCU ? <h> James @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep Gunn busy for the next several years . If reports are accurate , at the very least , his and Safran 's plans cover the next ten years . This means that if Gunn gets the chance , he could cast some of the Guardians in the projects he is working on . <p> Gunn has always had a reputation for finding a good team and sticking with them , so it is n't surprising that he would want to work with them again . Coming to love his cast , their incredible chemistry together would be a reliable tool to carry over and help establish the freshly hatched DCU . <h> Does This Mean The Guardians Will Die ? <p> While there have been some pretty significant spoilers about deaths in the forthcoming movie . The cast and Gunn revealed that they have filmed several death scenes with different characters to throw the press off and to prevent spoilers . However , it does n't necessarily mean that the character has to die . <p> Although we have always seen the Marvel Cinematic Univers and the DC Universe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be a character in both universes simultaneously . So maybe there will be a death or two in the movie , and it 's definitely the death of the trilogy under James Gunn as director . This does n't guarantee that everyone has to die . <p> Only time will tell for much of what has been discussed in this article . Still , until then , we can look forward to watching and enjoying the end of an era in May this year when Guardians of the Galaxy Vol.3 comes out in the cinema . 
@@96628233 <p> Jon Snow 's ending in Game of Thrones season 8 left many fans feeling unsatisfied . Although he may have gotten off easy after murdering the new queen , it was still thought unfair that he did not get a chance to sit on the Iron Throne . But recent events have suggested that this may not have been the last fans will get to see of the beloved character . In fact , HBO has confirmed that Jon Snow would be receiving his own Game of Thrones spin-off under the working title ' Snow ' . But considering the finality in his ending from the main show , what will the spin-off series be about ? And better yet , when can fans expect it to be released ? <p> Much debate and rumours have been circulating on the internet concerning the Snow tv series . Some fans are unhappy about this , while others are ecstatic at the prospect of Kit Harrington 's return . But the most important questions that fans have been asking are what the show will be about , who will return to the cast and when it will be released . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without further ado . <h> When is the release date and who is the cast ? <p> So far , you may be disappointed to find out that not much has been confirmed for the show . It would seem that a lot of details have either been kept under wraps quite nicely or is still in discussion . No premiere date has been released , not even an estimation of when fans can expect the show to hit their screens . Furthermore , there have yet to be any confirmed cast members outside of Kit Harrington as Jon Snow . <p> There has been a lot of speculation , however , that actors/actresses such as Gwendoline Christie ( Brienne of Tarth ) and Kristofer Hivju ( Tormund Giantsbane ) might be reprising their roles . In addition , it would make sense that fans would at least see Tormund again , considering Jon would be beyond the Wall with the Wildlings . And finally , in June 2022 , George R. R. Martin confirmed that the official title for the show would be Snow . <h> What will the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ premise of the show was Kit Harrington 's idea , it came as no surprise that many people were eager to corner the actor for some information . At a panel during a recent Game of Thrones convention in LA , Harrington told Entertainment Weekly what he thought Jon Snow 's mindset was at the end of Game of Thrones . Unfortunately , this was as much information as the actor was willing to share . <p> He explains that Jon must have felt that he got off easy after murdering Daenerys . Harrington further explained that Jon was expecting to be beheaded while awaiting his fate in the cell at the end of season 8 . He did not expect to get out of that one and did not want to either . Jon was done , and the fact that he got to go beyond the Wall was a great gift and a curse . The actor further explained : <p> " He 's got ta go back up to the place with all this history and live out his life thinking about how he killed Dany , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his arms , and live out his life thinking about how he hung Olly , and live out his life thinking about all of this trauma , and that , that 's interesting . " <p> Based on this explanation , it can be expected that Jon Snow would have to deal with a lot of trauma and come to terms with it . And it would make sense that this would act as motivation for him to end up in Westeros once again , South of the Wall . Most importantly , though , fans are hoping to see more of Ghost and Jon 's bond .

And with it came some new faces that fans had not seen before , with higher stakes . The Tournament of Power introduced some of the most powerful characters in the Dragon Ball universe . Not only that , but it breathed new life into old characters who appeared in their strongest form . And while there were many characters with extremely high-power levels , fans are curious as to whom the strongest fighters were in the anime series . So , that leaves the question : Who is the strongest in Dragon Ball Super ? <p> Without further ado , here are the ten strongest characters in the Dragon Ball Super universe . <h> 10 . Android 17 <p> As the final warrior left in the Tournament of Power , he managed to win the competition for Universe 6 . Not only was this due to his intelligent strategy skills , but also his increased power level upon his return to the series . He has reached a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> 9 . Top <p> As the leader of Pride Troopers from Universe 11 , he may not be as strong as Jiren but does come in at a close second . This is because of his hakai ability , which basically allows him to destroy anything in a manner similar to Beerus . Although his powers are not fully developed , he is being groomed to become a God of Destruction . <h> 8 . Frieza <p> If Frieza had trained more , he would be much higher on this list . However , the fact that he made it into the list speaks volumes about his strength . His Golden form , which he achieved after just three months of training , is basically on par with Super Saiyan Blue . The only reason he lost to Goku and Vegeta was due to him being too hasty to use his newfound powers and not honing his abilities . <h> 7 . Goku <p> Goku has repeatedly proved that he is Earth 's mightiest hero in the series . He has managed to unlock two new forms within Dragon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ultra Instinct technique . The latter earns him his spot on the list of strongest characters for the series . Even gods within the series struggle to perfect the UI technique . <h> 6 . Vegeta <p> At the end of Dragon Ball Super , Vegeta is stronger than Goku due to his Super Saiyan Blue Evolved form . Although he can not unlock Ultra Instinct , he still manages to unlock a form that allows him to surpass Goku 's Super Saiyan Blue form . During the Tournament of Power , he easily cuts through Top 's hakai blast using his Super Saiyan Blue Evolved form . His ability to resist hakai is a testament to his overall power levels . <h> 5 . Broly <p> Broly has earned his spot in the top five due to his endless energy bank . Simply put : the more he fights , the stronger he gets . In fact , the only way Goku and Vegeta could beat him was by fusing . Luckily for Broly , Cheelai wished him back to Vampa . Having been born a prodigy , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his son , Prince Vegeta . And this is while he was still a baby . In addition , he has a rare Saiyan gene that allows him to transform into the Legendary Super Saiyan . His only weakness is the fact that he is mentally unstable , which could lead to his downfall . This could be attributed to his father raising him as a weapon in Paragus ' quest for revenge . <h> 4 . Jiren <p> As someone who vowed never to lose again following the trauma he suffered as a child , he does an outstanding job in the Tournament of Power . He was unmatched in the tournament , with Universe 6 having to go to extremes to get him out of the competition . Even though he technically was defeated , no one could go head-to-head with him and reign victorious . <h> 3 . Beerus <p> As a God of Destruction , it only makes sense that he would be this high up on the list . Unlike Top , he has mastered his hakai ability , proving him to be one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not many other characters are stronger than him outside of his trainer and guardian , Whis . And although other Gods of Destruction can be found throughout the twelve universes in Dragon Ball , Beerus has proved himself to be the strongest . <p> He also has unlocked the Ultra Instinct technique , and even though he has not mastered Autonomous UI , it is still quite impressive . On top of that , he is over 200 million years old and has been training for all that time . And if you compare how strong Goku became after training in the hyperbolic time chamber for four years , imagine the level Beerus has reached after that long . <h> 2 . Whis <p> With God-like abilities , Whis easily takes the number two spot . He proves to be incredibly strong with his Autonomous Ultra Instinct making him invincible . Even though fans have seen him up against Goku and Vegeta , he barely broke a sweat . This means that there is no way of gauging just how strong he is . Having trained Beerus as his Guardian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is further proven when he knocks Beerus out in one chop following the Destroyer eating wasabi and disintegrating planets . <p> In addition to this , he can rewind time and resurrect the dead .

This is an impressive array of abilities for someone who is only an angel . <h> 1 . Grand Zeno <p> He is not a fighter , but he is basically God in the Dragon Ball universe . Again , he is another character where their exact power level is yet to be revealed and will likely never be revealed . However , if he can destroy and create planets at will , then he is much stronger than any other of the characters in this list .

The funniest thing about the tweet is that James Gunn himself liked the tweet . <p> James Gunn is a very active creator on social media , often interacting with his fans in various ways , answering questions , and giving little teasers here and there on what will be happening in the new DCU . A Reddit user , MysticShogun , asked other users , " James Gunn liked this tweet . Maybe we will be getting trunks ? " There were a lot of mixed opinions in the comments of this Reddit post , some thinking that it does mean we will be getting trunks for the new suit . Others think that if we got everything James Gunn liked on Twitter , the DCU would be a complete mess , which I agree with . Can we get a makeover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> Superman 's Suit in Live Action <p> In the comics , and in Superman ( 1978 ) , Superman II ( 1980 ) , Superman III ( 1983 ) , Superman IV : The Quest for Peace ( 1987 ) and Superman Returns ( 2006 ) , Superman always had his little red undies on the outside of his suit . However , it was n't until Man of Steel ( 2013 ) that DC decided to do away with the red undies but kept the red boots and cape . So whenever we next saw Henry Cavill 's suit , it remained the same as the original from the 2013 movie . <p> Superman &amp; Lois , The CW series in the Arrowverse , went the same route , deciding to leave the red undies as a thing of the past . We might not get trunks for the next Superman suit . Still , DC might continue on this trend of not having anything odd happening around the nether region , which is still an absolute win in my book . Has DC decided to do away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ James Gunn Starts Poll on Twitter Regarding Superman Trunks <p> James Gunn recently sparked a lively debate on social media , asking his followers their opinion on the iconic Superman look .

Early results were clear -- most were in favour of trunks when it comes to Superman 's costume .

With so many great movies to choose from , we thought it would be best if you got to decide which one of them reigns supreme over the others -- and take a look at the legendary kung fu film stars who made them . <p> After all , kung fu movies have inspired modern action movies in so many ways . We owe tropes like the dying master , bare hands fights , the final showdown , the prodigal son , former pupils seeking vengeance and dance-like fight choreography to the genre . In recent years , you ca n't find action films at the box office that are n't inspired by the martial arts genre . <p> In this list , we present a list of 11 awesome kung fu movies -- the best martial arts movies of all time . <h> 11 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Killer ) <p> Widely considered to be one of the most influential movies of the Chinese martial arts film genre , it is credited with setting up the blueprint for the popular training for the revenge storyline of the kung fu genre . The story follows Liu , a young boy , who witnesses a brutal attack carried out by the Manchu government . In order to seek revenge , he flees to the Shaolin temple and acquires extensive training in kung fu . Despite its modest budget , The 36th Chamber of Shaolin , a Shaw Brothers kung fu movie , was highly acclaimed and is regarded as a landmark of the genre . <h> 10 . Shaolin Temple ( 1982 ) <p> At first glance , 1982 's Shaolin Temple ( starring Jet Li , Hai Yu , Chenghui Yu , and Lan Ding ) might look just like any other kung fu movie ever , but the truth is much more fascinating than it seems . You see , Shaolin Temple signalled a monumental point in the history of kung fu and wuxia films . The movie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ China : up until then , they were all mostly filmed in Hong Kong . It was also responsible for introducing worldwide audiences to the Shaolin monastery -- not to mention that it featured Jet Li 's acting debut . <p> Shaolin Temple is told in an episodic structure , with the first half of the movie being a mix of comedy and martial arts . When adjusted for inflation , this classic film could also be considered one of the most commercially successful films ever made in China . <h> 9 . Once Upon a Time in China ( 1991 ) <p> Set in the late 19th century , Once Upon a Time in China stars Jet Li as Wong Fei-hung : a Cantonese martial arts master and folk hero that 's been the star of multiple kung fu films over the years . This particular chapter in Wong Fei-hung 's story deals with the martial artist fighting against invading forces in Hong Kong and Macau . <p> This is the first in a series of highly-successful kung fu films that are all absolutely worth watching . If you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , definitely go for the 1991 one . Once Upon a Time in China also stars Rosamund Kwan , Jacky Cheung , Shi-Kwan Yen and Yuen Biao . <h> 8 . The Big Boss ( 1971 ) <p> 1971 's The Big Boss features Bruce Lee 's first major role in a feature film , marking a clear before and after for kung fu movies . It also helped cement the popularity of martial arts films all over the world , with the movie grossing a staggering $300 million against a measly $100,000 budget ( both sums adjusted for inflation ) . <p> Despite its popularity , The Big Boss ( starring James Tien , Maria Yi , Marilyn Bautista , and Ying-Chieh Han ) faced some stern opposition from the censors in the 70s . Some of the most iconic -- and positively violent -- shots had to be cut for international releases . Due to this , some scenes are considered lost media , even today . <h> 7 . Drunken Master ( 1978 ) <p> One of the very first attempts at mixing elements of physical comedy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( one of the biggest action stars of the 90s ) at his very best . This movie popularized the " drunken fist " kung fu style -- a technique that aims to imitate the erratic and unpredictable movements of an intoxicated person . <p> The movie is yet another one featuring the legendary Wong Fei-hung , only this time it 's Jackie Chan playing the part . Drunken Master ( starring Siu-Tin Yuen , Jeong-lee Hwang , Dean Shek , Yuen Woo-ping and Kau Lam ) focuses on a very young Fei-hung -- one that constantly gets into all sorts of zany situations . <p> True to every other Jackie Chan film , the martial artist does all of his own stunts in the movie ( no special effects needed ) , and he almost lost an eye when filming the final fight scene . <p> Drunken Master was followed by a series of films , including The Legend of Drunken Master ( 1994 ) and Drunken Master III . <h> 6 . Ip Man ( 2008 ) <p> The most modern kung fu film in our list deals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of kung fu : Ip Man . Born in 1893 , Ip Man ( starring Donnie Yen , Simon Yam , Siu-Wong Fan , Sammo Hung , Ka-Tung Lam and Lynn Xiong ) was one of the most revered Wing Chun masters in Hong Kong . He 's also responsible for teaching Wing Chun to a young Hong Kong martial artist called Bruce Lee . Yes , that Bruce Lee . <p> Ip Man is the first movie in a series of quasi-biographical films about Ip Man 's life . This one deals with a very young Ip Man during the Sino-Japanese war . With little money and cruelly crestfallen , the young master must do whatever he can to survive the harsh reality of an occupied Foshan. <h> 5 . Ong-Bak : Muay Thai Warrior ( 2003 ) <p> An exhilarating action flick that puts the brutal aggressiveness of Muay Thai on full display , Ong Bak : Muay Thai Warrior is a relentless tour de force of martial arts cinema . Starring Tony Jaa as Ting , this movie serves as the introduction of the character in what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the film starts innocently enough : the head of a village 's religious statue is stolen , leading Ting on a quest to retrieve the sacred artefact . Recovering the idol 's head wo n't be easy though , and the Muay Thai fighter will have to face some of the most menacing criminals in the city if he hopes to succeed . <p> The action scenes are epic ! <h> 4 . Kung Fu Hustle ( 2004 ) <p> Do n't let the zany comedy of Kung Fu Hustle ( starring Stephen Chow , Wah Yuen , Qiu Yuen , Siu-Lung Leung , and Xiaogang Feng ) deceive you : under its cartoony exterior lies an amazing kung fu film with some of the most talented choreographers in the martial arts industry . <p> Directed by and starring Stephen Chow , Kung Fu Hustle is one of the finest examples of kung fu comedy done right -- yes , it 's even better than Kung Pow : Enter the Fist , somehow . The nearly nonsensical plot is set in 1940 's Shanghai and involves a fearsome criminal gang @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be the reincarnation of Buddha . <p> Not only is it one of the best martial arts films of all time , but , thanks to its slapstick comedy , it 's also a really funny movie . <h> 3 . Fist of Legend ( 1994 ) <p> If you 've never watched a proper kung fu film before , then 1994 's Fist of Legend could be a great starting point . The movie ( starring Jet Li , starring Siu-Ho Chin , Billy Chow , Yasuaki Kurata and Shinobu Nakayama ) follows the usual " quest for revenge " plot that so many martial arts films seem to be so enamoured with : a young martial artist returns to his homeland , only to find that his master has been killed . What follows is an explosive warpath against the Japanese that killed Chen Zhen 's master and are now occupying his beloved Shanghai . <p> The Wachowskis were particularly impressed by the action sequences in Fist of Legend . In fact , they 've gone on record mentioning this film as one of their main inspirations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <h> 2 . Enter the Dragon ( 1973 ) <p> It 's not easy to find a good kung fu film that also includes some elements of espionage thrillers in its plot . Fortunately for fans of both martial arts and James Bond , Enter the Dragon ( starring Bruce Lee , John Saxon , Jim Kelly , Robert Wall , Kien Shih , Bolo Yeung , and Angela Mao ) has some of the best of both worlds . The plot follows a secret agent as he infiltrates a top-secret martial arts tournament organized by a fearsome opium lord . <p> Revered as one of the most iconic films in Bruce Lee 's career , Enter the Dragon exposed a larger audience ( especially American audiences ) to the exciting world of kung fu . It also features an uncredited appearance by Jackie Chan -- one of the firsts in his stuntman 's career . <p> Putting a new and serious spin on classic kung fu films , Enter the Dragon is easily one of the best martial arts movies ever . <h> 1 . Crouching Tiger , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ middle of the cultural zeitgeist that came with the Matrix trilogy , Crouching Tiger , Hidden Dragon ( starring Michelle Yeoh , Chow Yun-Fat , and Zhang Ziyi ) gave audiences all over the world a renewed appreciation for the stylish action of the wuxia genre . Though the movie focuses more on the serene choreography of kung fu rather than the more violent aspects of physical confrontation , there are still tons of gratuitous and satisfying scenes to be found in this Ang Lee film . <p> The film is an epic tale of a Chinese warrior that steals a famed sword and has to escape to uncharted frontiers to evade his pursuers . Many of the now-typical aspects of wuxia films could be traced back to the style of Crouching Tiger , Hidden Dragon . The slow-mo fighting sequences and some stunts that made it seem like the actors were flying were highly inspirational for movies like Kill Bill and , more recently , Marvel 's Shang Chi and The Legend of the Ten Rings . <p> Ask anyone , Crouching Tiger , Hidden Dragon is one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Honourable Mentions <p> Of course you ca n't mention the best kung fu movies of all time without talking about a few other standouts like The Karate Kid , Keanu Reeves ' John Wick and The Matrix , Quentin Tarantino 's Kill Bill ( inspired by Shaw Brothers films ) , Rush Hour , Way of the Dragon ( featuring the iconic Bruce Lee vs Chuck Norris fight ) , Five Deadly Venoms ( 1978 ) , Police Story ( 1985 ) , Jean-Claude Van Damme 's Bloodsport , The Raid ( Iko Uwais ) , One-Armed Swordsman , Shaolin Prince ( starring Gordon Liu ) , Curse of the Golden Flower , House of Flying Daggers and Master of the Flying Guillotine . <h> What is considered the best kung fu movie ? <p> The winner of four Academy Awards and a worldwide critique favourite , Crouching Tiger , Hidden Dragon is widely regarded as one of the best kung fu movies ever made . Directed by Ang Lee and starring Michelle Yeoh , Chow Yun-Fat , and Zhang Ziyi , it celebrates the elegant acrobatics and stunning fight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plenty of intense confrontations . It 's a must-watch for anyone interested in martial arts films and is widely considered the greatest martial arts film of all time . <h> Who is the no. 1 kung fu master ? <p> Bruce Lee is undoubtedly the most renowned kung fu master in film history . His extraordinarily convincing acting and captivating writing , directing , and fight choreography skills all contributed to his tremendous success . Even after his death , the legacy of Bruce Lee lives on in modern martial arts films . 
@@96720237 <h> The 7 Worst Game Bugs And Glitches Of All Time <p> There is nothing worse than playing a new game and enjoying yourself when suddenly there are some awful bugs and glitches . It does n't matter how much love and effort game developers have put into making their games unforgettable . As soon as bugs break the game , a good game becomes a bad one . Unfortunately , some video games have unforgivable issues that you ca n't get past , and suddenly the entire game becomes defined by the fact that it is horribly glitchy . Here are some of the worst video game glitches and bugs in the gaming world . <h> 1 . Pok ? mon Bug <p> With a series that has been running for as long as Pokemon , it is understandable that they would have some of the worst glitches around . One of the most famous glitches in the Pok ? mon games was the Missingno bug back in Pokemon Red and Blue . This bug was easily encountered during gameplay . <p> When found , the Misingno sometimes took the shape of the ghost players found in Lavender @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pixelated and weird-looking mess in the form of a backwards L. Catching a Missingno would corrupt your Hall of Fame data , and multiply whatever was in your bag 's sixth item , whether it be master balls or anything else stored in your inventory . This bug could also corrupt your save file and lose you hours of gameplay . So there 's that . <h> 2 . Legend of Zelda Glitch <p> Nintendo is n't winning on this front . Still , at least the bugs have been mostly relegated to video game history and do n't seem to be following them into their modern games and the Nintendo Switch . One terrible glitch that The Legend of Zelda : Link 's Awakening players had to deal with was what they named the Doghouse Glitch . <p> This one is from a while back , seeing a release date back in 1993 , but the game still seems to be well-loved . The Doghouse Glitch can happen any time in the game , sometimes first thing after killing at least one monster . To encounter it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the front door ( it must be the house with the dog chained outside ) .

The only way to leave is to lose all your saved data and reset your Game Boy or die . <h> 3 . Pool of Radiance : Ruins of Myth Drannor Bug <p> This particular game is one of the most glitchy games out there . It had the power to break other games . A nifty bug exists in the game 's code that removes several system files when the game is uninstalled . This game could even break your Windows files . An update containing a later patch fixed the problem , but the damage was done . <h> 4 . Assassin 's Creed Unity Bugs <p> Where to start ?

Bethesda is notorious for its bugs , some of which they will just leave in the game and hopes that their modders will eventually fix . Like the Esbern bug in Elder Scrolls V : Skyrim . The Crooked Head Man glitch was an issue that plagued players right from the start of Fallout : New Vegas . It was so consistent that many players thought it was intentional . <p> Players would start the game with their player character face to face with Doc Mitchell , whose head would just begin spinning around without any care in the world . It was contagious because some players reported that other NPCs would start doing the same . <h> 6 .

Games having numerous issues will always be a problem , and it 's , unfortunately , the main game that usually suffers . Luckily , many of these bugs existed in the early days of gaming . In modern times , game developers have found ways to fix these issues and keep their players having a fun experience . 
@@96720239 <h> The Top 10 Worst PlayStation 4 Games <p> There is little doubt that the PlayStation 4 will be remembered as one of the best consoles of all time . This is thanks , in part , to Sony 's great marketing but also mostly due to all the great games that were released on the console . However , for every great game on the PlayStation 4 , there was an equally bad one that fans would prefer to forget . Let 's look at the worst PlayStation 4 games and why they were considered so bad . <h> 10 . Drawn to Death <p> When it was first announced that the mind behind the original God of War , David Jaffe , would be working on an online multiplayer brawler , many fans were left equally intrigued and confused . <p> Drawn to Death turned out to be a misstep for Jaffe as the game 's unique visual style felt more like a gimmick to draw fans in , but once they actually started playing the game , they realised that there just was n't that much to it . Although the game should be given props @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up for the shallow gameplay. <h> 9 . The Order : 1886 <p> A game I personally really wanted to love , The Order : 1886 , was one of the Playstation 4 's most disappointing launch titles . There is little doubt that the game showcased just how great the visuals on the console could look like , but great visuals do n't necessarily equate to a great game . The jaw-dropping graphics and interesting lore could n't hide the lacklustre gameplay . <p> This , along with the fact that you could finish The Order : 1886 in under 5 hours , made the game more of a " wait for a discount " than a " buy on launch day " title . <h> 8 . Godzilla <p> How could a game featuring giant monsters ever be bad ? Well , Godzilla on the PlayStation 4 set out to prove just that . It was more of a disappointment than just a bad game . The critics absolutely destroyed it . Not only did Godzilla look like it was made for the PlayStation 3 , but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The fact that the game suffered from repetitive mission structures did n't help either and , in the end , not even the King of Monsters could save the game from being one of the worst PlayStation 4 games . <h> 7 . Hardware : Rivals <p> I have many fond memories of playing Twisted Metal on my PS1 . The awesome vehicles , along with the over-the-top destruction , instantly made the game a classic . Hardware : Rivals took the same vehicular combat and bought it to the PlayStation 4 . It 's one of those games that is fun the first few times you play it , but soon you begin to realise that it is just too shallow . Hardware : Rivals did n't offer enough to keep players engaged . <p> The game is n't offensively bad . It 's just dull and offers nothing that will keep fans coming back . <h> 6 . Basement Crawl <p> Inspired by games like Bomberman , Basement Crawl had fans excited when it was initially revealed . But , like most games on this list , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the game suffered from a slew of technical glitches . The worst part is that the game ended up being frustrating to play . <p> Basement Crawl was such a train wreck that even the developer promised to remake the game . It 's easily one of the worst games on the PlayStation 4. <h> 5 . Knack <p> Okay , so I might get some flak for this , as there are many hardcore Knack fans out there , but Knack never lived up to its lofty goals . The game was dull , focusing on pummeling enemy after enemy in basic combat . It felt like a title that would have benefitted from some more development time . In the end , the game just felt disappointingly boring . <p> Sure , the world in which the game took place was interesting , and the visuals were great , but the lack of any exciting gameplay elements let fans down . Knack deserves a place on a list of the worst PlayStation 4 games . <h> 4 . The Quiet Man <p> One of those " it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Quiet Man was a confusing mess . <p> Players take on the role of a deaf protagonist -- meaning that the whole game takes place in awkward silence . While playing a deaf protagonist was an innovative idea , it 's the way in which it was implemented that took a game that showed potential and turned it into an almost unplayable confusing mess . The combat is basic , the story feels disjointed , the acting is bad , and the game falls short of all its goals . <p> In the end , the only reason one should play The Quiet Man is just to enjoy the awkward acting . <h> 3 . Bravo Team <p> A PSVR title , Bravo Team is a game that tried to cash in on the popularity of the Call of Duty franchise by adding VR . The game has a general lack of quality , from the uninspiring visuals to the fact that many of the mechanics just felt outdated . As a tech demo that shows what the PSVR is caple of , Bravo Team would 've been fine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just feels like a cash grab . Everything about it screams boring , even when playing in VR . <p> Bravo Team is definitely one of the worst PlayStation 4 PSVR games . <h> 2 . Dawn of Fear <p> A survival horror game in the same vein as the original Resident Evil , Dawn of Fear tried to bring the classic style of game to the PlayStation 4 . Unfortunately , it failed miserably . <p> It has all the ingredients , from shooting zombies to fixed camera angles and even the odd puzzle to solve . However , even with all this going for it , Dawn of Fear had many immersion-breaking bugs that took away from the enjoyment . <p> You 'll be excused for playing the game with a smile instead of terror on your face as you laugh at the numerous glitches . Although it did show a lot of potential , it needed a lot more development time . <h> 1 . Life of Black Tiger <p> Unanimously hated by everyone who has ever had the misfortune to play the game , Life of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the PlayStation 4 . <p> The game puts you in the furry paws of the titular Black Tiger . Your job is to complete various objectives . It 's an ugly , unresponsive , broken game that should never have seen the light of day .

When you listen to most of the campaign managers of most of the political parties , you hear them propagating false information to discredit their opponent . This can influence public opinion negatively . This is not good . <p> I also dislike the way campaigners turn each other into adversaries . Looking at the three major political parties contesting the presidential election , emphasis has been placed on the candidates and not the issues at stake or what they will do if elected . An example of the threatening way they speak is a state party chairman who said his party would win by " hook or crook " . Another said voters who failed to vote for his party would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the general populace is another " dislike .

I 'm talking about how political office holders use their offices to satisfy personal needs at the expense of those who voted them into office . Why should they wait till the election period before making basic social services available to the people ? It is sad that we only see people getting welfare packages at election time . <p> Another unfortunate aspect of electoral campaigns in Nigeria is that people tend to look to politicians to solve all their problems . Politicians have consistently abused this dependency to cajole people for support . We see this in the distribution of food and clothing at campaign rallies . Sometimes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about ideologies , as most of our political parties have no ideology to sell .

They have been organising debates and discussions in various forms . <p> Social media are useful and influential too -- they make it cheaper to reach more people and create awareness . They also help construct communities , which is valuable for minorities . <p> The media serve to inform people about what the candidates and parties are planning . And they act as a watchdog . The media are doing their best to inform the populace and they are giving each candidate an opportunity to present themselves to the public . <p> Another positive aspect of election campaigns is that they are opportunities for politicians to reach out to remote areas they would not have reached ordinarily . This opens up opportunities for the poor to engage with politicians . <p> I also like the fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system . People are more aware of the different choices available to them . In the current election season , people are queuing to obtain their voter 's cards , and engaging with campaigns . I have n't seen this level of awareness before -- it 's commendable . <p> Even in areas where some parties are not strong , they are campaigning . Politicians are not leaving anything to chance . This has increased awareness and given voters more options . <p> Another thing I like is that citizens have greater access to politicians . There have been debates , town hall meetings , rallies and roadshows allowing citizens to interact more with candidates . <h> What needs work <p> I think a sense of cultural heritage ought to be reintegrated into our beliefs , values and political activities . <p> The use of social media can be positive or negative . The idea of it becoming the voice of the people is good . But technology has also been used to create and circulate misinformation . I have seen many video clips being circulated that carry negative information @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ candidate whose speech was twisted . A BBC investigation has discovered that political parties are secretly paying social media influencers to spread disinformation about their opponents ahead of the elections . <p> It 's sometimes hard to know what is correct information and what is false . This can lead to poor decision making . Campaigning on social media can also be a dirty game in which politicians deliberately make each other look bad . <p> Too much of the campaigning so far has been more like hate speech and irrelevant talk , devoid of real political issues . It should rather be constructive , sharing ideas about how to fix and improve the country .

Shock horror ! <p> It tells us failure of leadership makes distrust the default position , and that restoring trust is key to societal stability . <p> Distrust in government leaders was undoubtedly impacted by the prolonged lockdowns and the draconian state of disaster that was introduced during the COVID-19 pandemic . <p> This was compounded by apparently irrational decisions like bans on tobacco , cooked chicken and certain clothing like open toed shoes and capri pants . But on a more fundamental level , it was also the result of soldiers patrolling the streets , deaths of citizens , and the curtailing of certain freedoms . <p> The bypassing of tender processes and the widespread corruption by Covidpreneurs further entrenched the public 's belief that the state of disaster created an environment for looting and a failure of checks and balances . <p> It is against this backdrop that there has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to deal with the load shedding crisis . <p> In early December last year , the courts ordered Minister of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs Dr Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma to release the record of decisions that led to the issuing of several regulations during the lockdown , including the extension of the state of disaster . <p> Non-profit organisation Sakeliga fought the government on various issues , including the lockdown and the mask mandate , amongst others . <p> There are other court judgments that found decisions made by government were indeed rational . But in the court of public opinion , that is a different story . <p> This is what the Justice Ministry 's Spokesperson tweeted on the matter : <p> In his addresses to the country during the lockdown , President Cyril Ramaphosa regularly referred to a social contract between government and the people that was required to fight the pandemic . <p> It is this precise social compact that is essential to the imposition of a state of disaster . <p> If the public does n't trust you , it ai n't going to work . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is crippling the economy . The knock-on effects are devastating . Government is also under immense pressure to solve the crisis . The ANC in particular needs to present solutions before the country goes to the polls next year . <p> The response to a state of disaster to deal with load shedding have been mixed . <p> It does allow government to free up funds for emergency procurements , and gives government access to more financial resources in a quicker time period to help cushion the situation . <p> But there are very serious concerns too . <p> We are at a very dangerous point in our democracy if we use a state of disaster for governance issues and failures . <p> In my opinion , it is a grand gesture to stem the criticism that government has failed to act . It is a band aid to create the impression that there is urgency . <p> Prof Dewald van Niekerk from North West University argues that the Disaster Management Act is not the correct law to be used in this instance , which is a self-imposed crisis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The legislation is there to deal with a once-off event like a natural disaster , not a long-term crisis like load shedding . <p> Concerns go beyond just the access to the coffers . <p> It is also the centralisation of decision making and the scant oversight . Government is essentially bypassing existing legislation . <p> The ANC is pushing for the state of disaster to be introduced . <p> The party 's spokesperson Mahlengi Bhengu told me on The Midday Report this week that the ANC is acknowledging a crisis and a ' sense of crisis ' , and they ca n't wait any longer to use the instrument of the Disaster Management Act . <p> The impression is that this was a problem created by a previous ANC government and the new leadership elected at Nasrec in December has to take extreme measures to solve it .

The electricity supply gap dates back to recommendations in the 1998 White Paper on energy , which stated that new procurement decisions be in place by 1999 . <p> The government delayed that move and it was only in 2007 that the decision was taken to build Medupi and Kusile .

An inquisitive mind is occasionally rewarded with fun side activities , such as stacking rock cairns or collectible archery targets to hit , but mostly you 'll be guided down a funneled path . This narrow approach naturally works well in VR , even if some of the inherent exploration that Horizon normally offers is lost . <h> If you suffer from any level of vertigo , this may not be the game for you . <p> There are two movement options @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that moves you around when holding two buttons and imitating a walking motion with your arms , and a more traditional analog stick-based system . After trying both I opted for the former for most of my playthrough , despite both coming with their pros and cons . At first , the gesture system did n't strike me as overly intuitive , but once I got to grips with it I preferred it simply because it made me feel far less nauseous when playing for long stretches ( by which I mean about 30 minutes ) . I did , however , find myself switching to the analog sticks whenever entering combat , as the dodge mechanics associated with this moveset ( a flick of the right stick ) made for a much easier time . Everyone 's mileage on this will obviously vary based on your VR tolerances , so I 'd recommend trying out both to see which suits you best . <p> Now 's the time to say that if you suffer from any level of vertigo , this may not be the game for you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here I did start to feel a little queasy when looking down at some of the ludicrous distances I could fall from . There are quite a few opportunities for potential plummets as well , thanks to the sheer amount of climbing you 're asked to do . Climbing cliffs . Climbing vines . Climbing ice walls . Climbing rock faces by lodging dual pickaxes into them . Almost so much climbing that you may find yourself wanting to climb the walls of your house as well . <p> Now , I was n't naive enough to think that a game called " Call of the Mountain " would n't involve some climbing , but I was taken somewhat off guard when I found that it really is the majority of what you 'll be doing here , especially in the early hours . Climbing is n't overly challenging , but honestly reaching for handhold after handhold gets quite dull after you 've scaled your third or fourth outcrop . It does get slightly more interesting once tools such as the grappling Grabcaster are introduced , and the immersion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the excellent music swells as you reach the next peak is undeniable . Although some ascents offer slightly more excitement than others , I can honestly say I never found climbing to be consistently fun . It 's frustrating then , that it dominates much of what you 'll be doing in Call of the Mountain , in particular when compared to its much less frequent but infinitely more exciting combat sections . <h> What We Said About the PlayStation VR 2 <p> The PlayStation VR2 may seem pricey , given that it costs $150 more than the base PS5 Digital Edition console you 'll need to use it . Even so , it 's such a quantum leap over the original PSVR in terms of ease of use , visual quality , and immersion that any PlayStation owner who loves VR should upgrade as soon as possible . Its 4K HDR OLED screen and excellently tactile Sense controllers are the most obvious improvement , but plentiful quality-of-life changes and the raw horsepower of the PS5 set a new standard for how VR games should play and feel on console @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , its thin launch lineup makes its lack of backward compatibility with original PSVR games a significant problem , but one that will only improve as Sony and other developers roll out new games that take advantage of the PSVR2 's unique features . -- Gabriel Moss , Feburary 16 , 2023 <h> Score : 9 <p> Largely taking place in mini arenas , these gladiatorial battles against all manner of unfriendly machine are often the highlight of each mission . It 's where the immersion of it all really beds in as you briefly forget what era of Earth you 're living in and the rhythm of combat takes hold . Armed with the signature Horizon weapon of a bow and arrow , you 'll quickly find yourself aiming for enemy weak points using the PS VR2 's impressive eyeball tracking tech , and then quick-dodging out of the way of flying melee attacks before ducking and weaving your head out of the way of projectiles . <p> It 's a set of combat options that gradually builds over time as well , as new ammo types are introduced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , naturally more firepower is needed , and with it the levels of excitement to find increase -- a thrilling fight against a colossal Thunderjaw being a particular highlight . Preparing yourself for encounters becomes increasingly more important as you build all sorts of elemental arrows in a pleasing crafting system that lets you manually attach arrowheads , explosives , and flights , thus further creating a tangible connection to the world . <p> More gratifying than crafting arrows though is , of course , firing them -- and in this regard Call of the Mountain has really nailed it . Now , my real-world archery experience may only stretch as far as giving it a go when 11 years old on a school trip , but in my expert opinion this feels pretty damn good . There 's a real pleasing " ping " to the way each arrow flies off of the bowstring and haptic feedback tickles your palm , and then an even greater thrill as it slams into whatever is unfortunate enough to be in its way and sets them aflame thanks to explosive Blaze . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watch sparks fly and machine parts fall off as the fundamentally brilliant Horizon combat successfully makes its way into the virtual reality space . <p> It 's a highly satisfying cadence that works really well in VR thanks to its enthralling but never overwhelming speed , but is also forgiving if you happen to get blindsided by a roaming Scrapper , for example . If you do manage to take some damage you can find a pocket of peace amongst the mayhem by going for a snack break and refilling your health bar by munching on some fruit . A health bar is smartly located on one of your hands ( much like we saw in Half-Life : Alyx ) meaning it 's never more than a quick glance away , like checking the time on a watch , and always in view when aiming down sights . All in all , the interface of Call of the Mountain is very cleverly implemented , making it feel like a tangible part of your character and not a series of distracting floating boxes that threaten to take you out of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes its way into the virtual reality space . <p> Puzzles also pop up here and there and , again , serve as a welcome break from climbing . Did I mention there 's a lot of climbing ? The problems are sometimes fun but never overly difficult , and once the novelty of actually physically picking up gears and slotting them into position myself wore out they became yet another minor obstacle on the way to the next combat encounter or story moment . <p> That story is serviceable , but one that is definitely engineered in order to facilitate big moments and fun cameos rather than tell a layered tale itself the way the previous two Horizons have . Here you play as Ryas rather than Aloy -- he 's a Shadow Carja rebel who must complete a series of tasks in order to atone for his crimes . His internal monologues are mercifully limited in a smart maneuver that allows you to experience this world first-hand yourself and not be distracted by voices in your head . <p> Naturally , things escalate as the plot thickens , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engaging than the first thanks to the action increasing in both quality and quantity . A personal highlight is the aforementioned Thunderjaw cat and mouse section , which conjures up memories of Jurassic Park at its rousing best . There are a few little nods scattered throughout for big Horizon fans to find of value here -- familiar faces like Aloy drop in to say hello -- but do n't necessarily come in expecting a dense new chapter in this universe 's lore . <p> Outside the main story you 're free to explore your small home base , take a closer look at artifacts collected on your expeditions , and chat with friends made along the way . It 's also home to the pleasant safari mode : a largely tranquil alternative version of the opening boat cruise which shows off a selection of the Horizon bestiary in its natural habitat . It 's short , sweet , and a reflection of the Disneyland-like nature of Call of the Mountain as a whole -- an impressive technical showcase for PS VR2 which uses the inherent wonders of the Horizon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> The Verdict <p> Horizon Call of the Mountain 's exciting highs elevate it just enough above its often monotonous climbing mechanics to create a fun first blockbuster-scale entry into the PS VR2 library . Through intuitive design , awesome spectacle , and gripping combat , Horizon 's first step into virtual reality is one packed with exciting encounters that its slower stretches may sometimes detract from , but never threaten to derail completely . It 's an enjoyable , if not essential , chapter of the Horizon story . 
@@97015240 <h> PlayStation VR 2 - Review <h> A quantum leap in console VR gaming . <p> It 's a thrill when we get to say this about a new piece of gaming hardware : The PlayStation VR 2 is a true generational leap that makes the old one look like a piece of junk . It 's not exactly cheap , but for $549.99 you get a high-end headset with a 4K , HDR-enabled OLED screen , a 110-degree field of view , built-in tracking cameras , and eye tracking , plus two of its slick Sense controllers with the excellent adaptive triggers and haptic feedback Sony introduced with the PlayStation 5 's DualSense controller . The catch is that it requires you to be connected to a PS5 by a single USB-C cable , but that means it 's much , much more powerful when it comes to delivering fantastic graphics than a self-contained headset like the Meta Quest 2 . With all of that , including a few features you do n't see on even more expensive PC VR headsets like Valve 's Index and HP 's Reverb G2 , the PlayStation VR2 has vaulted console VR @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ available games . <h> PlayStation VR2 -- Design and Features <p> The PlayStation VR2 is an immediate improvement over its predecessor in every way , but the physical design is actually pretty similar . Like its forebear , it 's got a clean black-and-white look that matches your PS5 , and it 's built around an adjustable head strap that 's separated from the VR display itself , which does a great job of comfortably accommodating a wide range of head shapes and lets the weight of the screen rest on the top of your head rather than on your face . The one-stop adjustment mechanism on the back of the head strap remains an excellent way to dial in a perfect fit . <p> It 's nice to see the PS VR2 has a slider on the top-left side of the lens casing to quickly adjust the headset 's interpupillary distance , or IPD , and it 's especially neat that the internal camera quickly measures the distance between your eyes during setup . Other than that Sony has kept the headset itself simple , with just two buttons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turns the headset on and off , and the other instantly activates passthrough mode , letting you see the real world around you in black and white without taking off the headset . This is great if you need to adjust your controllers or greet someone who 's entered your play area . That said , it 's slightly disappointing there are no physical buttons to adjust the volume . <h> Sony has kept the headset itself simple . <p> Everything else about the PS VR2 feels like a quantum leap over any other headset in its price class -- save for the HP Reverb G2 which , up until now , has offered a level of fidelity only accessible to PC gamers . This is no longer the case , and the PlayStation VR2 is now the most affordable way to play PC-quality VR games at 4K resolution . Unlike the Reverb G2 , however , the PS VR2 's display uses two HDR-enabled 2,000 x 2,040 per-eye OLED panels that operate at up to 120 Hz and offer a 110-degree FOV , rather than the G2 's slightly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out at 90 Hz and a 98-degree FOV without any support for HDR . As a result , the PlayStation VR2 displays a picture that is smoother , richer , and deeper than anything else on the market today -- save for , perhaps , the Meta Quest Pro which costs three times as much . <h> PlayStation VR2 -- Setup and Controllers <p> Compared to the original PSVR , setup is a breeze . Instead of a whole bunch of cables and an HDMI switcher that was an absolute chore to deal with -- to say nothing of the tracking camera -- the PS VR2 has a single 4.5m USB-C cable you plug into your PS5 , and ... you 're done ! After that you 'll need to install a firmware update and then quickly calibrate your controllers , eye tracking , and lens spacing , and the four tracking cameras will capture a scan of your room . It 's extremely cool to see it accurately map out the geometry of a room -- and everything in it , including furniture , pets , and even the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a play area , the PS VR2 's guardian walls rise out of the ground , clearly marking which parts of your room are safe to walk around in . <p> It 's easy to recalibrate or adjust your settings at any point from the main PlayStation 5 settings menu , and anyone familiar with the PS5 's control center wo n't have a problem seamlessly navigating between the VR experience and the PS5 's main menu . Still , it 's neat that someone can stand outside of the PS VR2 headset and direct the experience remotely using a DualSense controller . This can make setup way simpler if you 're trying to show off the PS VR2 to someone who does n't usually spend time in VR or is n't familiar with the PS5 's interface . <h> What We Said About the Original PlayStation VR <p> Sony has managed to make its lower-priced PlayStation VR headset competitive where it counts . Despite its relatively low resolution it looks very good in games , and the headset is comfortable to wear and easy to use after you 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ controllers it provides good but sometimes flakey motion tracking on your hands , but the PlayStation Camera 's limited viewing angle is a weakness , and so is its inability to see behind you . Should you run out and buy one ? That depends . The technology is astonishing but still in its infancy , and VR games that rival current console blockbusters are a long way off , so it wo n't be as immediately useful as you might expect for a $400 to $500 price . However , it 's a lot of fun to be on the forefront of something as exciting as VR . Some of the best times I 've had with my VR headsets are from wowing people who come over and try it for the first time , and that never gets old . -- Dan Stapleton , October 5 , 2016 <h> Score : 8.5 <p> If you 've only ever used the PSVR 's Move controllers , the moment you grab onto the included pair of Sense controllers is a revelation . The layout of their clicky face buttons and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room-scale VR in the last several years , but they step things up with the addition of haptic feedback and adaptive triggers . The analog sticks are half the size of the DualSense 's , but remain tactile , allowing almost the same degree of precision as a D-Pad when playing a game of Tetris Effect : Connected , which is notoriously difficult to play on the Quest 2 's default Touch controllers . Each button also features capacitive touch that can tell if your fingers are on it or not , which allows you to make reasonably accurate gestures with your hands . It 's not quite as sophisticated as the finger tracking on the Valve Index controllers , though , so you 're limited to specific gestures like giving a thumbs up or pointing with your index finger . <p> In games like Horizon Call of the Mountain and Star Wars : Tales from the Galaxy 's Edge , you can feel the power of drawing a virtual bowstring or shooting a virtual blaster through the resistance of the adaptive triggers . Haptic feedback improves this effect by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vibrations . This can be felt in everything from smashing a large shipping container with your Godzilla-sized tentacles in Tentacular to tackling an opponent in 2MD : VR Football Unleashed -- but it 's at its most impressive when producing subtle but accurate vibrations for calmer interactions , such as gliding your paddle against the flow of water in Kayak VR Mirage , where you can almost feel the resistance of the water through the Sense controller 's haptic vibrations . <h> You can feel the power of drawing a virtual bowstring or shooting a virtual blaster . <p> Of course , just like with the DualSense , battery life is a concern here : with all that vibrating and resisting , a full charge only lasts around four to five hours . That 's a long time for a session of VR gaming , but the fact that you ca n't swap out batteries for a fresh pair means you might get cut short if you forget to plug them in . Likewise , the Sense controllers ' ring design may take some getting used to -- it can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go by touch , which adds a little hassle to the joy of introducing someone new to VR . But they 're comfortable to hold once you get a grip . <h> PlayStation VR2 -- Gaming Performance <p> In contrast to the OLED panel included in the original PSVR , the PS VR2 's 4K HDR OLED panel offers richer colors and up to a 120Hz refresh rate , making even less visually detailed games come to life . The screen door effect was never an issue with the PSVR , and it is n't here either , but with proper IPD calibration , you can now tactically eliminate glare as well . The fact that you 're encompassed by 110 degrees of scenery at all times makes VR all the more lifelike . That 's 10 degrees wider than the original PSVR , and it 's a significant difference in how much of the world around you is visible . It 's still a bit like wearing a SCUBA mask , but it 's a bigger , less-claustrophobic SCUBA mask . Simply put , the PS VR2 is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ range . <p> The PS VR2 's access to the PS5 's graphical horsepower allows its games to have vast draw distances , much like their flatscreen counterparts , and there 's no better demonstration of this than in Horizon Call of the Mountain . You can see fully simulated mechanical creatures running around across the map , contrasted against cascading waterfalls and picturesque mountaintops reflecting light in the distance . Similarly , Cities VR : Enhanced Edition allows you to build urban sprawls that truly come alive from a distance -- and now you can see all of it , all at once . <h> The PS VR2 has a fancy new trick called foveated rendering . <p> On top of that , the PS VR2 has a fancy new trick called foveated rendering , which means its built-in IR camera tracks the movement of your eyes and uses that information to improve efficiency .

For example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Star Wars : Tales from the Galaxy 's Edge both generate haptic vibrations that pulse through the headset , coinciding with the distance , position , and intensity of the sounds they produce . It can bring the cinematic details out of sound design in games that implement it skillfully , but you really want proper 3D audio on top of the haptics in order to get the full experience , which means the disappointing packed-in earbuds do n't cut it quite as well as something like Sony 's own Pulse 3D wireless headphones . <h> The disappointing packed-in earbuds do n't cut it quite as well as something like Sony 's own Pulse 3D wireless headphones . <p> Unfortunately , you 're out of luck if you 're hoping any of this will work with your existing PSVR game catalog .

You can not erase the past , and the fact is that South African rugby players and cricketers were capped by national organisations that were members of the International Rugby Football Board ( now World Rugby ) and the Imperial Cricket Conference ( now International Cricket Council ) .

The economy has gained 1.6-million jobs since the depths of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020 when it lost 2-million jobs , so we are still behind -- and that is despite an unexpectedly strong bounce-back in the economy over the past two years . <p> Even more disturbing is the dramatic contrast between the number of adult South Africans who have jobs of any kind and those who depend on the state for income . <p> There are 15.9-million people in employment , according to Stats SA . There are also more than 26-million people on social grants , according to the Treasury . That includes more than 18-million people on old-age pensions , child support and disability grants , most of whom can not work . But the rest are able-bodied adults on the social relief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work . <p> This is not sustainable fiscally -- and as things stand , the social relief of distress grant is due to end in March 2024 . But it is also unsustainable for a society if so many adults , particularly young adults , can not find work . It can only do deep damage to the social fabric and it is implicated in the endemic criminal activity that is eroding infrastructure and service delivery , as well as driving social unrest . <p> The government 's priority should be to get those people into the ranks of employed people as quickly as possible . Instead , it is putting a Band-Aid on the problem with the presidential employment stimulus and other temporary measures . However worthwhile these might be , and however much they might do to improve young people 's chances of getting jobs -- if there were any -- they are no substitute for getting the economy to grow and create sustainable jobs . <p> With the economy expected to slow sharply this year and over the next few years , mainly because of Eskom and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Nor are the detailed breakdowns in the latest figures reassuring . It is unclear why domestic employment jumped so much in the fourth quarter or whether it is sustainable . <p> Nor is it clear why agricultural employment and informal sector employment declined . These are labour-intensive sectors that should be carefully watched and nurtured . Organised agriculture has rightly expressed disappointment at the latest figures and the government needs to work with the sector to turn the trend around . <p> Equally , the Western Cape provincial government 's delighted response to the strong jobs trend in that province is worth noting , given that the province has gained 330,000 jobs over the past year , an increase of almost 14% . It demonstrates that enabling and attracting investment , and taking steps to boost growth , do pay dividends in terms of job creation . <p> Higher growth will mean more jobs -- if the government could just do what is so urgently needed to boost the economy .

@@97505239 <h> No clarity yet on land donation to Unisa <h> Alternate suggestions for the Unisa facility include Ugu Sports and Leisure or the Port Shepstone Techno Hub . <p> 16 hours ago <p> Precious Gumede 3 minutes read <p> The site of ERF1216 demarcated in red . <p> With the closing date for public participation on the donation of land to the University of South Africa ( Unisa ) by Ray Nkonyeni Municipality ( RNM ) last Friday ( 10th ) , the community feels that a lot needs to be clarified on the project . <p> ERF 1216 in Uvongo was identified as the ideal spot to build a Unisa facility , however a portion of it comprises Douglas Mitchell Sports Club 's mini soccer pitch . <p> The site for the Unisa facility ( ERF1216 ) in Uvongo , adjacent to the fields at Douglas Mitchell Sports Club . <p> According to RNM spokesperson Simon April , despite the site being in a residential area , it is zoned for education . <p> Many residents have suggested that the municipality identifies alternate land or use existing buildings to house the institution . <p> The suggestions included Ugu @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opposite Southcoast Mall in Izotsha , which many believe has become a white elephant . <p> The Port Shepstone Techno Hub in Izotsha , which residents feel should house the Unisa facility . <p> April said the municipality is dealing with the matter of the identified land ( ERF 1216 ) and is unable to comment on the suggestions . " The notion that the Techno Hub is a white elephant lacks factuality as it is currently being used , " said April . <p> According to Uvongo Ratepayers ' Association 's , Brendan Cluley , there is no issue with an educational facility in the area , however RNM needs to involve the community , giving a clear picture of exactly what they intend to build . <p> " I agree that an institution is needed on the South Coast , however living in a democratic society , the rights of students along those of residents should be considered too . I do n't think the location is a viable option , considering other options in the area . <p> " As long as the university will serve the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be held . Perhaps the municipality should extend the deadline , get more community involved , find out from environmental committees on the impact it may have on the area , " he added . <p> Cluley said that generally an educational institution does add more value to an area as property values go up , however he feels that residents are fearing the unknown . <p> " If we have more input and understanding on the long term benefits , we would base our decisions on what 's right , " concluded Cluley . <p> Unisa spokesperson , Tommy Huma said in the South Coast region , Unisa student numbers vary from 3000 to 5000 , which is a rough estimate <p> " Since this is the only place that will be available to students on the South Coast , instead of students travelling by taxis to the Durban campus , they will utilise this place for registrations and their studies . " <p> He said the Wild Coast office was closed and currently there is no centre or campus on the South Coast . <p> Meanwhile , councillor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sports and Leisure was also identified by the chairperson of the ANC , Siboniso Duma to be converted into a university . <p> Ward 19 councillor , George Henderson ( left ) with Uvongo Ratepayers ' Association 's member and resident , Brendan Cluley point to the proposed site adjacent to the sports fields at Douglas Mitchell Sports Club . <p> He said it should be turned into an ocean or technology university and is perfect to pair with a Unisa facility . <p> " From a logistics point it would work better . Considering the infrastructure in Uvongo which has small roads and is not built for heavy traffic , a university will mean more traffic , " explained Henderson . <p> He said as far as the plans go , Unisa wants to build a hall , a library , admin offices , and rooms for students to sit and study . <p> Henderson said even though it would not be something big , looking at the land itself , it 's an open piece of land . <p> " A few years ago the sports club wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ site was being opened up they brought in a bulldozer and it disappeared in the mud . It took three weeks to remove it as the site is a wetland . <p> " Ecologically that is the reason the area is not developed as it would be expensive to build here . I feel that they should consider other available options , " he added . <p> Furthermore the sports club has a lease for ERF 1215 and 1216 . <p> " The lease agreement was signed in August 2020 and runs for nine years and eleven months until July 2030 , and I do n't know how the municipality will get around that . <p> " It boggles the mind that RNM is disregarding this existing lease in its attempt to donate it to Unisa .

Both the financial cost to the victim ( estimated to be around ? 6 000 per burglary ) and the emotional toll highlight the need for evidence-based interventions and crime prevention strategies . <p> The study aims to assess the effectiveness of using a virtual environment ( VE ) to understand the role of collaborative decision-making in target selection and the search of a property .

So , it 's important to consider not only the individual thoughts of those who offend , but also the role that peers play in influencing decision-making . <p> " More research in this area will have positive implications for crime prevention initiatives and the rehabilitation of offenders . " <p> Iris van Sintemaartensdijk from the University of Twente , says : " This research aims to extend our understanding of how others can influence offence-related behaviour by focusing on interactions in and around the scene of the crime .

It consists of a residential property that has been created to replicate a typical target for burglary . <p> Student participants will be briefed on the burglary task and will be required to work together to complete the virtual burglary in such a way as to obtain a realistic ' haul ' of goods , and to avoid detection . They will be asked to communicate with their partner during the task to assist with the successful completion of the burglary . <p> The use of virtual reality will allow for participants to respond naturally to cues presented in the environment , allowing for observation of behaviour and interactions in real-time .

These companies look for partners whose relationships can be leveraged to gain market share by providing solutions that their partners can use to extend their offering portfolio to customers . <p> By joining a partnership programme , companies can work with a partner development manager to differentiate their offerings and build quicker go-to-market and co-selling strategies . By partnering with a reputable and well-established vendor , companies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and some vendors offer mechanisms for partners to obtain tools or funding . These platforms can often be used by partners to market their various solutions and grow their market share and enable business deals to be concluded jointly . <p> Access to skills and technology <p> For example , joining the partnership programme of an organisation that is a global leader in providing omnichannel customer engagement solutions for businesses , would provide companies with access to a team of experts with vast experience in the omnichannel space and enable them to implement these solutions for their clients in the different regions where the business operates . <p> When choosing a partnership , organisations should ideally look for a partner that is keen on driving business growth jointly with the vendor . Aside from partnering with companies in the technology space , many technology vendors typically also seek to partner with consulting and services firms , business-to-business start-ups and telecommunication companies , alongside , enterprises with extensive experience in the niche communication spaces that are willing to offer the vendor 's solutions to their clients . <p> Companies must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ streams and lead to product integration .

This will enable the partnership to offer solutions that best address their clients ' needs and ensure that clients get maximum value from the collaboration . <p> Product integration <p> Partnerships can also lead to product integration , with the vendor typically integrating its solutions by white labelling offerings , while a partner can offer the vendor 's solutions with its product stack , essentially extending their product suite . <p> Strategic partnerships can position businesses to leverage the expertise and backing of a bigger partner or multinational vendor that typically provides a full suite of professional services that companies can utilise for the implementation of solutions for their customers . <p> Additionally , partnerships can also facilitate revenue growth , as collaborating with a vendor ensures that partners are fully supported , while providing best of breed solutions to the market , and also benefiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's business . Other revenue drivers include a joint marketing development plan that will ensure that partnering companies go to market and gain market share jointly . <p> Joining a partnership programme can be hugely beneficial to companies , especially during times of economic uncertainty .

The firm said that understanding the customer has become a critical touchpoint at a time of intense economic complexity . <p> McKinsey spoke to senior leaders about data and analytics and discovered that these technologies have the potential to disrupt but are complex to achieve at scale . And Forrester predicted that for 2023 , data and analytics teams are in for ' a wild ride ' . All three are correct -- data and analytics are in for a wild ride as three key trends emerge in 2023 . <p> Trend 01 : data security <p> Yes , everyone knows about security . It 's as complex and layered a problem as loadshedding with just as many criminals involved . Data security is n't something that should be looked at in isolation . <p> In 2023 , organisations have to consider security from multiple perspectives across the touchpoints of people , infrastructure , networks , applications , databases and the general environment . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the business environment is aligned with critical security frameworks and protocols . <p> Companies should also focus on understanding their security posture , utilising security frameworks bolstered by international standards of best practice , developing policies and control frameworks and driving awareness campaigns and educating their organisation 's employees on the importance of data security . <p> Ongoing monitoring and management of incidents are critical to ensure companies can be proactive when potential threats are identified or quick to respond when a breach is detected . <p> The classification of data is critical to ensure organisations understand what data is produced , consumed or shared in their organisation or with external parties ; understanding what the sensitivity level of the data is , as well as who is authorised to view or use the data . <p> Companies need to ensure that compliance with policies and regulations is a priority to minimise undue risk to their organisation . Protection has to be embedded at every point along the data chain and so , data security in 2023 has to be centred around 360-degree security . <p> Trend 02 : artificial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about data can be had without its fresh and shiny new companion , AI . This technology has undergone some impressive iterations recently -- the arrival of ChatGPT and its extraordinary growth heralded a new era in man-machine interaction -- and remains a solid counterpoint to the human in managing data volumes and insights . <p> The challenge this year is n't going to be finding an AI solution , but rather finding one that fits the business . AI tools can automate processes and improve efficiencies while reducing risks and costs , but the value is found in AI that 's relevant . The right tools and solutions will augment existing processes and support employees and can be trained to give people more space to perform their roles effectively . <p> The key questions in 2023 are about how these models are trained , the information that they 're using and how to mitigate bias . <p> Companies can fully realise the potential of AI moving forward but they have to do so knowing that these models can absorb the wrong viewpoints and biases that can fundamentally impact the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stories -- the Microsoft chatbot and the Amazon resume selector -- that underscore the importance of implementing an AI that can deliver on the right levels . <p> There are plenty of opportunities and great value that AI can bring to an organisation but understanding where and how to use it is important as this can be used for improved decision-making , identification of opportunities , identification of risk , improving efficiencies , optimising business processes , and improving customer engagement to name a few . <p> Trend 03 : optimised data management <p> Finally , one of the most interesting trends around data in 2023 is how companies are going to approach its optimisation . Moving forward , companies want to see what the data can do for them . How it will fit within their business strategy , and how they plan to fully dig into its potential . <p> These demands are making it important that data is designed around where the organisation is going -- it needs to come with the business and meet its strategic demands . <p> As data becomes increasingly integrated into strategy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There has to always be justification for spend , particularly now as companies and countries face strong economic headwinds , so data , like anything else , is under pressure to prove its ROI . <p> Prioritising the approach to data management and data governance in an organisation provides assurance to an organisation that data is managed as an asset and can provide value and potentially be utilised as a form of revenue generation . <p> As a result , data as a service is rising in popularity , as are data management tools that are designed to support organisations in managing and securing their data while squeezing out every last droplet of value . <p> These three trends , shaped by demand and ROI and risk , will equally shape how data and analytics evolve over the next 12 months . Moving forward companies need to find the right strategies and partners to ensure that data becomes as inherent and integrated a part of the company as the coffee machine . 
@@97746240 <h> Improve remote working by collaborating with employees <p> Mar 24 , 2023 <p> How we work is changing very fast . <p> A recent study conducted among UK businesses suggests that four-day workweeks are not a bad idea . The study discovered that contrary to entrenched concerns of lazy employees and poor delivery , most of the firms involved experienced significant productivity increases and lower stress among their employees . Many participants want to stay on a four-day work week . <p> A shorter work week is n't ideal for every business . But all companies should take a closer look at how they work . The World Economic Forum even predicts that two-fifths of the world 's employees will eventually work remotely . It 's become a norm for people to alternate between the office and elsewhere . <p> But without the proper culture and support , employees can cheat the system , such as using mouse movers and even Lego to fool productivity monitoring software .

" <p> PaySpace has discovered that remote working offers significant advantages and makes it a strategic priority . During this transition , Crous and her management team learned several essential insights . They elevated employee engagement in several ways , working harder to reinforce the company culture , finding ways to make remote employees more human , and even limiting meetings . <p> Collaborate with employees <p> In a remote and hybrid work environment , managers must pay attention and take the initiative to make their people 's professional lives easier . They should talk to their subordinates and give them ways to communicate their concerns . <p> " You have to give employees a platform where they feel secure , where they are honest and open about the things they struggle with in a remote world , " says Crous . " These can be confidential meetings , anonymous surveys , private @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But if you do n't know what your employees are really thinking , and you ca n't see them enough in person to get a real sense of where they are at , you must give them other avenues to confidently share their concerns and opinions about their work lives . <p> " Also invest in tools that recognise excellence -- it 's important people get the credit they deserve , publicly and in person . " <p> To help employees navigate their work , do n't keep them in the dark . Provide clear short term and long-term goals . Doing so will help them plan and make understand how important their role is . But foremost , it shows you trust them . <p> " Once you have communicated the strategy , give employees autonomy to work , " she says . " You do n't want to put stress on a person by not empowering them when they work remotely . So , trust for me is fundamental when you 've got remote teams . You want people to feel safe and not be completely stressed out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boundaries . " <p> Community and culture <p> Most employees enjoy remote work . But some might feel they miss the human connection as they no longer spend as much time face to face with their colleagues . Community is a crucial part of keeping teams cohesive and productive , and it 's important to celebrate employees as humans . <p> While this happens intuitively in physical office environments , the empathic gap created by a remote meeting can be substantial . <p> To counter this , Crous and her team emphasise humanness . " At the office , you do n't have any pets next to your desk . But when you work remotely , there 's a good chance that you 've got a pet around . Allow people to make that part of the activity , to introduce their furry friend to the internal colleagues on the call . <p> " We are all human and working remotely will mean that they are getting to know the human on the other side . It 's not just about work ; we really care about the person . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children on Friday afternoons or talk about exciting hobbies in their lives . Companies can provide spaces to encourage this type of bonding -- PaySpace has started introducing Microsoft Viva Engage , a company-focused social network where employees can join communities and share personal interests . <p> Expressing humanness and joining communities helps reinforce the business culture , which is the glue holding a productive workforce together . The real challenge with remote working is how it can impact culture negatively . <p> The office is not a natural culture source -- it just happens to create culture with less effort . To encourage an effective hybrid workforce , do n't take culture for granted . Reinforce it by providing employees channels to express their concerns and ideas , giving them support and autonomy , and cultivating trust in their abilities . <p> And , if you want a quick start , Crous suggests no-meeting days : " We have declared Fridays as no-meeting days . Honestly , I once thought it would n't work . But it 's been one of the best initiatives we 've implemented . Look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and you 'll get a lot from remote workers . "

Now that the pandemic is fading , this technology remains a vital workforce accelerator . <p> At a recent event hosted by Altron Systems Integration , in partnership with Digicert , tech experts unpacked how businesses can unlock the full potential of digital transformation . The overall sentiment from all speakers was clear : technology does not innovate , people do . <p> Caryn Vos , senior manager at Altron Systems Integration , kick-started the event highlighting the need for digital transformation through partnerships . " Technological advancements have far reaching implications . But we need to understand how the digital transformation can affect different industries , further cementing the importance of partnerships , " Vos said . <p> A tech-first approach leads to failure .

" <p> Speaking to the fourth Industrial Revolution ( 4IR ) and technological disruption , Verd said : " The 4IR is not only about new technologies , new software and new apps -- it is about the birth of a new era which coincides with new ways of thinking , leadership , working and doing business . <h> Future-proof enterprise <p> " When digital transformation is applied to its full potential , the result is a data-driven , agile , customer-centric , future-proof enterprise , " Verd said .

However , if you take care of the culture , then the customer experience and profits will take care of themselves , " she said . <p> Brandon Malambo , platinum client manager at DigiCert , highlighted the importance of digital trust in a world of digital transformation . " Public key infrastructure is the backbone of digital trust for organisations that value cybersecurity resiliency and is what enables us all to have confidence in the multitude of digital connections we make every day , " he said . <p> " With the DigiCert One solution , we provide organisations with automation and integration tools to allow for a more seamless deployment of a robust public key infrastructure , capable of scaling to meet any enterprise use case , while allowing for a user-friendly experience in the adoption of public key infrastructure best security practices . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Verd , technological transformation within organisations is more than just getting new software and it should be approached holistically . " Leaders often make the mistake of jumping on the digital transformation bandwagon , investing in new technologies without first equipping their staff effectively , " she said . " It is necessary to prepare them early and find out and get their feedback on the transition process . This requires leaders who are agile and innovative . It is important for leaders to understand digital systems and processes , even if it means learning from the tech-savvy millennials .

The continued surge in data traffic is largely thanks to a dynamic African Internet community that has embraced the value of peering , the increasing use of data-intensive applications , enterprises continuing to move into the cloud , and ever-increasing demand for video , content and gaming delivery services .

@@97873239 <p> A digital-first business is an ever-changing relationship between an organisation and the technology it harnesses to optimise its processes , people and platforms . It is , as IDC puts it , an " ongoing shift towards digital business models that mark the next era of digital transformation " . <p> Technology is n't just an enabler ( it has already proven its worth as decision-maker and optimiser ) , it 's a critical component of strategic thinking and planning . This is echoed in the IDC Worldwide CEO Survey 2022 where CEOs unpack what it means to do business in a digital-first world -- it means profits , cost savings , operational efficiencies , increased revenue and improved customer experiences . <p> This is echoed in the PwC 26th Annual Global CEO Survey that underscored the value of intelligent and strategic technology investments at a time of deep geopolitical and economic uncertainty .

Picture : THE TIMES <p> SA is a unitary state with strong , albeit complicated , federal features of intergovernmental fiscal relations . This is compounded by the fact that the political system governing this complex dynamic is balanced by a separation of powers , divided into three branches of government : the legislature , executive and judiciary . <p> The legislature , which enacts legislation and holds the executive branch of government accountable for its implementation , must be informed , advised and technically supported to make policy decisions to provide checks and balances . <p> The Financial &amp; Fiscal Commission ( FFC ) is a product of the multiparty constitutional negotiations that led to the 1994 elections . The inequalities and divisions that characterised SA at the time , as well as the inherent uncertainty of political outcomes , led to a unique settlement , an institution that has no precedent anywhere in the world . <p> The commission is one of the constitutional institutions established to guard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fiscal purse with the specific purpose of serving as a guardian of our fledgling democracy and its inherent socioeconomic rights . It was established to limit subjective political decisions regarding the allocation of public financial resources in the spheres of national , provincial and local government . <p> Through its advice and researched evidence , the potential impact of fiscal choices and various proposed policies are scrutinised to ensure these are in the national interest and that provinces and municipalities are able to provide basic services and perform the functions allocated to them . A well-functioning system of inter-governmental fiscal relations and co-operative governance is at the core of our government . The FFC is therefore a key referee in this structure . <p> The commission has an expert technical nature , meaning it must provide expert advice to government on financial and fiscal matters . In this regard it spearheaded the method and formula on how public finances should be divided equitably between local , provincial and national government . Up to this day , before the finance minister tables the national budget he must have considered the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the various committees in parliament with the responsibility to approve the national budget must also seek the advice and recommendations of the commission before they pass the budget .

In the past 29 years the commission has participated credibly in the co-ordination of fiscal policy in SA , through impartial analyses of intergovernmental transfers and recommendations on fiscal efforts to enhance collaboration between spheres of government . <p> What the commission has not fully done in line with its mandate is the proper forecasting and monitoring of fiscal rules . This is important because in SA the policy planning process has been characterised by consistent overestimation of GDP growth in the past 10 years . The national government 's budgets have consistently been overly optimistic regarding GDP growth since 2008/09 , and budget projections have over-estimated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have influenced policy decisions , such as planned expenditures and public and private wage negotiations . <p> Furthermore , emerging market economies such as SA are confronted by distinctive macroeconomic and fiscal management challenges , including vulnerability to external shocks and natural disasters . These challenges require prudent budgeting and forecasting , coupled with fiscal buffers , to be resolved by implementing fiscal rules or other sustainable objectives , thus ensuring that public funds are closely aligned to sustainable and long-term benefits . <p> This underscores the need for the commission to validate macroeconomic and fiscal forecasts and to monitor fiscal rules . Whether through lack of foresight or lack of political will , the commission -- notwithstanding its huge mandate -- has struggled to keep pace with evolving technology and innovative research approaches . Its internal systems are outdated , and its processes are inefficient .

And , as this is likely to be the status quo for at least another two years , short-term solutions no longer suffice . As a result , cloud adoption has increased . <p> Andrew Cruise , MD of Routed , says more and more businesses are opting to leave load shedding issues to the experts . " For most businesses , facilities management and electrical security is not their day job and they 're realising that their time and resources would be better spent elsewhere . Data centre colocation providers are obliged to offer a guarantee of continuous power to their tenants and are able to address power cuts more efficiently than a smaller enterprise 's data centre or server room .

Either way , cloud as an industry will benefit , says Cruise , as workloads inside the data centre are closer to the cloud providers and therefore there will be less friction when moving to the cloud in the future . <p> But it 's certainly not been smooth sailing for the industry , as data centres , which host everything from exchange points to content delivery nodes and websites to cloud-based services , have had to spend millions to generate their own power .

These operators have had a number of cloud outages due to power problems recently , which unfortunately negatively affects the perception of all local cloud operators . " <p> For savvy businesses , the benefits of data back-up and disaster recovery are eclipsing the potential for increased costs at more experienced cloud providers . " If the costs of getting onto the cloud are a barrier to entry , consider the alternative : the losses your business will suffer without continuous access to workloads . When workloads are in the cloud , through reliable providers , you only need internet access to continue business as usual .

And , as Europe is South Africa 's primary market for vehicle exports , this poses a significant risk -- more than 70% of the local industry 's exports last year went to the continent . <p> Although leading vehicle manufacturers such as Mercedes-Benz , Volkswagen , and BMW report to be on track to phase out internal combustion engine ( ICE ) vehicles , for traditional OEMs ( or original equipment manufacturers ) like Ford , GM , Mercedes , or Volkswagen it 's been a real challenge to fundamentally change their way of thinking about producing vehicles . <p> This is according to Mark Lacey , head of resource equities at global asset manager Schroders , who explains that for these manufacturers the supply chain has fundamentally changed . <p> " As a traditional OEM , you now need a supply of rock commodities like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need to figure out the different architecture of moving away from ICE vehicles to an electric vehicle .

Hence the new president 's decision to merge 14 ministries and a return to a 28-member cabinet . <p> The more svelte cabinet was welcomed by all spheres of society and key backers in business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to work -- the " thuma mina " moment . It was an easy win but one that has returned to haunt a president under pressure , who is struggling to get a grip on the electricity crisis the country is facing . <p> The merger of the department of mining and that of energy into the department of mineral resources and energy ( DMRE ) under one of Ramaphosa 's most powerful lieutenants in the party , Gwede Mantashe , has complicated his response to the electricity crisis . <p> With the country in the grip of stages four and six load-shedding , and the real prospect of stage eight in winter , managing the crisis on a policy front has become near impossible with a mining-friendly minister who played a large part in Ramaphosa 's rise to power . <p> However , Ramokgopa 's struggle to be given ministerial powers is understood to have started something of a turf war between him , Mantashe and another ANC heavyweight , Pravin Gordhan , who , as the minister of public enterprises , oversees Eskom . <p> Between them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two fronts : managing policy and the procurement of new generation capacity through the DMRE and , through the department of public enterprises ( DPE ) , stabilising the state power utility . <p> In order to do his job , Ramokgopa needs some of Mantashe 's powers and some of Gordhan 's . A minister of electricity with a mandate to end load-shedding needs the powers in section 46 of the Electricity Regulation Act , according to energy economist Lungile Mashele . The Act gives these powers to the minister of mineral resources and energy . <p> Ramokgopa would also need oversight over Eskom , which lies with the DPE , although , if Ramaphosa 's administration sees through the ANC 's conference resolutions , this could also eventually fall under Mantashe . <p> Section 46 empowers the minister of mineral resources and energy , in consultation with the National Energy Regulator of South Africa ( Nersa ) , to determine new generation capacity and what type of energy sources are needed to ensure an uninterrupted supply of electricity . <p> The section also allows the minister to procure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> In his presentation to the ANC 's national executive committee meeting over the weekend , Ramokgopa recommended , among other things , that preparatory work be undertaken to explore a " mega bid window " or a rolling bid window for electricity procurement . <p> Without any procurement powers , Ramokgopa will have to ask Mantashe 's department to develop a proposal for the mega bid window in order to make it a reality . <p> According to section 97 of the Constitution , the president can transfer any power or function entrusted to a minister to another member of his cabinet . Without these powers , Mashele said , there is no point in having a minister of electricity .

@@98497232 <h> High Court sets aside Nengwekhulu 's 2018 appointment <p> News - Date : 29 April 2023 <p> By Elmon Tshikhudo and Anton van Zyl <p> A longstanding chieftainship feud between the Davhana royal family and the Nengwekhulu royal family was provisionally settled when the Limpopo High Court set aside the status of Nengwekhulu as a senior traditional leader . The issue now needs to be investigated again and a new recommendation needs to be made . <p> The matter was heard in the Thohoyandou High Court and it served before Deputy Judge President MV Semenya . He made his ruling last Tuesday ( 18th ) . <p> The Davhana royal family filed papers in the High Court opposing the Limpopo Premier 's decision in April 2018 to recognise Wilson Mandela Nengwekhulu as a senior traditional leader . Prior to that , they argued , Nengwekhulu was recognised as an independent headman ( mahosi or gota ) and never had the status of chief . <p> At the time , the Premier acted on the advice of the Limpopo Provincial Commission on Traditional Leadership Disputes and Claims . Nengwekhulu filed a claim , stating that he was unfairly demoted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a senior traditional leader in his own right . The commission agreed with him and the Premier subsequently recognised Nengwekhulu as a senior traditional leader . <p> In his ruling , Judge Semenya sketched the background of the case , going back as far as 1864 when the then chief Davhana left the Dzata area after he had lost the battle with his younger brother , Makhado . He moved to the area south of the Levubu River and settled at what is today known as Mpheni village . When Davhana arrived here , several communities under leadership of chiefs such as Masia , Mashau , Tshimbupfe and Nengwekhulu were living in the area . <p> " The disputed facts ... revolve around the question whether , upon their arrival in the area , the Davhanas subjugated the Nengwenkhulus who were occupying the area referred to as Ngwekhulu , and became their chiefs , as claimed by the applicants , or whether the Nengwekhulus lost their status as chiefs and became subjects of the Davhanas in circumstances alluded to in their papers , " said Judge Semenya . <p> When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , prior to 1958 , the two leaders were functioning independently of each other . During the reign of chief Ndavhelesi Nengwekhulu , the apartheid government promoted Davhana to the position of senior traditional leader and relegated chief Nengwekhulu to the status of a headman who was required to serve under Davhana . <p> The commission that was tasked to investigate the claim found that the Nengwekhulu community lived as a separate group and abided by their own customary laws of succession . They had never been dispossessed of their rights to their land and still resided at the same village . Their leaders served as mahosi ( chiefs ) under khosikulu ( king ) Mphephu Ramabulana . <p> The Davhana royal family disputed these findings and criticised the commission for not conducting public hearings and interviewing the elders at Tshirululuni and Mpheni . Their argument is that the Nengwekhulus had always held the position of an independent headman , serving under the Davhanas . <p> As an example , the installation of Nndavheleseni Muofhe William Nengwekhulu in 1942 was cited . The installation was conducted by chief Kingi Davhana @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a headman would install someone as a chief . <p> In their submission to the High Court , the Nengwekhulu royal family stated that they did not object to the fact that Davhana held the position of senior traditional leader . Their objection is that Davhana should not exercise his chieftainship within their area of jurisdiction . Because independent headmen are no longer recognised , they feel that they need to be recognised as having an own chief . <p> Judge Semenya said that the commission that came to the conclusion that Nengwekhulu was a senior traditional leader had made irrational findings . He said the evidence showed that the Nengwekhulus had been independent headmen ( gotas ) as early as 1926 . " The Commission decided on its own to promote the Nengwekhulus to a position they never held , under the pretext of restoration , " he said . <p> The findings of the commission were set aside and the decision by the Premier to appoint Nengwekhulu as senior traditional leader was also set aside .

Then maybe the moment is scored by sweeping violin and thumping cello , before pivoting into a narrator who opens with the line : " Dearest readers . " <p> But there is nothing like that , the 53-year-old actor looks far more modern with barely there makeup and face-framing cornrows , complete with side-hanging beaded braids . <p> Immediately she utters the word " welcome " , it becomes clear that she shares one captivating tool with her onscreen persona , that expressive intonation . Just by opening her mouth she commands attention . Rosheuvel 's voice is her best instrument , with each word she enunciates eloquently delivered , using a combination of perfect rhythm , volume and emphasis . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our chat is her attention to detail .

Picture : DIMAS ARDIAN/BLOOMBERG <p> There are many reasons dedollarisation may be good for the US . A weaker dollar could make US exporters more competitive and encourage localisation . This could improve the US trade balance and lead to smaller government budget deficits . Dedollarisation could even enhance the country 's political cohesion as rural states regain their manufacturing competitiveness . As such , the US may be one of the biggest beneficiaries of a more diversified global currency system . <p> While the strength of the dollar resulting from its use as the world 's dominant trade and reserve currency is usually considered an extraordinary privilege , in many ways a strong dollar may be less of a blessing than a curse . As explained by the Triffin dilemma , the US is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ countries . This external demand for the dollar has produced large twin deficits and fomented increased socioeconomic divisions . <p> The US has been running persistent trade deficits since 1976 , after abandoning the gold standard in 1971 . During the 1970s , the dollar lost one-third of its value , which drove up the cost of imports and produced a trade deficit . Then , in the 1980s , the price of oil declined , and the dollar recouped its losses , but this made imports from Asia cheaper than domestically produced goods and led to the trade deficit becoming entrenched . <p> The US trade deficit has been growing ever since , constantly breaking new records in recent years . This has occurred despite former US president Donald Trump 's attempts at using tariffs to improve the US balance of trade with China , and President Joe Biden 's subsidies for green energy , which are intended to restore US manufacturing competitiveness . Even with disruptions to global trade from the coronavirus and the war in Ukraine , the US trade deficit has continued to increase , approaching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more on imports than it earns from exports , the deficit needs to be funded somehow . This is why growing US trade deficits have led to large budget deficits as well as high levels of corporate and household debt . Until recently , low interest rates and quantitative easing enabled the US to avoid a debt crisis , but with inflation at its highest level in decades , the Federal Reserve has been left with no choice but to raise interest rates . This has led to the collapse of several large banks and a potential US default is now on the cards due to political squabbles over the budget deficit . <p> The strong dollar may have even caused some of the country 's political divisions as it shipped jobs overseas and produced low interest rates , which disproportionately benefited wealthy stock and property owners . This partially explains the difference in voting patterns between urban educated homeowners and rural voters who lack large equity portfolios and tertiary educations . Trump won 80% of US counties in the 2016 election , saying the dollar was " too strong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tertiary-educated urban voters , who tend to lean Democrat , enjoyed large increases in the value of their homes and were less affected by the offshoring of manufacturing jobs to countries such as China . In the low interest rates environment , these homeowners often generated more wealth from increases in residential property prices than the sum of US wages , which have largely declined in real terms since the 1970s . <p> Lower trade deficits may also lessen the debt burden on the government as the US would be better equipped to fund imports with export income rather than debt . <p> Dedollarisation may help resolve some of these issues . It would likely produce a weaker dollar as demand for the greenback in trade and foreign reserve holdings declines . This would make imports more expensive and US exports more competitive in international markets , reversing a multidecade trend that has seen the US lose much of its manufacturing competitiveness to the detriment of less-educated workers . <p> Lower trade deficits may also lessen the debt burden on the government as the US would be better equipped to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a large budget deficit , the recurring dramas about the US debt ceiling may become less of an issue . That said , it is ironic that Republicans have complained about Biden 's green energy subsidies when most of the money will be spent in rural areas in red states that have the best wind and solar energy potential . <p> Of course , a weaker dollar could produce higher levels of inflation and consequently result in interest rates remaining higher for longer . But this may actually be a good thing for the US . Higher interest rates could help prevent speculative bubbles , make homes more affordable , and encourage sound investment decisions , which would result in higher productivity . <p> A weaker dollar could also boost foreign earnings of US firms who operate abroad . As the global economy is significantly larger than the US economy , this could be a substantial increase in income , while other money that would otherwise have gone overseas will remain in the economy , offsetting the loss of purchasing power from a weaker currency . US assets would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any increase in inflation resulting from a weaker dollar could help inflate away the country 's enormous debt levels . <p> While there may be potential downsides to dedollarisation for the US , including increased inflation , reduced purchasing power , higher interest rates , and a decline in the value of US assets in foreign currency terms , a weaker dollar may be the best way to ensure the long-term success of the US economy , improve political cohesion , and reduce the risk of default . <p> As the Brics and other emerging markets seek to dedollarise trade due to the weaponisation of the dollar , and central banks begin dedollarising their reserve holdings due to declines in the value of US treasuries , a weaker dollar could be on the horizon . Despite fears that this will represent the end of US hegemony , it may turn out to be the best medicine for the long-term health of the US economy .

At the same time , it opened the way for China to emerge as a global economic and military powerhouse .

But it is better that the water be clean in the first place . <p> Cholera can be treated simply by giving the patient water with suitable salts , cheap and plentifully available , either by drinking or by injection . It is an utter disgrace that anyone in the world today should die of cholera . In South Africa this month , over twenty people did so at Hammanskraal , in the richest province in South Africa , purely as a result of misgovernance . <p> The ANC 's manifold failures -- in education , crime prevention , health , water and sanitation , railways , ports , municipalities , railways , and employment -- are caused not only by corruption , incompetence , neglect and arrogance but also by deliberate policy . The ANC has deliberately forced upon the nation policies it knows are ruinous and to which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ similar failures in another country far away a century ago . <p> One of the world 's worst epidemics of malaria happened in Russia in 1922 , spreading as far north as Archangel on the Arctic Circle . Nowadays , it would have been blamed on climate change ( in the freezing cold ! ) , but actually , it was caused by the collapse of Russian health services following the brutal disruption of the communist revolution and the civil war . ( Malaria decimated the European population during the horrible cold of the 16th and 17th Centuries and probably killed Cromwell . ) But an even worse loss of life , this time by starvation , was caused by deliberate communist policy . <p> In 1921 , Russia under Lenin suffered a famine caused by " socialising agriculture " ( banning the market in food and collectivising the farms ) . Lenin , fearing the famine would bring down his revolution , hastily reversed this policy and allowed a degree of market farming and private enterprise . Immediately food became more plentiful , and the famine ended . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bureaucracy , Stalin then ordered the total collectivisation of the farms , knowing full well that it would cause starvation as it had done before . The resulting famine killed about 10 million people , including people living on the richest arable land in the world , in Ukraine ( now under attack from another Russian despot ) . Stalin regarded his collectivisation as a success because it " achieved socialism " . <h> Forced upon the nation <p> In South Africa , the ANC has forced upon the nation policies such as racial affirmative action , employment equity , transformation , cadre deployment and BEE , which it knows full well are ruinous . It knows that these policies have ruined education for the great mass of our people . ANC ministers would not dream of sending their own children to schools with affirmative action teachers , 92% of whom were black ( in line with the Employment Equity Act , which the ANC has recently strengthened ) . BEE procurement has helped to ruin Eskom , but the ANC keeps pushing it harder and harder . From what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of the facts seem as muddy as the water the local people have to drink ; these ANC policies are largely responsible for the loss of life . <p> Hammanskraal is a large peri-urban municipality in the north of Gauteng . It falls under the Tshwane local authority , which was ruled by the ANC until 2016 when a DA-led coalition took over . It has a long history of failing water supply and sanitation . In 2008 , sewage from the Rooiwal Waste Water Treatment Plant ( RWWT ) in the Tshwane municipality began flowing into the Apies River . Nothing much seems to have been done about it then . In 2011 , the ANC closed the Temba Water Purification Plant . In 2019 , Thembeka Mphefu , a Tshwane official and the divisional head of supply chain management , awarded a tender worth R295 million to upgrade the RWWT to a consortium of three companies , all owned by a businessman , Edwin Sodi , described as " an ANC benefactor " . Had Mr Sodi completed the work as he promised , the water at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and 21 people would not have died . He did not do so and did not have the competence to do so . <p> According to a tweet by Koketso Resane on 23 May 2023 , published in The Citizen , " Instead of using the money to upgrade the plant and ensure Hammanskraal residents get clean water , Edwin bought additional luxury cars , paid ANC salaries , and bagged Kefilwe Mabote as his side . " ( Please google " Kefilwe Mabota images " . ) In other words , he acted in full compliance with BEE procurement , which President Ramaphosa has recently confirmed he supports . I notice that Comrade Fikile Mbalula blames the DA for the Hammanskraal tragedy . <h> Terrifying thought <p> The terrifying thought is that what happened at Hammanskraal could easily happen in municipalities all over South Africa , and in fact , similar failures of water and sanitation have already happened in many of them . Many more poor people are going to die unless the ANC changes course . But will it ? <p> Will the ANC reverse its ruinous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to receive the best services at the lowest prices from the most competent and honest suppliers and contractors , regardless of their race or political connections ? Will it consider the provision of clean water and good sanitation to all the people to be more important than racial ideology and favours to rich cronies ? I do n't think so . Just listen to Fikile Mbalula in the Hard Talk interview , and you wo n't think so , either . Stalin thought that achieving socialism was more important than feeding starving people . The ANC thinks that racial ideology and enrichment of the few are more important than the welfare of the many . <p> The views of the writer are not necessarily the views of the Daily Friend or the IRR . <p> Andrew Kenny is a writer , an engineer and a classical liberal . <p> ( Visited 80 times , 80 visits today ) <h> Cyril Ramaphosa : The Audio Biography <p> Listen to the story of Cyril Ramaphosa 's rise to presidential power , narrated by our very own Alec Hogg.

@@99120234 <h> BRICS : From investment slogan to global power club -- Iran , Saudi Arabia , and 17 others now want in <p> The BRICS group of emerging markets -- Brazil , Russia , India and China , with South Africa added later -- has gone from a slogan dreamed up at an investment bank to a real-world club that also controls a major development bank . It once might have seemed ironic to see Communist Party-ruled China embrace the Wall Street conceit . But now countries of all political stripes , including Iran and Saudi Arabia , are clamoring to join , setting up potential friction at the club 's Aug. 22-24 summit in Johannesburg . <h> 1 . How did BRIC(S) get started ? <p> " BRIC " was coined in 2001 by economist Jim O'Neill , then at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. , to draw attention to strong growth rates in Brazil , Russia , India and China . It was intended as an optimistic thesis for investors amid market pessimism following the terrorist attacks in the US on Sept. 11 that year . The four nations took the idea and ran with it . Their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and common challenges . They were already cooperating in forums like the World Trade Organization and felt their influence in a US-dominated world order would be greater if their voices were combined . The first meeting of BRIC foreign ministers was organized by Russia on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly in 2006 . The group held its first leaders ' summitin 2009 . South Africa was invited to join at the end of 2010 , extending membership to another continent . <h> 2 . What does BRICS do ? <p> The biggest concrete achievements have been financial . The countries agreed to pool $100 billion of foreign currency , which they can lend to each other during emergencies . That liquidity facilitybecame operational in 2016 . They founded the New Development Bank -- a World Bank-inspired institution that has approved more than $30 billion of loans for projects like water and transport infrastructure since it began operations in 2015 . ( South Africa borrowed $1 billion in 2020 to fight the Covid-19 pandemic . ) They plan to discuss the feasibility of a common BRICS currency this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and farm products make them natural partners for Chinese demand . India and China have weaker trade connections with each other , partly due to political rivalries and an acrimonious border dispute . Like other multilateral forums such as the Group of Seven -- the annual BRICS summits and dozens of other lower-level meetings produce joint statements that proclaim broad agreement , but lack specifics . The biggest obstacle there is that the countries have diverging interests on major political and security issues -- including relations with the US -- and different governing systems and ideologies. <h> 3 . Who 's in charge ? <p> Economically , China 's gross domestic product is more than twice the size of all four other members combined . In theory , that should give it the most sway . In practice , India -- which recently surpassed China in population -- has been a counterweight . To take two examples : BRICS has not formally endorsed China 's big development push called the Belt and Road Initiative , partly because India objects to Belt and Road infrastructure projects in disputed territory held by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New Development Bank , there 's no dominant shareholder : Beijing agreed to the equal holdings advocated by New Delhi . The bank is headquartered in Shanghai , but has been led by an Indian and now , Brazil 's former President Dilma Rousseff. <h> 4 . Is Russia still a member ? <p> Yes , Russia remained a BRICS member despite its invasion of Ukraine in 2022 . That year 's BRICS leaders summit was held online , and Putin participated . The other BRICS countries have adopted a broadly neutral stance toward the war , viewing it as more of a regional issue than a global crisis . However , the war has changed Russia 's relations with BRICS institutions . The New Development Bank quickly froze Russian projects and Moscow has not been able to access dollars via the BRICS shared foreign currency system . Essentially , with US sanctions piling up , other BRICS countries prioritized ongoing access to the dollar-based financial system over helping Russia . The South African government has been grappling with what to do if Putin shows up for the August summit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crimes and has issued an arrest warrant . <h> 5 . How does it differ from things like the G-20 or Global South ? <p> Generally speaking , BRICS is similar to clubs such as the Group of 20 in representing a move toward a more multipolar world and away from one dominated by the US since the end of the Cold War , as exercised through clubs like the G-7 and World Bank . Other multilateral groupings arguably gaining influence as part of the trend include OPEC , the Shanghai Cooperation Organization , the Southern Common Market ( Mercosur ) , and the African Union . " Global South " is n't a club at all but a term that 's gained currency in recent years to refer to relatively poor countries , also referred to sometimes as developing or emerging . It 's typically contrasted with a " Global North " composed of the US , Europe and some wealthy countries in Asia and the Pacific . But the relationship between the two concepts is n't straightforward . For example , the European Union , firmly part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ multipolar world . China considers itself a developing country , although its status as the world 's second-largest economy with a large middle class makes that classification an awkward fit . The G-7 invited Brazil , India and Indonesia to attend its leaders summitthis year , in what officials said was an attempt to reach out to the Global South . <h> 6 . Who wants to join and why ? <p> China , which has been seeking to raise its profile on the global stage and counter Western influence , initiated the conversation about expansion when it chaired the group last year , triggering concern among other members that their own influence could be diluted . The proposal will be a main focus at this year 's summit , according to Anil Sooklal , ambassador from South Africa , which is chairing . At least 19 countries have expressed an interest and , of those , 13 have formally asked to join , including Saudi Arabia and Iran , he said in an interview . Others that have expressed interest include Argentina , the United Arab Emirates , Algeria @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nations from East Africa and one from West Africa that Sooklal did n't identify . For new entrants , being part of BRICS could expand their diplomatic influence and open up lucrative trade and investment opportunities . <h> 7 . Are there still BRICS funds or is the concept dead as an investment strategy ? <p> There 's still intense interest in emerging markets among investors . But while a nice idea two decades ago , BRICS is largely irrelevant as an investment theme today due to geopolitical changes and the members ' different economic trajectories . Except for India , the BRICS have underperformed their emerging markets peers over the last five years , according to Bloomberg Intelligence . US-led sanctions have made Russia uninvestable , and segments of China -- especially technology companies -- have also been sanctioned or face potential investment bans . China also is a maturing economy , increasingly separated from other emerging markets and facing a structural slowdown . Brazil 's economy slowed markedly following the end of a global commodity boom about a decade ago , while South Africa 's has been subjected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't produce enough electricity to meet demand . India is still a growth story that investment banks now compare with China 10 or 15 years ago , though its unclear if it can follow China 's manufacturing-led model .

Buckle celebrates the resilience of the Zimbabwean people and the preservation of the country 's magnificent wilderness amidst decades of hardship and corruption . Through stories of encounters with vultures , anti-poaching efforts , and majestic elephants , she shares her sense of awe , pride , and hope for Zimbabwe 's future . <h> Under the Sausage Tree <p> By Cathy Buckle <p> Dear Family and Friends , <p> For over two decades I have been telling you the story of our lives in a country stuck in a multi-faceted stranglehold . Zimbabwe is in a new stage of rapid economic meltdown and the currency is crashing again but my letter today is coming from a different angle and for anyone who has ever lived here or visited our beautiful Zimbabwe I hope this one will be good for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and would like you to come with me today for a sneak-peek into my latest adventure in Zimbabwe . I started composing this letter while sitting on a tree root under a Sausage Tree in Gonarezhou National Park but I had to calm down a lot before I could start writing because my hands were shaking , adrenalin was pumping and I desperately needed to go behind a bush . Adrenalin 's a funny thing is n't it ; they say it stimulates either fight or flight . For me it almost always stimulates fight and I had just driven my 20-year-old vehicle , which does n't have 4-wheel drive , across the Fishans River Crossing . " It 's Easy Peasy Cathy " they had told me at the office but words are one thing and tyres in deep sand are another . Fishans is a crossing point over the mighty Runde River . There 's no bridge or concrete track , it 's probably about three quarters of a kilometre across the river bed with a rocky section through flowing water and then a long stretch of thick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Five years ago I had mastered the Fishans crossing after a few encounters of being stuck in the sand but conditions had changed this time , the water was faster and the sand thicker and looser . When I arrived I had let the tyres down , got my speed and gears right , but it was pointless and I got stuck in the thick sand three times on the crossing and my girlfriends and I had to dig us out . I know these sand rivers are the rites of passage here but I knew I had to crack Fishans today so I could conquer the fear that was niggling away at me . So , with determination and purpose I faced Fishans again , loving her and hating her at the same time ; would she let me pass today or was it going to be hands and knees , sand in my hair and shovels again ? With trepidation and determination I dropped down the embankment into the Fishans river bed . Slow and steady , but not too slow , we got further and further across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't dare relax my guard and then I dropped into the steep little dip that led into the water . This part was much worse , you ca n't see the bottom , tyres are slipping and rocks moving under the wheels , the sudden nerve-racking tug of current pulling at your back wheels , and , at last , up and out . A few minutes had felt like an hour and I pulled over and got out , hands shaking , laughing , slowly letting the adrenalin dissipate and my heart slow down again . <p> Going back again without getting stuck restored my dignity but I know to never take this river for granted . Later I sat under the Sausage Tree watching three very well kitted out 4 ? 4 vehicles with South African number plates crossing Fishans and I felt so proud of Zimbabwe . Against all odds we manage again and again to face our fear and to overcome with little or nothing to prop us up . I felt so proud of Gonarezhou and how they have managed to maintain , preserve and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ widespread corruption which has left our country on its knees . <p> That evening back at our campsite , my green tent flapping in the wind we sat around the campfire . Water for the next day was boiling in a Kelly Kettle , homemade bread was baking in a cast iron pot in the fire and sweet potatoes for supper were wrapped in tin foil and nestled in the embers . We would have them with thin slices of chorizo and a hot tomato and chilli relish and while we waited we talked about courage and determination and how these two qualities define so many ordinary people in Zimbabwe and how they have empowered us to survive so many years of collapse and mismanagement here . We have n't had money or luxuries , we 've just learned to go without , to work harder and to help each other along the way . <p> After supper with the night sky ablaze , the Milky Way lighting the darkness and a waning crescent of the moon slipping into the horizon , we listened for the whooping of hyenas and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ encounter we had had the day before . Sitting in a dead tree in the golden grass there must have been close to forty vultures . We watched and watched , binoculars scanning everywhere for what we were sure must be a kill when suddenly a man appeared at the window . " Good morning . We are doing anti-poaching here and saw the vultures and have come to investigate , " he said . Into the dense undergrowth the anti-poaching unit set off looking for what had caused vultures to gather here , was it lions on a kill , a poacher 's snare line maybe or the dreaded rhino or elephant carcass . Whatever it was , watching these men heading into the unknown was looking courage right in the face . <p> When I was finishing this letter on the last day of our brief adventure , we were again sitting under a big shady tree in another area of Gonarezhou . I was sitting on the open tail gate typing , a beautiful cool breeze blew through the wilderness . Someone else was looking at photographs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ooh look who 's just popped in , " and there , about fifteen metres away was a huge bull elephant . It walked towards us , this was obviously its rubbing tree , we could see the mud high up on the bark . We left quickly but the memory of that moment will linger on in our hearts as we face the undoubtedly hard times that still lie ahead for our country . <p> Thank you for coming on this short adventure in Zimbabwe with me today . Many of you have been on this journey with me for 23 years and I could n't have done it without you and your encouragement to me to keep going .

@@99164230 <h> Has Telkom 's silver lining been found ? <p> The drama never seems to cease in South Africa and none more so for a beleaguered Telco company Telkom , South Africa 's 3rd largest mobile phone operator . <p> This past weekend , Bloomberg broke the story that the Public Investment Corporation ( wholly owned by the South African government ) , former Telkom CEO , Sipho Maseko 's investment company , Afrifund and Axian were looking to make an offer for government 's stake in Telkom . <p> The news itself met me with mixed emotions . As mentioned in my first Biznews Telkom podcast and article , the thesis was to see Telkom unlock value through corporate action around its assets . Without sounding too sceptical , this deal seems very coincidental . <p> Just over two weeks ago , the Telkom board scared the living daylights out of shareholders by mentioning a potential impairment as large as R13bn . Now there 's a " insider lead " consortium looking to scoop up a 35% stake at rock bottom prices . It almost reminds me of when Government sold R5bn of our strategic oil reserves at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the oil was sold below market value . <p> So where does this lead to for all the frustrated shareholders who have seen 44% of Telkom share price destruction this year alone ? <p> Firstly , I mentioned in my last article that government wants to push forward funding of their National Health Insurance ( NHI ) program and that their Telkom stake had been earmarked as an initial funder for NHI . But we must ask why now ? Why does n't government hold out for the sale of the assets and realize better value ? <p> My intuition tells me that there is more happening behind the scenes and most likely , some government officials will be making some hefty commissions on some shady handshakes . The flipside is that this could be a strong catalyst for a re-rating of Telkom 's share price . With government out the way , the new " consortium " will be more proactive in realizing value for all shareholders , and likely help re-establish the discussions with MTN for an outright sale . <p> If we reflect back to 2020 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Telkom was worth R100 a share . I 'm not saying it 's worth that , but it 's worth noting that someone who was once that close to the business still sees the opportunity to profit from a potential value unlock scenario in Telkom . <p> I had my reservations as to why the Board was so keen to impair the assets so significantly . But now , we see why . As the latest story does the rounds , it 's likely that speculators will push the share back up to the R30 mark . <p> We 'll have to sit tight to see if this story comes to fruition . For those Fantasy Fund Managers who listened to my podcast with Alec Hogg , and bought Telkom on that week , you will likely see some great outperformance , especially versus MTN and VODACOM as per our original thesis .

@@99187231 <h> Fearing three-week blackout , banks ramp up contingency plans <p> If South Africa was to experience a blackout , steps have been taken to control money flow . Photo : Leon Sadiki/Getty Images <p> As South Africa moves towards stage eight load-shedding , financial institutions are working on implementing contingency plans to keep banks operational should a full-scale blackout occur . <p> The South African Reserve Bank and Eskom have been locked in meetings to determine the possible risks involved in a blackout , and how to navigate a temporary grid collapse , should one take place . <p> Banks have implemented contingency plans for load-shedding to ensure that its systems continue to work . These plans are similar to those that are being worked on for a total blackout . <p> Should a total blackout occur , in the best case scenario , it would take six to 14 days to restart the power grid and in the worst case scenario , three to four weeks to repair the grid , according to Eskom . <p> Kuben Naidoo , the Reserve Bank 's deputy governor , told the Mail &amp; Guardian that the central bank had met @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fine-tune ways to navigate a total blackout . <p> " If you had asked me a month ago , I would have probably said that in the event of a complete grid shutdown , there would be almost no transactions , " Naidoo said . <p> The Reserve Bank has , since 2015 , had a contingency plan and laws ready to be implemented in a time of crisis . They were drawn up eight years ago as a precaution , but now it believes a grid collapse is likely . <h> The plans banks have in place <p> To find out what plans banks have in place , the M&amp;G asked Nedbank , Absa and Standard Bank what steps they were taking in the event of a blackout . <p> The plan includes connecting its ATMs to the bank 's backup power during an outage to ensure that customers can still do their banking activities . Nedbank also wants to put in place backup power at 1 350 sites by the end of the third quarter . <p> " As a business , we are well-prepared for load-shedding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limit the impact on our clients and our business . About 90.3% of the branches have backup power and are able to carry on with operations , Viljoen said . " Installation of a central battery system will be made during the first half of 2023 at the branches that currently do n't have backup power . <p> She said clients are also assisted through digital and call centre channels and , if need be , are redirected to the closest alternative branch . The bank also offers a few alternative payment methods such as QR code payments . <p> All Nedbank corporate offices have a backup electricity supply and operate normally during load-shedding . <p> Viljoen added that the bank has remained resilient in ensuring continuous operations since the increased frequency of load-shedding . <p> Standard Bank spokesperson Ross Linstrom said Standard Bank encouraged its customers to make use of the digital platform to ensure they stay connected . <p> " At all times , a viable and convenient alternative banking channel is and has been available to customers should an ATM not be available due to extended load-shedding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's ATMs are equipped with backup power facilities that provide services to customers even when there is load-shedding . <p> But , he added , because of the nature and extent of load-shedding at times , certain ATMs may not be available until their power backup systems are replenished . <p> Standard Bank , which is the country 's biggest bank by revenue and customers , had a series of significant outages of digital banking that occurred from April 2021 to May 2022 . At least 10 major service disruptions occurred , most of which resulted in hours-long downtime of its mobile banking app and internet banking . <p> Absa 's managing executive , Tshiwela Mhlantla , said that as part of its contingency plan , the bank on Monday launched a card tap-and-go capability to reduce the time taken at an ATM . <p> " The capability is expected to reduce transaction time at the ATM by up to 12 seconds on average and potentially deter incidents of card theft at ATMs , which is an industry wide trend . Further to this , the capability may assist to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ failures and card jamming . " <p> Mhlantla said the power supply at the majority of Absa 's branches and branch ATMs are backed up by alternative power sources , to mitigate the effect of an outage . <p> " We are deploying alternative power sources to support our standalone ATMs over the coming months and a process to upgrade our ATM network with enhanced energy-efficient technology is under way . <p> Mhlantla added that Absa participates in industry initiatives aimed at managing the effect of load-shedding and extended power outages on the financial services industry . <h> Continued cuts <p> According to a source in Eskom , the meeting between the Reserve Bank and the electricity utility was prompted by a warning that the power system was struggling , which prompted a call on financial institutions and big companies to prepare themselves for a regional blackout in July -- when demand for electricity is highest -- which would take three weeks to fix . <p> In its financial stability review released in February , the Reserve Bank said : " Insufficient and unreliable electricity supply is likely to threaten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enterprises , for the foreseeable future , with losses potentially spilling over into the financial sector . " <p> The performance of Eskom 's fleet of mostly coal-fired stations has deteriorated , resulting in regular blackouts . <p> The Reserve Bank estimated that load-shedding will contribute to the downgrade of economic growth this year . <p> Eskom has previously confirmed that the amount of load-shedding in 2023 will exceed that in 2022 , because of significantly more hours of stage six rolling blackouts . <p> Eskom has repeatedly said that a total system collapse is unlikely to occur . Last week Electricity Minister Kgosientsho Ramokgopa said the utility had improved its energy availability factor to 55% from 53% in May . <p> In an interview on Wednesday , he reiterated that it was technically impossible to end rolling power cuts by the end of this year , " but we will be at substantially lower stages of load-shedding " . <p> Mandisa Nyathi is a climate reporting fellow , funded by the Open Society Foundation for South Africa . 
@@99187232 <h> Tone-deaf Ramaphosa says citizens must help ease load-shedding <p> South Africans must play their part to reduce load-shedding as temperatures drop , President Cyril Ramaphosa said on Wednesday . <p> His renewed call to load-shedding fatigued citizens -- who have experienced power cuts every day this year -- comes as the country ping-pongs between stages four and six of the scheduled blackouts . <p> It also comes as the cost of running embattled power utility Eskom 's diesel-powered units has more than doubled , as revealed by the treasury on Tuesday . Finance Minister Enoch Godongwana also said the state-owned-entity was on course to post a loss of R21.2 billion . This was despite a hefty 9.6% tariff increase being approved by the national energy regulator and a treasury bailout of R21.9 billion . <p> The South African Reserve Bank has estimated that stage six load-shedding costs the country R900 million a day and the National Rationalised Specifications Association of South Africa is finalising revisions of the country 's load-shedding guidelines to allow for scheduling beyond stage eight . <p> Ramaphosa told the National Assembly that South Africa was facing " a difficult winter ahead " . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vote debate . <p> Electricity demand had increased as the colder weather set in and several units at Medupi , Kusile and Koeberg power stations remained offline due to repairs , he said . <p> " These six units alone represent approximately 4 500 megawatts of capacity or between four and five stages of load-shedding . The situation will improve as we return these units to service towards the end of this year . <p> " Until then , our best hope of limiting the severity of load-shedding is to reduce demand on the grid . " <p> The president said that tax incentives had been introduced to support the rollout of rooftop solar for households , as per his State of the Nation Address , and that just as citizens had " come together " to stop the spread of Covid-19 , " we must all act now to bring down demand over the winter months " . <p> " We can all make a difference by switching off lights and appliances when not in use ; reducing the temperature setting on geysers to 60 degrees ; installing a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your electricity bill and turning off unnecessary equipment like pool pumps . " <p> These " simple actions " could reduce demand by up to 1 000MW or one full stage of load-shedding , he said . <h> Grid collapse <p> As Eskom has done , Ramaphosa dismissed the possibility -- but not outright -- of a total grid collapse . The risk was " extremely low " , he said , adding that there were safeguards in place to prevent this happening . <p> The government was working " urgently " to resolve the country 's electricity shortfall , he said , but this did not diminish its commitment to a just energy transition . <p> " We will stick to our commitment to reduce our carbon emissions by 2030 to within a target range which , at its upper level , is compatible with limiting global temperature increase to 1.5 ? C. <p> " We need to do this to prevent the worst effects of climate change , including illness , droughts , floods and other disasters . We also need to protect jobs in sectors of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> He said that any decisions -- if necessary -- to temporarily delay the decommissioning of coal-fired power stations to address electricity supply shortfall would be informed by " a detailed technical assessment of the feasibility of continuing to operate older plants and the cost of doing so relative to alternative energy sources " . <p> " It will also be informed by the timeframe in which we can expect new generation capacity and the impact on our decarbonisation trajectory . At the same time , we will further accelerate the pace of investment in new renewable electricity generation as an important part of the plan to overcome load-shedding . " <p> In March , Public Works and Infrastructure Minister Sihle Zikalala said that since 2019 , the government had spent R2 million on procuring and installing alternative power supply systems for the homes of ministers , while the total for procuring and installing alternative power supply for deputy ministers amounted to R5 040 000 . <p> Zikalala was responding to a question from Democratic Alliance MP , Leon Schreiber.

It is Africa 's largest importer of refined petroleum products . <p> This paradox has long hamstrung the Nigerian economy . Given its abundant oil resources , fuel should not be a scarce commodity , or subject to major price hikes , and the government should not have to spend $861 million a month on subsidies to keep pump prices down . <p> Consumers are unlikely to notice any immediate benefits .

As a result , they have had to develop a variety of structured methods and scoring models to rank and rate their projects , with the purpose being to determine , as objectively as possible , which projects are deserving of scarce capital investment . <p> Most mining companies have a multinational set of potential projects , so the decision models include the relative risk and reward of one mining jurisdiction relative to another . In the case of South African greenfield projects , most diversified miners have been explicit that they will not allocate growth capital to South African mining projects under current conditions .

Projects are at all stages of development , with the early ones like Gold Fields ' South Deep and Pan African 's Elikhulu already producing energy . <p> To be economic for energy consumers , high upfront capital , renewable energy projects require a low cost of capital and a multi-decade payback period . This is why we have seen that the early REIPPP ( renewable independent power producer ) projects are all highly leveraged 20-year contracts , with the offtake guaranteed by National Treasury , the most credit-worthy guarantor in South Africa .

And mining company investors like their returns spicier than that anyway . Bland utility industry-type returns can be found elsewhere . <p> Obviously , renewable energy investment is being justified on other grounds , like energy security , price certainty , and to meet mining company decarbonisation commitments . <p> Mining companies have gone on to take a variety of approaches when procuring renewable energy . Some have invested directly in projects using their own balance sheets ; others have set up renewable energy subsidiaries or joint ventures with multinational energy companies . It is only the highest quality diversified mining groups with the strongest balance sheets and longest life mines who have been able to sign long-term , bankable power purchase agreements with third party energy companies . <p> What of South Africa 's smaller , shorter life or previously distressed mining companies ?

Once the energy security , price certainty and decarbonization boxes have been ticked , these energy projects will no longer belong within mining companies -- they simply do not rate or rank highly enough in the capital allocation decision models -- and new multi-customer , multi-project , lower-risk , diversified energy companies must emerge .

@@99389234 <h> 7 New Details From the Mortal Kombat 1 Gameplay Trailer <h> Get over here ! <p> NetherRealm Studios shared the first gameplay trailer for Mortal Kombat 1 , a new game in the famed fighting game series that will reset the timeline ( again ) . While all your favorite characters like Scorpion and Sub-Zero are set to return , the new timeline means there 's a lot we still do n't know about these familiar faces . <p> On the gameplay front , Mortal Kombat 1 is shaking things up with its biggest new mechanic yet : Kameos , which introduces a tag system to Mortal Kombat for the first time ever . With that in mind , we poured over the new trailer to see what new secrets we could glean from the gameplay trailer . <h> Tag You 're It <p> The big new gameplay reveal in the new trailer was Kameo , a new system where players pick a second character to assist them in Kombat . Similar to games like Marvel vs . Capcom , players can summon their Kameo partners using a button press to do a quick attack , and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems to be that there are a number of different commands you can issue to your Kameo partner , depending on the input used . We 've seen Kameos extend combos , aid with throws , used as a breaker to get their partner out of a combo , and even participate in what appear to be MK1 's new X-Ray/Fatal Blow attacks . <h> Who 's That Kameo ? <p> While we do n't know the full roster just yet , it seems like NetherRealm Studios is being very deliberate with its Kameo characters . Instead of just letting you choose anyone on the main roster to be your tag partner , there will be an entire separate roster of Kameos , similar to how assist-only characters worked in Marvel vs Capcom 1 . So far , it seems like only pre-reset characters from past Mortal Kombat games are in the roster such as Mortal Kombat 1 Sonya , Mortal Kombat 1 Kano , Mortal Kombat 2 Jax , Mortal Kombat 3 Stryker , Mortal Kombat 2 Kung Lao , and Goro . <p> During the stage presentation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk more about Kameo and said there will be some characters who are available as main roster characters and Kameo fighters . But " many of our Kameos are nods to our first game , " Boon says . <h> Timeline Shenanigans <p> Mortal Kombat 1 is a true and proper sequel to Mortal Kombat 11 , but because of Liu Kang 's decision to reset the timeline in his own vision , the Mortal Kombat universe begins anew , and there are plenty of changes to the characters as a result . <p> We already know that mortal enemies Scorpion and Sub-Zero are now brothers who seemingly get along , but Mileena 's teeth get a new backstory as they 're now the result of a disease rather than Mileena being created as a clone of Kitana with Tarkatan blood mixed in . Other changes include the fact that Kenshi can see , Kung Lao 's fights without his signature bladed hat , and Raiden is mortal following the events from Mortal Kombat 11 . <h> Blast From the Past <p> Just as how the Kameo fighters are nods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fatalities . Kano 's heart rip is an iconic , classic fatality that seems downright tame compared to what NetherRealms has cooked up in recent years , but the Kameo system seems very much a way to combine the newer Mortal Kombat games with callbacks to the past , which should leave both new and old fans alike happy . <h> New Shaolin Monks <p> Liu Kang 's ideal universe is under threat as we learned from the first Mortal Kombat 1 trailer . But he 's not going to save the universe by himself . Along with the Scorpion and Sub-Zero brothers who seem to be on Liu Kang 's side , the now-human Raiden and Kenshi appear to be sparring as Shaolin monks , much like Liu Kang and Kung Lao used to in the previous timeline . <h> Up in the Air <p> While it 's not confirmed just yet how Mortal Kombat 1 will play differently from its predecessors , one apparent change that we can see in the gameplay trailer is a new emphasis on air combos . Multiple characters are seen launching opponents up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ series of hits while still suspended mid airs . Kameos are also used to extend these combos for maximum juggling . <h> Where are the New Faces ? <p> So far NetherRealm is emphasizing the returning characters from past Mortal Kombat games . While we 've seen plenty of Fire God Liu Kang , Raiden , Kung Lao , Mileena , Kitana , Kenshi , and Johnny Cage , we have yet to see any new faces this time around ( other than some leaked guest characters ) . <p> Not that we 're complaining . Because of the timeline reset , many of these characters have completely different origin stories and we ca n't wait to be reintroduced to our favorite characters again , some of whom seem completely different from how we 've known them previously . <p> These are some of the biggest details we noticed from the Mortal Kombat 1 gameplay trailer .

The King and Queen were said to have had a traditional wedding ceremony in 2021 in Newcastle . It 's rumoured that the Zulu Queen had reached her limits with her husband for leaving her alone at the palace . <p> A mole speaking to the publication said the Queen was spotted in Umhlanga with the prince recently and nobody would be able to ever guess that they were royals as they were n't escorted by any bodyguards which was uncommon in the royal family . <p> " Queen Mayisela decided to go back to her old life after she realised that she meant nothing to the King . The King went as far as stripping her off the bodyguards as she had her own bodyguards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mole said . <p> " Recently I met her in Umhlanga with the king 's child and there were no bodyguards and they were just like other normal people .

Image via Twitter @lunietoolz <h> MORE ABOUT THE ROYAL COUPLE <p> Earlier this year , Queen KaMayisela was interviewed on Sunday World and reportedly said she has n't seen peace in her marriage since she married the King . She denied that any of the rumours against her and her " troubled " marriage were true and reportedly suspects that someone is maliciously trying to destroy her . <p> " I am at my house at Pongola . I am at my home and I have never left .

Image : AdobeStock <p> The additional requirements contained Eskom 's interim grid access rules will increase the amount investors in independent power producer ( IPP ) projects must spend before knowing if they will be able to use the national grid to evacuate the energy to their buyer -- considerably . <p> That will increase the risk significantly . " They will rather go to other countries , " says Brian Day , chair of the South African Independent Power Producers Association ( Saippa ) . <p> This does not bode well for the rapid deployment of privately generated electricity to end load shedding and comes shortly after the virtual failure of Bid Window 6 ( BW6 ) of government 's Renewable Energy Independent Power Producer Procurement Programme ( Reippp ) late last year . <p> Intention <p> The interim rules announced by Eskom were developed to prevent a repeat of BW6 when none of the participating 23 wind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were overtaken by projects for the private market that took up all the remaining grid capacity in the Northern , Southern and Western Cape . <p> Eskom has until now allocated grid connections on a ' first come , first served ' basis . <p> In terms of the interim rules , access will be limited to " shovel-ready " projects and Eskom has the right to reserve some grid capacity for Reippp bid windows . <p> This means developers must now complete several additional processes before they qualify for an allocation . <p> In its presentation to the industry , Eskom listed the following : <p> The allocations will be valid for a limited period and , if not utilised , Eskom will revoke them and the capacity will go back into the pool ; and <p> Eskom will also draw on the Grid Capacity Allocation Guarantee payable by developers . <p> Day says it can cost up to R30 million to get a project to financial close . <p> In terms of the existing allocations system , developers will spend about 20% at risk before knowing if they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ push this to about two-thirds . <p> IPPs must therefore decide if they are prepared to take the risk of spending up to R20 million only to hear they can not use the grid to evacuate the electricity to their buyer . <p> Niveshen Govender , CEO of the South African Wind Energy Association ( Sawea ) , also raised concern about the new rules . <p> He said the requirement of two years ' wind data is unnecessary and unreasonable and could delay new wind projects . <p> Sawea pointed out that investor confidence in the South African energy sector continues to dwindle and that from an economic standpoint , urgent consideration of the investor perspective is essential . <p> Onerous requirements <p> Dr Rethabile Melamu , CEO of the South African Photovoltaic Industry Association ( Savia ) , said the increased onerous requirements and capital requirements only serve to raise the hurdle rate ( the minimum rate of return required by an investor ) , encouraging the dominance of larger established players . <p> " The rules need to ensure there is space and opportunity created for small-scale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and diversity , " she said . <p> According to Melamu , there is industry concern around Eskom being a truly independent judge in the matter given that this role typically resides with Nersa ( the National Energy Regulator of South Africa ) . <p> Saippa 's Day says this just shows how important it is for Eskom 's transmission division to become truly independent -- so it can change its way of thinking " from that of a protected monopoly " to an entity that facilitates the workings of an open market . <p> He believes the only change that is needed is for Eskom to consistently revoke the rights to grid access not utilised within the specified period . <p> Instead , the utility keeps extending such deadlines for Reippp projects -- and that delays getting new generation capacity onto the network . <p> " The procurement process prevents the BW6 projects from being allocated grid capacity at this stage , following the conclusion of the announcement of the preferred bidders . <p> " Projects that were submitted as part of BW6 must resubmit for BW7 if they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says Sookgrim . <p> " Should the BW6 projects be selected as preferred bidders for BW7 , Eskom will allocate the capacity according to the Interim Grid Capacity Allocation Rules .

Titi and group finance director Nishlan Samujh were the only executive directors granted an LTI award at that point . <p> The bank 's remuneration committee says it " considered at length whether there had been a ' windfall gain ' arising from the LTI grant made in June 2020 , noting the LTI value was reduced at grant by 10% to reflect the significant reduction in share price " .

This vested at the maximum 135% of on-target shares " following the strong financial and non-financial performance " over the performance period . <p> In reality , the group 's performance was so strong that these long-term incentives actually vested at 142.7% of the on-target shares , but when the award was made , it was subject to a cap of 135% . <p> The original award was also adjusted lower by 10% , meaning that the outcome could 've been substantially higher . <p> In terms of short-term incentives ( STIs ) , Titi and Samujh achieved 83.8% of the maximum opportunity . <p> The remuneration committee exercised a " downward discretion " of 10% for Titi and Ciaran Whelan ( who has effectively stepped down as head of the UK wealth business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transition and related challenges " . Following a combination of this business with Rathbones , the enlarged group will be led by the current CEO of Rathbones . <p> This ' downward discretion ' means Titi received a final STI achievement of 75.4% . <p> Personal security <p> Titi and Samujh also receive a personal security benefit of just under ? 90 000 annually , or about R2 million , following the approval of this by shareholders at last year 's AGM .

@@100052237 <h> The Best Improvised Scene In The MCU <p> The Marvel Cinematic Universe is made up of a growing cast of beloved comic book characters , and with so many faces vying for screen time , it 's often hard to focus on a natural flow to their behaviours . Part of what makes the MCU special is the way actors are able to bring a bit of themselves to these roles and create undeniably funny and heartfelt improvised scenes . This chemistry is something that usually clicks when actors interact with each other extensively and get a feel for how their counterparts approach interactions . For this scene , the two actors present managed to create one of cinema 's most memorable scenes of the 2010s . <p> If you had n't guessed already , we are talking about the heartbreaking disappearance and " death " of Tom Holland 's Peter Parker/Spider-Man in the events of Avengers : Infinity War .

This made it a long improvisation moment where they attempted to find what could stick . <p> However , Holland eventually came up with the idea of Peter 's emotional disappearance by channelling a certain acting technique . He revealed that he uses repetition to get himself into the emotional space necessary for certain scenes . In this case , the phrase " I do n't want to go " was his choice of words , and it was enough to sell the impact of Peter 's disappearance .

For Spidey 's debut , Tom Holland 's first scene with Robert Downey Jr . took place in Peter 's house . Here , Tony attempts to recruit the kid for the Civil War battle .

While the game certainly looks larger and involves a much more nuanced plot than its predecessor , the story seems unapologetically rushed at times .

There 's virtually no trace of the Ghost of Sparta , which means that the story would need to more or less redeem him -- which is not easy , considering most of Kratos ' past is so soaked in blood that no one could ever read it . <h> Better Combat , Worse Fights <p> The shift to a more " Souls-like " fighting scheme in the 2018 God of War made the game feel like a more modern , decidedly cinematic take on the series ' formula .

Back when it was released , critics loved the narrative of the new God of War : the game follows Kratos in what appears to be a long , continuous shot , making the player feel even more invested in the plot and characters . <p> God of War Ragnarok keeps the same camera technique , but the gameplay does n't exactly play along with the narrative .

@@100161237 <h> Peering into the future of media in Africa : Fast forward , but firmly rooted <p> The world has only recently emerged from the worst of the Covid-19 pandemic . We are still dealing with the ongoing war in Ukraine and , in South Africa , an electricity crisis . Supply chains , input costs , trading conditions and entire sectors within countries ' economies have been hugely impacted . <p> These lead to consumer behaviour changes , raising questions for marketing and media strategies . To what extent have price hikes and the unavailability of some goods shifted purchasing patterns , price elasticity within categories , and brand selections ? Will remote or hybrid work dampen economic activity centred around office parks and business nodes ? <p> Will six to eight hours of daily power outages shut down yet more micro enterprises in South Africa , causing further unemployment and hitting core categories of consumer spending ? For how long will the electricity issues cut into the previous targeting banker that was the traditional evening television audience peak ? <p> The biggest lesson from the pandemic and the last few years of turbulence is surely that -- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -- marketing and media strategists need to build a contingency plan into their thinking , not just as small budget reserves or lower-priority items highlighted on spreadsheets , but as a holistic , 180-degree alternative in the case of sudden , unpredictable events . <h> Digital rules -- across a digital divide <p> For the better part of 20 years , ' digital ' has pervaded conversations in marketing meetings , and littered media strategy presentations . This coincided with the digi-tech revolution and mostly made sense , and was necessary . Good strategy has involved incorporating subscription video on demand ( SVOD ) into TV plans , allocating a portion of radio budgets to podcasts , bundling a publisher 's online offering with its print title offering , and shifting from product placement to influencer marketing , amongst many other evolutions . <p> But if industry professionals were to reflect on these decisions , some might need re-evaluation . Has it been effective to forego mass audience reach achievable on , for example , South Africa 's Zulu-language radio station Ukhozi FM , in favour of online , niche @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ budget be scrapped so that online search engine optimisation ( SEO ) metrics could inch up , come at the price of reduced corporate or brand reputation ? <p> And how should we frame the metaverse , where some brands are already spending significant advertising monies ? While this has strategic relevance for the likes of Gucci or Nike , the environment being called the next iteration of the internet is surely an enormous over-hype for many advertisers . <p> Interestingly , global consultants , Gartner , have a methodology for evaluating technologies within industries called the Hype Cycle . Its descriptions of the phases of technology adoption apply perfectly to the media environment . As planners , we get triggered by innovation , our expectations are probably inflated , and we may experience disillusionment before a new platform 's viability and genuine delivery kicks in . <h> Closing the gap <p> Our continent 's varied socioeconomic context and existing media landscapes are also acutely relevant to any discussion of media trends and challenges in Africa . Nine of the world 's ten poorest countries are in Africa , according @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are enormous income and wealth disparities , especially in Nigeria and South Africa , the continent 's two largest economies . These indicators translate to real-world consequences for media strategists , the bottom line of which is that there is a digital divide in Africa . <p> This divide is closing -- fast , in countries such as Kenya and Rwanda , which incorporated rapid digital transformation into their national economic plans a decade ago -- but most nations ' media landscapes are still dominated by traditional media . This is a powerful resource , upon which advertisers can capitalise . <p> Consider two examples . In Namibia , each day , a fleet of trucks drive 700km northwards and southwards from Windhoek to deliver copies of The Namibian newspaper to all major towns and villages across the country . In its near 40-year existence the paper has become the most trusted source of news for all Namibians . <p> The publisher takes digital seriously , and has developed and nurtured associated online channels and platforms , but the printed newspaper remains an institution on the country 's media landscape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Umhlobo Wenene hosts a programme programme , Imiphanga , that conveys death notices . It is a cherished source of community news and empathy , and has been running for generations . Enormous numbers of listeners tune in each week . <h> Cautionary tales <p> Predicting the future is tricky and -- because it engenders a sense of know-it-all complacency -- may even be counterproductive . In his seminal book The Black Swan , statistician Nassim Taleb highlights deep problems in how we think about risks ; one of which is that we over-emphasise newness because it 's top-of-mind . The opinions of experts , too , are over-valued ; Taleb provides evidence that they are rarely better at predictions than anyone else , because their ways of thinking are also blinkered by assumptions and biases . <p> The flipside of the same coin is that even if we are wary of predictions , as media professionals we must remain alert to signs of change , and take appropriate action . " I give the talkies six months , no more . At the most , a year . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The pioneering comedian and filmmaker should not have resisted change ; by 1940 silent movies were a thing of the distant past . <h> Human-centric planning <p> Peering into the future , media professionals also need to confront the elephant in the room . Algorithms -- embedded within programmatic digital media and television buying -- already make many decisions . Inevitably , artificial intelligence ( AI ) will soon do more -- much more . Could it take over the entire media strategy and planning function ? <p> The answer is surely ' yes ' -- but with a qualifier : however rapidly the industry continues to change , the human factor will provide the critical difference between solid campaign plans and those with the spark of ingenuity . Which do we believe will be most effective ? <p> The key to switching arising challenges into opportunities and unlocking business value is to be both brave and smart in our thinking . This might mean seizing on early signs of a trend to gain early adoption advantage -- or it may require resisting the trend because the conventional solution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be strategic in how we deal with change . The bottom line is that media owners will still need to deliver audiences , and marketing and media decision makers will always need to deliver results .

@@100161240 <h> How different are B2B and B2C customers , truly ? <p> PARTNER CONTENT I had an interesting conversation last week about whether a traditionally B2C advertising agency can deliver effectively to a B2B client . <p> I have always thought there was little difference between the services a creative advertising agency should offer a client , regardless of whether they are B2C or B2B . But I did pause to calibrate my response , and I think it 's worth sharing for anyone else pondering this question as we continue to see an increase in B2B brands actually investing in brand development . <p> It 's often said that B2B advertising and marketing requires a fundamentally different approach . The reasons given are that the buying journey and conversion time is longer ; it encompasses more than one highly knowledgeable decision maker ; the investment value is -- for the most part -- significantly higher ; that sales activation , not brand building , yields better results ; there is more switching inertia to overcome ; that the transition decision is ultimately a rational , rather than emotional one and that good B2B marketing is founded on great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the industry and competition better than anyone else . <p> What debunks all of that is the simple realisation that there are emotion-driven human beings at the end of every customer journey . And quite honestly , ALL good marketing and advertising should be founded on great insight based on customer understanding and a deep knowledge of the clients industry and competitors . <h> Storytelling , creativity , brand building <p> But do n't just take my word for it , Deloitte Digital delivered a three-year long study and found that organisations who focus on the " human experience " -- aligning to the values of their customers , workforce and partners -- were twice as likely to outperform their competitors in revenue growth . <p> In the 5 principles of growth in B2B marketing research published by the LinkedIn B2B Institute , it states that using storytelling , creativity , and brand building to tap into emotions is just as important to long term B2B marketing success as focusing on features , benefits and price . <p> According to a B2B customer insight 's report from B2B Marketing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likely to buy from a business whose culture and personality matches their own -- similar to consumers -- and 89% stated that feeling their needs have been understood is their biggest driver . <h> Intent data <p> Research from Infogroup has highlighted that intent data -- data about behavioural signals that help predict purchase intent -- has become a crucial tool for B2B organisations ( and already is for B2C brands ) and can increase close rates by as much as 79% . A staggering 93% of B2B marketers reported that personalising content increased their revenue over time . <p> In B2C marketing , there is a well-known relationship between a brand 's advertising expenditure or " share of voice " ( SO V ) and its rate of growth . Brands that set their SOV above their SOM ( share of market ) tend to grow , and those that set SOV below SOM , tend to shrink . <p> According to Harvard Business Review , consumer brands with 10% extra share of voice ( ESOV ) attain a market share rise of 0.6% points per annum , all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ market share rise is 0.7% ! So it appears that B2B brands respond to growth from advertising in exactly the same way that B2C brands do . So while tactical sales activation may be good for short-term results , brand building still excels at driving long-term growth . <h> Blurring the lines <p> The blurring of lines between personal and professional life , combined with evolving technology and access to more data , means that it 's time for organisations to start approaching their buyers as multi-faceted individuals . <p> Armed with the right tools , B2B organisations can , just as effectively as B2C organisations do , using the same marketing and advertising approaches , develop holistic marketing plans that are personalised and connect the brand with buyers on a more meaningful level and in a more enduring way , <p> At the end of the day , no matter which side of the B2B or B2C divide an organisation is , all marketing and advertising is essentially just P 2P ( person to person ) .

He would not have the privilege of a real-time experience with the witnesses physically present in court . <p> ARE COURTS ASKING TOO MUCH OF SOUTH AFRICANS ? <p> We all know how contentious the Senzo Meyiwa murder case has been . <p> It 's taken eight years to finally have suspects in the dock .

If the events from this week are anything to go by , it 's clear that the country will be pulling out notes from the last year and using them to test the truthfulness of the witnesses on the stand . <p> There will be no clean slate in the court of public opinion .

I am certain that this will be of interest to the new judge . <p> While the other witnesses who finished giving testimony were also visibly relieved , with Meyiwa 's childhood friend Tumelo Madlala sobbing as he wrapped up , they too will be recalled . <p> And if they choose not to return , in the words of media lawyer Dan Rosengarten , " nothing like a subpoena to get a witness to testify " .

@@100622231 <h> Warhaven Hands-On : Finding Joy in the Mayhem <p> In a bid for the growing number of warfare-centric multiplayer games with massive numbers of combatants taking to the field all at once to impale one another , Warhaven hopes make a name for itself with large maps , an impressive roster of warriors , and objective matches that have armies scrambling to overrun one another in an elaborate game of tug-of-war . I recently spent several hours with the team at Nexon and some of my fellow IGN sweaty tryhards as we tried desperately to maim one another while slinging as much trash talk as humanly possible . The result was a few entertaining hours that were complete pandemonium from beginning to end . <p> While combat may be slightly reminiscent of fellow third-person melee warfare game For Honor , Warhaven 's biggest departure is in its decidedly more chaotic style . Instead of smaller engagements with only a few players slowly and methodically dueling against one another , Warhaven 16-vs. -16 multiplayer throws an avalanche of opponents into a jumbled pile of swords , shields , and cannonballs that 's almost always pure mayhem . While fighting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slashing , and well-timed abilities , more often than not any hope at a fair fight is immediately dashed when either you or your opponent shows up in full force to ruthlessly butcher anyone in sight while sheer numbers throw any hope of fighting back right out the window . <p> In the occasional instances where both teams show up at a single point in full force , the often one-sided push and pull is replaced by a disorderly slaughterfest that 's sure to be the highlight of any match . Even when the odds feel fair though , the haphazard swings from your characters weapons and decidedly floaty movement makes for an imprecise experience that sometimes does n't feel great , even though that untidiness usually leads to hilarity . It 's especially funny to see players spontaneously transform into ultra-powerful heroes once they 've accrued enough murder karma , then roll over an entire team as a horse-mounted character or a magical samurai with a cowboy hat . It 's ridiculous , over-the-top , and at times feels completely unbalanced , but there 's a certain kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in how it appeals to my inner agent of chaos . <p> It 's not that Warhaven lacks strategy , though -- in fact , there 's plenty of opportunities for teams to communicate with one another around objectives in order to win the game . For example , a few maps feature a cannon that 's absolutely essential to victory , as whoever has control of it can rain down deadly hellfire over vast swathes of the map , leaving little hope for the enemy to control the objective without dealing with you first . That race to control the all-powerful artillery was definitely a good time , especially when I was the one firing the cannon at the soon-to-be-dead sorry excuse for a soldier who opposed me . But just like everything else in Warhaven , the battle over the cannon is in no way immune to the utter tumult of warfare , and it seemed like , even whilst communicating with my team as much as possible , we still regularly found ourselves steamrolled by overwhelming numbers leading to repeated turnovers . It honestly felt like , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came down to a coin toss based on the random and messy flow of battle , even when that sloppy homicide fiesta was generally a lot of fun . <p> The silly good times are definitely extended by Warhaven 's interesting roster of playable characters , which range from standard sword-wielding soldiers to lightning-fast assassins with a sneaky set of moves to healers with little in the way of attacks at all . Most of them feel good to play too , like the shield-bearer who can plow his way through an army of enemies like Frank West in Dead Rising , or the crazy dude with a warhammer who turns the enemy into mashed potatoes like the rabid monster that he is . From what I can tell in the handful of hours I had with it though , not all are winners , like the spearman whose attacks feel like they 're way harder to land hits with than they should be and which left me almost immediately flattened by the enemy every time I played as him . <p> So far Warhaven seems to be shaping up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a whole lot of entertaining moments in each chaotic match .

It 's truly a pleasure to have you as president of the ANC Veterans League with us today , shedding light on the League 's perspectives on crucial matters . For those unfamiliar with the ANC 's structure , could you describe the importance of the ANC Veterans League ? <p> Snuki Zikalala : Certainly . The Veterans League is critical . It is the most senior structure within the African National Congress . We have three leagues in total . There 's the Youth League , which held a conference about two weeks ago . The Women 's League , which also had its conference two weeks ago . And then we have the Veterans League , which had its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Membership in the Veterans League is n't for everyone -- it 's for comrades who are at least 60 years old and have 40 years of uninterrupted service to the African National Congress . When we see that someone has met these criteria in our electronic membership system , we request a brief personal profile and details about their involvement with the ANC underground , given that the ANC was banned in 1960 . We also ask for the names of at least two colleagues they worked with underground . As I was saying , this includes comrades who worked with COSATU , UDF , Mass Democratic Organisation , defence and aid campaigns . These are people who qualify having rendered 40 years of uninterrupted service to the African National Congress . We verify these claims with the named colleagues to confirm the authenticity of their service . So , that 's the caliber of individuals we have within the Veterans League . <p> Alec Hogg : So , these are individuals with vast life experience and substantial tenure in the ANC . Could you elaborate on the role @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strong resolutions this week ? How are these resolutions received ? <p> Snuki Zikalala : Our resolutions are taken very seriously . According to our constitution , it 's stated clearly that we have the authority to intervene in matters that impact the integrity and dignity of the organisation . We have the authority to intervene in instances of unethical behaviour , corruption , malfeasance , or gender-based violence . We have the power to assert that such things can not occur within the African National Congress . We have a considerable influence . For instance , last year , we persuaded the NEC of the ANC to ensure that six veterans , who are not NEC members , sit on the ANC 's disciplinary committee , while four are NEC members . We insist that veterans must drive discipline within the organisation . We also ensured that six members of the Veterans League are on the Disciplinary Committee on Appeals , and they are not NEC members . This committee is chaired by Comrade Johnny de Lange , an elected NEC member of the Veterans League , with four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as some NEC members might defend close comrades . Instead , we have independent individuals who can objectively assess allegations against any comrade . <p> Alec Hogg : The central issue that the media has highlighted is the ANC 's resolution not to form coalitions with the EFF at local government level . Could you elaborate on the reasoning behind this and what the implications might be if enacted , given that numerous local governments currently operate under coalitions between the two parties ? <p> Snuki Zikalala : We have a defined framework for coalitions , a document which we , as the Veterans League , influenced for adoption . We argued that coalitions should not be formed without a proper framework . This framework is founded on seven pillars . Firstly , coalitions must be based on a common minimum program , a citizen 's charter focusing on measurable service delivery and community development targets . Such a program should be public and open for community discussion . Secondly , we proposed that coalition partners should share values such as stability , accountability , ethics , good governance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equity , human dignity , and non-racialism . The third aspect is that the party with the most votes should lead the municipal coalition and executive positions should be allocated proportionately to votes obtained by coalition partners . Now , in assessing the EFF , we have found that they do not uphold good governance , ethical values , and integrity , nor do they respect the <p> Alec Hogg : So , they violate these principles ? <p> Snuki Zikalala : Precisely . The EFF fails to honour these principles . However , there are other parties that do respect them . For instance , the DA upholds the rule of law and respects our constitutional democracy . Consequently , there would n't be any issue if we were to form a coalition with the DA . Suppose they secured 45 percent of votes and we secured 44 , and they presented a program of action aimed at community development and service delivery , such as providing electricity , maintaining roads , and managing waste . There would n't be any problem in negotiating with any party committed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Alec Hogg : However , many within the ANC consider the DA as The Enemy , and what you 've just suggested might be a bitter pill to swallow . <p> Snuki Zikalala : We are conveying to our people that we 're not against collaboration with any party as long as it prioritises service delivery and community development . It 's all about providing services to the poor and society at large . If the proposed coalition partner respects the rule of law and our constitutional democracy , it 's worth considering . Of course , with the DA , there are certain red lines . They 've shown resistance to transformation , and some members exhibit racial bias . However , if they propose a common program for public service delivery and we mutually agree on it , I do n't foresee our society objecting to such an agreement . Our people are the ones bearing the brunt of these issues . If the DA pledges to impart governance skills , we would n't object to that . We 're open to collaboration with any party , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of law and our constitutional democracy prevents us from considering a coalition with them . <p> Alec Hogg : Currently , the ANC has coalitions with the EFF , and many analysts argue that they are a natural partner should the ANC not secure 50 percent after 2024 . <p> Snuki Zikalala : I would argue against the EFF being a natural partner . We 're competing for the same votes . The EFF has been very clear about their intentions to unseat us and their disdain for our president . How can we enter a coalition with the EFF when they 've expressed their aim to unseat our president and the African National Congress ? Furthermore , where is our pride and dignity if we enter into a coalition with a party that does n't uphold our values ? As veterans , we 're planning to meet with the top seven to discuss the issue of forming coalitions with parties that do n't respect the rule of law , economic development , and our constitution . This is about the livelihood of ordinary people and South Africans as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ top seven . There seems to be significant jostling for power , with Fikile Mbalula being outspoken about his ambition and Paul Mashatile conducting something of a media charm campaign . What 's the veterans ' take on this , considering it breaks from the ANC tradition of not publicly declaring leadership ambitions before elective conferences ? <p> Snuki Zikalala : To my knowledge , Fikile Mbalula has n't openly expressed presidential ambitions . Paul , although the deputy president , is not guaranteed the presidency if a change occurs . It 's the National Executive Committee that decides who becomes president . If there is jostling for presidency , it 's not fair to automatically presume that they will lead the African National Congress . <p> Alec Hogg : What 's the veterans ' viewpoint on the current state of South Africa ? <p> Snuki Zikalala : Could you be more specific , Alec ? <p> Alec Hogg : According to the SA Reserve Bank , we 're likely to have 0.6% economic growth this year and 1% next year . Given our population growth is at 1.5% , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ step in where possible . Where do the veterans think things went wrong , and what are their suggestions ? <p> Snuki Zikalala : As veterans , we are advocating for a social compact that we believe should have been signed at Nedlac , involving business , labor , and government . Business has shown willingness to participate and has proposed over two trillion rand for this compact , aiming to create jobs and revitalise the economy post-COVID . However , labor is still hesitating . We , as veterans , are committed to engaging with labor and ensuring they join in because the high unemployment rate is causing rising food costs , crime , and violence . We believe it 's essential to bring together business , labour , government , and community organisations to sign the social compact at Nedlac . Just last week , businesses agreed to support government-led economic growth , which is a positive development . The challenge now is to get labor on board , and we will ensure that happens . Economic recovery is crucial , given the high unemployment , increasing inflation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Congress , we firmly believe in signing the social compact . <p> Alec Hogg : What about the National Democratic Revolution ? In her recent book , Dr. Anthea Jeffrey claims it was conceived in the Soviet Union in the 1950s and is no longer suitable . However , it seems to remain a key part of the ANC 's economic blueprint . <p> Snuki Zikalala : The National Democratic Revolution , in essence , signifies providing quality services to our people . We need to address low education , stimulate economic growth , establish public healthcare in the country , and ensure economic stability . We need more black economic empowerment companies , not just those listed on the stock exchange , and we need to boost investment in our economy . The current state of our economy is stagnating . The National Democratic Revolution maintains that we must bring stability to our community and society , grow the economy , enforce the rule of law , and offer quality services to our people in all sectors . That 's the true meaning of the National Democratic Revolution . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Veterans League , you 've previously emphasised your focus on integrity .

The coup d'etat in Niger raises concerns over uranium supply , with the Kremlin 's indirect involvement in the region . As uranium-rich Niger could fall into Russia 's orbit , the world 's dependence on Moscow for atomic energy grows .

Register here . <h> The Long Arm of the Kremlin and the Politics of Uranium : Javier Blas <p> By Javier Blas <p> ( Bloomberg Opinion ) -- The town of Arlit , a desolate settlement on the southern fringes of the Sahara , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : the fight for the control of uranium , the fuel that powers the nuclear industry . <p> It was there , in the arid ranges of northern Niger , where French geologists found the radioactive mineral in the 1950s . Since then , French state-owned companies have dug it out from their former colony , transforming Niger into the world 's seventh-largest producer . In 2022 , the mines surrounding Arlit accounted for 25% of all European Union uranium imports . <p> Now , a coup d'Etat in the impoverished west African nationhas put that flow in jeopardy . <p> The commodity may not attract the headlines of oil , gas or even coal , but it 's crucial for a world desperately in need of carbon-free energy . <p> While the Kremlin does n't appear to be directly behind the coup , its propaganda machine has boosted anti-French and American sentiment all across the Sahel , the area just south of the Sahara . Unsurprisingly , the region has seen a bout of palace revolutions -- including in Burkina Faso , Chad , Guinea , Mali and Sudan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , pro-coup crowds have waved the Russian flag to denounce French imperialism . Yevgeny Prigozhin , head of the Russian Wagner paramilitary group , welcomed the military takeover . Wagner already operates in neighboring Mali after the coup there . The long arm of the Kremlin meddles in the geopolitics of energy in many ways -- not often in the most obvious ones . <p> If Niger falls into the Russian orbit , the world would depend even more on Moscow -- and its clients -- for atomic energy . Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan , two former Soviet republics , are among the world 's top uranium producers , accounting for about 50% of the world 's mined supply . Add Russia and Niger to that , and the share jumps to just above 60% . <p> Uranium is only the beginning of what 's called the nuclear fuel cycle . While Russia is also the world 's sixth-largest uranium miner , its real power lies elsewhere in that cycle : the transformation of the commodity into usable atomic fuel rods for civil reactors via so-called conversion and enrichment . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uranium conversion and enrichment , according to data from the World Nuclear Association . It 's a stranglehold that has created what US officials recently called a " strategic vulnerability " that 's " unsustainable . " About a third of all the enriched uranium consumed last year by US utilities came from Russia , at a cost of nearly $1 billionpaid to a company directly controlled by the Kremlin . More than a year since the Russian invasion of Ukraine , Washington has n't banned imports of Russian nuclear fuel . <p> For the first 50 years of the nuclear age , America was self-reliant , but with the end of the Cold War , it largely abandoned uranium mining , and crucially the complex conversion and enrichment processes . Today , the US is largely " dependent on international sources of nuclear fuel , including nations that do not have our best interests at heart , " according to John Wagner , head of the US Energy Department 's Idaho National Laboratory . <p> How Russia came to dominate the nuclear fuel industry is a mix of geological @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agreed to by Moscow and Washington just after the collapse of the Soviet Union . <p> First , Russia is endowed with uranium deposits , giving it a natural role in the industry . Then , its engineers developed a system to enrich the radioactive material that was significantly less energy-intensive than the method favored by French and American engineers , making it far cheaper.Those factors alone would have given Russia a big role in mining , conversion and enrichment . Then , in 1993 , the US and Russia agreed to what 's popularly known as the " megatons to megawatts " program , in which the highly enriched uranium from former Soviet nuclear warheads was transformed into low-enriched uranium and shipped to the US for civilian nuclear plants . Simply put , the US industry could n't compete against the Russians , and slowly , it died , to the disinterest of both Democratic and Republican White Houses . <p> Even before the invasion of Ukraine , the American nuclear industry was raising the alarm for its dependence on foreign sources . Since then , the talk among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Add now the trouble in Niger , and the situation looks more like an emergency . <p> Washington and Paris could develop a plan to boost production by reopening mothballed nuclear fuel plants , and boost diplomatic and military support to uranium-producing nations , starting in Niger . The effort wo n't be cheap . But with Vladimir Putin showing he 's ready to weaponize fossil fuels like oil and gas , the West needs to act before the Kremlin decides to weaponize even the peaceful use of uranium in a way that makes the transition to carbon-free energy even more difficult . <p> 1For decades , Western countries used an enrichment system known as gas diffusion which consumed significantly more electricity than the Russian method using centrifuges . At the peak of the Cold War , about 7% of the total US electricity generation was devoted to uranium enrichment , both for military and civilian purposes . <p> 2On top of its uranium mines , Niger is important for both France and the US to support military operations against Islamist groups in the Sahel region .

At least some of the comrades from the Radical Economic Transformation Spetsnaz would have increased the price points of the haute couture on show .

Administered costs serve to turn long-term capital savings into short-term consumption , destroying the basis of economic growth and employment opportunities . <p> The free market for labour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is illegal to employ a person at a wage that reflects his value . The state legislates the productive value of an individual and any voluntary transaction below that arbitrary number is against the law . Employers have been turned into criminals with minimum wage legislation . Nobody wants to break the law , that is why youth unemployment is at 80% . <p> When does this end ? It ends when the taxpayer also becomes a government employee to live off the taxes of other government employees . 
@@100989239 <p> The deal , which saw a 5% stake in the financial services group effectively issued to five new beneficiary trusts and existing empowerment partner Ubuntu-Botho , has been under water since early 2020 , when the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic rattled through markets . <p> Of course , no one could 've predicted a global pandemic , followed by Russia 's invasion of Ukraine and surging global inflation . <p> The result is that the group 's share price has traded below the R70 issue price of the 111 million shares practically since just one year into the five-year deal . <p> Sanlam provided half the funding of the transaction , with Standard Bank providing the other half via preference shares in the special purpose vehicle ( SPV ) and equity-secured funding . <p> Or , as Sanlam describes the situation : " Due to the negative impacts on the Sanlam share price , the Funding SPV remains in a negative equity position , a situation which has existed since March 2020 and is likely to persist in the short-term until the repayment date of the funding in March 2024 . " <p> Sanlam 's problem is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secured by Sanlam shares . <p> Further declines in the group 's share price could see a breach of debt covenants which would force the disposal of a " large block of shares " which , it says , " is likely to negatively impact the Sanlam share price " . <p> Sanlam admits there is " unlikely benefit " to any of the beneficiaries of the transaction , which include trusts for rural and urban poor black women , professional black women , black youth , black business partners and broad-based groups and group employees . <p> To remedy this , Sanlam will purchase the A preference shares in the funding SPV from Standard Bank for R2.421 billion . <p> It will fund this from existing cash resources , with a small adjustment for interest between the end of June and when it is finalised . <p> ( Even if the share price holds up , the second issue is that the subscription SPV is required to dispose of 85 million shares in Sanlam in the open market once redemptions occur in March next year . This would n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ double the level it is currently .

These are accounting entries necessitated by the group 's share price , among other factors , and the group has been clear that these " impairments can reverse in future periods based on the movement in the group 's share price " . <p> The group says it anticipates that the funding SPV structure " may be unwound following its maturity in March 2024 " and that it " will continue to consider alternatives in the best interest of stakeholders to implement the orderly unwinding " of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 85 million Sanlam shares from the subscription SPV . <p> At the end of the first quarter this year , Sanlam reported " discretionary capital " of R3 billion . <h> 295 <h> 13 <h> 71 <h> 2 <p> @Falconetti , your Advisor or Broker must sit with you to explain Portfolio choices on your Retirement Annuities .

@@101010230 <h> Why cyber protection is vital for digital survival <p> Aug 16 , 2023 <p> In the wake of today 's highly interconnected digital landscape , African enterprises are increasingly battling a ballooning number of cyber threats that have enormous potential to cripple their day-to-day operations , expose sensitive data , and inflict irreparable financial losses . <p> By Peter French , GM : MEA &amp; South Asia at Acronis <p> Driven by the acceleration of technological advances and the relentless malicious actors becoming more sophisticated , it is now becoming crucial for businesses in the region to rethink their overall approach to cybersecurity and data protection as their ultimate defense . <p> In view of these emerging challenges that are seemingly slowing down the region 's much-needed digital transformation , there 's a growing need to identify and explore the common cyber threats faced by African enterprises and the underlying risks associated with a lack of investment in cyber protection infrastructure . <p> It is also crucial to highlight the key components of a strong cyber protection strategy , the emerging technologies such as the use of artificial intelligence ( AI ) in the cyber protection space , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Africa . <p> The changing face of cyber threats <p> A recent Interpol report singled out online scams , digital extortion , business email compromise , ransomware , and botnets as Africa 's top five cyber threats . These threats continue to pose significant risks to individuals and organizations across the continent as far as protection from cybercrime is concerned . <p> These threats have evolved over time , becoming more sophisticated and lucrative as cyber criminals deploy newer and more complex methods . <p> One emerging and largely alarming trend that also featured prominently at the just concluded Africa 's first-ever GITEX exhibition held in Marrakech , Morocco is the use of AI and chatbot-driven technology by cybercriminals to deploy undetectable malware . <p> Such technology has enabled them to design and carry out attacks with greater efficiency and effectiveness . The proliferation of these threats demands a proactive approach to cyber protection . <p> The cost of inadequate cybersecurity investment <p> The lack of investment in cybersecurity infrastructure has exposed African businesses to grave risk in terms of not being able to compete favorably with their international counterparts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's business landscape , it is no longer a matter of whether an organization becomes a cyberattack victim , but more importantly when . By 2017 , the cost of cyberattacks on African economies was estimated to be over US$3 billion . In terms of cost to the economy , these attacks alone cost South Africa over $573-million , the Nigerian economy $500-million , and the Kenyan economy $36-million in 2014 . <p> And with Africa 's growing internet connectivity and the casual approach to cyber protection by companies in the region , these numbers are expected to rise significantly . To mitigate the risks , African businesses must invest in robust cyber protection solutions , adopt best practices , and take a proactive approach to safeguard their digital assets . <p> Building a strong cyber protection strategy <p> A comprehensive and unified approach to cybersecurity is essential for African enterprises on the back of growing and evolving threats . Deploying a multi-level defense system is , therefore , paramount . It begins with implementing strong passwords and employing multi-factor authentication whenever possible . <p> Backing up data and systems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of protection against data loss , corruption , and system failures . Adhering to the 3-2-1 backup rule -- maintaining three copies of data , with two stored in different locations and one off-site -- can ensure business continuity . <p> Furthermore , companies should also seriously consider using multi-factor authentication and immutable backups to protect against modification by attackers . However , backup alone is not enough ; prevention , detection , and mitigation of cyber attacks earlier in the kill chain are equally important and should be integrated into the overall cybersecurity strategy . <p> Embracing emerging technologies and trends <p> To stay ahead of cyber threats , African enterprises must embrace emerging technologies and trends in the cyber protection space . Automation and AI/Machine Learning ( ML ) tools are increasingly being utilised by cyber attackers to develop and deploy sophisticated attacks more frequently . As more African businesses integrate cloud and software as a service applications , attackers are also shifting their focus to cloud resources and APIs for direct and lethal attacks . <p> Infrastructure tools by service providers including deployment of resources and remote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Companies must , therefore , integrate relevant mission-critical tools , such as the Acronis EDR , and techniques that are able to detect and prevent attacks targeting their digital infrastructure . <p> Consolidating and simplifying IT environments , along with leveraging integration and AI/ML technologies to automate processes , can help minimize human errors and strengthen overall cyber protection posture . <p> The future of cyber protection in Africa <p> Africa 's thriving digital ecosystem and cyber protection landscape are expected to face further challenges largely because of emerging technologies and digitalization . Data breaches and ransomware attacks will remain largely profitable for attackers , necessitating a persistent focus on cyber protection . <p> In response , individuals and organisations should implement sophisticated multi-level cyber protection strategies , adhering to best practices and leveraging advanced technologies .

This is something we frequently hear , but how are we preparing them ? <p> South Africa is a nation with many issues , and the ongoing problems that South African youth face today are extremely troubling . In this article , we speak to industry experts and ask them how we can help prepare our children for the future . <p> Future-proof youth with software development skills <p> The most in-demand expertise and one of the most challenging sets of skills to get on the South African market actually remain inside the software development field . <p> Andrew Bourne , regional manager : Africa at Zoho , believes that " With low-code platforms , citizen developers can create complex and powerful business applications without requiring costly and lengthy training . In the year ahead , universities must ensure that educators are equipped with the skills to train youth for the demands of the technological world . <p> " We need to future-proof children so that they are equipped to apply for jobs that require digital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can help do this by ensuring that educators also have the skills to encourage children to become more digitally literate . " <p> Nurture the creative potential of the youth <p> In order to sustain growth in any industry , employers and established professionals need to nurture the creative potential of the youth . <p> Anton Gillis , CEO at Kruger Gate Hotel , believes that one of the key aspects to growing tomorrow 's talent is fostering an engaging approach to working with young people . <p> " It 's amazing what we can stand to learn while engaging with the youth ; no one will teach you about social media or online platform developments quicker than them . In an effort to prepare the youth for their future , we should work with them . Within this collaborative strategy , we can benefit from fresh perspectives , and they can gain expert advice , " states Gillis . <p> Teach sustainable farming <p> As world hunger looms , the impact of agriculture on addressing food shortages can not be underestimated . Teaching the youth about a more sustainable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing so is Rick Hein , MD of MicroThumbs . <p> As a supplier of microgreens to retailers nationwide , Hein has established a small , indoor , vertical farming model at Alberton High School in Gauteng , where pupils learn to grow their own food . <p> " The world 's food supply-to-demand ratio is increasingly becoming unbalanced , and globally , we 're running out of space to keep up . By showing young people how to grow food in small urban areas , they learn about food security and self-sufficiency and are given lifelong skills on how to survive eating healthy foods they 've grown themselves , " he says . <p> Hein 's aim is to roll out the urban farm model in schools across South Africa . " Growing food connects young people to nature and fosters a future stewardship of the natural world ; it 's a priceless lesson to learn for the uncertain world of tomorrow . " <p> Educate on the importance of saving <p> It 's never too soon to start talking to children about the importance of saving and thinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money and the benefit of saving for big-ticket items like a car or a home , you will set them up to be financially stable later in life , says Carl Coetzee , CEO of BetterBond . <p> Young adults need to know that they should consider investing in property as soon as they are financially able to do so . Advise them to think about setting aside money for a deposit so that they pay less each month on their bond , save on interest over the long term , and ensure that they consider the benefits of owning rather than renting , advises Coetzee . <p> " Renting may suit their lifestyle , but having property as an asset is a long-term investment . Homeownership may seem like something only grownups do , but by explaining the basics of buying a home from an early age , you will help lay the foundation that will ensure your children make sound financial decisions when the time comes for them to invest in property , " concludes Coetzee . <p> A reading youth is a capable youth <p> South Africa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are the future entrepreneurs , innovators , and job creators . With boundless potential and fresh perspectives , young South Africans have the potential to drive transformative change . <p> However , we must fix the alarming drop in literacy levels in the country . South Africa ranked last out of 57 countries assessed in the Progress in International Reading Literacy Study , which tested the reading ability of 400,000 students globally in 2021 . Illiteracy among South African children rose from 78% in 2016 to 81% in 2021 . <p> " One way of achieving this is by taking advantage of the mobile technology advancements we have made as a country , " says Lea-Anne Moses , executive director and trustee at the Fundza Literacy Trust . " Currently , some 95% of South Africans have access to a mobile phone , and smartphone penetration in the country has surpassed 90% . <p> " We should be able to contribute to changing this situation by making sure that reading material on digital and mobile devices reaches young people in order to help us cultivate a reading culture . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young people entering the workforce are equipped with the right skills needed to thrive in the new , digitally transformed world of work should be a key focus this International Youth Day , and indeed every day . <p> " Achieving this requires a holistic , integrated approach that is focussed on fit-for-purpose skills and whole-person development . It also requires the collective effort of stakeholders across industries , because business should be a platform for change , " says Ursula Fear , senior talent program manager at Salesforce <p> Empowering young people with the right digital skills , together with an agile approach to learning , is central to combating unemployment both today and into the future .

Moreover , she is now able to provide employment opportunities to five disadvantaged individuals who Iddrisu employs as sales assistants . <p> " Things were very good when we started but now there is a lot of competition .

Several initiatives that should have offered advantages to Africa 's largest economy , have also , unfortunately , been met with barriers to entry by Nigeria . <p> The African Continental Free Trade Area ( AfCFTA ) , for example , was supposed to provide regional integration of goods and services between African countries .

The unstable power supply means I am running my business on a generator 24/7 , which means I am spending a lot of money on fuel , " she says . <p> About 25% of the Nigerian population are considered to be Gen Z and have an insatiable appetite for fashion pieces , according to Iddrisu . <p> " The young ladies of today want trendy items that no one has and they want items that are not too expensive so they can change them regularly without breaking the bank .

Something has to be done , " says Amusan . <p> One solution that has been suggested by experts is to perhaps transform the fashion economy into a circular one .

China 's largest developer , Country Garden , lost $7.1 billion in the first six months of 2023 ; investors concerned about potential debt default have sent its stock plummeting . <p> One major -- if indirect -- reason China 's real estate industry is so shaky is that local governments are heavily dependent on tax revenue from land sales , as well as property taxes and real estate development fees . At the same time , about 70% of the general population 's assets are invested in real estate . <p> Those facts enticed developers and local governments alike to borrow excessively to fund new development .

With the reissue of his opus , Black Beauty , Kwela , who died of an apparent asthma attack in 2003 , re-enters the conversation , opening the door for a reappraisal of his talents and another take on this overlooked gem . <p> Initially released in 1975 on the Joburg/Soweto label , a subsidiary of the Satbel Recording Company , Black Beauty embodies the contradictory nature of Kwela ; a reputed jazz snob whose experiential knowledge of the musics of Africa and its diaspora rendered him chameleon-like . <p> Kwela 's biography exists in scattershot form , with fragments contributed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which originates on the South Coast of present-day KwaZulu-Natal , the guitarist 's birthplace is commonly listed as Chesterville , a small township in Durban between Cato Manor and Westville . <p> According to fellow guitarist Madala Kunene , it is these musically fertile locales that define Kwela 's earliest musical encounters , which included watching older brothers who played guitar and other instruments . In 1954 , at the age of 15 , Kwela got his first " proper " guitar and then set his sights on a professional career . <p> " You can trace the influence of Cato Manor in his eclectic style , " says Kunene of the racially mixed inner-city ghetto that was the hub of subversive urban culture from the early 20th century until much of it was demolished in the late 1950s and 1960s . The promulgation of the Group Areas Act in 1950 , which separated residential zones according to race , had a wide effect on societal networks and would go on to affect the fortunes of active and upcoming musicians . <p> " He and his peers would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kunene , Vonco Khumalo and Dixie Sibiya . Kunene my father and Ernest Khoza were experimenting with marabi on guitar , which later morphs into township jazz . <p> " I 'd say Allen , by virtue of having learnt from those guys , was privy to how marabi , with the influence of and interplay with evolving American styles , becomes township jazz . In that regard , Allen was like a Joe Pass -- naturally quick-fingered -- and also keen to pick up on what American guitarists were doing . We called Sandile Shange who collaborated with Kwela Wes Montgomery and Sdumo Ngidi was Barney Kessel . It was the intermixing of styles that alters marabi into township jazz . But there were others , too , from Cyril Magubane who formed Heshoo Beshoo , to Alpheus Nkosi an early adopter of the electric guitar in Durban and an obscure character I only remember as Hloni . A lot of guys learned from Hloni . " <p> Writing in Jazzlife on what would have been Kwela 's 80th birthday , Sam Mathe lists the guitarist , who leaves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ player in Durban , as a " chief composer " for kwela proponent Spokes Mashiyane . Working with Mashiyane , Kwela helps to forge the harmonic structure of kwela , a marabi-based style with pennywhistle melodies as the lead . <p> Soon parting ways with Mashiyane , Kwela falls in with the Dorkay House scene , a hub for jazz and theatre . This amalgam of influences is evinced by the cinematic scope of pianist , composer and arranger Gideon Nxumalo 's landmark 1970 recording Early-Mart , in tribute to the slain drummer , Early Mabuza . Kwela participates in this album , orchestrated by Nxumalo , a mainstay at Dorkay House and a maestro whom Kwela considered a master and mentor . <p> Produced by Rashid Vally and released on his imprint Soultown Records ( which , in 1974 , becomes As-Shams/The Sun ) , the album presages a golden age of South African jazz that would spill over into the early 1980s . Although Kwela 's performance is not credited , a norm at the time , he puts in a star turn , with emotive licks in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same decade , Kwela turns a corner in his recording career , releasing the warmly produced Soul Bag on Atlantic City in 1972 as the leader of an initially uncredited Allen Kwela Octet . <p> Kwela 's experiments on Alex Express by The Cliffs , which was released on J-Town Records in the mid-1970s , caught the ear of a young Bheki Khoza . <p> " I copied that recording , listening to what he was playing long before I met him , " says Khoza one Friday evening in 2023 , at a rehearsal spot near Jeppestown . " Back then when we 'd form bands in Durban , there was an older guy named Zithulele Dlamini who would guide us . He had albums by Allen Kwela , Dick Khoza , Heshoo Beshoo and the like . That 's how I got influenced by Allen 's playing . His marabi was polished . He added passing chords and was very advanced in harmony . " <p> By the mid-1970s , Kwela would have already been part of the motley crew of guitarists who hung around Lucky 's , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " There was always this competitive spirit , but particularly with him and Themba Mokoena , " says Pelican scenester and then-Harari member Sipho " Hotstix " Mabuse . " But Allen was almost a one-man band . He could play guitar and add other structures within the music , like backing bass . " <p> In 1975 , when Kwela stepped into the state-of-the-art Satbel Music Recording Studios on 195 Marshall Street to work on Black Beauty for the Joburg/Soweto labels , the long wave of Mannenberg 's popularity was just beginning its swell . Its effect on the craft of South African jazz production , however , was immediate . Mannenberg 's open-ended structure , in which a chord progression unfurls into a series of solos and a jam-like atmosphere , resulting in a hypnotic , almost 15-minute composition , became a hugely replicable template . <p> Polished : Bheki Khoza ( above ) , himself an accomplished guitarist , was influenced in his early years by the playing of Allen Kwela . Photo : Lauren Mulligan/Gallo Images <p> While Black Beauty stands as a distinctive showcase of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get buried in the mix by inadequate technology that had defined much of his output hitherto , he was still conflicted by the pressure for commercial success . <p> The title track opens things up with a strong marabi feel and a cyclical melody that centres soloing . " If you knew Allen , you 'd dispute that it 's him playing here , because he is playing the very thing that he was criticising , " says contemporary and former Movers and Boyoyo Boys member Lulu Masilela of the opening song . " Maybe this valorisation of American jazz was a viewpoint imposed on him . But what I know is that musicians from Durban -- wow ! That 's where the Americans landed . Durban , Cape Town , Port Elizabeth , East London . People from there were too jazzy and they dug jazz before everyone else . " <p> Masilela argues that Kwela 's styling of the title track was " out of character " , probably a result of bowing down to pressure to produce a commercially viable product . Masilela says the song 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , most likely at the behest of a producer . " Mbaqanga is the foundation , " says Masilela . " But I think , in general , Allen 's style evolved out of wanting to evade being copied . " <p> A lot about Black Beauty remains in the realm of speculation . For one , its line-up is contested , left to those who can ( mis ) identify signature styles by ear . Over the course of several sessions with Gallo archivist Robert Allingham , Masilela reached the conclusion that Black Beauty was helmed by a squad including Dennis Mpale on trumpet , Kippie Moeketsi on first alto sax , Barney Rachabane on second alto sax , Stanley Sitole on tenor sax , Dimpie Tshabalala on piano , Boy Ramotsie on bass , Gilbert Matthews on drums and Sipho Gumede on bass for Mild Storm . <p> The producer for the sessions , Patric van Blerk , remembers little of the time , except that Kwela was his usual strong-willed self , unwilling to be nudged towards the pop trends of the day . " He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the time , " says Van Blerk . " At the time , we had had some success with saxophonist Mike Makhalamele and singer Margaret Singana . Baba Matiwane , my partner in the black music areas , was very closely linked to all the radio stations . With Allen 's stuff at the time , and I 'm open to correction , it did n't pick up a lot of airplay . Radio thought it was too jazzy and not geared for a broader , more commercial market . I do n't think that was Allen 's target -- to do commercial music . He wanted to do what he wanted to do . " Pivotally , Van Blerk remembers that he never saw Kwela again after the session . <p> If Kwela 's star and recorded output waned somewhat from that point on , his influence continued to loom large over South Africa 's music scene . " When I came to Joburg in the early ' 80s with Sakhile , I was already playing some of the things from Alex Express , " says Khoza . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excited . I just approached him straight and wanted lessons . But I was playing in a band that was paying a lot of money , playing in all the pop festivals . Because of the declining popularity of that ' jazzman ' trend , he was already playing in small clubs , with very low pay . " <p> Khoza says the lessons never came because Kwela 's Yeoville pad at that time was a halfway house , and lessons could always be put off for the following week , but he did follow the man around Joburg stages , absorbing his chord work into a style of his own . <p> " When I started playing jazz guitar , " says Billy Monama , another devotee , " his music was on the airwaves . Seven Days Ago from the Sheer Sound album The Broken Strings of Allen Kwela was a hit . It was playing on every radio station . The song was released in 1998 and I started playing guitar in 1997 . " <p> For Monama , who has embarked on a comparative study of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bounds and limits stipulated for black musicians . " It was always known that a black guitar player would play amarabi , but he went to study and understand improvisation because every jazz musician needs to know how to improvise -- it 's an expression of the inner self . He was the ultimate expressionist on the guitar . " <p> For all the different narratives and perspectives on Kwela , perhaps now with this timely reissue his contributions can be re-assessed and his music enjoyed afresh . His place in the canon of South African jazz guitarists can be cemented . <p> This is a slightly edited version of Kwanele Sosibo 's liner notes of Allen Kwela 's Black Beauty , recently reissued by Matsuli Music .

@@102177236 <p> Prosus 's new interim CEO inherits a conundrum from his predecessor : how to bridge the yawning gap between the value of the company 's stock and its assets . <p> It will be a challenge for Ervin Tu , who assumed the top job last week following the departure of Bob van Dijk . Prosus , the Dutch investment arm of Naspers , is still valued at well below the sum of its parts despite its push to unknot a complicated cross-holding structure and boost share buybacks . <p> The sticking point is its US$93-billion stake in Chinese tech giant Tencent Holdings , with some investors steering clear of firms with large China exposure due to the country 's faltering post-Covid rebound and rising geopolitical tensions . Prosus 's stock performance is highly correlated to that of Tencent . <p> On paper , the aggregate value of the Amsterdam-listed investment firm 's assets is worth about ? 125-billion <p> Strategically , Prosus is " doing the right things " in terms of simplifying its structure , said Osamu Yamagata , a London-based portfolio manager at Abrdn . But the firm 's ability to narrow the discount to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of their control and that is around the attractiveness of the Chinese economy " . <p> On paper , the aggregate value of the Amsterdam-listed investment firm 's assets is worth about ? 125-billion ( R2.5-trillion ) , or ? 45.80/share , according to a company tracker as of 27 September . But on public markets , its share price is almost 40% below that figure . Essentially , all Prosus assets outside of the Tencent investment -- bought in 2001 in one of its most successful bets ever -- are valued at less than zero . <p> To convince investors that it 's undervalued , Prosus launched a buyback last year , funded by a gradual selling of its Tencent stake . Having traded more than 50% below the sum of its parts for first half of last year , the buyback announcement quickly narrowed the gap to 30% . But since then , the discount has been fluctuating around the historical mean of around 36% , according to estimates by HSBC analysts . <h> Unusual arrangement <p> Van Dijk stepped down last week as the head of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he had set up . In an unusual arrangement , Amsterdam-based Prosus owned nearly half of its Cape Town-headquartered parent company Naspers . The structure , which was introduced in 2021 as an attempt to address the distorting effect of the company 's large stake in Tencent , was criticised by some investors as complex and ineffective . <p> " We have no plans to further simplify our group structure , " Prosus said in an e-mailed response to questions . On the discount , the company said : " We have n't given an exact discount level at which we expect to trade but we are comfortable that there is a long way to go before we will stop . " <p> As a first step for how Tu can attract investors and boost Prosus 's value , analysts have said monetisation on some smaller assets could help .

The current setup remains complex as it uses two classes of stocks to give controlling parties extra voting rights , said Abrdn 's Yamagata . <p> Still , for now , Prosus 's stock performance will be highly related to that of Tencent , given three-quarters of its sum-of-the-parts value lies in the Chinese tech giant . While Prosus 's portfolio contains over 80 companies that operate in areas from food delivery to fintech , much of these are small unlisted assets that do n't have live pricing . <p> " Prosus may serve as an imperfect proxy for the Chinese venture for some time , " Bloomberg Intelligence 's Davies wrote in a note . -- Henry Ren , with Loni Prinsloo , ( c ) 2023 Bloomberg LP

The complexity of African regional corporate treasuries is that they need to first access and then analyse a plethora of incoming insights and data points , and then engineer ways in which they are going to create that specific currency liquidity in partnership with their liquidity providers . <p> But that 's not all , this liquidity then needs to be made available at the right time for subsidiary treasuries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obligations . <p> But before we go any further , let 's unpack exactly what the concept of a digital treasury means .

Many African countries are threatened by the loss of their connectivity to the global financial system ( through SWIFT ) , creating a significant risk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The extent to which the corporate treasury 's local/regional banker has consistent and reliable access to foreign currency clearing services to facilitate cross border payments/receivables is crucial .

The treasury has a responsibility to keep a daily intraday finger on the pulse of cashflow and the overnight liquidity position of companies -- particularly those that operate across geographies , or which have multiple business pillars . <p> A Procurement Roadmap <p> There 's a second component in the operation of the procurement department .

They need to ensure the health of the corporate cash flow is intact and well synchronised with the organisation 's growth plans . The treasurer needs to make sure that the schedule of obligations or repayments is well communicated and understood , since such liquidity events are often large ( for example dividend payments or capital market repayments ) . <p> This is especially important in an African context where availability to FX liquidity may not be available at the required time for these chunky payments . <p> Digital for Clients <p> There 's also a strong link into clients and the sales activity of an organisation .

I think one very important implication is the price of crude oil , which is going to skyrocket . This may have a very negative impact on the South African economy , as it will in the rest of world . I know the Russians are cutting their production of crude oil by some 20 000 barrels , and the crisis in Israel is going to put more pressure on oil production . We know that Iran and Saudi Arabia are also playing a role , so we can expect this , " explains Prof Duvenhage . <p> What to expect from Israel ... and Iran <p> " Israel is in a state of war , and they are going to take drastic action . I am expecting Israel to not only take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I think there is going to be a ground invasion . Israel was not expecting the attack . They were completely unprepared and are now on the defensive , but that will not stay so for long . <p> " Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has his own internal problems , and I will not be surprised if the lack of flow of information can be attributed to internal sabotage . There may be questions , because there are huge internal political fights involving corruption cases against Netanyahu , but it is clear that Israel is united at the moment . I am expecting a long , escalating war that may rocket to the level where world actors will become involved , " says Prof Duvenhage . <p> " I am expecting Israel to retaliate with all its power on all levels from the sea , from the land , from the air -- even from space if possible . It means the region will be very destabilised in many ways . " <p> According to him , one of the actors that may be activated is Iran -- which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orchestrate the attack -- as well as the USA . <p> " We have already seen that the Americans are repositioned close to the coast or in the vicinity to support Israel where possible . There are also other forms of support coming from the West , and from a Western perspective , this is seen on the same level as the 9/11 attacks for the Americans . We also know what type of action the Americans took after 9/11 against Al-Qaeda and with the war in Iraq and Afghanistan . I am expecting that the Israelis -- with the support of the West -- will follow a similar path , but then I am expecting very strong counter moves coming from the side of Iran and Lebanon . <p> What does the future hold ? <p> " We are currently living in a very unstable world , especially if you look at the greater Middle East . Think about Syria and what is happening there . Think about a nuclear Iran and the Russian-Ukrainian war that is going negatively for Russia , the close connections between Russia and Iran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many ways supporting both the Hezbollah and Hamas . The conflict has definitely been internationalised and I will not be surprised if the attack on Israel is a deliberate attempt to take attention and support away from Ukraine . I do not have any precise evidence to support that , but I think that may be the case , " Prof Duvenhage concludes .

They were born between 1981 and 1996 , they are called millennials and , according to Prof Roland Goldberg from the Faculty of Economic and Management Sciences at the North-West University ( NWU ) , retailers would be remiss to ignore their specific spending needs . <p> " Firstly , I would say there is an emphasis on experiences and creating memories . Millennials tend to prioritise spending on experiences like travel or dining out and attending events , rather than focusing on material possessions . Then there is online shopping . Millennials are known for their comfort and proficiency in using e-commerce platforms like Takealot or Amazon and are definitely more likely to shop online than previous generations . They are also known as digital natives . Having grown up with technology , they are very tech savvy and are greatly influenced by online reviews and social media recommendations when making buying decisions , " he says . <p> " Many millennials are much more conscious of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ support brands and products that align with their values , which include sustainable and ethically sourced items . They are also more debt conscious than other generations , and many prioritise saving or paying off existing debts over extravagant spending , " explains Prof Goldberg , who is an expert in consumer behaviour , market segmentation and place marketing at the faculty 's School of Marketing Management . <p> " There is definitely room for improvement in South Africa in terms of understanding and meeting millennials ' specific needs and desires . " <p> According to him , there are a number of ways to better tap into the millennial market : " The most important thing for retailers to do is to establish a user-friendly website or mobile app for online shopping , along with secure and convenient payment options . And there are so many well-known retailers that still do not have this option available , which is quite worrisome . Also , retailers should promote sustainability . They should offer eco-friendly and socially responsible products and communicate this offering or their commitment to sustainability to their valued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the importance of using social media platforms . <p> " Retailers must engage on social media and utilise platforms such as Instagram and TikTok for influence , and create various marketing campaigns that are in line with the needs and the characteristics of millennials .

I see many retailers in South Africa that are still very much focused on Facebook , but they should start moving their focus . "

@@102705236 <p> CROW is South Africa 's oldest wildlife rehabilitation centre . For the past 43 years , the centre has been rehabilitating and releasing wild animals and birds . But due to the COVID-19 pandemic , which suspended their international volunteer programme for two years , combined with the devastating floods Kwazulu-Natal in 2022 and the current cost of living crisis , the centre is now in danger of closing down . In an interview with BizNews , Clint Halkett-Siddall , the Director of CROW , shed light on the centre 's current plight . What was once a sanctuary rescuing 3,000 to 4,000 injured , orphaned and displaced animals and birds annually is now facing a grim reality : a mere 10 months of operational costs stand between them and closure . Halkett-Siddall said CROW has , in a bid to keep their doors open , initiated a BackaBuddy campaign , reaching out for support .

Urbanisation , he said , is exacting a significant toll on South Africa 's wildlife . -- Linda van @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the BizNews Insider to keep you up to speed with the content that matters .

Register here . <p> Listen here <p> Excerpts from the Interview <h> Rescuing between 3,000 and 4,000 a year from 1977 <p> Crow is dedicated to rescuing , rehabilitating , and releasing all wildlife within KwaZulu Natal . We rescue between 3,000 and 4,000 animals every year and have between 300 and 400 animals on our property at any given time . As we head into our busy baby season , we currently have 355 animals on our property , but that number is sure to increase over the coming months . <p> We have permits for every species of wildlife in Kwazulu-Natal , including lizards , reptiles , antelope , game species , birds of prey , garden variety birds , and even small shrews . Additionally , we have permits for threatened and protected species both in the marine and terrestrial environments . <p> A lot of people do know about us . It is quite scary though being going for 43 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't know about us . It 's all about awareness . But I think as soon as anybody puts it on a chat group , somebody will know about us on WhatsApp or the internet . They can Google us . We do show up top of the Google list when wildlife rehabilitation is put in . So people find us in many different ways . <p> We also welcome people to drop off animals if they are not a dangerous species , for example , a baby bird or something , just to help us with fuel costs , things like that because it is quite an intensive and expensive operation to run . <h> The impact of COVID , KZN floods , cost of living <p> Everything 's gone up obviously with the inflation , currently with fuel , food prices for our feed for our animals , amongst other things . But the International Volunteer Program which generates about 50% of our overheads basically went from 80% bookings down to 0% overnight , and that lasted for about two years . So for two years , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of income each month . <p> since COVID regulations were phased out . We did start getting a lot of international volunteers coming through in the post-COVID tourism boom , I think , with tourism . I think it really was locked inside for so long and they wanted to get out . So this last June , July , and August being the European and American holidays , we were actually fully booked , which was fantastic . And it is slowing down a little bit now going out of the holiday season . But fully booked , which was fantastic . And it is slowing down a little bit now going out of the holiday season . But we have got bookings , one or two people up to three people all the way through to June next year . So things are definitely looking up on our volunteer program side . <p> Due to inflation , the cost of fuel , food prices for our feed for our animals , and other expenses have increased . Additionally , the International Volunteer Program generates about 50% of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and lasted for about two years . So , for two years , we were losing out on about R150,000 to R180,000 worth of income each month . <p> However , since COVID regulations have phased out , we have started receiving a lot of international volunteers coming through in the post-COVID tourism boom . This last June , July , and August being the European and American holidays , we were fully booked , which was fantastic . Although it is slowing down a little bit now going out of the holiday season , we have got bookings from one or two people up to three people all the way through to June next year . So , things are definitely looking up on our volunteer program side . <h> Struggling to keep their doors open <p> CROW has been struggling to keep their doors open due to a loss of income over the past few years . With people 's pockets being tighter nowadays , our supporters do n't have as much spare change to donate towards us as they had in the past . We were facing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' worth of operational costs left to be able to keep our doors open . <p> We launched a BackaBuddy campaign that 's doing quite well . You can go on there to support us as well as our website . We have been extremely blessed since our appeal went out and we received a lot of support from members of the public , whether it be that they are starting their fundraising campaigns for us , same as corporations . We have had some charities and some trusts reach out to us , but the support has been overwhelming . We 're not out of the water yet , but we still have quite a way to go . If anybody is in a position that they can support , it would be highly appreciated . You can go onto our website , which is www.crokzn.co.za . You can give us a call . Our details are on there as well if you 'd prefer to get our banking details . Otherwise , we do have the BackaBuddy crowdfunding campaign and then we also have a PayPal account that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to change attitudes towards wildlife preservation are in South Africa <p> Education is the key to conservation , and PROS are very active in education . In the past 14 years since we revamped our wildlife education program termed Wildlife Warriors , we 've reached over 160,000 learners . And strangely enough , last year for the first time in the past 10 years , the number of admissions dropped to just below 3,000 animals that came through our doors . So there could be other factors involved there , but I 'd love to say that it 's down to education and the perception change in our country . <h> The best cage is an empty cage <p> Reptiles are my favourite animal , so I always bring a reptile into the conversation . And we did have a crocodile released last year , a 1.2-meter crocodile in Tongaat that was on a farm and was going to be destroyed . But we went out , rescued it , and it was released in Tula Tula . We currently also have a baby crocodile that hatched out as an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who illegally harvested it . So , we 're raising the croc at the moment . We 've got a beautiful baby Blesbok that just came in . Poachers going to use it for the muti trade and he 's doing extremely well . Then we 've also got some genets that are about to be released . We 've got a group of dassies that are about to be released . Our vervet monkeys will be going out to Pongola next month once the good rains have come , and we 're releasing them on a 40,000-hectare reserve that 's a five-year rehabilitation program with the vervet monkeys . So there 's plenty going on and many success stories . I think every time an animal is released back into the wild , it just brings up emotions and it 's just such a good feeling . <p> I believe it 's important , especially in areas where urbanisation is taking such a large toll on our wildlife and we 're losing our habitat for these animals , and there is more human and animal conflict . It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and return them to wildlife areas where they belong . This way , they will have a secure future and be able to keep the species going for not just us but also our future generations . Education is also extremely important to ensure that the next generation is more conservation-conscious . <p> We are not a sanctuary at all . So any animals that ca n't be released , especially if they 're threatened or protected species , we send those to specialised breeding programs for threatened and protected species . However , our philosophy is that the best cage is an empty cage . So if an animal is going to spend the rest of its life in a cage , then usually the decision will be made that it will be more humane to euthanize that animal .

So , that meant we had loads of physical barriers from registering . Now , we can do online voter registration , and this is game-changing . There are a few reasons why you have to go register . The first thing is you can not vote if you are not registered . It 's as simple as that . <p> So if you do n't register , the battle is lost already . Number one , you can not vote without registering . Number two , we 're now in the age of coalition politics in South Africa . So , we 've seen in the last two years and a bit with the various coalitions in SA , you either have stable coalitions run by the DA and its coalition partners where it 's based on principles and values , or you have coalitions of corruption where the various other parties do horse trading and just run the cities into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and one seat , you are able to form a stable coalition , or not . The way that our politics works with proportional representation is that every member of parliament seats represents about 50,000 votes , and for 34,000 votes , it is rounded up to a full MP . That means suddenly with one seat , we form a coalition that is stable and gets our country out of this mess of streets exploding , corruption , cadre deployment , and load shedding . So , we can now register to vote online overseas . Why would n't we do that ? Why would we just grab the opportunity and be part of that solution ? <h> Three scenarios for overseas voting <p> The first one is when you are a brand-new voter . So I 've just turned 18 , you 're a South African citizen and live overseas , or you 've never voted before and you want to vote this time . It 's a brand-new registration . The second scenario is when you are on a voter 's roll , and you want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have previously registered in South Africa , and you want to move it to the overseas mission or you 've moved from Australia to London and want to update your voting location . The third scenario is a temporary overseas vote . You want to keep your voting station in South Africa , but you 're going to be overseas for work , a holiday , or visiting family , and you want to vote then . This is called the VEC10 process . <p> The first two scenarios can be done when they go live on the 24th of October . As for the third scenario , you 'll be able to do it a certain number of weeks just before the election . If people follow us on the DA abroad website or the DA website and sign up for our alerts , we will inform them about how to register , when to register , when to send the VEC10 forms , and answer any questions . All three scenarios , which include new registrations , changes of voting stations , and temporary overseas voting stations , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abroad need a passport and ID to vote , DA will help smooth the process <p> Unfortunately , right now the Independent Electoral Commission , IEC requires that you have to have a valid passport and an ID book or smart card . We are going to try and fight this a bit more , but as it stands right now , you have to have both . Now we understand that South Africans living overseas do n't always have both , and many people have had numerous issues trying to renew their passports with just ridiculous turnaround times . <p> So , we 're asking people to do three things . One is , if you 're going to South Africa for Christmas in December or a day , please go and renew your passport and ID while in South Africa . It takes five days , and it 's a fast service ; please just do it there . However , if you 're not going to South Africa between now and the end of the registration period or the election period , then just contact your local @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Thirdly , if you have any problems , if you 've been waiting for a long time , or the embassy does n't respond to you , or if the turnaround time is just too long , please contact us , the DA Abroad , at email protected . We have an escalation service that we use to highlight those issues with the Department of Home Affairs . I know it might seem like a hassle to have your passport and ID , and it might feel like an insurmountable administrative task if you do n't have one or the other . But the fact is this : you can not register if you do n't have both . If you ca n't vote , you ca n't register . So , please apply for the ID and passport . There are three processes : Renew in South Africa when you get there , contact your embassy right now , or please contact us , and we 'll assist you if there are problems with the local embassy . <h> DA pushing DIRCO for another 13 overseas voting stations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the Electoral Act states that you can only vote at foreign missions . These are embassies , consulate services , and high commissions . The Department for International Relations and Cooperation , DIRCO , is responsible for designating overseas missions . The DA is launching a campaign to request DIRCO to designate additional overseas voting stations . <p> In 2019 , the IEC made 125 voting stations available overseas . Our best estimate is that we need another 13 to cater to the high-density South African locations around the world . So instead of having 125 , we are aiming for 138 . This does n't break the bank or create logistical barriers like before . The only difference is that DIRCO has to designate additional sites . <p> We are launching an official process through parliamentary procedures , and if that does n't work , we will go to the courts to request more voting stations . They can not deny us our voting rights when they have provided 125 other locations with low-density South African populations voting rights . Why not these other 13 missions . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ court battle against Home Affairs to help people who lost their South African citizenship regain it . Those people lost it automatically . It took us eight years , but we got there . So , there 's a well-trodden road for us to fight for what is right . While the IEC may say they ca n't make more voting stations available , it 's not up to them , but we will work to get DIRCO to designate more sites so that the IEC can have more voting stations overseas . <h> Register to vote : Empower the DA 's efforts to expand voting stations <p> In Australia , the capital city of the country is Canberra , and the embassy is located there . So , in Australia , in the old way of doing things , you would have had to fly from Perth to Canberra or fly from Sydney to Canberra . We are now going to push for voting stations in Perth , Sydney , Adelaide , Brisbane , and Melbourne , in addition to Canberra . The same thing applies to New Zealand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We are going to push for Christchurch and Auckland as well . The same is happening in Canada ; we 're pushing for more voting stations . The same in the UK , not just in London , but also in Belfast , Manchester , and Edinburgh . All these places have South Africans , and we are now being denied the ability to vote because of this . However , we need people to register overseas because those registrations will make our case easier to get more voting stations . So no matter what you do , even if there is n't currently a voting station nearby , please just register because that 's the first step in us being able to get more voting stations ideally closer to where South Africans live . <p> So in 2019 in the US you could vote in Washington , New York , Chicago and Los Angeles . But we have people reaching out to us from Austin Texas and several other places . So , wherever there are certain volumes of people , we will push for voting stations . <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does not work <p> The way it works is that the ICE can only implement what the law says ; the laws are dictated by the Electoral Act unless there are court orders that override the Electoral Act at that point . The courts do not favour people going to court and overriding the parliamentary process ; they frown upon it if you skip a step . So , our first step is to engage with DIRCO through our shadow minister for foreign relations to request them to designate these overseas foreign missions . We hope they comply . If they do n't , we will then attempt to navigate the parliamentary process of changing the Electoral Act , though there is n't much time left . Only then will we consider pursuing a court case . But we can only initiate the court case after we 've completed both steps one and two . Step one involves requesting DIRCO to make this designation . If they say yes , then they have to declare those places as voting stations and then nothing else needs to change because the IEC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ However , if DIRCO does n't cooperate , then we will have to compel them to do so . <h> DA 's goal : Register 200,000 overseas voters <p> Census data is really skewed , and every country has a different way of asking questions , depending on where you were born , where you go to university or what your nationality is . So , you ca n't rely on census data . We have used a variety of sources and reached a point where , while there 's no direct number of how many people are overseas , we know where the majority of South Africans are . Our target is to get 200,000 people registered online . In 2019 , only 31,000 people were registered , so we aim for 200,000 because we 've transitioned from a physical process to an online process . From that point , it 's all about voter turnout because unfortunately , voting is still in person , not online or by any other method . Our primary step is to ensure we can be registered . <p> If we achieve 200,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more voting stations in the areas where those people are registered . Ultimately , we want to increase the number of voting stations from 125 to at least 138 , and potentially more if we find that there are people in locations we did n't initially budget for . <p> Of these 200,000 people we aim to register , our goal is to secure 100,000 DA votes . Depending on the election turnout and the 400 seats in parliament , for example , if 20 million people turn out to vote , it means that 50,000 people equal one MP . So , our objective is to get two MPs elected to parliament through the overseas vote , totalling 100,000 votes . <p> However , the critical number is 200,000 registrations . That 's where we begin . Without these registrations , we ca n't achieve anything . Step number one , everyone , is to register online .

Africa 's most industrialized nation is expected to only hold the top spot for a year before it once again lags Nigeria , and then fall to third place behind Egypt in 2026 , according to the report , which was released last week . <p> While IMF data shows Nigeria 's economy has eclipsed South Africa 's since 2018 , its fortunes have dimmed along with a decline in production of oil and it has been grappling with runaway inflation and a plunge in the value of the naira . <p> Bola Tinubu has announced significant policy changes aimed at getting the state 's finances back on track since he became president of the West @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the foreign-exchange system , scrapping costly gasoline subsidies and taking steps to address dollar shortages and boost tax revenue . <p> Those measures are causing initial pain in Africa 's most populous nation , but are expected to increasingly pay dividends going forward .

South Africa 's transient emergence as Africa 's largest economy in 2024 is mainly due to the shrinking of Nigeria and Egypt 's GDP in dollar terms , following sharp currency devaluations .

" -- Yvonne Mhango , Africa economist <p> Egypt has devalued its currency three times since early 2022 as it confronts a foreign-exchange crunch , with the pound losing almost half its value against the dollar . <p> The government secured a $3 billion IMF package last year that requires a more flexible exchange rate , a move it 's only likely to undertake after December elections in which President Abdel-Fattah El-Sisi is seeking to extend his rule until 2030 . <p> The delay has stalled IMF reviews that were initially scheduled for March and September . Successful appraisals could unlock about $700 million in postponed loan tranches , give Egypt access to a $1.3 billion resilience fund and potentially spur major Gulf investments . <p> The government is meanwhile in talks with the IMF on boosting its rescue package to more than $5 billion , according to people familiar with the discussions , confident it can overcome the hurdles preventing it from accessing support , including addressing concerns over its currency policy . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rate of 5% or more from 2026 , according to the IMF . <p> Unlike Nigeria 's naira and Egypt 's pound , South Africa 's rand is free floating , and has lost about 10% of its value against the dollar this year . <p> Currency weakness has been stoked by concerns that the National Treasury will miss its budget deficit and debt-to-GDP targets for the fiscal year through March due to increased demands on the state for support and revenue shortfalls , as a fraying transport network and record power cuts curtail economic growth . <p> The IMF sees South Africa 's economy expanding 0.9% this year and 1.8% in 2024 , with the potential to expand 2.5% to 3% faster should it improve the power situation , tackle logistic bottlenecks and institute other reforms

@@102789230 <h> Big banks , take note : PayShap should be free <p> The adoption of rapid payments in South Africa , via BankservAfrica 's PayShap platform , is far lower than in countries such as India and Brazil . <p> A big reason could be the cost to consumers . <p> There are obviously differences in how long rapid payment platforms ( RPPs ) have been available in South Africa , Brazil and India -- South Africa being the most recent to launch .

It has even changed citizen-to-government and government-to-citizen transactions -- everything is running on this real-time payments platform . " <h> Free <p> India 's UPI was launched in 2016 and has been free for individuals since its inception . <p> From April this year , UPI began charging merchants on a sliding scale -- from 0.5% to 1% of the transaction value depending on predefined commercial categories . But there are no fees for consumers to use the platform . <p> Brazil 's RPP , called Pix , uses a similar pricing model . Regulators there have insisted on free use of the platform for individuals , while merchants are charged a flat 0.33% fee for each transaction processed .

If PayShap is to replace cash , it needs to match the flexibility of cash . <p> When cash changes hands , there is no residual fee paid to a third party . This allows cash to flow more freely in the economy ; when people must pay to move money around , they tend to do so less often . <p> Furthermore , to change a behaviour , people must know of what they are changing to and why . " UPI is always on television in India , " said Peach Payment 's Jain about the marketing money behind it . <p> In South Africa , by contrast , apart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some platform-specific marketing done by the banks , there is little by way of concerted mass marketing to drive awareness of PayShap . <p> The author , TechCentral 's Nkosinathi Ndlovu <p> E-wallets are often used by the banks as a gateway to get unbanked recipients to open a full-service bank account . The recipient , who might receive money via a banked relative on a regular basis , develops a familiarity with the bank 's tools , usually via ATM and USSD interactions . This could be serving to disincentivise banks from driving awareness of the bank-agnostic PayShap over in-house equivalents . <p> In cases where money will inevitably be sent via one digital platform or another , PayShap 's interoperability gives consumers more choice in how they access the funds they receive . However , pricing that is in some cases very similar to existing instant payment or electronic wallet facilities already offered by the banks is not compelling enough to motivate behavioural changes . <p> In short , the banks -- with the exception of TymeBank -- have priced PayShap to fail . -- ( c ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> Vodacom agrees to pay fine over high contract cancellation fees <p> Vodacom has agreed to pay a R1-million fine imposed on it the National Consumer Tribunal over a disputed 75% contract cancellation fee policy that was found to be in contravention of the Consumer Protection Act ( CPA ) . <p> " Vodacom will comply with the tribunal 's determination and plans to continue co-operating with the National Consumer Commission , as has been its practice , on any future consumer- and customer-related concerns , " a Vodacom spokeswoman told TechCentral . <p> The fine , which forms part a 13 October ruling by the consumer tribunal , follows an investigation by the commission of 21 instances of complaints against the mobile operator relating to its contract cancellation policy and how customers who sought to cancel their contracts were treated . <p> The complaints under investigation all relate to the 2021 and 2022 financial years . <p> " In some instances , the complaints relate to a delay in the timeous cancellation of the contracts upon request by customers , resulting in the customers being charged for periods after having requested the cancellation of their contract , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consumer commission sought for a heftier fine of R20-million and for Vodacom to refund the customers outlined in its application to the tribunal , the tribunal levied a R1-million penalty in accordance with the CPA , which does not allow for a fine greater than 10% of the respondent 's ( Vodacom 's ) turnover or a maximum of R1-million .

@@102789232 <h> Common battery myths debunked <p> In the world of lithium-ion batteries , smartphones take centre stage . Yet they 've also sparked an ongoing debate : does prolonged ( or overnight ) charging wreak havoc on your battery ? <p> A number of factors determine a phone battery 's lifespan , including its manufacturing age and its chemical age . The latter refers to the battery 's gradual degradation due to variables such as fluctuations in temperature , charging and discharging patterns and overall usage . <p> According to Apple , " a normal iPhone battery is designed to retain up to 80% of its original capacity at 500 complete charge cycles when operating under normal conditions " . <p> Research has found a 2019 smartphone battery could , on average , undergo 850 full charge/discharge cycles before dropping to below 80% capacity . This means only 80% of the initial battery capacity remains after about two to three years of use . At this point the battery begins to deplete noticeably faster . <h> Should you charge your phone overnight ? <p> Most new-generation smartphones will take somewhere between 30 minutes and two hours to charge fully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capacity -- larger capacities require more time -- as well as how much power your charger supplies . <p> Charging your phone overnight is not only unnecessary , it also accelerates battery ageing . Full charging cycles ( going from 0-100% ) should be avoided to maximise your battery 's lifespan . Samsung says : " Charging your battery up to 100% too frequently may negatively impact the overall lifespan of the battery . " <p> Similarly , keeping iPhones at full charge for extended periods may compromise their battery health . Rather than a full top-up , it 's recommended to charge your battery up to 80% and not allow it to dip under 20% . <h> Can your phone be overcharged ? <p> In theory , lithium-ion batteries can be overcharged . This can lead to safety risks such as the battery overheating and catching fire . The good news is most modern phones have an in-built protection that automatically stops the battery from charging further than 100% -- preventing any damage from overcharging . <p> However , each time a battery drops to 99% ( due to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charge " : it will start charging again to maintain a fully charged state . <p> Trickle charging can wear a battery down over time . That 's why many manufacturers have features to regulate it . Apple 's iPhones offer functionality to delay charging past 80% . Samsung 's Galaxy phones provide the option to cap the charge at 85% . <h> Can your phone explode from charging ? <p> It 's very unlikely your smartphone will explode as a result of charging -- especially since most phones now have automatic protections against overcharging . <p> Still , over the years we have seen severalreports of phones exploding unexpectedly . This usually happens as a result of manufacturing faults , poor-quality hardware or physical damage . <p> Lithium-ion phone batteries overheat when the heat generated during charging is unable to dissipate .

" With this in mind , it was essential to find a solution that would sidestep MNO legacy infrastructure and find a multi-operator SIM solution that was truly modern .

Can artists -- a frequent-flyer class who rival politicians and business leaders as emissaries from elsewhere -- make a difference ? Perhaps , but it is slow and incremental work destabilising a clich ? . <p> Over the past year , without much razzle-dazzle , art and artists from Mexico and South Africa have been engaged in conversations with audiences in the two countries . <p> It started last year with a long-delayed exhibition of Mexican painter Frida Kahlo in Johannesburg -- the first time a work by this Hollywood-grade artist had been exhibited on the African continent . <p> Hosted by the Joburg Contemporary Art @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Modernist Identities in the Global South featured a 1940 self-portrait of Kahlo wearing a thorn necklace and hummingbird pendant . It bristled with psychic energy . Of course , bookings for this reticent private museum in Forest Town spiked . <p> In March , Kahlo 's painting -- originally a gift to her lover , photographer Nickolas Muray -- returned to its owner , the Harry Ransom Center at The University of Texas at Austin in the US . <p> Three months later , acclaimed ceramicist Clive Sithole travelled to the mountain town of Tapalpa in Mexico to present a workshop at the National School of Ceramics . Sithole , a master potter who was briefly trained by Nesta Nala , demonstrated his superb technique . <p> This included showing how to shape , decorate , fire and burnish a traditional Zulu beer pot or ukhamba . The workshop was also a learning opportunity for Sithole , who was surprised by the form and daily functionality of Mexican ceramics . <p> " It caught my attention that in Mexico pottery is used in utilitarian pieces , " Sithole told a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long time ago . Ceramics are preferably used for ritual and/or decorative objects . <p> " In KwaZulu-Natal culture , ceramic pieces are used to serve beer when receiving visitors and also for certain rituals . " <p> Earlier this month , painter Georgina Gratrix -- who was born in Mexico City but grew up in Durban -- opened a solo exhibition of new paintings at contemporary art gallery Proyectos Monclova in her birth city . <p> Titled Colima 302 , the exhibition includes examples of Gratrix 's opulent flower still lifes , candid portraiture and tchotchke-like dog sculptures . There is also a fabulous blobby self-portrait in purple -- it makes Kahlo 's charged work feel po-faced . <p> Gratrix has been in Mexico on an extended sojourn while her Cape Town home is renovated and the dust settles after leaving her long-time gallery for Stevenson . <p> The jubilant paintings on her exhibition were all made in Mexico City . Some were inspired by a visit to Mercado de Jamaica , a flower market known for its animal figures made entirely out of flowers .

It is hard to fully account for the facial features of the male figure . To summarise , his face is an agitation of paint . <p> For a number of years , this portrait has served as the WhatsApp profile picture of the Mexican curator Francisco Berzunza . The painting is also part of Berzunza 's ambitious group exhibition at A4 Arts Foundation in Cape Town . <p> Titled You to Me , Me to You , the show includes major international figures such as Bas Jan Ader , Sophie Calle , Moshekwa Langa , Tina Modotti and Dayanita Singh , alongside newcomers such as Thato Makatu . <p> Similar to Berzunza , Makatu had a peripatetic upbringing in a diplomatic family and is completing her final year at the Michaelis School of Fine Art in Cape Town . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Berzunza 's exhibition is less motivated by the possibilities of cultural diplomacy than it is about exploring an idea . <p> Can love be a viable theme for an exhibition ? Berzunza thinks it can . <p> " Love is a human experience ; we are all invested and interested in human emotion , " he explains in a guide accompanying his exhibition . <p> During a public walkabout he elaborated on his motivations . <p> Last year , after a tour of the ministry of public education in Mexico , Berzunza sat at the feet of Diego Riviera 's 1922 mural The Assembly and declared his love to the straight man accompanying him . <p> " I get that we are not friends nor lovers , so what are we ? " responded Fernando . <p> " Well , I am Francisco to you , and you are Fernando to me . " <p> And thus an exhibition title was coined . <p> " Love can be the desire and the frustration of becoming one with another , " explained Berzunza . <p> " This exhibition explores -- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this affirmation , as love may well be the act of sharing our loneliness with each other . <p> " That , more or less , is what guides this exhibition , the story between another person and myself and this exploration of love as an act of sharing loneliness . " <p> Group exhibitions -- like the mixtapes of old and the Spotify playlists of today -- are necessarily subjective for viewers . This works for me , that not so much . <p> The abundant photography was , for me , an unexpected treat , more so given its death at market and consequent disappearance from the local gallery scene . You to Me , Me to You has strong photographic contributions by Manuel ? lvarez Bravo , Thembinkosi Hlatshwayo , Pieter Hugo , Graciela Iturbide and Jo Racliffe . <p> The tragic Dutch conceptualist Ader , who died during a solo Atlantic crossing , is represented by an expanded version of his mercurial photo essay In Search of the Miraculous ( One Night in Los Angeles ) . The work was made in 1973 as a precursor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , an episodic record of an artist 's walking search for something in the urban interstices of nighttime Los Angeles . <p> " Certain things , " writes the Mexican author Valeria Luiselli , " elude direct observation . Sometimes it 's necessary to create an analogy , a slanting light that illuminates the fugitive object , in order to momentarily fix that thing that escapes us . " <p> This observation by Luiselli -- it appears in her debut book of essays Sidewalks published in English in 2014 -- does n't neatly explain Ader 's journey or Berzunza 's love quest but somehow it illuminates them . <p> The daughter of a diplomat , Luiselli spent a substantial part of her youth in South Korea and South Africa . English became her language of discovery , of reading and writing . <p> She met Nelson Mandela , twice . When she told the statesman with " deep , deep grey eyes " she wanted to be a prose writer , he responded , " Well , then you need to read a lot .

He first visited the country -- fittingly -- after a breakup and quickly fell in with local artists . <p> He completed a master 's degree at the University of Cape Town , focussing on coins from the Cape Colony minted with American silver . He later worked as a cultural attach ? for the Mexican embassy . <p> In 2018 , then still in his twenties and brattishly ambitious , Berzunza curated a large-scale exhibition of South African art in Oaxaca , in southern Mexico . Titled Hacer Noche , it included fascinating moments , especially a selection of sculptures by Dumile Feni , Nelson Mukhuba and Johannes Segogela that chimed -- formally and thematically -- with pre-Hispanic Mesoamerican and Catholic-influenced Mexican art . A biennale-like showcase of African art followed in 2021 . <p> Mexico , a country that decoupled from the Spanish Empire in 1821 , offers many insights for South Africans negotiating three decades of independence .

@@103635235 <p> Kgosientsho Ramokgopa was made electricity minister last month by President Cyril Ramaphosa to deal with load-shedding , which has brought businesses and the economy of the country to their knees . <p> The performance of South Africa 's power grid has been disappointing over the last two weeks , largely due to the failure of more generating units at Eskom , Electricity Minister Kgosientsho Ramokgopa said on Sunday . <p> During his fortnightly media briefing on the country 's energy action plan to tackle chronic power shortages and end load-shedding , Ramokgopa said the past two weeks had seen a deterioration in the unplanned capacity loss factor -- the rate at which the generating units are failing . <p> " ( Previously ) we were averaging less than 15 000 megawatts ; in some instances we were even sub 14,000 MW . We were doing exceptionally well . And that 's why you saw ... the green period where we did n't have load-shedding for a period of eight days .

" <p> He said the failure of the cluster of units at the Kendal , Medupi , Hendrina , Duvha , Kriel and Camden power stations had forced Eskom to ramp up load-shedding to stage three . The power utility however expected five units to come back online by Sunday night , Ramokgopa added . <p> The energy action plan was launched in July 2022 as a roadmap to end load-shedding as quickly as possible and promote the long-term sustainability of electricity supply in South Africa . <p> Ramokgopa said cabinet had approved implementation of the country 's Just Energy Transition Investment Plan ( JET-IP ) which sets out the scale of need and the investments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sources . <p> " Remember that what the JET-IP does is to say to the country how we intend to deploy the US$12.5 billion that has been made available by international partners , " he said . <p> " We are going to ensure that in the manner in which we tap from that , it meets the requirements of the country and one of the major determinations there is a principle of ensuring that whatever we do must meet both the pay scale and cost that is consistent with our socio economic situation here in the economy . " Ramokgopa said Forestry , Fisheries and Environment Minister Barbara Creecy would provide more details on the JET-IP plan , adding : " It 's part of the totality of the efforts that we 're making , in ensuring that we are able to attain energy sovereignty and in the immediate ensuring that we end load-shedding.

@@103825235 <h> How to Fortify Email Security in 2023 and Beyond <p> In the ever-evolving landscape of cybersecurity , email security remains a paramount concern in 2023 and beyond . With the proliferation of digital communication , ensuring the confidentiality and integrity of emails is essential . <h> Securing Email in 2023 and Beyond <p> To bolster email security , several best practices are recommended . First and foremost , adopting a zero-knowledge architecture is advisable . <p> This means that email service providers do not have access to user decryption keys or messages , thereby mitigating the risk of internal breaches . Additionally , employing end-to-end encryption is essential . This encryption method ensures that messages are only readable by the intended recipients , as encryption occurs on the senders ' devices . <p> Strong passwords and Two-Factor Authentication ( 2FA ) play a pivotal role in safeguarding email accounts . Passwords should comprise at least 12 characters and include diverse elements . The introduction of 2FA , which adds an extra layer of security by requiring a phone-based code for access , is highly effective in thwarting unauthorized entry . <p> Email users should also exercise caution when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vulnerability , so individuals should avoid clicking on suspicious links or opening attachments from unknown sources . <p> Opting for secure email services that offer end-to-end encryption further enhances email security .

Staying informed about evolving threats by following security experts and reading relevant blogs and newsletters is equally important . <h> Latest Trends in Email Security <p> In 2023 , email security is witnessing several noteworthy trends . One of these trends is AI-driven threat detection . Artificial Intelligence ( AI ) is increasingly being employed to identify emerging email threats . By analyzing patterns and anomalies , AI can effectively counter phishing and malware , leading to quicker threat identification and blocking . <p> Another emerging trend is the adoption of zero-trust architecture .

@@104267230 <h> SA Govt 's plan to unleash army on illegal mining is doomed <p> SIBANYE-Stillwater 's Neal Froneman has more reason than most to want crime and corruption in the mining sector tackled . The precious metals miner , of which he is the founding CEO , reported 363 incidents of illegal mining in 2022 , resulting in 1,115 arrests -- against 187 incidents and 473 arrests the year before . <p> " Look , illegal mining is out of control , " he says . " It requires special skills that clearly the police do not have . You are dealing with people where life is cheap and sometimes blunt force with blunt force needs to be used to establish control . " <p> It seems to be a conclusion the government has reached too . On November 17 the parliamentary joint standing committee on defence gave its blessing to the deployment of 3,300 South African National Defence Force ( SANDF ) soldiers to help finally defeat the illegal mining industry . Until April , the army will work with the police to stem running battles between the heavily armed criminal gangs , known as zama zamas , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Joburg . <p> It 's no small matter . Speaking in a parliamentary debate last year , mineral resources &amp; energy minister Gwede Mantashe estimated illegal mining had cost the South African economy R49bn in 2019 . A more up to date estimate is hard to come by , given the opacity of the industry , says Minerals Council spokesperson Allan Seccombe . But the council is in no doubt the problem has spun out of control . <p> Parachuting in the SANDF to deal with seemingly intractable civilian scourges is hardly novel in South Africa . Soldiers were part of an effort to reduce illegal trade in rhino horn . What is worth thinking about , however , is that more force does n't guarantee a better outcome . In June , for example , 51 rhino horns were stolen from the North West Parks Board 's vault in Mahikeng -- a salutary lesson that corruption of this ilk supports a food chain with international reach . Similarly , stopping the violence near disused mines in Krugersdorp does n't tackle the well-funded syndicates funnelling stolen gold to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is only partially cheered by the military rollout . Its main worry is that the government has failed to recognise the scope of the problem . Syndicates operate through informal and institutional channels ; in fact , wherever public sector weakness enables them . Take South Africa 's national borders , which are so porous as to provide an unbroken supply of new illegal miners . <p> When you think of illegal mining you think of well-armed people in gangs running around underground . But it 's also communities panning for gold on tailings dams , people with equipment starting a mine without a permit -- Neal Froneman <p> And , as Froneman says , " when you think of illegal mining you think of well-armed people in gangs running around underground . But it 's also communities panning for gold on tailings dams , people with equipment starting a mine without a permit . I personally do n't know what this initiative is targeting . " <p> So while he expects the initiative to help to an extent , he worries that the government has n't got an idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and after spending the R492m required for the effort , which is currently unfunded . <p> Pan African Resources CEO Cobus Loots also likes the idea of force meeting force . His outfit is building a R2.5bn project called Mintails in Carletonville , where illegal miners have flourished . Though Mintails is fenced in and protected , he is faced with the question of what happens once the SANDF packs away the guns . <p> In his view , it 's important that the Hawks be better empowered . This is the elephant in the room ; it 's what everyone wants and what no-one seems able to achieve . One person tasked with assisting in this role is Froneman , the joint head of the crime &amp; corruption workstream created by President Cyril Ramaphosa in June . <p> But , worryingly for those hoping the government has got its bases covered in tackling illegal mining , Froneman says he was surprised by the SANDF plan . " I became aware of it like you , through the media . It 's not linked to the crime &amp; corruption workstream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well , " he says . <h> Crime &amp; Corruption Workstream <p> In any event , the workstream has asked the Minerals Council to form a point of co-ordination with the government so that the private sector can be " sure its knowledge and experience is incorporated into the government 's plans " . <p> As for the workstream more broadly , Froneman says the private sector is still in " the organising phase " . There are no successes worth pointing out to date ( it 's still early days ) with a lot of effort put into knowing when and how the private sector can step in , and when not to do so . <p> Froneman is keen to avoid compromising the work of the National Prosecuting Authority , as well as the Hawks and established institutions . As it is , there are already severe capacity constraints in the judicial system as a whole . " You 'd be shocked : there are something like 10,000 cases ready to be heard ; 2,000 cases waiting for judgments . The low-hanging fruit is moving that on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Zondo commission of inquiry into state capture have to follow through to proper prosecution . Then there are the crimes that are not even public that are being pursued . " <p> But Loots points to something slightly different : controlling and arresting illegal miners is no good if the courts are n't able to impose minimum sentences for illegal mining in the first place . At present , prosecuted illegal miners walk away with a fine for trespassing or just a warning . <p> He 's also concerned by a lack of clarity on the government 's artisanal mining policy . " That just obfuscates the matter , " he says . <p> The draft artisanal &amp; small-scale mining policy 2021 , released for public comment last year , is described by minerals lawyer Hulme Scholes as " a fantasy " . It assumes miners will stop illegal mining overnight , undertake formal training , use personal protective equipment and pay taxes and royalties .
