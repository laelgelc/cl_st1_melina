" <p> He said he would not be surprised if the gang were involved in other kidnapping cases . <p> " The failure by the family to speak to the police will allow this gang to continue to cause tyranny and target other families .

@@63751234 <h> The Book of Boba Fett Episode 3 - Review <h> Temuera Morrison is benevolent Boba . <p> This review contains spoilers for episode 3 of The Book of Boba Fett , ' The Streets of Mos Espa ' , now available to view on Disney+ . To remind yourself of where we left off , check out our review of The Book of Boba Fett episode 2 . <p> In 1995 , a famous soccer pundit once said " you ca n't win anything with kids " after Manchester United 's young team line-up lost against Aston Villa . But the comment came back to haunt him when Manchester United went on to win both the Premiership and FA Cup that same season . Will that be the case with The Book of Boba Fett now the series has premiered its own youthful squad of misfits in episode 3 ? Here 's hoping , given the new odds the former bounty hunter is set to face as his past and present finally collide in " The Streets of Mos Espa . " But despite new young blood , this chapter functions as a somewhat superficial set up of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expense of meaningful character development . <p> Boba 's increasing benevolence may well be signposting his downfall . On the plus side , he manages to acquire a group of angst-ridden youths to beef up his muscle power against the incoming Pyke Syndicate . Adding to the long list of brunette women in the Star Wars universe , Sophie Thatcher ( of Yellowjackets fame ) plays the leader of an Alita : Battle Angel-meets-Akira-like bike gang who 've upgraded their bodies with droid parts and are wreaking havoc on the locals with their thieving . These juvenile delinquents give off the whole " we 're just misunderstood , man ! " vibe and could give The Outsiders a run for their money . A few scenes show just what they are capable of ; a chase sequence through Mos Espa on their Teletubbies moped-esque speeders adds a punch of flare to the burnt landscape -- with a cyberpunk theme tune to boot -- but it looks a bit budget compared to the high-octane exhilaration of the train stunt in the previous episode . <p> Earlier , the youths help Boba @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indisposed in his Bacta tank , but it 's a far less satisfying fight than the cantina takedown he administered against the swoop-gang . One has to wonder how a massive Wookie managed to get past their defences , but Fennec Shand 's late stage arrival hints she might not be as loyal to her saviour as once thought . It would certainly explain her frustrating lack of screen time , save for that opening fight scene and a few snarky comments here and there . But in an episode that spends so much time signalling future alliances -- Boba befriending a rancor and setting Krrsantan free -- and potential treachery , the action and storyline feels pretty disjointed . And with all these new characters thrown into the mix , it never takes the time to let the viewer get to know the motivations of anyone but our eponymous antihero . <p> Of course , it 's his name on the title card , but even in The Mandalorian with supporting characters like Cobb Vanth and Frog Lady , there was a real sense of who they are and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ none of that in The Book of Boba Fett , save for our titular lead who continues to be haunted by his childhood , reminders of his clone heritage every time he comes across a stormtrooper helmet stuck on a spike , and seemingly his need to atone for his bounty hunter sins after being given a second chance at life . But the way in which his antihero 's journey is being told feels somewhat pedestrian and , given the legend of this character , he arguably deserves better than what he 's getting , as do the characters he associates with . <p> The decision to decimate the Tusken tribe Boba had been made an honorary member of is both an obvious and lazy one . Barely any time is dedicated to their deaths , but I guess they 'd served their purpose to bring the bounty hunter back from the brink and show his heroic side . Now their murders simply add pathos to his journey and push his plot forward while their names are lost in the ether . <p> Without Temuera Morrison , The Book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He brings warmth and depth without pretentiousness to a character that could have easily followed the outlaw-ish arrogant route . Even when the plot feels a bit paint by numbers as it has in this chapter , Morrison keeps you rooted to your seat . Fingers crossed he 'll have audiences on the edge of them next week . <h> The Verdict <p> " The Streets of Mos Espa " is a flat return to Tatooine that spends so much time setting up future plot points it only skims the surface of new and established character development . Still , Morrison 's plain-speaking , humane antihero keeps you endeared to Boba 's story .

@@63751236 <h> Money in your 20s : Let 's talk credit <p> Being careless about how you repay debt when you 're young means you 'll find credit more expensive when you 're older . Image : Adobe Stock <p> A key aspect for a young person who has just earned their first substantial pay cheque is the opportunity to start building a clean sheet financially . A good credit reputation is one of the most important building blocks . <p> Whether you need to buy a car or a home , lenders will want to know that you can pay your bills on time and that they will get their return . <p> So where do you start ? <p> Wealth Advisor at PSG Wealth , Elke Brink , tells Moneyweb that for young people still in the early stages of building up a credit profile , starting small and keeping things manageable is the way to go . <p> " Start with smaller commitments . The most important part of building a good credit record is you need to be able to commit to the monthly repayments that you have to make on a consistent basis . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your earnings and your planning , " says Brink , adding that the moment something becomes too difficult to repay is when a vicious cycle starts . <p> As a quick solution to addressing their lack of a credit history , young people are often told to open retail store accounts . However , Brink says although this is an option for some , a credit card is a far more manageable and less limiting solution . <p> " I think a credit card is something that can be used more widely ... I would recommend this because your options are just a little more open than having one specific clothing account with one specific store , " says Brink . <p> What should I be using credit for ? <p> Debt Busters CEO Benay Sager tells Moneyweb that because it is generally more expensive for young people to borrow money , it is important to have a sound reason for taking out credit -- emphasising that credit should not be used to supplement one 's income for day-to-day living expenses . <p> " It is important for young people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serve a particular purpose , " he says . <p> " If that purpose is n't going to necessarily yield a good , productive asset for you , your education or your family , then you should probably rethink whether you want to proceed with borrowing that money . " <p> What is the point ? <p> According to Sager the 20s are the best time for young people to start building a good credit history , because this is when one generally has fewer binding financial responsibilities . <p> He adds that the work put in towards establishing a good credit history during this time contributes significantly to how expensive borrowing will be once they start seeking longer-term credit such as a home loan . <p> " Normally I would say it takes between eight and 10 years to build enough of a history to be able to borrow for a house later , " Sager says . <p> " So while most of the debt or credit is generally accumulated in your 30s to 40s , the run up to that -- in terms of you being able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be able to borrow that money -- depends on the small decisions you make every month with regards to paying or not paying the small amounts you borrow in your 20s , " he says . <p> Taking a more long-term view , Brink adds that because credit is ultimately debt , building a good manageable credit reputation in your 20s is also essential to living a debt-free retirement life . For this , you need to learn to manage debt at an early age . <p> Do n't overcommit <p> According to Sager you should not be committing more than 40% of your take-home salary to debt repayments . <p> A debt-to-salary ratio of more than this is a sign that you may have taken on too much debt . <p> Brink adds that from the moment one starts earning an income , it is important to start making smart decisions that will ultimately help create a financially stress-free retirement . <p> " I do think that if you can start somehow building your financial future by trying to minimise debt as much as possible , you 're going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less stress in your longer life term . <p> " Successful financial decisions actually start in your 20s and are a combination of making the right decisions when it comes to your debt profile , but also starting to save a little bit to help you win a lot of time , meaning you wo n't have mistakes you need to correct for the rest of your life , " Brink adds . <p> Key take-aways : <p> Start small -- Committing to monthly repayments for credit taken in this stage of your life should be rather easy ; if there 's a possibility that you could miss several payments , rather reconsider . <p> Building blocks -- The credit you take out now is laying the foundation for your credit reputation and will decide how expensive it will be for you to borrow larger sums of money in the future . <p> Think retirement -- Credit is debt , so if you take on too much too soon , you may not have much of a life after retirement , so keep an eye on your debt . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be going to debt ; if it 's more , you 're in trouble . <h> AUTHOR PROFILE <p> Akhona is a passionate young financial journalist who covers the retail , property and tourism sectors .

The organisation alleges that she is guilty of gross misconduct for her role in the attempted settlement of the controversial Siyaya matter , and had violated the separation of powers principle by acting as chairperson of PRASA while also being an appointed judge . <p> In March 2020 , GroundUp reported that the Judicial Conduct Committee ( JCC ) , chaired by then-Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng , agreed that this complaint , if substantiated , would amount to gross misconduct . The JCC recommended that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " investigation and determination " . <p> If the tribunal finds that Makhubele 's actions constitute gross misconduct , and the JSC upholds this finding , Judge Makhubele could then be impeached . A two-thirds majority of the National Assembly is required for impeachment . Judges Matter has produced a thorough guide to the impeachment process as it relates to Makhubele . <p> On 21 October 2021 , Sello Chiloane , Chief of Staff at the Office of the Chief Justice , sent retired Judge Brand two letters that Makhubele 's attorney , Eric Mabuza , had written to the JSC about the upcoming tribunal . <p> In the first letter , Mabuza requested a postponement of the tribunal , as Judge Makhubele 's counsel , Wim Trengrove , was not available until late February . The second letter asked the JSC for retired Judge Brand 's recusal . <p> GroundUp has not seen the recusal letter but we reliably understand that Makhubele , through Mabuza , argued that since Judge Brand had been involved in the Siyaya matter , he could not be objective in overseeing her tribunal . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between Siyaya and PRASA . However Brand was never called on to make any decisions as Makhubele controversially settled out of court with Siyaya . <p> In an email to Chiloane on 27 October , Brand stated that he did n't see " good grounds " for his recusal , but nevertheless feared that his " refusal to do so will probably lead to a public debate that may embarrass the JSC and the Acting Chief Justice . " <p> Then on 29 November , Brand informed Chiloane of his decision to recuse himself , after he had spoken with Acting Chief Justice Raymond Zondo . Again in this email , Brand reiterates that no proper case for recusal had been made . Nevertheless Brand insists on recusing himself , so that the matter is not escalated " into a matter of argument and dispute " . <p> Zackie Achmat of #UniteBehind told GroundUp that as the complainant , the organisation was only informed of Brand 's recusal around 22 December when Chiloane alerted them that the tribunal had been postponed indefinitely . #UniteBehind , through their attorneys Bradley Conradie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ JSC to oppose the recusal . <p> On 7 January 2022 , Judge Brand responded to #UniteBehind via Chiloane . Again , Brand conceded that he did not believe there were good grounds for his recusal . He said , " Since a colleague seeks my recusal on the basis of her apprehension that she may not have a fair hearing in a matter of great importance to her , I believe I should adhere to that request unless there is good reason for my refusal to do so . Moreover , my refusal may potentially trigger a costly and time-wasting debate that may cause public embarrassment to the judicial system . " <p> Achmat told GroundUp that Judge Brand 's recusal was unacceptable . " There can not be one legal standard on recusal for the public and another that privileges judges to choose the members of tribunals expected to hear matters , big or small , involving complaints to the JSC about judicial conduct . There can be no excuse for a judge who decides to recuse themselves on the basis that their refusal to do so would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said #UniteBehind 's complaint against Makhubele illustrates that she " acted to facilitate corruption " and " to undermine criminal investigations against politically connected people " . <p> Chiloane and the JSC did not respond to GroundUp at the time of publication , despite multiple efforts to receive comment and access the letters submitted by Judge Makhubele . <p> You may republish this article , so long as you credit the authors and GroundUp , and do not change the text .

@@63760234 <h> Long-term test : Living with the Kia Sonet 1.5 EX <p> Being a motoring journalist is as lovely as you would imagine . Every week , a brand new car is delivered to your home with a full tank of fuel . In return , all you need to do is drive it and report back with an unbiased evaluation . <p> As long as a week may be , you only really get to know a car after you 've lived with it for an extended period of time . Once you 've played with the touchscreen and the new car smell wanes , what is it like on a day-to-day basis ? <p> I 've thought about this a lot recently while driving the Kia Sonet 1.5 EX . The Korean brand was gracious enough to provide one over an extended test period over the December holidays . I 've covered in excess of 2,000 km and put it through its paces in a number of settings and challenges . <p> Perceived build quality is best in class , with solid materials . EX model receives a leather-trimmed steering wheel and gear lever . <p> Ordinarily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whatever I 'm driving , but the Sonet EX piqued their interest . No surprise since SUVs are de rigueur at the moment and this particular one is well-priced , economical and practical . <p> While we wo n't admit it , looks are a crucial factor in the car buying process . The Sonet 's chunky styling and classy touches -- the grille detailing and rear light bar , for example -- appealed to plenty who saw it . <p> Perceived build quality is superb . The plastics may be of the harder variety , which is a common theme in this class but everything feels solid and well-screwed together . I must have traversed at least 400 km of gravel roads and there was n't even a murmur of protest from the Kia , the plastics and interior remained rattle-free after some jarring and bone-shaking surfaces . <p> A cheaper LX model is also available . The six-speed manual retails for R285,995 while the CVT-equipped model is priced at R306,995 . <p> Insulation is another plus point . I recall how dirty the interior of a similarly priced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ While the Kia also let dust in , it was minimal . <p> I seldom had passengers in the rear but a friend who measures over 1.8 m sat behind me with room to spare . The cloth-trimmed seats are comfortable and rear passengers also benefit from a useful armrest with two cup holders , their own air supply and a handy USB charger . <p> Up front , a handy eight-inch touchscreen offers Apple CarPlay and Android Auto compatibility . I found this handy but did have constant connectivity issues with my iPhone but Android Auto worked perfectly . Equipment-wise , there 's not much to complain about as everything you really need is there . <p> All variants are powered by the same 1.5-litre , naturally-aspirated petrol engine . Peak power is 85 kW while torque is rated at 144 Nm . <p> The Sonet has plenty of safety features including the all-important stability control . For this , we applaud Kia . Many cars on the budget end of the segment tend to eschew this vital piece of technology . While two airbags are standard , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a job for the facelift or yet-to-be-announced top-spec model . <p> A major draw card is its practicality . The 392-litre boot came in handy on trips to the grocery store , lugging Christmas gifts and when packed full of luggage for an impromptu weekend away . The rear bench does fold down but a split rear seat would be a lot more useful . <p> Other crucial aspects are fuel economy and servicing . Manufacturer 's are often optimistic with fuel consumption claims , often impossible to replicate in real life . It seems Kia has been rather conservative with its 7.0 L/100 km claimed figure . I averaged 5.8 L/100 km overall . The worst I saw was 6.9L/100 km in heavy traffic into the CBD . A four-year/60 000 km service plan and a five-year/unlimited mileage warranty should assuage any maintenance concerns . <p> On road , the Sonet rides like a far larger SUV .

In my opinion , it 's the one to have in this segment . The past month has only solidified my stance on this . I added over 2,000 km and the Sonet has not skipped a beat . <p> Although Kia has experience in building budget cars and larger SUVs , this is the first time it has blended the two categories and it was worth the wait . The Sonet offers all the appealing elements you would associate with an SUV -- practicality , raised ride height , chunky good looks -- and melds them with the fuel economy , purchase price and daily usability of a budget hatchback . This , along with generous levels of standard kit , is why the Sonet remains the best compact crossover on the market .

Ultimately , though , its bonkers storyline and pioneering use of the " orgy montage " to move the action forward made it of limited interest . <p> 4 .

Demonstrating inclusion and diversity in advertising is no longer optional , but an imperative , and the figures are evidence of this . <p> Facebook Advertising claims that 54% of surveyed Facebook users do not feel culturally represented in online advertising .

It 's more than skin deep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk . <h> The rise of social ads as cookies get crunched <p> Announced in January 2020 , Google 's eventual phasing out of cookie tracking by 2023 will require brands to reimage how they will target their social audiences . The cookie-less future will mean that those that have profited from privacy-invasive data collection will need to rethink their consumer advertising approach , particularly in South Africa with the now-active POPIA . This means learning to weigh up the need for personalised services against the need for consent and compliance . <p> The phasing out of cookies poses significant issues for brands looking to target their ideal consumer .

Virtual reality 's shift now extends beyond the gaming sector to using the technology to create , explore , identify , express , collaborate and socialise .

The fund already owns about 5,000 student beds in Pretoria and Joburg worth R2bn . The plan is to grow the portfolio to about R10bn-R12bn within the next five to seven years . <p> Incidentally , Growthpoint is singled out as Anchor Capital 's top SA-based property stock pick for 2022 in its latest quarterly strategy and asset allocation report , " The Navigator " . Chief investment officers Peter Armitage and Nolan Wapenaar reckon Growthpoint could outperform this year on the back of an international tourist rebound at Cape Town 's V&amp;A Waterfront , the jewel in Growthpoint 's real estate crown ( co-owned with the Public Investment Corp ) . <p> Anchor Capital expects an 11% total return for the sector as a whole this year .

@@63815240 <h> SMALL SCREEN <h> Maggie Gyllenhaal 's The Lost Daughter is a cerebral psychological drama honestly tackling the weight of parenthood , led by three talented women whose acting chops are as good as they get . <p> Olivia Colman 's performance in The Lost Daughter is ammunition for any performer or film enthusiast who is romantic about the craft of acting as a vocation . One can not take for granted the way she throws herself into the complex role of Leda Caruso , the brilliant but twisted professor of comparative literature who leads Maggie Gyllenhaal 's cerebral feature directorial debut . <p> The psychological drama is based on a novel of the same name by pseudonymous Neapolitan writer Elena Ferrante , who gave Gyllenhaal permission to adapt the novel on the condition that she also direct it . <p> Gyllenhaal immediately piques your curiosity using the trope of opening with the protagonist 's tragic fate . Leda stands gobsmacked on a beach in the fogginess of night , walks towards the shore break , and collapses without a word . As is always the case with this sort of time-jumping prologue , the journey of the film @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why . <p> Leda has just arrived on a Greek island where she 'll be staying alone on a working vacation . She wears an ever-changing expression that orbits her sanguine personality , occasionally breaking out into bursts of excitement or a relieved sigh as she takes in her surroundings . <p> Having already been given a sense of the woes awaiting Leda , we are tuned in to the omens Gyllenhaal strews in Leda 's path . A lighthouse flashes a warning into her balcony window , blaring a sombre cavernous foghorn that threatens disaster . Leda discovers that the underside of all the fruit in her fruit bowl is rotting , a metaphor for the insidious human tensions hidden by the islands sparkling shores . <p> Leda settles into a quiet relaxing holiday , oblivious to these menacing hints . Stylised camerawork and dreamy swaying music echo her calm nostalgic state of mind until her peace is very suddenly interrupted by the arrival of a huge obnoxiously rowdy Greek-American family . <p> Olivia Coleman as Leda Caruso . Image : courtesy of Netflix . <p> She is visibly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ group commandingly asks her to move her chair , Leda refuses , and we see for the first time that this polite and proper middle-aged British woman has also got a bite on her . <p> Colman 's ability to convey clashing feelings with natural but highly perceptible gestures makes her interactions emotionally multifaceted . She is irritated , trying to hide her irritation , anxious and threatened , but also resolute to stand her ground and working to stay calm ; and all of that is communicated wordlessly with just a few recognisable movements of her face . <p> Her stammering , half-finished sentences and drawn-out silences have the subtlety of normal communication , rather than the crisp procedural dialogue of simpler films . <p> Because Leda is there alone amidst groups of others , she ca n't help observing them , and we rely on Colman 's expressive acting to imply what she 's thinking . She is particularly taken by a young American woman ( played mysteriously by Dakota Johnson ) and her daughter , Elena , who Ferrante named after herself for reasons we can only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vivid flashbacks of Leda 's younger self with her own daughters . <p> When Elena goes missing , Leda becomes entangled in the toxic social webs of the island , and her flashbacks ( acted exquisitely by Jessie Buckley as the young Leda ) become more melancholic and revealing of what makes her tick . <p> Image : courtesy of Netflix.Jessie Buckley as young Leda Caruso . Image : courtesy of Netflix.Image : courtesy of Netflix.Image : courtesy of Netflix . <p> The flashbacks can be hard to watch for the same reason that they 're so diverting -- Leda 's parenting tells a tricky , messy , underrepresented story of a mother unable to cope with the needs of her demanding , uncontrollable children . Her story criticises but also sympathises with a lived experience that is typically condemned in film and literature . <p> A crucial practical and stylistic element of Ferrante 's novel was Leda 's first-person narrative , which steers our entire experience of the story . Gyllenhaal 's skilled direction visually guides our focus and perception in much the same way without needing the narrative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at all times , intentionally distorting your view so that you are careened around every turn . The title of the film alone will throw you for a loop more than once . <p> If the craft of an actor is taking on another character 's perspective and experience , much of their purpose is to help viewers to do the same , and the more skillful the actor , the more we come to understand their character 's perspective . <p> It 's never resolved how much of Leda 's perception of events as menacing is insightful and how much is paranoid , or even imagined . When she 's hit on the back by a pinecone while walking under a tree , she thinks it 's merely fallen from a branch , while we as the audience suspect it was thrown . By the time it happens again , the reverse is true . That consistently misleading uncertainty is the film 's psychological intrigue . <p> Image : courtesy of Netflix . <p> The psychological drama of The Lost Daughter is riveting , but it 's a slow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to its ambiguous conclusion , and even though the evolving drama and gossip of the island 's inhabitants add a moreish spice , some viewers might find the unravelling flashbacks too cryptic to endure the film 's deliberate pace . <p> For those who become invested in the honest exploration of parenting and the nature of altruism , the extensive , colourful time spent exploring and giving substance to the imperfect characters is enriching . <p> Halfway through the film , a character quotes French philosopher Simone Weil , saying , " Attention is the rarest and purest form of human generosity " . The challenge that defines Leda 's life is giving her children the attention they crave and require at the cost of her own freedoms . <p> Leda is a twisted woman whose impulsiveness can make her unlikable . You do n't have to like her though ; all you have to do is give her story the attention it rarely receives , and grapple with the complexity of her life . Everyone has goodness in them , everyone is a little bit broken , and people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ferrante implore you to revel in the grey areas between all things . DM/ ML <p> The Lost Daughteris available in South Africa in theatres and will be available on Netflix in the future . <h> Comments - share your knowledge and experience <p> Everybody has an opinion but not everyone has the knowledge and the experience to contribute meaningfully to a discussion . That 's what we want from our members . Help us learn with your expertise and insights on articles that we publish . We encourage different , respectful viewpoints to further our understanding of the world . View our comments policy here . <p> I resent the use of the word ' twisted ' here . I found this film and story gripping precisely because it presents an alternative view of motherhood that is purposefully hidden from mainstream literature , imagery and films . Describing Leda as ' twisted ' to me implies that she is somehow pathological , yet she represents something that many women identify with , but are too afraid to admit or explore . Where is the ambivalent mother in mainstream media @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sacrifice herself entirely for her children ? I liked your comment at the end about ' grey areas between all things ' -- I feel we should definitely be more open to the grey areas of motherhood , instead of the binary ' good ' and ' bad ' mother . <p> The film also touches brilliantly on the normalisation of , or even accepted absent father figure . The male father characters abandon or absconds from parental duties with apparently little guilt or societal pressure or judgment .

It covered findings on two state-owned enterprises ( SOEs ) , the arms manufacturer Denel and Transnet . <p> The report detailed how the Guptas and their associates used VR Laser , a long-standing defence supplier to Denel , to capture the SOE . Gigaba frequented the family 's sprawling compound in Saxonwold , with the then Denel CEO Riaz Saloojee finding him there " soliciting SOE business for his friends " , the Gupta family . <p> Scathing on the relationship between the Guptas and Gigaba , the report likened it to what one of the brothers , Tony Gupta , " used to do with Duduzane Zuma " . <p> " There is no doubt that the Guptas brought minister Gigaba to the meeting with Mr Saloojee to show him that minister Gigaba was a mere tool in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and from whom Mr Saloojee could expect no protection . <p> " A politician who did not recognise this to be so would be so naive indeed .

@@63835234 <h> OPINION <h> John Hlophe 's bungle <p> Dr. Llewelyn Curlewis - Prof. Koos Malan <p> 03 February 2022 <p> Llewelyn Curlewis and Koos Malan write on where the WCape JP went wrong in the recent Mafe case <p> On 2 January this year the South African public were shocked by the scenes of fire blazing through the seat of the national legislature . The aftershocks , however , were even more severe ... the fact that security at the parliamentary compound was seriously neglected , thus rendering the supreme symbol of South African democracy a soft target , not only for professional criminals , but apparently also for an ordinary semi destitute man -- Zandile Christmas Mafe . <p> The Mafe case soon became rather strange . More specifically , it has become political . He is drawing a train of sympathisers , if not outright supporters , suggesting that Mafe is merely an innocent victim living in the streets Cape Town , who has been framed to pay the price for the parliament conflagration . Mafe apparently seems to earn this sympathy and support irrespective of the hand that he might ( or might not ) have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the sympathisers and supporters . <p> Advocate Dali Mpofu SC ( infamous for his interactions in cases related to Zuma and the EFF to name but a few ) , was then parachuted in from Gauteng to give further weight and lustre to the Mafe defence . This undeniably added to the political flavour of the case . <p> It , however , did not stop there , since yet another curious episode had been added to the enfolding Mafe drama ; when the court order of the Regional Court for Mafe 's referral to undergo psychiatric observation in the Valkenberg psychiatric facility was successfully challenged in the Cape High Court . The main actor in this episode was the presiding judge , John Hlophe , the judge president of the Western Cape High Court . <p> At the commencement or during the trial of a person who appears , or is alleged to be , mentally disturbed , the Criminal Procedure Act 51 of 1977 provides for procedures set out in sections 77 to 79 , in order to establish whether the accused is mentally equipped to stand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actions . <p> --&gt; <p> Section 78(2) of this Act , as amended in 1998 and 2017 , provides ( emphasis added ) : " If it is alleged at criminal proceedings that the accused is by reason of mental illness or intellectual disability or for any other reason not criminally responsible for the offence charged , or if it appears to the court at criminal proceedings that the accused might for such a reason not be so responsible , the court shall in the case of an allegation or appearance of mental illness or mental disability , and may , in any other case , direct that the matter be enquired into and be reported on in accordance with the provisions of section 79 " . <p> It is clear that in the case of an allegation of , or , on the appearance of a possible mental illness or intellectual disability , the court must direct that an enquiry be made under section 79 . The accused bears no onus : section 78(1A) and ( 1B ) of the Act provide that every person is deemed mentally competent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capable of being held criminally liable for an offence ) , unless the contrary is proved on a balance of probabilities . <p> Therefore , any allegation of criminal responsibility of the accused shall rest on the party who raises it . The accused therefore attracts the burden of proving his incapacity if he alleges that mental illness excludes his criminal capacity . He is then also barred from appealing against a finding of being mentally competent ( section 78(8) ) . <p> The jurisdictional threshold set in section 78(2) is met when there is either an allegation of criminal incapacity with some indication of the reasons therefore in accordance to case law such as Makoka ( a decision handed down by the former Appellate Division as long ago as 1979 ) , or an apparent mental disturbance based on some information before the court that the accused is not criminally responsible . <p> --&gt; <p> If this is the case , the court is mandated , that is , it has no choice but to refer the accused for the necessary psychiatric enquiry , whereas , in any other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obliged to act in accordance with section 79 ) . This was confirmed in Malatji v The State , a 2013 decision ) . <p> This enquiry is therefore of paramount importance for effective adjudication of a criminal trial , since it either confirms that an accused lacks the necessary criminal capacity to have committed a crime and can therefore not be held criminally liable ; alternatively , that the accused at the time of the commission of the act in question was in fact criminally responsible for the act , but that his capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness of the act , or to act in accordance with an appreciation of the wrongfulness of the act , was diminished by reason of mental illness or intellectual disability- in which event the court may take this fact into account when sentencing the accused ( section 78(7) ) . <p> In consequence the court must adjourn the proceedings pending the outcome of the psychiatric examination . The outcome of the inquiry dispels all doubt regarding the accused 's criminal capacity at the time when the alleged crime was perpetrated . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ John Hlophe 's intervention when he overruled the Regional Magistrate 's initial order for Mafe 's psychiatric observation , rather perplexing . Criminal cases , including all issues surrounding an accused 's criminal capacity or possible lack thereof as a result of an apparent mental illness , are the daily bread of Regional Magistrates and they are well-versed in them . <p> --&gt; <p> From our understanding of the Criminal Procedure Act , the Regional Magistrate merely applied well-settled obligatory principles of law in a proper and correct way . The prosecutor in the Regional Court also simply and correctly discharged her responsibilities when she requested the court to order the accused 's referral to Valkenberg . <p> Judge President Hlophe effectively acceded to the spirited pleas of Mafe 's senior counsel , adv . Dali Mpofu . The judge stated that the Regional Court misdirected itself by ordering Mafe 's supervision in Valkenburg . To add insult to injury , even the State Advocate ( the NPA 's representative ) , quite surprisingly largely agreed with the Judge . <p> What is the use of compulsory legislative provisions if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and if we understand the reasoning of Hlophe correctly when he overturned the order of the Regional Magistrate , he relied on the wrong Act , namely the Mental Health Care Act 17 of 2002 . <p> This Act provides for the care , treatment and rehabilitation of persons who are mentally ill . Hence , on close analysis , the judge seemed to have erred on the applicable law , applying the wrong Act - the Mental Health Care Act instead of the Criminal Procedure Act . In this criminal matter where the criminal capacity of the accused is the central issue and the mentioned provisions of the Criminal Procedure Act are to be applied . The issue is not dealt with by the Mental Health Care Act . <p> --&gt; <p> We therefore suspect that Judge Hlophe was confused in his dealing with these two pieces of legislation . The legal issues the High Court had to deal with are not difficult or complicated at all . They are , in fact , dealt with on a daily basis . In the Mafe case , and for inexplicable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ astray . <p> In the Mafe case the Regional Court prosecutor did the accused and his legal team a favour , by pre-empting a possible defence and saving the court time and the taxpayer a lot of money ( by not postponing an issue that would probably be an inevitable enquiry to be followed later in any event ) . The High Court apparently erred on the applicable law , as simple as that . 
@@63835235 <h> OPINION <h> Mafe , Mpofu and Hlophe <p> Jeremy Gordin writes on the alleged parliamentary arsonist 's first appearances in the courts <p> When it comes to " rugby viewing , " I am going through a deeply frustrating time , a veritable slough of despond . <p> As we all know , Seffrican rugby has experienced extremely rough times for almost 24 months as a result of Covid and its accompaniments . Some players have had Covid , players and teams have been forced to quarantine , stadiums have been empty , and so on . <p> Even now , as limited numbers of spectators are allowed back into local stadiums , and as we valiantly keep going with the Currie Cup as well as our participation in the United Rugby Championship ( URC ) , local players and teams -- compared to those in the UK and Europe ( including Seffricans ) -- look as though they 're suffering from a species of sleeping sickness . <p> To add insult to injury , just as the Six Nations competition ( in Europe ) and the " new " Super Rugby ( in the " Pacific region @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ announced a week or so of what we euphemistically call stage two loadshedding . <p> What I know about electricity and its supply is dangerous as a hot wire , but it seems obvious to me that saboteurs are at work and I do n't understand why Eskom 's Andr ? de Ruyter does n't highlight this more than he does , though I guess he has , sort-of . <p> It might not be covered in the Constitution , but in my view denying me the right to watch rugby from all over the world via the wonders of modern technology ( unless I spend a small fortune on a generator while simultaneously splitting my neighbours ' ear drums ) is a serious incursion on my human rights . <p> --&gt; <p> If I were n't so inarticulate with rage and if my osteoarthritis and rugby injuries were n't acting up again , I 'd write to The Institute for Accountability in Southern Africa ( IFAISA ) , the Council for the Advancement of the South African Constitution ( CASAC ) , Freedom Under Law ( FUL ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Solidarity , the Democratic Alliance ( DA ) , and maybe even the Economic Freedom Fighters ( EFF ) i . <p> Now then , I apologise for imposing this rant on Polweb readers , but clearly I feel very strongly about being denied the right to watch rugby . However , I also want to suggest that , given the foregoing , readers will readily appreciate that probably only a front-end loader would be sufficient to tear me away , of a Saturday afternoon and evening , from watching rugby on TV . <p> Yet I must admit -- and I am blushing a little -- that last Saturday ( January 29 ) I was so transfixed by the bail application of one Zandile Christmas Mafe in the Cape Town Regional Court that I watched little if any rugby . <p> Mafe , as you might know , has been held responsible for the devastating fire at the houses of parliament . He has been charged with housebreaking with the intent to commit terrorism ( alternatively delivery , placement , discharge , or detonation of an explosive or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have called -- forgive me -- " arsing around " ) . STEADYPAYWALL <p> --&gt; <p> The bail hearing was riveting viewing , if only because it pitted " senior " NPA prosecutor Mervyn Menigoii , a man who could teach my ancestor Job a thing or two about patience , against one of our leading freedom fighters , Dali Mpofu SC , who was surprisingly well-behavediii . <p> Not only could one watch this tussle , if I might call it that , but it 's also common cause that the Cape Judge President Yahya John Mandlakayise Hlophe was keeping an eagle eye on proceedings iv . The JP said as much when delivering an earlier judgment declaring it unlawful for the state to have referred Mafe for psychiatric observation at Valkenberg Hospital -- because , the JP said , Mafe was not properly questioned or questioned sufficiently before being referred for psychiatric observation . <p> Now , before continuing , let me point out that the regional magistrate Michelle Adams reserved judgment until tomorrow ( Friday , 4 February ) , when we shall hear whether Mafe gets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I come from a tradition of court reporting in terms of which a reporter should desist from commenting on a case and , above all , from suggesting what the outcome might be v. <p> No matter . It is some of the evidence led during the bail hearing , not the outcome , that fascinates me . But , before turning to this " evidence , " let me also note three other issues by way of context/background . <p> --&gt; <p> First , a number of people , whose identity is unknown to me , but presumably they have a connection to so-called grassroots organisations , including the EFF ( hence the presence of Mpofu SC ) , have said that Mafe is clearly a " scapegoat " and they have " demonstrated " outside court to this effect . <p> What is unclear to me is whether they mean Mafe is a scapegoat because he is ostensibly a poor , vulnerable , homeless vi person per se ; or whether he is a scapegoat because the state knows full well that , whether Mafe set the fire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ control were the glaring lack of safeguards ( the sprinkler system was apparently not working , etc. ) and either the security cameras were not working properly or the cops on duty were snoozing vii -- in other words , the state is trying to shift the blame onto some poor , benighted fellow to take the focus off its own culpability ; or perhaps Mafe 's " supporters " mean both . <p> I mention this because it seems pretty clear to me that the state/government/etc. are , whatever happens , going to try to lay the blame four-square on Mafe -- hence the terrorism charge , which at this point , given what we know , is palpably laughable . It seems this way to me because this is what our government , state , etc. do . Owning up is not in any of the handbooks . <p> Second , during the bail hearing , magistrate Adams denied the State the use of video footage presented as evidence showing how , when and with what the suspected arsonist allegedly set Parliament alight . As Menigo remarked , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which we never got to see , was wearing the same clothes as Mafe was when arrested and bore a remarkable resemblance to him . <p> --&gt; <p> But I think it was a smart decision of the magistrate 's ; this was a bail hearing -- about whether Mafe should receive bail , had a fixed address , was a flight risk , etc. -- it was not set to deal with the charges against him . <p> Third , it is common cause , as already pointed out , that Mafe was sent to Valkenberg for observation , even if the JP found this to have been unlawfully done -- apparently because a district surgeon had diagnosed Mafe with " paranoid schizophrenia " . <p> Not being a doctor or shrink , I do n't really know what paranoid schizophrenia is . Google tells me it 's a malady " characterized by predominantly positive symptoms of schizophrenia , including delusions and hallucinations . These debilitating symptoms blur the line between what is real and what is n't , making it difficult for the person to lead a typical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point out that , as someone who has during the past 45 years observed and interviewed numerous Seffrican politicians , especially those in governing parties , there have been precious few of them without delusions and most have not been at all able to tell the difference between what is real and what is n't . <p> As for paranoia , I seem to recall that it was the great poet Delmore Schwartz viii who famously said that " Just because I 'm paranoid does n't mean I do n't have enemies " ix . <p> Which is a good point to turn at last to some of the things Mafe said -- or rather what the state said -- during Mafe 's bail hearing ( I thank you for your patience ) . <p> Speaking via an interpreter , Mafe confirmed his signature and the content of the affidavit handed in by his legal team , his identity , said he grew up in Mahikeng , completed Grade 8 , and is fluent in English , Afrikaans , Tswana , and Xhosa . <p> He also acknowledged that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very young age at school . I do n't have a problem when I 'm reading , only when I 'm talking , " he said . <p> He also said , " I 'm not guilty and I will not discuss the merit of the case because this is my bail application " and repeatedly said " no comment ' to just about everything Menigo put to him . This was obviously the instruction given to him by Mpofu ; my point though is that many who have not been labelled paranoid schizophrenics are unable to carry out simple instructions . Think about your partner or even former president Jacob Zuma ( " come to the Zondo commission " ) . <p> Now then , according to the state , Mafe , 49 , told the policemen who interviewed him after this arrest , the following six things . <p> Mafe said , ( 1 ) " It was the right thing to put the Parliament on fire , as it does not work for people like me who are suffering " . Mafe also remarked that ( 2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should not be held this year ; he referred to it as the State of the Nonsense Address . He also said ( 3 ) he knew former AWB leader Eug ? ne Terre'Blanche and considered him a friend . <p> Mafe also allegedly demanded ( 4 ) the immediate resignation of President Cyril Ramaphosa on 8 January ; ( 5 ) the release ( on the same day that former President Nelson Mandela was freed from incarceration , 11th February ) of Janusz Walus -- Mafe said Walus did not kill Chris Hani , but blamed Ramaphosa ; and ( 6 ) a monthly grant of R1 500 for the unemployed . <p> I do n't have to parse those claims and demands made by Mafe for Politicsweb readers , do I ? <p> Most of us would probably agree with ( 1 ) , ( 2 ) , ( 4 ) and ( 6 ) . I would . One or two of us might even own up to ( 3 ) . As for ( 5 ) , I also think Walus should be released . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As for who might have killed Hani , I think it was Walus and Clive Derby-Lewis , not Ramaphosa -- but there are plenty of folks , a few in the government , who insist others were involved in the plot and that this is why Walus ca n't be released " until he tells the full truth " . <p> Whichever way the bail application goes , should Mafe be sent to Valkenberg for observation ? ... I think I 've made my point(s) . I rest my case and going into the garden to kick a rugger ball around for a little while . <p> Endnotes <p> i I could even write to minister of energy and communist party stalwart Samson " Tiger " Gwede Mantashe , but Part Two of the Zondo commission report does suggest that the Tiger might have , or ought to have , other issues on his mind . And , since he seems to be the only world leader able to get anything done , I would even -- with the help of the Fishcake Gordin-Kropotkin Parkview Decembrists ( FGKPD ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> iii This might be related to Mpofu having charges pending against him after the Legal Practice Council investigated his conduct at the Zondo Commission last year and found it to be pretty poofy . This was after Mpofu rudely demanded that a colleague -- and later her client -- " shut up " and interrupted Justice Zondo when he attempted to control the proceedings . The LPC concluded that Mpofu interrupted Justice Zondo on numerous occasions and " did not uphold the accepted decorum in court " . It found that his conduct was aggravated by his having been being " contemptuous " towards Justice Zondo and having refused to accept a rebuke from him . And that it was wholly improper for him to demand that his colleague " shut up " . The LPC accordingly recommended that Mpofu be charged with professional misconduct . <p> Or it might be related to Mpofu feeling he 'd be dealt with " properly " in a court under the purview of JP Hlophe ; or perhaps Mpofu was feeling somewhat at sea having to deal with the nitty-gritty of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to spout about the Constitution ; Mpofu had to prove " exceptional circumstances " for why the accused should be granted bail . Or maybe he simply decided to behave himself . <p> iv The JP took the opportunity to point out to Mpofu , a few times , that " in the Cape , " the courts are run properly and smartly and there 'd be no messing around ; he , the JP , would make certain of this . <p> v So , I of course wo n't say a word about whether Mafe will get bail tomorrow . If he does , however , I do promise to buy both the JP and Mpofu a lunch of excellent pork potstickers at an outstanding Johannesburg restaurant in Linden . <p> vi Before Mpofu or anyone else jumped on him , Menigo noted that the correct term is " unhoused " not " homeless " . NB ! <p> vii Saps has notified four officers of its intention to suspend them , three of whom were responsible for watching security cameras on the day of the fire .

@@63835237 <h> POLITICS <h> Govt 's donation of R50m to Cuba a crime against people of SA -- FF Plus <p> Corne Mulder <p> 03 February 2022 <p> For govt to come to the aid of another country while it needs saving itself is absolutely baffling , says Corne Mulder <p> Government 's donation of R50 million to Cuba is a crime against the people of South Africa <p> 3 February 2022 <p> The ANC government 's donation of R50 million to Cuba , to reportedly assist the country with " food security " , is scandalous and borders on a criminal offence against the people of South Africa , especially those who are in need of food and shelter . <p> The deputy Minister of International Relations and Cooperation , Alvin Botes , announced the donation during a meeting of the relevant parliamentary Portfolio Committee . <p> According to Trading Economics , the unemployment rate in Cuba was 3,5% at the end of 2021 , while South Africa is teetering on the edge of ruin with its highest unemployment rate ever -- it currently stands at 35% , while the expanded unemployment rate is 46,6% . <p> This means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abject poverty . <p> --&gt; <p> Numerous schools in the country still have to make do with pit latrines ; the police force 's budget has been cut back while crime flourishes ; and doctors working at the Charlotte Maxeke Academic Hospital are yet to be paid their full salaries this year . <p> These are but a few examples demonstrating that South Africa is broke and finds itself sinking fast in economic quicksand due to mismanagement . <p> For South Africa to come to the aid of another country while it needs saving itself is absolutely baffling . Equally baffling is the reason for the donation . <p> The ANC is busy alienating itself more and more from the people of South Africa -- in this case , due to its ideological ties with a very suspect ally .

@@63842230 <h> Friendship is everything in ' Love ! Valour ! Compassion ! ' at the Artscape <h> Written by Terrence McNally , this production of the Tony Award-winning play is a warm celebration of life and light that shines despite the darkness . <p> Set in the 1990s America , eight friends descend on a summer house for three consecutive national holidays , bringing with them a whole lot of love and laughter . <p> It takes a moment to familiarise oneself with the joyous and fun cast : Gregory Mitchell is the owner of the holiday house and a successful Broadway choreographer ; he is accompanied by his lover , Bobby Brahms , who is much younger and blind . Arthur Pape and Perry Sellars are in a long-term relationship , and celebrate their fourteenth anniversary on one of the weekends , and Buzz Hauser is a wealth of theatre knowledge who breaks into song throughout . Ramon Fornos , who is a new addition to the group , is accompanied by his lover John Jeckyll . James van Helsdingen , who plays John , also plays his twin brother James Jeckyll -- and he only arrives in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , complex , and difficult topics , such as HIV/Aids , death , infidelity , ageing , disability and trauma . Yet it is never serious for long and gives each topic the attention and respect they deserve while still letting light and laughter bleed through . It is a funny and joyful take , and realistic in that this is life -- and what are hardships without being able to debate and poke fun at them with your closest friends ? The show does hold the audience with a few sombre moments , but they are interspersed among jokes and jabs that send ripples of laughter across the theatre . <p> While the set itself is minimal , the production uses every piece of the space available and more , pushing the boundaries of the stage and leaving audiences with the sense that nobody is ever too far away . They are spread out across the house , sometimes out of sight but never out of the story . <p> John 's piano can be heard from the wings , almost as if he is just in the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and sing along . While this is a convenient device that allows Van Helsdingen to play James while John is out of sight playing piano , it never feels forced .

Image : Supplied / Lefra <p> The other actors move in and out too , passing from room to room or leaping off the raft into the lake and swimming out into the wings . The spaces that are visible to the audience are fully taken advantage of too . <p> Gregory Mitchell fondly describes his house at the beginning of the production , telling of the many rooms and gardens that lead down to the lake , but there is no grand set design to bolster his picture . Rather , a few platforms raise parts of the stage and white cubes are moved to set up various scenes -- anything else would be distracting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shines and is given the space to hypnotise the audience , who give the men their full attention . The large proportion of the house is not lost in the minimal set ; conversations are had on the lake at the edge of the stage , while coffee is prepared at the house , toward the back . This mastery of space creates an intimacy with the audience and the impression that it moves along with each character . Combined with excellent lighting -- shadows and ripples dance on the stage floor like sunlight through trees and on water -- and a stellar soundtrack , the show makes up for an empty set with a plot and performance that is full of emotion . <p> The show is both a tribute and a mourning of the human body and how it changes , weakens , sickens and carries . <p> Ramon , who seems to spend more time out of his clothes than in them , is perhaps the most carefree within his body , and as he stretches out on the raft in the lake , there are always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his relationships appear superficial , and he can be perceived as simply a playboy whose presence is only impactful when it leads to conflict between others -- such as Perry and Arthur , whose performance is spectacular in its pure ordinariness . Their touches have the comfortability of people who loved each other for years , they lean into each other and gravitate towards one another with ease , their bodies fitting together as if they were not made to be apart . <p> It 's a stark contrast with Bobby and Gregory , who seem to be pulling apart from each other . Gregory spends his days in his studio , wrestling with his body as it ages and takes his livelihood of dance with it . Meanwhile , Bobby can be found wandering around the house or the garden -- the others question how the two can work as a couple , contending that Bobby could never truly know Gregory as he will never physically see the dance that makes the older man who he is . <p> Schoeman Smit as Buzz Hauser .

While not all eight of the friends are sick , it is clear that this affects them all in some way -- either personally , or just by the reality of being a part of the queer community in the nineties . <p> At one point in the play , Perry laments that he " will always feel like a bystander at the genocide of who we are " , as he reflects on the shadow of Aids that hangs over them , like a Damocles sword . <p> While relationships hit highs and lows , lovers and friends fight and make up and meals are shared ; there is something fondly familiar about the show , as the characters search for meaning and grapple with the realities of living and dying . And within the imminence and inevitability of death there is the overwhelming heartbeat of life and humanity that binds the show together , and the cast and the audience with it . DM/ML <p> Love !

@@63842237 <h> Email this article <h> Check how far your rent stretches -- before you sign a lease <p> Many landlords are still seeking to contain their costs and pass along certain charges to their tenants . <p> By Gerhard Kotz ? 5 Feb 2022 00:01 <p> Image : Shutterstock <p> Even when they have a written lease , tenants are often uncertain about what their monthly rent actually includes , especially if they are renting a flat or townhouse in a sectional title complex . <p> And they need to make sure before they sign a lease , or they could find themselves having to pay for things that were not in their budget . <p> The rental market has been through a very tough time in the past 18 months , and while things are starting to improve* , many landlords are still seeking to contain their costs and pass along certain charges to their tenants . <p> In sectional title schemes , for example , the owner of each unit is responsible for their own interior maintenance and repairs -- which should be covered by the rent being charged if they let their units out . However @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't live close to their rental units , landlords can pass the responsibility for some maintenance and repairs on to their tenants , in return for a reduction in rent . But in such cases the lease should stipulate exactly what is expected of the tenant and the value of the rent concession . <p> On the other hand , tenants in sectional title developments usually have no responsibility for the upkeep of building exteriors or the common garden or parking areas . This is handled by the trustees on behalf of the body corporate -- which is the collective of all the unit owners in the scheme -- and is not covered by tenants ' rentals but by the levies that those owners must pay . <p> This does not mean , though , that prospective tenants can forget about levies . Their lease should state whether or by how much their rent will be increased if their landlord 's levy is increased -- or if the trustees suddenly decide on a special levy to cover an unexpected expense in the running of the scheme . <p> In our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rate of inflation in many complexes recently , often due to the need for the body corporate to build up a bigger reserve fund in line with legislation that is now being more strictly implemented by the Community Housing Schemes Ombud . <p> By contrast , rentals have stayed flat or increased by only a very small percentage since the start of 2020 , so it is understandable that landlords would wish to recoup at least some of their levy increases from tenants , and are now providing for this in leases . <p> Another thing for tenants to consider is how they will be billed for municipal services -- that is , whether they will get an individual account reflecting their own , real usage , or whether they will be charged according to a ' participation quota ' ( PQ ) that depends on the size of their unit in relation to the whole sectional title scheme . <p> These days , most sectional title units do have a separate municipal electricity meter or a pre-paid meter that means tenants will only pay for their own usage . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each unit , which means that the local authority sends the body corporate a bulk account that is then divided among the residents according to the PQs of their units . <p> This can become very unfair as it does not necessarily reflect tenants ' real usage of water at all . For example , the couple renting a three-bedroom flat is very likely to consume less water than the family of four renting a two-bedroom unit in the same complex , but may well be charged more because the PQ of the three-bedroom unit is higher . <p> Alternatively , water usage calculated according to PQs might be added to the monthly levies that unit owners have to pay -- and when water charges are increased steeply as they have been this year , landlords could once again be looking to pass on at least some of this extra expense to their tenants . Consequently , prospective tenants should always aim to be billed for their own actual usage of utilities . <p> In addition , they must make sure that the sectional title scheme they are considering is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to risk living in a complex that can not be properly maintained for lack of funds , or where the units are about to be attached and sold in execution to meet body corporate arrears . <p> And finally , we always suggest that they obtain a copy of the management rules for the particular sectional title scheme , before they sign a lease . The rules of a scheme apply to tenants just as they would to owners but are often not specifically noted in lease agreements . And while they generally cover common nuisances such as loud music and noisy parties , they may , for instance , ban all pets or contain other restrictions that would make an otherwise suitable unit undesirable for some tenants . <p> *According to the latest PayProp Rental Index , the average rate of rental increase rose to 0,4% year-on-year during the second quarter of 2021 , compared to a multi-year low of 0,2% at the end of 2020 .

The deadline has since been extended to February 15 . <p> The purpose of the basecase report was to establish baseline information for the natural gas sector in South Africa , the DMRE said when it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ value chain and regulatory framework . <p> Advertisement <p> The report also aimed to set the scene for the Gas Master Plan development process . Once developed , the Gas Master Plan would serve as a policy instrument , providing a roadmap for taking strategic , political and institutional decisions which would guide industry investment planning and coordinated implementation , the DMRE said . <p> In its submission , Just Share argued that it is " irrational to continue to invest in fossil fuels when these are not least-cost , sustainable , nor required for energy security . " <p> " New fossil fuel projects , as envisaged in the Integrated Resource Plan for electricity , will harm South Africa 's global competitiveness , lock the country into many more decades of harmful air pollution , environmental degradation and carbon emissions , and thwart our ability to meet ambitious emission reduction targets in the future , " it added . <p> In the Basecase Report , the DMRE said fossil gas would play a " very important role " in South Africa going forward , and that it had " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ growth and development , stability and job creation " . <p> Just Share claimed that the DMRE failed to outline the scientific , policy or regulatory basis for the report 's assertion that the pursuit of significant gas development was an appropriate pathway for South Africa . <p> " The DMRE 's position is not supported either by independent analysis or by evidence on the ground . Instead , the Basecase report relies largely on information provided by the gas industry to support its claims about the future role of gas , " Just Share said in a statement on February 3 . <p> The activist organisation further asserted that the report ran counter to the global pressure to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions . <p> " For a stable electricity system , supply and demand through the grid must be balanced . While gas plants can provide flexibility to the system , several expert studies confirm that stored energy -- whether through batteries or options like ice , pumped hydropower , heat , chilled water and electrochemical , and gravity storage -- could also play that role , " Just Share @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Moreover , Just Share labelled the DMRE 's intention to create an artificial gas market by using the electricity sector as an " anchor tenant " to stimulate gas demand " irrational and unnecessary " . <p> The report stated that a " challenge in developing the gas sector is to bring gas demand and supply on stream at the same time and spread geographically to stimulate broader localised demand through South Africa " . It said the plan for breaking this impasse was to create significant anchor gas demand through the development of a gas-to-power programme . <p> However , Just Share pointed to analyst reports that said new gas capacity would not be needed to meet South Africa 's electricity demand and prevent load-shedding for at least the next decade . Just Share quoted a report by research and analysis organisation Meridian Economics , which said that the option to delay new gas development would hold " immense value for the country " and that there was no need to lock into long-term gas commitments for now . <p> Just Share further asserted that , despite the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the fossil gas sector , and ultimately inform " strategic , political and institutional decisions which will guide industry investment planning and coordinated implementation " , it was prepared without a tool " to model the current gas sector in the country , as well as to develop immediate sector expansion scenarios " . <p> The organisation said the absence of robust modelling made the development of a rational Gas Master Plan impossible . <p> Just Share further said the Basecase report made no reference to any of the substantial research and credible modelling on the gas sector published by independent institutions and civil society , choosing to rather quote projections made by the gas industry . <p> " It is in the interests of fossil fuel companies , and their associated industry associations , to motivate for the increased exploitation of gas . Claims and projections made by those with vested interests must be carefully and objectively interrogated , and compared and contrasted with independent analyses , " Just Share said . <p> In terms of emissions , the shareholder activist organisation said the DMRE provided " no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was clean and environment-friendly , and that it would help South Africa meet its climate change commitments . <p> Moreover , the report made no mention of the 2015 Paris Agreement , any of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change reports , nor South Africa 's Nationally Determined Contribution ( NDC ) in terms of the Paris Agreement , Just Share pointed out , adding that the report failed to demonstrate how the DMRE 's gas ambitions would align with South Africa 's climate commitments in its NDC . <p> In terms of the economic benefits of South Africa pursuing a gas strategy , Just Share believed there were none . <p> " The Basecase report provides no substantiation for its assertions that the economy will benefit from developing gas resources . . . it is inexplicable that the government would choose to follow a path which will almost certainly entrench and exacerbate existing inequality and energy challenges , " Just Share stated . <p> Hugo said a " wealth of evidence " demonstrated that rapid and extensive scaling up of renewable energy generation was the most cost-optimal energy pathway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presented significant economic benefits and opportunities .

This means earning the minimum wage is not enough to secure basic needs for a family . <p> " It is clear that companies can do more to balance job creation with improving the lives of workers by committing to paying wages that meet employees ' minimum needs , lift them out of poverty and allow them to live a dignified life , " PwC People and Organisation division director Makhosazana Mabaso says . <p> JSE NONEXECUTIVE DIRECTOR PROFILE <p> This year 's report found that the number of NEDs serving on the boards of active JSE-listed companies was 1 955 , which is 151 fewer than in 2021 .

@@63860232 <h> OPINION In defence of our brother and colleague Dali Mpofu <p> EFF leader Julius Malema and Advocate Dali Mpofu at the interviews for South Africa 's next Chief Justice at Park Hotel in Sandton last week . ( Photo by Gallo Images/Daily Maverick/Felix Dlangamandla ) <p> A group of advocates has written a response to Adriaan Basson , saying his article on Dali Mpofu was an irresponsible attack on a legal practitioner performing his constitutional duties . <p> On 7 February 2022 Mr Adriaan Basson , Editor-in-Chief of News 24 published an article in which he sought not merely to differ with our own brother and senior colleague , Dali Mpofu SC , but also sought to pour upon him gratuitous insults typical of the colonial and barbaric attitude of whiteness towards Africans in general , and more recently , African professionals in particular . <p> We consider the article an irresponsible attack on a legal practitioner performing his constitutional duties . <p> The Judicial Service Commission performs a constitutional duty , and it is in that context we must view his contribution . If Basson is so committed to polite language as he claims , his point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Malema , could be done without resorting to narcissistic insults . <p> Basson chooses to refer to Mpofu as " a scoundrel , immoral and a nincompoop " . Of course , the term nincompoop is drawn from the Latin phrase " non compos mentis " , which means a person not of right mind . Really ? We note the racial undertones in his attack and find it an outrage that in his desire to differ with Mpofu SC , he resorts to gratuitous insults and slurs , whose roots are clearly what he ( Basson ) inherits from his colonial racist heritage that settled on our shores to rape , to plunder , to exploit , to maim and to colonise . <p> He naturally sees Mpofu , the same way the colonial forefathers saw an African : an immoral , depraved and irrational being , whose race is so inferior it deserves the master 's sharp tongue and reprimand . <p> Basson could well differ with Mpofu SC , and he is entitled to do so , but we take exception to the seeming colonial logic that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the insults ? It comes from the same people , who , not so long-ago lynched Minister Lindiwe Sisulu when she expressed a world view that does not coincide with theirs . Clearly , like some among us , Basson is unhappy with the outcome of the JSC interviews for the position of Chief Justice . <p> Save to state that we respect each and every candidate that appeared before the JSC recently , we make no comments about the process because that is not the focus of our statement . <p> Patronising and cheap <p> Basson employs the old device made popular by whiteness when insulting us . In the hope that they , like his minions , crave white approval , he draws a line between Mpofu on the one hand and the likes of Semenya , Ntsebeza and Mtshaulana on the other . How patronising . How cheap . <p> Ntsebeza , Semenya and Mtshaulana can never join him as he insults one of their own . He , typically , as the superior one , arrogates upon himself the knowledge of what Mpofu and Julius Malema @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Basson descends to gratuitous insults in order to challenge what he views as insulting and unfair to certain candidates . <p> Many like Basson are just unhappy that an African woman , Justice Mandisa Maya , was recommended and have conjured up a plethora of excuses and feeble legal argument to justify what is at best their displeasure or at worst , their prejudice . Ironically , it is they , the self-appointed super democrats , and not Mpofu , who are inspired by misogyny . <p> We will defend both Mpofu and Justice Maya and we consider it a national disgrace that after 27 years of almost five male Chief Justices since the democratic breakthrough , there is opposition disguised as constitutionalism , to a recommendation we should all celebrate . <p> We must expose the mindset that inspires these insults and state categorically that we will not tolerate them because they are what Africans have endured for centuries since white settlers set their oppressive , thieving , murderous and exploitative foot on our shores . <p> To the extent that we may be dealing with embedded journalism , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with interests that have always sought to direct South Africa towards a neo-liberal reality , and away from the goal of creating a society that is the antithesis of apartheid colonialism . <p> No white legal practitioner , no matter what crook or rapist they represent has ever been attacked or insulted by the likes of Basson and his ilk . They reserve their attacks for African professionals because they arrogate to themselves the role of superior to Africans , whom they see as sub-human . <p> One of the things betrayed by the racist attitude in Basson 's article is the extent to which social , political and economic reality is dominated by another reality -- the fact that whiteness has become South Africa 's new majority , whose world view , and ways of being have become the dominant reality in our neo-apartheid state . <p> The agenda is to make sure that the interests of the new cultural majority are imposed , enforced , promoted and maintained . One of the ways in which this happens is through the imposition of an echo-chamber , which , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opinion , and anything that falls outside this cannon is base , immoral and irrational , and anything that falls outside this cannon is as barbaric as what the white coloniser imagined the African to be . This is a logic of whiteness which is the offspring of coloniality , a logic that is governed by the belief that those who are not white are not as human as those who are , and it is therefore not immoral to visit upon them the barbarism of colonialism and apartheid . <p> Neo apartheid <p> It is actually in defence of this barbarism , which today exists as neo-apartheid that people like Basson can , with no sense of irony , engage in the double-standard we see in his article . At the centre of this bigoted tendency is the arrogance of whiteness , an arrogance that seeks to keep the land , the economy , the rule of law and the legal profession in the control of white people . <p> Furthermore , this is a tendency that is borne out of the arrogance of some among us , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are the high priests and priestesses , masters , guardians and custodians of modernity , democracy and constitutionalism . Only through what their world view and what they imagine to be democratic does democracy exist . <p> Anything that resides outside their imagination and does not coincide with their pi notions of democracy is undemocratic , and those who dare challenge their illusory and self-serving notions of democracy are the barbarians at the gate . One of the challenges facing South Africa today is a network of whiteness , propagated through the mainstream media , which transcends ideology , parties and political interests . In many ways , it even transcends race , in so far as some of its allies are people who are on the periphery of whiteness , but through assimilation into its culture , have become adept at mimicking its disdain towards blackness , its grammar and superior tone and have therefore become its useful idiots . <p> We are outraged by the language used by Basson against Mpofu and understand that it represents , not only his bigoted attitude towards Mpofu , but also his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are part of the culture reserved for black professionals . No white professional , no matter how uncultured , has had to endure the kind of insults Basson and his ilk direct at black professionals and black people in general . <p> Basson occupies a very important media space and should use that space more sensitively than to propagate his own insults towards Mpofu . We ask Basson to reconsider , not his views , because he is entitled to them , but the painful import of his insults against Mpofu , and by extension , against all of us . We call on Basson , News24 and all the NGO 's of super democrats and certain sections of the media to be more responsible in their natural instinct to dislike African people . <p> This racist campaign and political vendetta against Mpofu and other senior African advocates are unhelpful for our country . It detracts from the real mission of creating a truly free society for Africans in the land of their birth . We know how it feels to face the wrath and organised persecution by an army @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all of us . <p> We expect the attacks that will come our way as a result of this statement and call upon all progressive structures in the legal profession like AFT , BLA , PABASA and NADEL to join us in defending ourselves against this racist onslaught . <p> *Want to respond to the columnist ?

@@63862237 <h> Why The Middle-Class Is Disappearing <p> The middle class was once a symbol of the American dream . It meant financial security and an opportunity for a better future . But that portrait of the American middle class is quite different today . A survey in 2018 found that a third of middle-income adults do n't have as much as $400 to cover an unexpected expense . And while the middle-class lifestyle grows more expensive and uncertain , it 's also moving beyond the reach of younger generations . " It was at least a secure category , " said Alissa Quart , author of ' Squeezed : Why Our Families Ca n't Afford America , ' but there are certain kinds of assumptions around being a middle-class person " that have " shattered " over the past 10 to 15 years . Some middle-income households and experts believe a lack of supporting policies might be to blame for the drastic changes . " There is no help whatsoever , " according to Chantal Jacob , a middle-income parent from suburban Texas . " There 's no policy in place to assist people . And I feel like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as you 're working , they 're just like , ' That 's all you need , a job . You got it , go forth and have at it . ' " Lawrence Mishel , a distinguished fellow at the Economic Policy Institute , shares that sentiment . " It 's not that the economy got worse , it was that there were policy decisions made so that the economic growth did not filter down to the vast majority . " The Biden administration has been pushing for several bills aimed at supporting middle-income households , including the $1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure legislation passed in November 2021 and the Build Back Better Act currently stalled in Congress . But observers say it might not be enough to save the middle class from economic hardship now and in the future . " My friends that were struggling are still struggling , " said Jacob . " I 'm still budgeting down to every dollar trying to get things done .

In 2015 she was living with her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times to visit the country she felt unconsciously connected to , but it took a chance encounter with a SA icon at a White House event with her lawyer husband to convince her to finally take the trip home . <p> After some time off I 'd returned to duty days before global peace icon Desmond Tutu passed away . Like many South Africans I felt an uneasy sense of loss . From a young age " the Arch " was a name weighted with the utmost respect in my family home . <p> I 'd spent four days in Cape Town , covering the final farewells for a man whom many viewed as the country 's sharpest moral compass . Little did I know the dejection I felt , would be shared so intently by Christa . <p> One would imagine there would be no shortage of fascinating guests at the White House , but Christa only hoped to meet one specific guest , Desmond Tutu -- a man she had long revered . <p> " Tutu was standing at one end and there was a photographer and people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remember thinking I would give anything to talk to him , I do n't care about a photo . " <p> The healer 's face lights up as she draws on her memory of a person approaching . Seconds later she had her hands grasped out in front of her by Tutu , greeting her as if she was an old friend . <p> " He asked me about my life and asked me what I was doing and then asked me whether I 'd been to his country , SA . <p> " I thought to myself , I know where you live , dude , I 've tried , got cancer , this happened . And he said , no shame , it will all work out , but you must come home now .

She spent a month in the country , living in top-end reserves , travelling through many of the country 's provinces and experiencing many of the land 's diverse cultures . <p> After a month in SA , she returned to her family in the US with a heavy heart . She felt unfulfilled , and by her own admission could only speak about her trip or cry for days on end . <p> " My husband and I were not sleeping in the same room at that point -- we had n't been in a long time -- and I went in one morning and was watching him sleep as I often would , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're going back are n't you ?

Due to visa requirements , she would leave the country every three months briefly to renew her visa . <p> During one of her frequent trips to Phindi , a lodge in KwaZulu-Natal , Christa convinced one of her local guide friends to take her to see a " real " sangoma . Having always explored different paths of healing , Christa sought a visit with a traditional healer that was n't part of the usual tourist spiel . <p> " We walked into this roundhouse that was kind of dark and filled with gourds , coffee cans , formula cans , bottles , beaded things and animal skins . We sat on mats and waited , and Baba Gumede shuffled in at some point , " Christa laughs as she describes the somewhat dishevelled look of the man who would become her father upon their first meeting . <p> She says she immediately felt a connection with Baba , despite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the word " light " for " right " . After some general discussion , Christa asked the sangoma if he had any insights on her remaining in SA as she felt her heart was here . <p> Gumede said the two would talk some more upon their next encounter , knowing Christa would return . <p> " There was that recognition , and I was aware that he also felt it . It was not anything I was used to or could explain in words but it was just a knowing , " Christa says . <p> As her visits continued , he consistently spoke to her about ubizo , or the calling , asking her about her dreams , if she 'd lost children and so forth . The answers were mostly yes . It became apparent he could see a traditional healer 's path for her . <p> " He started calling me his daughter after a couple of months and I did n't think much of it at first , but then realised that he meant more , like his actual daughter , " she says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her a story of how after his first child was born , he was in discussion with his own Mkhulu , his grandfather , who said this may not be his first child .

Gumede began to train Christa in traditional healing . <p> In 2018 , while Christa was on one of her visa-required trips , Baba fell ill and passed away . She immediately went home and led the funeral preparations as the eldest daughter -- a clear indication that the family had been as prepared for the prophecy as Baba was . <p> Traditional practices are not the only place Christa finds her healing . She also finds solace in creative outlets such as writing and creating multi-medium artworks . The walls of her home are bejewelled with artworks of complex , colourful layers .

A complete sense of trust hangs in the air and the lengthy discussion is littered with inexplicable coincidence . <p> " I think all traditional African practices are much closer to filling our basic human needs , and in the white world , we have sanitised life to the point where we are missing these basic practices . I personally , and my father agreed with me , think that accounts for a lot of the world 's ills . " <p> Shaped by trauma , she now dedicates her life to helping others .

@@63882232 <p> In this podcast , ActionSA founder and leader Herman Mashaba explains why the attraction of former DA heavyweight Athol Trollip is such a coup for his party . The news created a stir in the Eastern Cape where the popular Trollip will lead ActionSA 's 2024 election charge . Mashaba also addresses apparent ructions within the young party , including the fracas over its KZN leader Makhosi Khoza ; and unpacks his strategy in Gauteng where the coalition 's governance of Ekurhuleni and Johannesburg is looking increasingly fragile . <p> It came about when we launched the people 's dialogue in 2019 . After I resigned from the DA , I tried to meet with him and unfortunately , I could n't . I let it go because we were overwhelmed by the response of the people 's dialogue . So , I focused on that before inviting people to join , as the whole idea behind the people 's dialogue was to establish whether people who were calling for me to start a political party were real or not . When I started this project , my target was half a million people . We ended up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to start a political party , which we launched on 29 August 2020 . It was in the middle of Covid-19 , I was overwhelmed and had to prepare for elections with the IEC making it difficult for us to register . I made contact with Athol because I knew we were not going to contest the Eastern Cape . I then focused on the areas and municipalities where we would contest . Groundbreaking electoral reform happened . Then it dawned on me that 2024 is around the corner and I had already made a commitment that ActionSA was going to contest nationally . Upon my return from vacation at the beginning of January , I met with Athol . I thought of him as a very great , strong individual . I also had the advantage of knowing him reasonably well during my days in the DA . Eventually , last week we finalised the sign-off . My team said we should have the conference in Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality and we had people today coming all the way from Buffalo Bay to welcome Athol . I feel proud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ActionSA as a vehicle to save South Africa from the ANC <p> The media being receptive is an understatement . We had a full house . Our national spokesperson , Lerato , organised Athol 's interviews . The poor guy , everyone is looking to talk to him . It 's been overwhelming , the news has been well received . ActionSA honestly and truly believes it has got an asset , someone with many years of experience , committed to this country . I do n't want South Africans who join us to save ActionSA . We are a vehicle to save this country from the ANC . Our preference is South Africa first . Let us put the interests of this country ahead of our political party . <p> We were taken by surprise when she wrote to us requesting to step down as provincial chair and senate and to serve only as ward councillor . About a week later , we learnt of her election as MPAC by the ANC . We had a senate meeting to discuss this matter and decided we can not reverse this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Makhosi to play . We left it as such and prepared a press statement , which she signed off . In January , we started getting vibes that Makhosi has been removed from the senate and provincial chair . I reported the matter to our disciplinary committee and they are pursuing it . I am really hoping to get the results of their findings and what course of action to take . <p> On ructions within ActionSA <p> For people to say ActionSA has massive ructions is absolute nonsense and an over-exaggeration . Yes , we 've got issues which we 've raised . We have had issues with some ambitious people who joined our party thinking we are an employment agency , claiming to be responsible for our performance . That 's the kind of nonsense . These are former members whom we 've flushed out of our system . Some are now working with the people who are planted to cause disruptions at our meetings in Tshwane , and we are dealing with them . They are in our disciplinary committee because we are not going to tolerate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the decision to step down from the council of the Johannesburg metro <p> I can only work so many hours . I have been in the Eastern Cape . I 'm needed in Limpopo , in Mpumalanga and the Western Cape . I have to deal with all six municipalities where we 've contested . Council work requires dedication and I was serving as a caucus leader . For our 2024 project to succeed , I needed to give someone else a chance . I decided to step down rather than fail in my duties as a caucus leader and a counsellor . 2024 is around the corner and we 've still got to draw provincial chairpersons in four provinces . I have a huge responsibility to identify provincial leadership that can steer this movement to unseat the ANC . That 's our main objective . The only way we can remove the ANC is to recruit strong provincial leaders . Gauteng contested to take the ANC under 50% . We have taken them in the mid/lower 30s , so that says we 've given South Africans the hope and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ANC way below 30%.

The organisation will complement this activity and assist other countries in Africa and other low- and middle-income countries to strengthen bio-manufacturing capacity as well as regulatory capacity . <p> mRNA vaccine technology has been used in shots for two of the COVID-19 vaccines : Pfizer and Moderna .

" Once a vaccine has been successfully developed , other manufacturers from around the world will be able to produce the vaccine for national and regional use . <p> " The pandemic has highlighted the need for increased local production of vaccines globally , especially in low- and middle-income countries .

" <p> Last week , Afrigen gained international recognition following its announcement that it had developed its own version of an mRNA shot , based on the publicly available data on the composition of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine , which will be tested in the coming months . <p> " This virus shows how interconnected we all are and I am proud that Belgium -- and other EU countries -- are now collaborating to build vaccine capacity everywhere , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sharing of licences , technology transfer and know-how so that in this pandemic , and future ones , we can rollout vaccines quickly and equitably to the whole global population .

@@63887230 <h> Maverick Life <h> STRUCTURE &amp; CULTURE <h> A new public art sculpture and wellness park soon to launch in Braamfontein <h> A previously mothballed , cordoned-off area on a historical site in Braamfontein has been transformed into an art , sculpture and wellness park by a team of experts led by architect Edmund Batley . <p> Opposite Wits University on the Braamfontein Ridge where the legendary SA Breweries building is located , the new park -- designed by architect Edmund Batley -- is a gateway from the northern suburbs to the city centre , and where Mandela Bridge , the Diamond Building and the Eland sculpture are orientation points . The entrance to the Liberty offices has become a grand porte-coch ? re and drop-off arrangement . <p> As yet unnamed , the approximately 4-hectare space promotes visual and physical connection to its urban context while simultaneously providing a space to escape from the craziness of Joburg city life , to reconnect with nature , engage with works of art , take a meditative meander , kick off one 's shoes for a foot massage on a reflexology surface , ground oneself on an earthing mound , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trees , plants and grasses , bonsais , medicinal herbs , " lei water " channels with rushing water and tranquil reflective pools all echo the healing spirit of the site . <p> The concept , which evolved over several years was loosely termed the " Beacon Project " , as in " a beacon of hope " by the team of experts involved . <p> Unlike many others in his profession , Batley does not appear to be bracketed by a particular architectural typology . " We have never built anything that we do n't want to build and we never have any preconceived idea what our projects are going to look like when we start our design process ; they evolve from a series of checks and balances of what the final product needs to become , " he says . <p> He approached professionals who knew the city , understood what would work , and had relevant experience to help him realise the vision of a city park : James Delaney , who reimagined The Wilds ; the doyen of indigenous gardening , Patrick Watson ; lighting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sustainability consultant and co-founder of PaperThinkLAB , Thulani Kuzwayo ; as well as water features expert Pawel Gradowski . <p> " Every construction or architectural process is massively collaborative " says Batley . " What happened on ' beacon ' though was highly unusual because Covid contributed significantly to the outcome . " <p> James Delaney brought important insights from his experience at The Wilds about how to reclaim the carpark and turn it into a place of healing , wellness and reconnection . In fact , " wellness " became the theme for the park . <p> " Those of us in the design field realised how public spaces are becoming more and more important for people for regeneration and reconnection , " Batley says . " We felt we had to create something that would be accessible to as many people as possible . Will students use it ? Yes . Will office workers use it ? Yes . Will people from Braamfontein use it ? Yes . Will people from the Constitutional Court use it ? Hopefully , yes .

The artwork was designed by artist and community activist Andrew Lindsay and was completed by his Spaza Gallery team after he suddenly passed away in October 2021 . <p> " It took a while to figure out the scope of the job after Drew died , " Spaza team leader Dionne McDonald explains . " We are working with his original design but I do n't have his colour reference . He always worked in black and white and we worked in the colours as we were going along , but because he is a part of us , he has trained all of us , there is no way that he ca n't be present in the work that we do . His voice is in our ears and sometimes I will even say to the crew : Drew is so proud of you for that piece , because I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Speaking about the project , Lindsay had said that working on the design had made him think about how little attention we pay to nature and to where and how we walk . He wanted people to discover elements of the design , like insect images , hidden in the mosaic , adding : " It is also about teaching people to be aware of their environment . " <p> At least six other artworks by better-known and emerging artists feature in the park -- works by Rirhandzu Makhubele , Zanele Montle , Grace Mokalapa , Pat Mautloa , Hannelie Coezee and James Delaney . " Artists have come up with an idea for each location that we designated , " Batley explains . <p> MojaNation creative visualist Farai Mafurirano says the aim was to enhance a sense of wellness by engaging with the artworks at a spiritual , emotional and intellectual level . <p> In addition , Kuzwayo explains that a " Net Zero " tool was used to calculate whether developments to the site are positive for ecology . It is not about repairing previous ecological damage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example , planting more indigenous plants and prioritising permeable surfaces over hardscaping . <p> Kuzwayo 's team surveyed the site and recommended the removal of some alien species as weeds . " The eucalyptus was kept because it is about 60 years old , " he says , adding : " The ecological angle is not limited to plant species and nature . The park is addressing a social dimension that is desperately needed in the city as well as contributing to the idea of rewilding the city or bringing more nature into the city . " <p> In discussions with Batley and the design team , Kuzwayo promoted a biophilic framework ( an approach to design that focuses on improving our " connectivity to the natural environment " ) . Landscape designer Patrick Watson , who is known for his indigenous gardens , selected plants based on his experience of the 30-acre Hollard Arcadia Campus garden in Parktown , which he designed . He explains : " You let things happen . I always argue with engineers . They say : I will put a column here . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seed itself down the hill . " <p> Together with his son , Jean-Paul Watson , and Abram Mokoti , Watson is doing all the planting while James Delaney selected the medicinal plants . " The concept is grasslands , so it is this surreal thing where you have got wildness in an urban setting . It is spiritual . It is the veld in central Johannesburg and it is about contrast , there are no hedges and things like that ... and there are stone walls so you have a sense of country and history , which is quite unusual for the city . " <p> About 80% of the plants will be indigenous to the Highveld and the rest will be exotic plants from all over the world . " Just to use wild in Braamfontein would be a bit too radical , " he says . The part of the garden that is natural to Braamfontein will bring the butterflies back , and restore it to what it used to be . " It is like bringing artistic wild into an urban setting and I think that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it will work as a sculpture park . " Grasses will include indigenous and ornamental varieties . " I think that will be quite a nice soft spot , especially since it is quite masculine with hard walls and buildings . " <p> At the back , bordering on Helpmekaar School , the property slopes up to the ridge and down on the other side . " We are exposing rocks that are of geological interest , " says Watson . " They are soldered shales that are part of the Witwatersrand system . The rocks on the Helpmekaar side go to the Indian Ocean and the ones on the other side go to the Atlantic . I think it is exactly on the watershed . " <p> That 's not all : Yellowwood trees planted in the Breweries garden 60 years ago are still there , and now , more are being added . Wild grasses and 120 stinkwood trees are being planted , and nine additional wild fig trees have been planted in the front of the building . <p> The original idea was to design a new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accessible to Wits students as part of an entrepreneurs ' ideas initiative . " From Patrick 's indigenous plants to our spine and meandering walkways , to James 's ' earthing mound ' and stepping stones , to Pawel 's tranquil water features and Paul 's experiential lighting , we have debated things thoroughly . It has been a very , very good team collaboration experience , " Batley says . <p> " How do you make something relevant to people who live in the city and also attract people who live further away in the suburbs ? You have got to make a green space not only beautiful and attractive , but also relevant and engaging so it draws people and makes them come back over and over again , " says Delaney . <p> He adds : " We have worked with the theme of healing so it will not only be a beautiful landscape to walk through and a nice place to go for a picnic , but there will be much greater depth to the story . Healing is about how plants and landscape can help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the textures and even medicinal qualities of many plants ; it 's about meditation spaces , and it is about going to a place where you can relax . These are all aspects of holistic healing . " <p> Beacon Park Location .

" It is on top of a koppie , a natural lookout point , which is part of the Witwatersrand ridges , which are part of the gold-bearing reef upon which the city is built . " <p> He also hopes that the Braamfontein park will be a safe space for all to enjoy : " We are taking quite a progressive approach . There wo n't be any walls around it , it will stay open till late at night and will be well lit , and there will be security and cameras and visible security , but it is a low-key approach .

@@63887232 <h> From artificial snow at the Beijing Winter Games to dams being too low to row in : the sports world is having to come to terms with unusual and unpredictable conditions . <p> The 2022 Beijing Winter Games made Olympic history this month by becoming the first Winter Games to be held on 100% artificial snow . <p> A recent report found that climate change is threatening the Winter Olympics and the future of snow sports , with the dependence on artificial snow changing the nature of the games and the warming climate decreasing potential venues . <p> Valentin Cretu of Team Romania slides during the Men 's Singles training run ahead of the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympic Games at National Sliding Centre on February 03 , 2022 in Yanqing , China . ( Photo by Julian Finney/Getty Images ) <p> And this is n't just an issue for snow sports . At the 2021 Tokyo Summer Olympics , dubbed the " hottest Games in history " , athletes battled to compete in high temperatures and humidity and events were rescheduled to earlier hours of the day . <p> Willem Landman , professor in meteorology at the University @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told DM168 : " When climate changes in the way that they project , and I believe that projections are reliable , it may lead to having more heat and less rain . And when there 's more heat , obviously , there 's going to be problems for people running marathons , for example , and less water would have a serious impact on all water sports . " <p> Dr Pedro Scheel Monteiro , a marine biogeochemistry and oceanography specialist and the head of Ocean Systems and Climate at the CSIR , told DM168 : " The rise in the incidence , magnitude and persistence of extreme events ( heat , water cycle , storms ) as a result of the continued emissions of greenhouse gas emissions will increasingly constrain our social choices , including sports . <p> " This is likely also to be felt in the planning of large sports events such as world cups and Olympic games that require long lead times and conditions that accommodate large numbers of people comfortably . " <p> The 2022 Fifa World Cup is to be held in Doha @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's summer temperatures reach the high 30s and 40s , the players will play in 21 ? C. <p> " It is these increasing costs of adaptation and damage recovery in general , and for sports events particularly , that also makes it essential to rapidly cut greenhouse gas emissions and stay under the target of 1.5 ? C. " <p> However , Landman , whose research interests include climate variability , was quick to point out that " we should not confuse climate change with climate variability " . <p> Climate variability is when aspects of the climate ( such as heat or rain ) are different from the average -- for example , one year having a hot summer and the next a cooler summer . The key is that this occurs because of natural causes . Climate change is an adjustment in the climate anthropogenically -- change caused by humans . <p> Rainfall , heat , droughts are naturally occurring phenomena , and Earth has variations when there are years with more or fewer of these events . <p> Climate change does n't cause this ; however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is a very strong likelihood that climate change will increase the frequency and intensity of these events . <p> " And when we have more extremes -- like bigger storms and more heat days -- those things will impact on sports , " said Landman . <p> Piotr Wolski , senior climate researcher at the ? ? Climate System Analysis Group at the University of Cape Town , agreed , saying : " We 're not able to say that event would n't have happened without climate change ... So what we do , for instance , is talk about the changing probability of an event , i.e. how often does that event happen . " <p> Wolski says the important thing to focus on is how we expect the climate to change , such as intensification and increased frequency of rainfall , droughts and heatwaves . <p> Rower Jake Green , who represented SA in the 2021 Tokyo and 2016 Rio Summer Olympics , said the national squad has faced issues with lack of rainfall , explaining how dam levels affected their high-altitude training camps in Lesotho . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the river because there 's no water left in the dam , which is crazy . When we first went to Katse Dam in 2013 , it was like 80 to 90% full . And to actually look at the water receding , it 's really , really scary . " <p> ' When we first went to Katse Dam in 2013 , it was like 80-90% full . And to actually look at the water recede , it 's really , really scary , ' said Olympic rower Jake Green . ( Photo : Roger Barrow ) <p> Green and his teammates said , in recent years , rowing camps in Tzaneen and Ebenezer in Limpopo had to be cancelled or rescheduled because dam levels were too low . <p> Wolski said : " Every single situation has different drivers and it might or might not be influenced by climate change ... It 's tricky to say that a drought is linked to climate change because there 's many things that might influence it -- there might have been a mismanagement of water resources . " <p> However @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reported : " Human-induced climate change is also contributing to increases in droughts in some regions . " <p> Tetelo Maphaka , cricketer for the Central Gauteng Lions Academy and Wits University first team , said effects were seen more at club level . " There 's a lot more moisture in the air , there 's a lot more rain , and those club fields -- the drainage is n't as great as a professional field -- so you 'll find a lot of games getting cancelled or rescheduled because the field was waterlogged . " <p> The IPCC report stated : " Heavy rains will become more frequent and intense with more warming . At a global scale , extreme daily rainfall events are intensifying by about 7% for each 1 ? C of global warming . " <p> Wolski said , unlike changes in temperature , which show an almost consistent upward trend , changes in rainfall are variable . <p> The IPCC report said that " since the 1950s heavy rainfall events have become more frequent and intense over most land areas where there is sufficient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is an upward trend in Gauteng , and it is statistically significant . So it 's safe to say that there is a change , an increase in the number of extreme events , " said Wolski about the study . This trend being " statistically significant " meant that there is likely another cause of this increase other than the natural variability . <p> " Perhaps anthropogenic climate change ? " he said . " But that can not be said with certainty without a dedicated study . " <p> George Bradley , who has been an athletics coach for 34 years and coached his athletes to more than 50 national titles , said : " The more extreme climates and climate- or weather-related incidents and events over the years seem to have gradually had more impact on sporting events . " <p> In athletics , events have had to be cut short , postponed and even cancelled in the face of such occurrences , he said . <p> Climate change has required a more focused approach to training , such as considering weather patterns when doing altitude training @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he said . " An example is the extreme ultra running event in China in 2021 , when some runners lost their lives due to the extreme cold . " <p> Cian Oldknow , SA female pro track , road and cross-country athlete , said : " I think maybe a big thing that we 've noticed is there 's been a lot of late-afternoon thunderstorms , and while it 's fine to train in the rain , running in a thunderstorm , you ca n't because of the lightning . " <p> Oldknow said four or five consecutive sessions were cancelled in December because of non-stop rain and thunder . <p> The IPCC reported : " With more global warming , we will continue to see intensification of the global water cycle . Rain and water flows are expected to become more variable within seasons and from year to year . Average annual rainfall on land is expected to increase with greater warming . " <p> " Heat is a tough one , because it gets really , really hot with some training . But it 's hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if it 's just summer , " said Oldknow . <p> A report from the Global Change Institute at Wits called Climate impacts in southern Africa during the 21st Century stated : " The number , intensity and duration of heatwaves in South Africa will increase steeply in future as a result of global warming . The capacity to perform manual labour out of doors decreases dramatically as the occurrence of heatwaves increases . " <p> Mike Schlebach , big-wave surfer and CEO of Protect the West Coast , told DM168 that the most prolific ways he 'd seen climate change affect surfing in the Cape were changes in storm sizes and the wind shifting more south and changing the swell . " The predominant wind now has changed from a southeasterly to a southerly , or at least a south southeasterly . <p> " Which I know does n't sound like a big difference , but ... even a five- or 10-degree difference can make the difference between being onshore or offshore . " <p> Stalwart big wave surfer Mike Schlebach has been tackling giant waves at places like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chairman of The Cape Big Wave Trust and one of the founding members of the Protect The West Coast organisation , he is keenly aware of the relationship between humanity and climate , and how that is changing for good and worse . Photo : Alan van Gysen <p> Wolski said we could possibly link the changes in wind and swells conceptually or by association to climate change . <p> " And that 's the large circulation pattern that is essentially from 30 degrees south to 60 degrees south . As a result of climate change , what is happening is that you have an expansion of the tropics and shift of those systems southwards . " <p> Landman said : " Even if we have n't seen anything about climate change in our current life , there is a very strong indication that it 's going to shift . <p> " And if we do n't start preparing for this ... we may be caught offsides .

@@63888239 <h> Mara Phones ' South African Ambitions Come To A Pandemic End <p> A little over two years ago , a flagship smartphone manufacturing facility was launched in Rwanda by Mara Corporation , a company billing as the first indigenous smartphone manufacturer in Africa . <p> With the promise of producing smartphones specifically tailored to the African consumer , the assembly factory was set up in October 2019 , a month after which a similar facility was unveiled in Durban , South Africa . <p> Mara Phones ' South African launch was celebrated by hopefuls , and significant results were expected since the country is the most industrialized , educated and innovative in the African continent . The factory was South Africa 's first high-end smartphone manufacturing plant , one which looked to create jobs for 450 people in the next half a decade . <p> It has always been questioned whether Mara 's idea would fly , considering that it is setting up shop and aiming big in the continent with shackled supply chains and low purchasing power . Launching the factory in Rwanda took USD 50 M , and there is no telling the costs of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could outdo Transsion , Africa 's largest smartphone maker , among other contenders such as Samsung and Huawei . <p> Now , word on the street is Mara Phones South Africa is in a fix . The smartphone assembly plant is receiving backlash from its employees over unpaid wages and poor working conditions . <p> According to local news , the factory has been shuttered , and the venture has been placed on auction , seemingly right in the middle of a Management By Objectives process meant to enhance the organization 's general performance . <p> Per a Business Insider publication , the workers were promised to be permanently employed in the company after three months of temporary work . The permanent placements were also supposed to be accompanied by pay raises . <p> " But after the three months , they were offered new six-month contracts similar to the first , but with a new permanent probation clause , and remuneration was raised to ZAR 4,500 . The contracts were never revised to permanent . There was no straightforward contract that stated that you were hired as a permanent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they kept telling us we will get them , " the report reads . <p> The fiasco started in the middle of last week when word broke out that Mara Phones South Africa is visiting the auction rooms shortly after the company 's investors took over the reins . As the story goes , rights to the company will be sold to whatever is the highest bidding . Meanwhile , the factory 's equipment is going out to a single buyer , but if not , just about any buyer . <p> Is the South African government the thorn in Mara 's flesh ? Last week , the country 's leadership officially embarked on its first legal crackdown on the South African unit of Huawei , a tech giant whose African operations , unlike its European activities , have not come under any fire . But , South Africa is taking Huawei to court for a completely different reason . <p> As it turns out , the Cyril Ramaphosa-led administration has been supportive of Mara 's manufacturing ambitions in the country . <p> In February 2020 , the government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promising to patronize Mara Phones for work-related smartphones in its departments from now till 2026 . The same year , Mara received a green light under the deceased Section 12I tax allowance initiative . Meanwhile , Standard Bank and state-owned Industrial Development Corporation ( IDC ) injected capital into the business . <p> In April last year , South Africa 's government recognized Mara Phones as its choicest phone brand , along the lines of the communications contract that is valid until 2026 . Under this scheme , all government departments were mandated to buy from Mara , except they could tender a solid reason to prefer another maker . <p> According to Mara Phones , the business fell victim to the unprecedented coronavirus pandemic which struck in 2020 ; South Africa has had one of the world 's highest infection rates for a prolonged period . The company also blamed the situation on the slow uptake of its mobile phones , in a country where 51 percent of adults own smartphones , and where 40 percent of the populace own mobiles . <p> " Our ambitious plans to launch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Africa ' devices was untenable in South Africa due to the pandemic and lockdowns that followed only four months after opening , " Mara Phones said in a statement . <p> It has been established that the pandemic revealed the fault lines in global supply chains , more so in Africa , where underdeveloped commercial systems prevail to the detriment of new consumer-facing companies . The reality appears to have been more severe in South Africa , whose economy was in recession until three months ago . <p> How about Mara Phones ' Rwandan factory , the birthplace of the African smartphone idea ? Unlike its South African counterpart , the facility in Kigali is still operational and is reported to have been consistently producing phones . <p> Moreover , in December 2021 , the Rwandan business minted a partnership with MISALEI- Com ? rcio e Presta ? ? o de Servi ? os to export its smartphones to Angola , one of Africa 's largest economies . While announcing this development , the company 's Managing Director , Eddy Sebera , mentioned that the factory has exported to 76 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the progress in the domestic market , " he said . <p> Rwanda is the second easiest place to do business in Africa , coming only after the much-admired Mauritius . In 2018 and 2019 , the East African country ranked higher than first-world countries like Italy , Belgium and Israel . One too many times , the country has been pointed to as the ideal tech testbed for African markets . <p> Nevertheless , Mara 's Rwandan unit admits it currently runs at 20 percent capacity due to the adverse implications of the COVID-19 pandemic and the economic instabilities of 2020 and 2021.

@@63896238 <p> She stated the withdrawal of part A of the litigation by Telkom allows the auction to proceed , and further gives confidence that " parties can find each other outside of court on outstanding matters that are part of part B " . <p> Telkom has taken ICASA to court to challenge some aspects of the spectrum auction process . <p> Its application was in two segments -- part A , which requested the court to urgently suspend the spectrum invitation to apply , while the court deliberates on part B of Telkom 's application , which focuses on the merits of its arguments against the licensing process . <p> However , Telkom later asked the courts to remove from the roll its urgent application ( part A ) to interdict ICASA from auctioning the spectrum . <p> " Progress did not happen by coincidence , " said Ntshavheni . " It is a result of continuous engagements to find common ground with all stakeholders . <p> " The licensing of the high-frequency spectrum will not only improve the ability of mobile communications operators to build robust telecommunications with better penetration and reach . <p> " Through ICASA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within 36 months of licensing of the spectrum , all outstanding public schools ( 18 520 ) , public health facilities including clinics and hospitals ( 5 731 ) and offices of traditional leaders or traditional authorities ( 8 241 ) . <p> " The extension of broadband connectivity to traditional authorities is part of government 's commitment to strengthen the role of traditional leaders as service delivery centres of government . " <p> She continued : " In the past , we have seen the telecommunications operators ignoring social obligations and opting to pay negligible penalties instead of connecting our people . <p> " This time around , ICASA will include the fulfilment of social service obligations as part of the licensing conditions without an option of a penalty but the spectrum licence itself . " <h> Long road ahead <p> South Africa 's allocation of spectrum has been up in the air for a number of years , with the last significant spectrum awarded 16 years ago . The last big set of spectrum issued was in the 2.1GHz band , which helped the operators in their 3G @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is one of the few countries that have not allocated 4G/LTE spectrum on the continent . This has forced local operators to improvise , with spectrum re-farming and carrier aggregation . <p> Spectrum will help mobile operators provide faster and more widespread high-speed data services . On the consumer front , it would mean making affordable data available to firms and households . <p> For government , the allocation of spectrum by means of an auction is at the forefront of the economic reforms , as the state anticipates the national fiscus will benefit in excess of R8 billion from the proceeds of the auction , the minister stated . <p> Acknowledging the long journey , Ntshavheni said government looks forward to the positive benefits associated with release of spectrum , which include reduced costs of data and voice communications . <p> " This spectrum is expected to unlock economic transformation not only for the telecommunications sector but to service other industries such as mining , agriculture and manufacturing . <p> " We expect industry growth of between R4 billion and R6 billion in 2023 . We are also working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and preparations for advances to sixth- and seventh-generation networks . This will allow us to prescribe minimum data to the home because data has become the new utility , like water and electricity , that our home needs . <p> " Every South African household -- despite being rich or poor , employed or unemployed -- will have access to 10 gigabytes per month . " <h> Migration conundrum <p> Ntshavheni told the joint sitting that part of the challenges bedevilling the auctioning of the high-demand spectrum has been the availability of sub-1GB spectrum that is to be released through the Broadcast Digital Migration ( BDM ) programme . <p> " The president , in his address , reported that this programme is firmly under way and on course to be completed by 31 March 2022 . <p> " I am happy to report that we have concluded analogue switch-off in the five provinces as follows -- Free State , Northern Cape , North West , Mpumalanga and Limpopo . " <p> The communications minister added that her department is on course to conclude the switch-off in the remaining four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the analogue switch-off ( ASO ) programme has supported 396 installer companies that have created 3 109 job opportunities to locals . These numbers of both companies participating and jobs created will double by the time when we conclude the digital migration . These companies form the basis from where we build digital technology businesses in our townships and rural areas . <p> " In addition , we have commenced the process of frequency re-stacking in provinces where we have concluded ASO . To date , we have concluded frequency restacking in Free State and Northern Cape , and will be concluding the North West during February , and we are to commence with frequency re-stacking in the provinces of Mpumalanga and Limpopo . " <p> After missing the International Telecommunication Union-mandated June 2015 migration deadline , the South African government is in a race to conclude the BDM process ahead of the long-awaited spectrum auction . 
@@63896239 <h> SONA 2022 : ICT industry calls for ' action not promises ' <p> President Cyril Ramaphosa will deliver the annual SONA at Cape Town City Hall this evening . <p> While the president has often made mention of ICT sector-related matters in the State of the Nation Address ( SONA ) , industry commentators do n't have high expectations for this evening . <p> President Cyril Ramaphosa will give an assessment of the state of the nation and present plans for the coming year when he addresses the public this evening . <p> SONA , which will for the first time be held outside of Parliament 's precincts , will be a hybrid joint sitting of the two houses -- the National Assembly and National Council of Provinces . <p> With many of South Africa 's socio-economic , political and corruption challenges set to take centre stage tonight , expectations from an ICT perspective are " pretty low " , says Mark Walker , associate VP for Sub-Saharan Africa at IDC MEA . <p> " Unless technology can be deployed to support or improve on these issues , it will likely be relegated to a low priority , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be left for SA Connect . " <p> Professor Martin Butler , head of teaching and learning and associate professor for digital enterprise management at the University of Stellenbosch Business School , also has low expectations . <p> " Like previous SONAs , I expect the president to be vague on ICT-related matters , " states Butler . " When it features , it will be somewhere between wishful thinking and vagueness in how execution and control will work . The current administration , and president , in particular , mostly played a head-in-the-sand game for some of the biggest ICT challenges and digital inequalities that continue to face our country . " <p> Thecla Mbongue , senior research analyst for Middle East and Africa at global research and consultancy firm Omdia , points out there 's usually not much ICT expectation from the SONA speech , except a summary of the sector 's major KPIs ( revenues , number of users ) and the directions for the coming year . <p> " We could also expect the speech to include a reference to the impact of the COVID-19 crisis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In terms of KPIs , the sector has recorded growth in the number of users ( mobile telephony and broadband connectivity ) and revenues . The sector is indeed boosted by increased coverage and a high-demand in connectivity . The COVID-19 crisis had a positive impact on the growth due to consumers and businesses integrating habits such as remote working and e-commerce . " <h> Spectrum action <p> Ramaphosa 's SONA takes place during a legal tussle around the country 's spectrum allocation process . <p> The allocation of spectrum by means of an auction is at the forefront of the state 's economic reforms , as it is expected to add billions of rand to the fiscus . <p> Furthermore , spectrum will help mobile operators provide faster and more widespread high-speed data services . On the consumer front , it would mean making affordable data available to firms and households . <p> The commentators concur SONA must spark some action regarding spectrum . <p> Says Walker : " Hopefully , the spectrum allocation will be accelerated and 5G , etc , can be deployed . Digital TV is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even though it 's so desperately late and slow . " <p> He adds it 's imperative to have an actual plan to salvage some of the communications ministry 's ailing entities - the SA Post Office and SABC , for example . <p> Mbongue explains : " We should hear about the long-awaited spectrum auction to take place next month . Once allocated , the frequencies will mostly be used for 4G and 5G network rollout , reinforcing broadband networks ' capacity and coverage , as well as enabling telecoms operators to rollout equipment more efficiently and save costs . <p> " The main expectation from this auction is that as telecom companies save cost on network deployment and network management , there should be a positive outcome on the cost of service for consumers , leading to a drop in data tariffs . The country 's telecoms market leaders , such as Vodacom or MTN , have in the past regularly blamed part of their inability to lower data tariffs on the lack of spectrum . " <p> Butler adds that action is required on digital skills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Department of Communications and Digital Technologies to move the multiple multi-year projects on the table forward . <p> " The president must increase the digital literacy and competency of the government agencies and embrace the operational efficiencies that well-implemented ICT systems hold for them . " <p> Professor Martin Butler , University of Stellenbosch Business School . <p> Walker believes the sector would like to see a focus on rollout of affordable access to IT-based citizen services , especially in education , citizen services at municipal , provincial and national level , and healthcare . <p> " The digital divide is a savage problem , as demonstrated during COVID , and it only widened in the last two years -- healthcare and education and remote working opportunities are worlds apart if you 're poor . Government has to close that gap , by sorting out spectrum , prioritising access , and mandating digital milestones for the Department of Health and Department of Basic Education . <p> " Also , Ramaphosa should issue a moratorium on any long-term white papers . Stop the cycles of five-year posturing , and start @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hit milestones , and hire ones who know what their department is actually for , " comments Walker . <p> Butler concludes : " The ICT sector , which has always been resilient , will flourish when energy , safety , education and health are addressed . We are used to being the poor cousin and will continue to fight for ourselves ; please help the rest of the struggling economy since we are dependent on them more than we are on the state . " 
@@63904232 <p> Growing up as an orphan and left to fend for himself after his brother , Sam , fled the law when he was just a kid , Nathan Drake ( Tom Holland ) has been getting by as a bartender and a petty thief . One night , an experienced treasure hunter , Victor Sullivan ( Mark Wahlberg ) , approaches Nathan with an opportunity to both reconnect with his brother and to make hundreds of millions of dollars by joining him on a quest for the long-lost treasure of Ferdinand Magellan . Despite some initial reluctance , Nathan knows an unbeatable opportunity when he sees one , but as he is drawn deeper and deeper into a world of deadly adversaries and deadlier secrets , ancient relics and double-crosses , he starts to wonder just why Sullivan approached him in the first place . <p> WHAT WE THOUGHT : <p> As someone who has never owned a Playstation ( aside from my beloved fakey Nintendo from when I was a kid , I 've always been a PC gamer , and a mostly retro one at that ) , the incredibly successful , highly acclaimed , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is , except for the news that would routinely pop up on pop culture websites and in film magazines about a movie adaptation that was always just around the corner but never actually materialised . <p> Finally , some fifteen years since the first Uncharted game hit the Playstation 3 , the long-awaited and constantly teased Uncharted film is actually hitting cinemas . Fans rejoice ! Or should they ? Could something with this much hype behind it and with this many years in development hell possibly satisfy all the hope , frustration , and expectations that have no doubt built in the heart and mind of the games ' stalwart fans ? <p> In short : No . No , it ca n't . Not just because very few things can live up to such heightened expectations , but because Uncharted is , frankly speaking , just not a very good movie . It 's not a terrible movie either , to be sure , as it does what it does with at least some mechanical proficiency , but " mechanical proficiency " is , presumably , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Uncharted film -- and it 's certainly not what I wanted from it either . <p> Considering how much the Uncharted series , like Tomb Raider before it , owed to the Indiana Jones films ( which themselves owed their debts to older adventure films and serials , but restructured -- to mix a metaphor or two - those debts into the definitive examples of the genre ) , it was always going to be something of a struggle to make the film feel like anything more than just another Raiders of the Lost Ark retread . Well , as it turns out , it 's nothing of the sort . Raiders -- or any of the original Indy films , really -- is so far out of reach that it is , at very best , warmed up Kingdom of the Crystal Skull , but probably falls closer to the level of something like National Treasure 2 . <p> Written by successful TV writer Rafe Judkins ( Chuck , the Wheel of Time , Agents of Shield ) , and the team of Art Marcum and Matt Holloway , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but also Transformers : The Last Knight , Punisher : War Zone and Men in Black : International , it 's not massively surprising that the plot is little more than a lazy collection of clich ? s or that the " zinger-tastic " dialogue lands with a leaden thud . And consider me unsurprised that despite featuring more double and triple crosses than a blackout-drunk stroll through a Christian cemetery , the story is more monotonous than anything else . <p> What 's perhaps a bit more surprising is just how little the stuff in front of the camera works , either . Sure , director Reuben Fleischer hardly has a spotless record , but surely the man who directed Zombieland would exhibit some sort of panache in his filmmaking ? Instead , it all feels just a bit ... rote . It has enough trouble setting itself apart in the writing , but even in terms of bringing that writing to life , Fleischer looks to be doing nothing more than going through the motions ; taking what he can from other , often better films , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its own . It does n't . <p> The action scenes look like they come straight out of the video game and have about as much weight to them as that might suggest . While I have little issue with suspending my sense of disbelief for over-the-top action set pieces in these sorts of films , the action scenes in Uncharted are so disconnected from the basic laws of physics that it becomes all but impossible to actually invest in them . <p> Or perhaps it 's even worse . <p> Perhaps , it 's more the case that the film failed so spectacularly to hold my attention in terms of character and story that things that are not supposed to draw attention to themselves suddenly started irritating the more rational parts of my brain , which only drew me further out of the film . This is about as fundamental a failing as is possible to get in an action-adventure film . <p> And then there 's the cast . It is , in theory , a strong cast , led by one of the most charismatic young actors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they just never manage to gel as an ensemble -- or they 're simply hopelessly miscast . The latter failure already irked fans of the game back when the casting was first announced , and while that sort of thing usually just comes down to fanboy whining , in this case , they 've been proven all too right . Even just a tiny bit of research on Wikipedia shows just how far off most of the casting is here . <p> In particular , Tom Holland is a terrific actor and a wonderfully likeable screen presence , but he 's demonstrably not Nathan Drake ; not even a younger version of him . Even with his Spider-Man muscles and undeniable good looks , he never comes across like he 's on the way to becoming the tough-as-nails badass that the character apparently is in the game . As for Mark Wahlberg , Victor Sullivan is supposed to be a grizzled , ex-military professional , but Wahlberg plays him like your fairly typical Mark Wahlberg character ; just less sympathetic and/or funny than usual . The theoretical " buddy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well . <p> So , yeah , so sorry Uncharted fans . I have n't even gotten into the more spoilery issues I have with the film ( ugh , the villains ... ) , but whichever way you slice it and however much past video game movies should have tempered your hopes in the first place , I can all but guarantee disappointment .

@@63904239 <h> Some will fight for their very lives , lifestyles , careers , reputations and the capacity -- after the storm -- to earn an honest living ( outside the ANC ) in a corruption-intolerant South Africa of the future . <p> With lawfare almost a national pastime , especially for those accustomed to deep state pockets to cover ever-growing legal fees , there are bound to be big , if ill-advised , challenges to recommendations in the final State Capture Commission report . <p> Part 3 is about to hit the streets at the end of February and will most certainly deal , in great part , with abuses within the State Security Agency and other intelligence structures . <p> It will not be pretty . <p> On 15 February , Ronald Lamola , the minister of justice and correctional services , revealed during the Sona debate that the National Prosecuting Authority ( NPA ) is " seized " with 37 " high profile cases " . <p> He added that 14 matters had been enrolled in the courts and in March the Investigative Directorate ( ID ) would add three " seminal matters " to the list @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NPA ) and the Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation ( DPCI ) made it known in a joint media statement in January that the commission had gifted them " a petabyte of data " . <p> This , it said , was the " equivalent to roughly 500 billion pages of printed text on corruption , fraud and related offences including affidavits , investigative reports and other evidential material " . <p> A petabyte is equal to 1,000 terabytes and some estimates , apart from the 500 billion printed pages calculation , hold that the big P is the equivalent of " 20 million tall filing cabinets " . <p> In the meantime , the NPA says it has created a " dedicated task force " , coordinated from the top down with a view to building criminal prosecutions with the evidence no doubt floating all over the data volumes . <p> The authority gave assurances it would move swiftly to freeze and forfeit the proceeds of crime , " where appropriate " ( and where there is anything left ) while " vigorously exploring " options to boost capacity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assistance of the National Treasury , the Department of Public Service and Administration , the Office of the Solicitor-General and with support from the minister and the director-general of justice . <p> The authority said it would continue with its " collaborative approach in line with its legal mandate , including with the private sector " . <p> And while it welcomed private sector support and would continue to engage with these " key partners " as and when appropriate , it would insulate itself from " any perceptions of external influence " . <p> The difference between evidence presented before a commission of inquiry and evidence required to meet the standard of proof for prosecutions needed to be fully grasped , the NPA and DPCI reminded those of us champing at the bit for justice and tired of watching the proverbial honeysuckle grow up the equally proverbial guillotine . <p> Criminal investigations would be conducted " so that evidence can be presented in criminal matters , in accordance with the South African law of evidence " , said the NPA . <p> Individuals named in the commission 's report @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gigaba , have taken to social media boldly threatening to challenge the report . <p> But Gigaba and Van Rooyen will be flushing money ( hopefully their own ) down the drain , we can tell them this for free . <p> There are those who will argue that the commission is subject to limited judicial review . <p> But it is important to bear in mind that the recommendations of Zondo 's reports do not legally constitute " administrative action " and do not amount to decisions of " final effect " which have " adverse " consequences . <p> In plain language : it will be difficult to review recommendations that do not legally constitute administrative action by the state . <p> For Van Rooyen and many others , including the banks , businesses , accountants and consultancies that have been named ( and will be named in a week or two ) , the path to shielding reputations will have to be done in the country 's courts where they will be free to challenge evidence . <p> What the first two volumes of the commission 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the right to procedural fairness has remained intact . <p> All the commission does , in the end , is tell others in the law enforcement cluster to do their jobs and apply the country 's laws . <p> Should the NPA institute a prosecution , Van Rooyen will have an opportunity to challenge any evidence given by Dahwa in an open court . <p> So-called reputations , for now , must yield to the national interest . <p> President Cyril Ramaphosa has reportedly revealed there are " talks " within the judiciary to establish a special court roll for State Capture and corruption matters . <p> How about not just a roll , but special courts themselves ? <p> Like those set up before the 2010 Fifa World Cup . That express roll-out of 54 courts across nine cities operating for 15 hours a day with 1,500 dedicated personnel could be more or less replicated . <p> In that case , the pop-up courts worked like a charm and cost only R1-million ( a bit more than R2-million by today 's monopoly money ) .

A great crop of potential leaders is to be found among the gems in the State Capture legal team whose prowess in leading evidence was on display for all the country to witness during live transmissions of the Zondo Commission on YouTube . <p> The law states that a regional court convicting an accused under section 2 ( 1 ) after a guilty plea may impose a sentence not exceeding a fine of R100-million or a period of 30 years of imprisonment . If there are merits for life imprisonment , the regional court will stop proceedings and refer these to the high court . <p> Life imprisonment , people . <p> What Part 2 of the State Capture report indicated is that Transnet was captured as part of an international criminal enterprise run by the Gupta brothers and associates , aided and abetted by accountants , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ANC government officials as well as a sitting head of state . <p> Some will fight for their very lives , lifestyles , careers , reputations and the capacity -- after the storm -- to earn an honest living ( outside the ANC ) in a corruption-intolerant South Africa of the future . <p> It was all more than just State Capture , it was a criminal heist , the biggest this country has ever seen and now is just one more tawdry chapter in the long story of pillage and plunder by past governments and colonial forces of South Africa and its people . <p> Many bucks will be passed , much legal dust will be kicked up , threats will be made .

@@63913232 <h> Electric flying cars are dirty old helicopters rebranded <p> For all the excitement around eVTOLs , they 're likely to account for a rather small portion of overall traffic in the future . Image : cheskyw / 123rf <p> The Jetsons are back , and they 're looking green . <p> Electric flying taxis were the toast of the Singapore Airshow last week . AirAsia and a unit of Embraer SA announced deals for nearly 200 of the futuristic vehicles , which have n't made it beyond prototype stage yet . Such eVTOL vehicles -- short for electric vertical take off and landing -- have seen an explosion of interest in recent years , with $12.8bn ( roughly R193,043,200,000 ) invested in the field since 2010 , according to McKinsey &amp; Co . <p> The promise of this booming sector is that they 're selling something fundamentally different than the original VTOL aircraft : helicopters . Unlike their noisy , fuel-guzzling predecessors -- the transport mode of choice for Bond villains and former US president Donald Trump -- eVTOLs will quietly buzz a more ethical breed of passenger between office and home , " connecting communities " and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , smooth , and emission-free flight " . <p> It 's a magnificent triumph of marketing over reality . While eVTOLs promise some genuine advances in aviation technology , the investments being made wo n't so much bring about that Utopian future as rebrand the dystopian old helicopter industry for a new generation of the super-rich . If the promise of whisper-quiet , affordable , zero-emissions transport sounds too good to be true , that 's because it is . <p> Take energy efficiency . It 's always been true that aircraft in cruising flight are remarkably efficient relative to cars and trains that use friction to drag themselves laboriously along the ground . The problem is how to get up there . <p> Climbing and , to a lesser extent , descending have always taken up an outsize share of fuel consumption in aircraft . That 's particularly the case with VTOL vehicles , which can use up a substantial share of their energy just hovering to treetop height . That means the differences between an eVTOL used to travel from one city to another and one used to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One 2019 study in Nature Communications concluded eVTOLs could be more efficient than electric cars for 100km journeys , but noted that 85% of car trips are shorter than 35 km -- a level at which a conventional fuel-guzzling automobile results in about the same emissions as the flying car . <p> Occupancy also tends to be a critical assumption . A 2021 study in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences argued that vehicles like the Larry Page-backed Kitty Hawk Heaviside are already more efficient than electric cars -- but a crucial aspect of both analyses is the idea that ground-based modes should be judged by the 1.67 occupants who are carried per trip across the entire American vehicle fleet , whereas eVTOLs should be measured at ideal capacity levels . <p> The promises sound too good to be true -- and they are . These new vehicles will do little more than ferry the elite , burning carbon and causing noise pollution as they do . Image : Bloomberg <p> That 's not a reasonable comparison . If there 's not a full complement of fresh passengers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down , its efficiency per passenger , per kilometre drops drastically . Such " empty leg " flights , where an aircraft goes to its next destination with no passengers at all , make up about two-fifths of trips in existing private jets . Indeed , there 's an entire cottage industry dedicated to finding cheap tickets on them . <p> It 's a similar picture with sound pollution . By having several small rotors rather than one big one , most eVTOLs promise to be less noisy -- " almost 1,000 times quieter " than a helicopter , according to Archer Aviation Inc . While decibels are a useful objective measure of sound pressure , they do n't correspond much to the subjective annoyance factor for noise , which relates to harder to measure qualities such as frequency , duration , repetition , and the way sound reflects from building surfaces in an urban environment . Noise also corresponds a lot to distance , making an eVTOL quieter the higher its cruising altitude . But climb higher and you 're using more fuel again . It 's almost impossible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Perhaps this does n't matter . For all the excitement around eVTOLs , they 're likely to account for a small portion of overall traffic in the future , next to the workhorses of buses , trains , cars and low-cost jets in which passengers will be crammed into ever-smaller seats . <p> The trouble is , they 're a distraction from the real problems the aviation industry needs to be dealing with -- most of all , the question of how most of us will travel by the middle of this century without our carbon emissions destroying the atmosphere through which we fly . About three quarters of investments in future aviation technology since 2010 have gone into urban flying taxis and similar technologies , according to McKinsey &amp; Co. , with the urgent question of sustainable aviation attracting only cents on the dollar by comparison . <p> A grimly plausible vision of the future will see billionaires travel from San Francisco to their weekend escapes in Lake Tahoe , blithely ignorant of their true carbon footprints . The city-dwellers over whom they fly will be stuck in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get round to solving . Once they get home they 'll be constantly buzzed by the sound of passing eVTOLs they could never afford to fly , thanks to the way spurious arguments about decibels managed to loosen long-standing aircraft noise regulations . <p> Perhaps eVTOLs are the future of mobility . If they are , it 's not something to be proud of . It 's an admission that transport policy -- as something designed to move the mass of humanity from place to place , rather than something to serve the interests of an oblivious elite -- has comprehensively failed . <p> For instance , Archer bases its estimates about noise pollution on a 2,000-foot cruising altitude , twice the 1,000-foot estimate used in the Nature Communications study . <p> This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners . <p> David Fickling is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering commodities , as well as industrial and consumer companies .

@@63917237 <h> Maverick Citizen <h> INFANT NUTRITION <h> WHO/Unicef report reveals how companies violate global standards in the marketing of formula milk to parents <h> A landmark new report reflecting ' the most complete picture to date ' of the marketing of formula milk to mothers and health professionals around the world , including in SA , says that 51% of parents and pregnant women have been targeted by companies that produce breast-milk substitutes , even though this violates international standards on infant feeding -- and is illegal in SA . <p> The joint WHO/Unicef report , How marketing of formula milk influences our decisions on infant feeding , published today , is the first systematic , multicountry , multiregional study of formula-milk marketing , and the first to feature the voices of 8,500 women on their experiences . <p> The report highlights industry tactics to promote formula milk such as distorting scientific evidence to legitimise inaccurate health claims and push their product , systematic targeting of health professionals ( on whom mothers rely most for health information ) including incentives and gifts to get them to promote their products , and using manipulative marketing tactics -- especially online and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anxieties and aspirations . <p> " This research shows that formula milk marketing knows no limits , " says the report . " Forty years on , formula-milk marketing still represents one of the most underappreciated risks to infants ' and children 's health . " <p> This is because formula-milk feeding undermines breastfeeding , which the WHO and Unicef recommend for all babies where possible , including those of HIV-positive mothers : Ideally , babies should be breastfed within one hour of birth , then exclusively breastfed for their first six months -- this means no water , no formula , or any other liquid or solid -- with continued breastfeeding alongside the introduction of nutritious solid foods up to age two . <p> This first-ever systematic , multi-country , multi-regional study of formula-milk marketing draws on surveys and interviews carried out between 2019 and 2021 , with 8,500 women and 300 health professionals in cities in South Africa , Bangladesh , China , Mexico , Morocco , Nigeria , the United Kingdom and Vietnam . <p> ( Graph : WHO / Unicef ) <p> Just over half ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ targeted by formula-milk marketing , despite the existence of the WHO 's International Code of Marketing of Breast-milk Substitutes ( the Code ) . The Code , designed to protect parents from aggressive marketing practices used by the baby-food industry , was adopted by 196 countries in 1981 , when the World Health Assembly approved it ( 118 countries voted in favour ; only the US voted against ) . <p> Of these , 136 countries , including South Africa , translated that agreement into national legislation to make the Code legally binding within their countries . South Africa 's law is called R991 and aims to protect and promote breastfeeding by regulating the inappropriate marketing of breast-milk substitutes for children aged 0-3 years , removing " commercial pressures " , " conflicts of interest " and " perverse incentives " from the infant-feeding arena . <p> And yet , the report says , the industry 's marketing around the world remains " pervasive , personalized , and powerful " . <p> " These marketing practices just blatantly disregard the recommendations and agreements of the World Health Assembly ( WHA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the lead researcher on the report , in an exclusive interview with Maverick Citizen . <p> " It 's a fundamental human rights issue , " Rollins said , calling out the " prevalence , invasiveness , and unrelenting nature of marketing " designed to influence the environments in which decisions are taken -- by mothers and fathers -- at one of the most vulnerable times in a parent 's life . It compromises both the right to parents ' impartial decision-making based on accurate information and the right to a child 's health enshrined in the UN Convention of the Rights of the Child . <p> Acknowledging that we are all bombarded with marketing for all kinds of products at every turn , Rollins said that what makes formula-milk marketing different is the $55-billion per year industry 's cynical exploitation of parents ' hopes and aspirations . <p> " If anything in life captures what human society is about , " Rollins said , " and what our vision and future is for our society , it 's the first years after the birth of a baby -- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a commercial opportunity . ' That somehow puts the marketing and the strategic exploitation of that moment into a different space than any other type of marketing . " <p> ( Graph : WHO / Unicef ) <p> The WHO acknowledges that cultural , psychological and socioeconomic factors also drive low rates of breastfeeding . <p> " This is not an attempt to remove formula milks from the shelves of supermarkets , " he said . " WHO is not calling for any limiting of access to formula milk by families and mothers -- or to limit the rights and decision-making of women . Some women need formula , some choose it for a range of reasons , and it is their right to do so . What we are highlighting is the marketing practices that seek to influence the environment in which decisions are made , and those decisions impact on the health and development of children , no matter whether it 's a high- , middle- or low-income setting . " <p> Enforcement -- or lack of ... <p> Clearly , violations are frequent and flagrant , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " large numbers of health workers in all countries had been approached by the baby feeding industry to influence their recommendations to new mothers through promotional gifts , free samples , funding for research , paid meetings , events and conferences , even commissions from sales , directly impacting parents ' feeding choices " . <p> And yet , says Rollins , " In no country has there been an example of a meaningful sanction . You 've got to ask the question , why do n't we have meaningful sanctions even when there 's strong legislation ? " <p> In South Africa , says Tanya Doherty , professor in the Health Systems Research Unit at the South African Medical Research Council ( SAMRC ) , " We have the Code legislated but we have very weak enforcement -- there 's one person at the National Department of Health who 's responsible for Code compliance , which translates into no penalties against violators , even when health professionals or civil society report violations . " <p> South Africa is one country whose R991 is highly praised by the WHO , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in South Africa interviewed for this research , less than half ( 19 ) had ever heard of R991 . <p> Still , Doherty says , " There 's no way a marketing representative could walk into any public sector hospital and try and market formula , whereas it 's completely rampant in the private sector . " <p> Doherty was an adviser to the WHO on the South Africa component of the research behind the report , which was carried out in Cape Town and Johannesburg , using a survey of 300 pregnant women and 750 mothers ( 1,050 people of the 8,500 total ) , focus group discussions with women , marketing diaries kept by women , and interviews with health workers -- 17 from the public sector and 23 from the private sector . <p> Doherty told Maverick Citizen that in South Africa , health workers were reported by women to be a major source of trusted advice on feeding , second to family members , yet they were also the main people giving advice on using formula and specific brands of formula . <p> So even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marketing in their place of work , Doherty said , " In fact , we saw the same beliefs around the advantages and benefits of formula coming from mothers and from health workers -- they both had their perceptions influenced by these claims that are very clearly in the marketing messages , and on the tins themselves " -- with terms used such as ' gold ' , ' supreme ' , ' opti ' , ' superior ' and ' human-milk oligosaccharides ' . " <p> ( Graph : WHO / Unicef ) <p> " Women would seek advice from health workers around issues like crying , sleeping , the equivalence of formula to breast milk after seeing ads for milks that claim to be equivalent to breast milk , " Doherty describes . <p> " And the health workers in this study firmly believed that companies have advanced so much in their production of formula that it is now equivalent to breast milk . That was shocking , " Doherty said , especially as this group was made up of nurses and doctors , including paediatricians . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ industry , which globally spends $3-billion to $5-billion per annum ( 5-10% of annual turnover ) on its marketing , " because it works " , Rollins said . The report states that " multiple studies have shown marketing 's ability to increase demand and consumption , including for unhealthy products such as tobacco , alcohol , and ultra-processed foods " . <p> Rates of breastfeeding have increased very little in the past 20 years , the WHO says -- globally , 44% of babies under six months old are exclusively breastfed -- while sales of formula milk have roughly doubled over the same period . <p> ( Graph : WHO / Unicef ) <p> Only 32% of babies under six months are exclusively breastfed in South Africa , which has seen a steady growth in infant-formula sales over the past 15 years , Doherty and others wrote in the South African Medical Journal in 2019 , " from a retail value of R1-billion in 2004 to R4.2-billion in 2018 ( a 33.3% per capita increase ) and a forecast of over R6-billion in 2023 . " <p> The Lancet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have averted 823,000 deaths in 75 low- and middle-income countries in 2015 , and prevented 72% of hospital admissions for diarrhoea . Because formula is expensive , and clean water and bottle sterilisation are often not accessible , formula feeding can be dangerous , causing disease from bacteria , and malnutrition from formula that has been " stretched " by dilution . <p> The report 's conclusion that women 's confidence in breastfeeding is undermined by insidious formula-milk marketing tactics seems to apply equally in South Africa , including " a sustained flow of misleading marketing messages , " the WHO says , that reinforce myths such as the " necessity " of formula in the first few days after birth , the inadequacy of breast milk 's nutritiousness , or that the quality of breast milk declines over time . <p> Also , Doherty told Maverick Citizen , " Formula is seen as a solution to any breastfeeding problems . Just as much as in the private sector , public-sector health workers were saying , ' You 're having trouble ? It 's time to introduce formula ' . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provided good lactation counselling that this could overcome a challenge . It was an easy solution that a health worker could say , ' You 've got a crying baby ? This is the one you need for that ' . " <p> In understaffed and pressurised hospitals , it 's also a function of facilities , staff and workload . " It 's far quicker to suggest something that can be mixed up in five minutes , that does n't take an hour to sit and provide support and counselling , " Doherty said . <p> Doherty said that 51% of pregnant women in South Africa said they wished to breastfeed exclusively , exactly the same proportion as the average of the other seven countries , but the second-lowest among the eight countries surveyed ( lowest was Morocco at 49% , highest was Bangladesh at 98% ) . <p> Yet in South Africa , only one-third ( 32% ) of 0-5-month-old babies were breast-fed in 2016 ( the latest data available ) . And this comes off a low base : from 7-8% in 2003 . The very low @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the government 's HIV-prevention measure of providing free formula in public clinics , which may have had an unhealthy side effect for HIV-negative women , too . ( In South Africa , one in every five women is living with HIV . ) <p> In 2011 , when the WHO established that exclusive breastfeeding for at least six months was safe and preferred for the babies of women living with HIV , the government stopped providing free formula , and breastfeeding rates started to rise . But we still rank 36 out of 51 African countries , and our 31.6% falls far short of the UN Decade of Action on Nutrition 's target of at least 50% of babies ( everywhere ) to be breastfed by 2025 . <p> Digital marketing : A priority <p> Crucially , digital marketing , which has a long-term impact on mothers ' beliefs about formula milks , must be tackled , the report says . Data are gathered and used in sophisticated ways to target and reach out to women , often through individual interactions with " influencers " . <p> " Influencers target @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provenance of those messages , " Rollins says , " whether the influencers are being funded , and by whom . And then you have a whole set of options through chat rooms where industry reps are then reaching out on an individual basis : ' Send me your email and we can have a discussion offline ' -- which is just completely wrong . It 's explicitly called out in the Code . " <p> Rollins emphasised that this report is about the way in which marketing is influencing values . " We now see formula milk as the norm , " Rollins said , because of all of society 's shifts in norms and values . " We do n't need follow-on milks -- WHO does n't recommend them , health-professional associations do n't recommend them , and yet doctors and families often believe that they are actually necessary . We 've been gradually nudged and nudged to believe that is true . " <p> ( Graph : WHO / Unicef ) <p> Calls to action ? <p> The WHO can not mandate member states to take action @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to mitigate the unethical marketing of formula milk ( there is not yet a special treaty such as the WHO 's Framework Convention on Tobacco Control ) and to try to create environments that support women and parents in their child-feeding decisions . <p> The suggested actions are high-level and non-specific , given the different contexts in which countries need to act . They include encouraging countries to pass laws regulating marketing , to monitor and enforce the laws , to prevent false " scientific " claims , and to safeguard children 's health on digital platforms , as well as encouraging health professionals and their associations to strengthen conflict-of-interest policies . <p> " What is the responsibility internationally of these huge global brands who have clearly made a decision not to align with the Code ? " Rollins asks , also suggesting that investors -- banks and pension funds -- insist on companies ' alignment with public-health guidelines . <p> " Invest in mothers from a national government side , " Rollins explains , referring to strengthening maternity-related protections and support , " and disinvest from companies that fail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ element to get right , Rollins said , is the need for much better regulation -- globally -- on formula-milk product development . <p> " There should n't be any health claims , anyway , " Rollins said , " but you get industry highlighting the addition of this ingredient or that ingredient -- such as these ' human oligosaccharides ' , things that are important for brain development . If these are beneficial for one child they should be there for every child . <p> " Product development should be scrutinised to the same level as pharmaceutical development and you should n't have differential formulas . If you have one ingredient for which there is some belief that it has value , then it should be in every formula . It should n't become a marketing ploy where they say , ' we 're adding this , and if you can pay more for it then your baby 's going to be brighter ' . First , the information is untrue , and second , there needs to be equity -- this should n't be used as a pricing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calls for a comprehensive review of " the entire digital ecosystem -- including data capture , data brokering and content dissemination " using " a public health lens " . The report urges that governments together with international authorities " develop enforceable regulations that protect child health and development from harmful commercial marketing " . <p> The WHO has started to work on this , Rollins says , having taken a decision at its governing body level to set in motion exactly such a process . <p> " Public health has got to understand the issue , " he emphasises . " This clearly dovetails with a whole set of other areas where digital marketing is also a problem . " This would mean that digital marketing of other harmful products , such as sugary drinks , fast food and other ultra-processed foods , could fall under the same recommended regulations . <p> Why now ? <p> " I think we realised that our understanding of marketing was very superficial , " Rollins told Maverick Citizen . " We did n't piece together the political influences , we did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't join the dots between those political activities and the way in which guidelines are developed . " <p> Because the WHO is the UN organisation that has responsibility for health , Rollins said , one of its core functions is to synthesise the evidence and provide guidance . <p> " So as we reflected we said , we need to do this more comprehensively . There is a process that is absolutely needed that spans issues of human rights , health , understanding digital , and that clearly goes beyond the skills and expert basis of WHO , " Rollins said , " but WHO can convene a process . " The timeline for this work is notionally two years but could take longer , Rollins believes . <p> " It 's a bit like a jigsaw puzzle -- and hopefully the pieces will come together to give us a much better understanding around the problem , the scale , and to drive urgency . It 's a bit like a frog in hot water -- we have been in the water and just gently warmed up , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the impact that it is having on child health and development . " <p> Rollins is careful to point out that this report should not be viewed as criticism of governments or of health professionals . <p> " We need to say , how do we work together to go forward -- because the problem is not the government , or the health professionals or the individuals or civil society . The problem is the readiness of the industry to adopt marketing practices that are manipulative , highly funded and partial . " DM/MC <p> Ad ? le Sulcas writes about food , health and science .

@@63917239 <h> OPINION <h> The coming NHI nightmare <p> Reiner Duvenage <p> 22 February 2022 <p> Reiner Duvenage says the end result will be disastrous collapse of entire healthcare system <p> The nightmare of National Health Insurance <p> 22 February 2022 <p> The planned implementation of the National Health Insurance ( NHI ) Bill is the ANC government 's latest power-hungry attempt to monopolise and centralise its grip on South Africa . The government is window-dressing NHI as a panacea for the poorest of South Africans ' lack of access to quality healthcare . However , the end result of its actions will lead to the disastrous collapse of the entire healthcare system and will have severe consequences for all South Africans . <p> When studying NHI from a critical perspective , one must wonder how the management ( or rather mismanagement ) of this centralised fund will differ from that of other state-owned enterprises ( SOEs ) . <p> Both the Auditor-General and Zondo Commission 's recent findings have been damning in their exposure of mismanagement , state capture , corruption , and inefficiency at prominent SOEs such as SAA , Transnet , and Eskom . Yet , NHI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door open for even greater failures and financial losses . <p> The government has demonstrated a clear lack of will to end systemic corruption in all governmental sectors . It is impossible to calculate how much money has been lost to corruption since the ANC came to power , but recent estimates suggest that R1,5 trillion was lost between 2014 and 2019 alone . <p> --&gt; <p> The ANC government has also shown a shocking brazenness to steal money from the most desperate people in society . This was seen in Medical Brief 's investigation of looting of the Covid-19 relief fund , which investigated 10% of the R152,5 billion , and found that one out of every two Rands spent had been stolen and 62% of contracts had been awarded irregularly . <p> In addition to this , the current public healthcare sector is in tatters due to the government 's failure to maintain facilities and infrastructure . The scale of failure is demonstrated by the Western Cape Department of Health being the only provincial health department to receive a clean audit in 2019/2020 . <p> With the ANC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simply no way that it will be able to manage a larger scale national health system . With this considered , the NHI amounts to nothing but irresponsible gambling with the health sector , and therefore , with the lives of millions of South Africans . <p> Yet , the above argument is rendered purely academic when one considers that NHI is simply unaffordable . Discovery Health estimated that 44% ( R212 billion ) of total healthcare funding was being spent in the private sector . <p> --&gt; <p> Thus , if private medical aids are to be eliminated as the NHI Bill stipulates , this shortfall will have to be absorbed by the state . The country 's atrocious economic situation and astronomical debt levels , amplified by mismanagement of the Covid-19 pandemic , disqualifies it from funding NHI via loans . This leaves the raising of taxes as the only funding option for NHI . <p> South Africa is already taxed higher than other countries in its GDP bracket -- it is estimated that 25% of taxpayers pay 80% of income tax . On top of this , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for many essential privatised services such as schools , security and of course healthcare . Therefore , the raising of taxes to fund NHI would be the final straw that breaks the already over-burdened taxpayer 's back . <p> As briefly mentioned above , the implementation of NHI 's will mean the end of the private medical sector on which the state is heavily reliant in catering for the healthcare needs of all South Africans . This means government would be depriving citizens of pre-existing quality coverage in favour of a system which is unaffordable , unfeasible , and unworkable . <p> It is tragic that the ANC government has allowed the public health sector to deteriorate to such an extent that many poor South Africans do not have access to quality health services . However , this problem will not be solved by destroying the private health sector which already over-burdened taxpayers are funding out of their own pocket . <p> --&gt; <p> Against this rather bleak background , many skilled South African professionals are already emigrating in search of better value for their taxes and personal safety abroad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unprecedented exodus of medical professionals . <p> In June 2021 , the South African Medical Association warned that as many as 38% of its 12 000 members planned to emigrate if NHI were to be implemented . In addition to this , a further 6% planned to emigrate for other reasons and a further 17% said they were unsure about leaving the country if NHI were to be implemented . In the face of already crippling staff shortages , the mass emigration of healthcare professionals is something South Africa can not afford . <p> In summary , NHI is a project for which the true costs and service needs are completely unknown , but despite this , is still being foisted on the already over-burdened taxpayer . When considering the track record of state-owned monopoly enterprises , NHI will be severely burdened by corruption , excessive bureaucracy , mismanagement , and inefficiency . <p> The government is using NHI as a way of garnering votes from poor South Africans , who have legitimate grievances regarding the quality of healthcare in South Africa . However , NHI will not solve these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overall access to quality healthcare by destroying the private healthcare sector . <p> --&gt; <p> This will also be accompanied by the mass emigration of medical practitioners and specialists . The government is reliant on the private healthcare sector and the disappearance of its financiers and personnel will bring about a collapse of the entire health system . Unfortunately , it is the poor people of South Africa that will suffer the most as a result of this .

The short-term revenue from high commodity prices in recent years must be directed towards interventions that will promote sustainable , inclusive , long-term economic growth and job creation . Government must broadly also continue to pursue fiscal consolidation and structural reform . <p> While South Africa remains in a difficult fiscal position , the public purse has received a short-term boost as a result of high commodity prices over the past two years . Agri SA is hopeful that government will allocate these funds in ways that aid the economy 's recovery , including the agricultural sector . <p> Agri SA eagerly awaits an update from Minister Godongwana on four strategic priorities to achieve this end . <p> First , the budget must prioritise investment in critical infrastructure . Working roads , railways and harbours are vital if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ firm footing and the economy more broadly is to recover , grow , and create more jobs for South Africans .

Agri SA will be listening for announcements addressing the public sector wage bill , and how government plans to fund the extension of the Social Relief Distress Grant to 2023 . We also hope that the budget will not include any unbudgeted bailouts to failing state-owned enterprises . <p> Third , we would like to hear government commit funding to advancing the economy 's inclusivity through greater access to land and capital for emerging farmers .

@@63919232 <h> Capcom Reveals Realistic Street Fighter 6 -- Hadoken ! <p> Over the last few years , the Street Fighter franchise ( which celebrates its 35th anniversary this year ) has taken a back seat to more realistic fighters like Mortal Kombat and Tekken . Showcasing a more cartoonish look , Capcom has always focused on fun and creating awesome combos than delivering ultra-realistic characters . Until now . The first teaser for Street Fighter 6 promises something very different . <p> The last title in the franchise , Street Fighter V , which was first released in 2016 on the PlayStation 4 , was well-received by critics and fans -- although , personally , I felt like it was a fall from grace for the fighting video game . For me , it just felt outdated compared to every other fighting title available at the time . After many updates since it first launched , Street Fighter 5 managed to update the character roster and upgrade the visuals somewhat ( even though they kept the same art style ) . In fact , it went on to sell more than six million copies ( thanks to the Arcade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bugs and server issues sorted . <p> And while V always looked gorgeous , Street Fighter 6 looks leaps and bounds more impressive . The first teaser trailer , which features more realistic renders of the popular characters ( possibly done with RE Engine -- the Capcom Resident Evil engine ) is really exciting and definitely a major overhaul for the iconic fighting game . Keeping the arcade experience ( just listen to that awesome announcer ) , we 're offered better 3D models of a bearded Ryu and newcomer Luke Sullivan ( a DLC character in V ) -- you can literally see the sweat dripping off their muscular arms . <p> While the Street Fighter 6 teaser trailer does n't show any actual gameplay ( or a release date ) , it 's safe to assume that this is what they will look like in-game . There also is n't much in terms of news beyond the trailer , except that we 'll receive an update on the game later this year . <h> Street Fighter 6 : Everything We Want To See <p> The speculation is over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fighter series is finally upon us . Capcom has finally revealed the first images of what Street Fighter 6 might look like -- and fans all over the internet are already theorising about what this new game might look like . <p> If there 's one thing that Capcom knows how to do , that would be enticing teaser trailers . Even the way the company teased the initial reveal of the game ( via their official website ) had fans guessing just what new announcement they were getting -- and the leading contender was n't even Street Fighter . <p> Everything from the colours to the ominous numbers made it seem like we would be getting a new Resident Evil game instead -- maybe even the rumoured Resident Evil 4 reboot that 's allegedly been in the works for some time . But now , we know that the secret game Capcom was teasing was Street Fighter 6 all along , and also Capcom Fighting Collection if you 're into retro gaming . <p> With every new Street Fighter game , rumours immediately begin to emerge about what the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fighter community can be when it comes to the competitive aspects of the game , it would n't be too surprising to see Capcom taking a special interest in the quality of the game 's more competitive features . <h> The Technical Side <p> This means that the upcoming game might do away with some of its predecessor 's most controversial features , like the focus on being slower than the massively popular Street Fighter IV . After all , the series has always been known for its fast-paced combat and emphasis on flashy combos ( as seen in previous titles ) . <p> The fifth game also introduced some questionable decisions when it came to how it handled content after its initial release . While it was kind of refreshing to not see any kind of " Ultra Hyper Super Street Fighter V Arcade Championship Edition Turbo , " it also broke some sort of tradition that long-time fans of the series have come to expect from Street Fighter . <p> It would be great to see the new Street Fighter 6 return to a more traditional DLC model @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ service " model seems to be all the rage these days , Street Fighter 6 could include some sort of microtransactions , or in the worst case , even some kind of season pass . <p> Another area that will more than likely experience some changes in the new game is the graphics engine . Street Fighter IV used a custom engine engineered between Capcom and Dimps , and Street Fighter V made the jump to Unreal Engine 4 . While the new game engine allowed for better environments and character models , it also made the gameplay feel a bit different -- and slower -- than in the previous entry . <p> Considering how versatile Capcom 's RE Engine has proved to be , the next logical choice would be to use it in Street Fighter 6 . Although the engine has never been used in a fighting game before , there have been some seriously convincing results when the engine has been put under heavy loads with titles like Devil May Cry 5 and Resident Evil : Village . <p> Seeing the RE Engine shine in the new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ multiple ports of the game being released . After all , even the Nintendo Switch has used the engine before in Monster Hunter Rise , so that would mean that we could be getting the game on Nintendo 's insanely popular portable hybrid . <p> Speaking of consoles , Street Fighter V ( a Playstation console exclusive ) aroused some negative critiques from gamers after Capcom refused to release the title on Xbox consoles ( which might also happen with the new title ) . Let 's not forget that the console landscape has changed drastically since the last generation of consoles : the Xbox Series consoles are a great deal more popular than the Xbox One ever was , giving Microsoft consoles a clear fighting chance against Sony 's PlayStation 5 . <p> RE Engine would also be great news for PC players : even the more graphically-intensive games made in this engine have been able to run perfectly on even the most modest gaming setups . Together with the higher framerates that would surely come from the new engine , now would be the perfect time to return @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <h> Dream Roster <p> Even though Street Fighter V ( which is very popular in the world of esports ) ended up having a considerable selection of fighters hailing from multiple Capcom games , there 's no denying that the initial roster was a bit barebones . This contributed to the game 's aggressive DLC tactics , so it would be great to see a more meaty starting roster in Street Fighter 6 . <p> From the short teaser trailer alone we know that series regular Ryu will be making a comeback , as is to be expected . We also know that series newcomer Luke Sullivan will also be returning for the next game . Other than that , the appearance of Street Fighter 6 remains a total mystery . <p> Some characters are pretty much guaranteed to be returning to the upcoming fighting game . Fighters such as Chun-Li and Ken Masters are a safe bet when it comes to who will be returning to the roster -- however , some other series regulars like Akuma and Guile have been added as DLC in the past , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's also worth mentioning that some recent characters have become serious contenders for the title of most popular Street Fighter character in recent years . Although Ryu and Ken used to be pretty much the faces of the franchise in the past , there 's been a recent upsurge in the popularity of characters like Juri Han and Laura Matsuda which basically guarantees they 'll be returning in Street Fighter 6 . <p> Other characters are not as lucky , unfortunately . Some new characters like F.A.N.G . and Menat have not received much love from players , according to Capcom 's usage statistics . These characters might not be returning to Street Fighter 6 -- at least not in the base roster . <p> While we 're on the subject of possible characters , something Capcom should keep in mind when they 're designing the characters for the upcoming game would be to return them to their original designs . While it was somewhat refreshing to see characters like Ken sporting new looks in Street Fighter V , it would be better if their new appearances somewhat resembled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looks of the trailer , it seems that Ryu at least will be keeping his now-iconic beard -- along with some seriously wide shoulders -- in the next Street Fighter . <p> Street Fighter 6 logo ( left ) , Stock Image ( right ) <h> A New Identity <p> As short as it was , the brief teaser trailer revealed some precious info about what Street Fighter 6 is aiming to be . The characters look more realistic and less cartoony , and the game seems to be striving for a more serious tone overall -- however , there was also one clear point of contention at the very end of the trailer , and that was the game 's logo design . <p> The languid logo ( based on an Adobe stock image ) lacks the energy that the franchise is known for , and seems to be looking to emulate some of the more generic aspects of the e-sports community . Whether what we saw on the trailer will be the final design or not remains to be seen , but we sincerely hope that Capcom will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) and a final character roster during its summer presentation , when we 'll get additional information and an official announcement about the game 's development . <p> Regardless , the future of Street Fighter certainly looks interesting .

@@63919240 <p> This morning , as we left the Imbizo Centre where pre-Budget lockup pressers are hosted , SA 's finance minister Enoch Godongwana took my arm : " I 'm relaxed , " he said , " this ship is turning around . " <p> He was repeating the message which overrides everything else in the country 's annual national bookkeeping exercise for 2022 . <p> Like his boss Cyril Ramaphosa , by his own admission the recently appointed minister of finance was worried when he presented the mini-Budget in November . <p> Now he 's doing his best to instill hope . On the logic that without hope there can be no confidence . Sans confidence , investment does n't just happen . And without investment , even modest economic growth projections in the 2022 Budget would be a stretch . <p> SA has been battened down for so long that it 's easy for pundits to conclude Ramaphosa and the man who is effectively his FD , Gondongwana , are fighting a lost cause -- peddling a critical intangible like a last-minute Hail Mary ? <p> But even allowing for a sunny disposition which usually nudges me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for dismissing the cynics . After some extremely tough years headlined by bleeding State Owned Enterprises , Covid and the July Riots , South Africa 's luck is indeed turning . <p> The bank account does n't lie . An extraordinary revenue windfall pushed national tax receipts R182bn beyond what had been expected this time last year . For context , to achieve an identical bottom result , the Finance Department would have needed a six-percentage point surge in VAT ( or an identical increase in personal income tax rates ) . <p> The lion 's share came from a surge in corporate income tax , again most of which came from the impact of the commodity price boom on mining company profits . So even though you may not realise it , all South Africans have a vested interest in pulling for that longed-for Super Cycle . <p> Even more heartening is the way the windfall is being used . <p> Granted , a R44bn chunk has already been spent on " Covid-19 relief " via an extension of the social grants and half as much in direct costs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poor performance in the November polls , cynics may have anticipated a far bigger allocation to any vote-catching proposals . Not yet , maybe . But then again , maybe never . <p> Treasury 's increasingly confident director-general Dondo Mogajane confirmed the bulk of the R182bn windfall will go towards reducing this year 's government borrowing . In other words , not adding to the debt mountain for the first time in well over a decade . <p> That is a meaningful turnaround . Evidence , too , that SA is now seriously willing and able to tackle Zuma 's legacy of a debt-to-GDP ratio that ballooned from 26% to over 50% under his unlamented tenure . One now over 70% due to recent challenges . <p> This country 's newfound practical fiscal conservatism is reflected in the Budget 's meagre R5.2bn in direct tax relief -- just over half of which is via an expected but abandoned " non-adjustment " to the fuel tax ; the balance of R2.2bn through a 50% increase , to R1,500 , in the employment tax incentive . <p> Also , the tax tables @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ R13.5bn to offset fiscal drag . Sceptics will argue that this is an obvious course in an inflationary environment . But as we 've seen in recent years , this is by no means a baked-in approach by Treasury . <p> In recent Budgets there 's been more fancy footwork on this front than by Mohammed Ali in his prime . Among them , a hyped-up early retirement proposal that nobody accepted . For his part Godongwana is banking on " restructuring " the wage packages , just like any other employer , he says . We 'll get an idea of whether he is more successful than his predecessors soon enough . The finmin and his team meets with organised labour towards the end of March . <p> What heartened me most about the exercise was the firm response to a question I pinged about retribution for the multinational professional partnerships which facilitated the perpetration of State Capture . Specifically Bain , the Boston-headquartered firm , which according to reports is still selling its wares into the public sector . <p> Again , relax . Their day of reckoning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , SAP et al , plus those global legal firms which have thus far managed to stay out of the public spotlight . <p> The message from the keepers of SA 's national purse is that simply paying back ill-gotten fees is nowhere near enough . The country will demand a recoupment of the true cost of actions by these multinationals actions on behalf of their nefarious clientele . <p> Perhaps Godongwana 's newly relaxed state is aided by a belief another windfall of commodity boom proportions is coming . SA is certainly due . And more to the point , why not ? <p> Depending on who you ask , the cost of State Capture was anywhere from one to two trillion rand . Even a modest slice of that would be enough to repeat the 2022 booster that made this Budgetary exercise the least stressful in over a decade .

According to the AG , RAF understated its liabilities by R300 billion in 2021 following the switch to a new accounting system . <p> Letsoalo said the litigation was over the accounting model and nothing else . <p> " The new accounting standard says management shall use own judgement , and we did exactly that .

@@64015233 <h> How South Africa 's ' Quiet-Storm ' Crypto Market Is Shaping Up <p> The average South African crypto buyer is most likely to be male , spends about ZAR 450.00 ( USD 30.00 ) on the first purchase and holds onto it for about eight months , according to data from Luno , a prominent crypto platform in the country boasting 9.8 million customers across 40 countries . <p> Interest in crypto is rising on the African continent , says Richard Ball , lead data scientist at Luno . " South Africa is one of our strongest markets , in fact , South Africans make up about 43 percent of our verified customers . Over the past year , we verified more than 3 million new users worldwide . As we expand into new territories , the trend is starting to shift . " <p> Ball says the greatest surge of interest was in Malaysia , which now makes up almost 14 percent of Luno 's customer base , an increase of 8 percent compared to a year ago . <h> South African customer behaviour <p> South Africans usually start with an average first deposit of ZAR 450.00 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Bitcoin in November last year , Ball says . <p> " Most customers start with a relatively small deposit , while the top 25 percent of our biggest local customers start to buy crypto at around ZAR 1.5 K ( USD 100.00 ) and the highest deposit amount among our smallest 25 percent of customers is only around ZAR 90.00 ( USD 6.00 ) . " <p> Ball says these metrics are good news for Luno , as they indicate that South Africans are investing in crypto responsibly . Luno allows customers to buy crypto for as little as ZAR 1.00 ( less than a cent ) in line with its mission to ensure wider access and encourages people to start with smaller deposits while they learn more about crypto . <h> South Africans ' most popular cryptocoins <p> According to Ball , the most popular cryptocoins in South Africa are Bitcoin , Ethereum and XRP , with more customers buying than selling . Almost 80 percent of the transactions on Luno are from people buying crypto , which provides a rough indication of how bullish customers are on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so far this year in demand is XRP , with a 25 percent price surge within a single week . USDC , a cryptocurrency linked to the US dollar , is the least popular on Luno 's platform , in line with its status as a stablecoin . " <p> Ball says customers bought USDC during the market dip in the past few months . " When crypto prices fall , some customers buy into USDC to shield themselves from further market volatility . Once volatility has cooled down , traders will typically move from USDC back into crypto such as BTC . In some sense , this is in line with traditional financial markets where investors avoid risk and move to cash during periods of uncertainty . " <h> Who are South African crypto buyers ? <p> The local buyers are almost a mirror image of the global picture . In line with the gender split in traditional financial services , more men are buying crypto in South Africa than women , with about 30 percent of the activity in the 18 -- 29-year age bracket from women . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ percentage of women -- about 46 percent -- are active on Luno . <p> South African customers hold their crypto for an average of 8 months , which is much longer than two years ago , with the exception of traders , who would naturally be more active , Ball says . " Overall , this indicates that South African customers increasingly view crypto as a longer-term investment and are not necessarily buying it to make a quick buck . " <h> Behaviour depends on when customers bought <p> Ball says Luno is noticing that customer behaviour varies depending on when customers first bought crypto . " We frequently perform cohort analysis to track the transactional behaviour of customers who first bought at a particular point in time . They are grouped into a cohort , for example , the 2017 or 2018 cohort . Customers who bought during the peaks in 2017 or 2021 tend to display different holding period behaviour compared to customers who bought when the price action was much flatter . " <p> Ball explains that customers who first bought when the price was surging , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the markets are flat , tend to be longer-term investors . <h> Repeat buying <p> According to Ball , more than 1 in 10 active Luno customers have used the repeat buy function in the past three months , with South Africans buying an average of ZAR 400.00 ( USD 26.00 ) worth of cryptocurrency per month using this facility . Repeat buy is an instruction to buy into the market at regular intervals and is a great way for customers to buy crypto without having to time the market . Without a repeat buy instruction , one needs to keep a very close eye on movements in the market to ensure they buy when the price dips and sell when it rises . 
@@64015237 <h> TOPLINE <p> Coronavirus infections and hospital admissions are surging across the U.K. just weeks after restrictions were lifted and testing scaled back as part of government plans for " living with Covid , " a concerning uptick experts say could be driven by behavioral changes , waning immunity and the rise of the more infectious BA.2 omicron relative . <h> KEY FACTS <p> Last week , around one in 13 people tested positive for coronavirus in Scotland , one in 18 in Northern Ireland , one in 25 in England and one in 30 in Wales , according to data from the Office of National Statistics infection survey , which randomly tests a sample of the population for the virus . <p> The figures mark an increase in the proportion of people testing positive for Covid-19 across all countries of the U.K. compared to the week before , the ONS said , and government data also shows the number of Covid patients in hospitals across the U.K. is increasing , reaching the highest point in over a year in Scotland . <p> Experts told Forbes it 's difficult to offer a precise explanation for why cases and hospital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a greater wave . <p> Professor Liam Smeeth , Director of the London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine , told Forbes the increase in cases is to be " expected " given the behavioral changes and increased socializing after the U.K. lifted all pandemic restrictions , including the requirement to self-isolate if testing positive for the virus ( a few measures do remain in Wales and Scotland ) . <p> It 's " certainly plausible " that waning immunity from booster shots could explain the increase , Professor Paul Hunter , an infectious disease expert at the University of East Anglia , told Forbes , especially as cases rose first among older people who would have received them earlier , but the fact that recent data shows an increase in all age groups indicates fading protection is " probably not a major contribution . " <p> Hunter said the " main driver " of the increase is the BA.2 omicron subvariant , a more transmissible virus relative of omicron that has been increasing since the beginning of the year and became dominant around two weeks ago . <h> CRUCIAL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the recent increase in cases and hospitalizations in the U.K. is the rise of BA.2 omicron subvariant , " Professor Mark Woolhouse , an epidemiologist at the University of Edinburgh , told Forbes . Given that cases of the original BA.1 omicron are falling , Woolhoouse said waning immunity or behavioral changes were unlikely to be " the main drivers " behind the increase , and BA.2 appears to be able to evade immunity from vaccines and prior infection . <h> WHAT WE DO N'T KNOW <p> The size of a new Covid wave . As we do not yet know " how many people will prove susceptible to it BA.2 ... it is impossible to predict the size of any wave , " Woolhouse said . " There is no obvious reason why cases should fall dramatically in the next few weeks -- Covid-19 is still here and still a significant public health problem . " <h> SURPRISING FACT <p> That hospital admissions are rising in the U.K. now . Hunter told Forbes that while it 's relatively unsurprising the number of infections are increasing as restrictions are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the virus , the current increase in hospital admissions is unexpected . " Admissions normally lag seven to 10 days behind changes in case rates , " he explained . There are several potential explanations for the rise , Hunter said , including BA.2 omicron possibly causing more severe disease than other forms of omicron , problems in data collection and reporting , an increase in older and more vulnerable people at greater risk of hospital admission or more people being admitted to hospital with , but not for , Covid . The answer , as well as an idea of how severe it may get , should become clearer as more data becomes available , Hunter said . <h> WHAT TO WATCH FOR <p> A rise in U.S. cases and hospitalizations . Trends in the U.K. and Europe tend to foreshadow trends elsewhere . For the U.S. , patterns of infections and hospital admissions have been broadly similar to those in the U.K. but lagged a few weeks or months behind . The proportion of BA.2 is also on the rise , accounting for an estimated 12% of cases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , the U.S. has relatively low levels of vaccine uptake and even fewer people have received booster shots , while many people received theirs months ago . This could leave it less well prepared to weather another wave than the U.K. Smeeth , commenting on just the British situation , said the country has " strong population immunity " through infections and vaccination . Covid vaccines are " life-savers " but " not total transmission stoppers . " Smeeth recommended continued caution and having fourth doses " as soon as possible " when they are made available .

@@64029231 <h> Who is the comic now ? Zelensky shows world leaders how it should be done <p> Volodymyr Zelensky was a comedian who starred in romantic comedies . One of his roles was in a political satire series as a high school teacher who became the president of Ukraine . This past was often used against him as an excuse not to take him seriously and his opponents urged him to act like a grownup . But the Ukrainian President proved to be made of much sterner stuff and his oratory skills , bravery and resolve have turned him into an inspiration and symbol of courage across the world . Zelensky dug himself in Ukraine while Russia , a much more powerful world power launched a relentless onslaught on the cities and citizens of Ukraine . When American President Biden offered to evacuate Zelensky from the capital city Kyiv , he replied , " The fight is here ; I need ammunition , not a ride .

We are certainly not seeing this in South Africa , where the once-courageous Cyril Ramaphosa -- who knows what it is like being bullied by a stronger enemy -- is hiding behind Russian President Putin 's skirt . Ramaphosa and many other world leaders can learn important lessons from Zelensky .

" This article was first published on email protected . -- Linda van Tilburg <h> What can leaders learn from Ukraine 's Volodymyr Zelenskyy ? <p> While his country is in crisis , Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is emerging as a masterful communicator and charismatic leader whose management style is reminiscent of some of the greatest statesmen in history , according to Wharton management professor emeritus Michael Useem . <p> Watching Zelenskyy receive a standing ovation after addressing the US Congress from his presidential bunker last week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ D Roosevelt speaking to the same body after the bombing of Pearl Harbour and Winston Churchill delivering his rousing war speech to the House of Commons . <p> " I think the phrase ' leadership presence ' sums up what we saw , " said Useem , who is director for Wharton 's Centre for Leadership and Change Management . " He 's not just there to appear , he 's not just there to show the flag . He 's there to make a case . I think Zelenskyy has proven a master of this moment in ways that we rarely see . " <p> Useem joined Wharton Business Daily on SiriusXM to talk about the evolution of Zelenskyy 's leadership style since the Russian invasion on February 24 . ( Listen to the podcast above . ) Drawing on his decades of research and expertise in the field , the professor pointed out two of Zelenskyy 's consistent management strengths : his on-point messaging and his unwavering dedication to the cause . <p> Since shelling began , Zelenskyy has communicated strength and stability both to his own people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ army green T-shirt , he 's appeared frequently on television and social media platforms to reiterate his resolve and ask the world for help in fighting off Vladimir Putin 's brutal advance . <p> " This is a time to step forward and not shrink from , and Zelenskyy has demonstrated that in spades , even though the conditions and his own safety are at stake , " Useem said . <p> He called Zelenskyy a " master of communication , one of the best ever " . He noted that the president does n't take a formal pose behind a lectern during press conferences , preferring instead to sit in a chair or stand in the street to show the landscape of war behind him . <p> " He 's as artful as they come in helping people focus not on him but on Ukraine , the disaster that it is going through , and the solutions that many countries ought to be following in coming to Ukraine 's aid , " Useem said . <p> There 's a close correlation between the skills of a statesman and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excel at what is described as general management ; juggling a number of urgent and often disparate issues at once . <p> " Being a one-trick pony wo n't do it here .

Will Zelenskyy be able to persuade foreign leaders to intervene and help his country fight off Russian aggression ?

Here they are : a minister of labour deregulation who can weather the resultant union storms ; fire every ANC-appointed central government civil servant ( let them re-apply , this time on merit ) , starting fast with key ministries and agencies , especially the NPA and the SAPS . Drop all commissions of inquiry ; instead , investigate and charge . Devolve virtually every government function , inverting the ANC model and restoring local accountability . And , finally , cut spending . A blueprint for a new SA ? Why not ? This article was first published on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The first four items of the post-ANC government 's agenda <p> By Martin van Staden* <p> It might not be in 2024 , and it might not even be in 2029 , but at some point in South Africa 's future , there will be a day after the African National Congress ( ANC ) -- or whatever other rebrandings or affiliates it may have picked up along the way -- has been substantively defeated at the polls . <p> Martin van Staden . Image by Free Market Foundation <p> The immediate agenda of any post-ANC government must be set early on by its constituency . If not , that government -- whether a Democratic Alliance government or a multi-party government -- is going to want pragmatism to lead it by the nose , and will tend to want to avoid any substantive vision . We have seen this multiple times , where a misplaced preoccupation with colouring within the lines and projecting an image of stability , has delayed or even entirely set aside necessary action . There is cause for concern that this is what the post-ANC government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ action . <p> Here follows a modest proposal for the first four items that must be on the post-ANC government 's agenda that must see the light of day within the first days of that administration . <h> 1 . Send them back to Europe <p> The first order of business must be for the new minister of labour deregulation to announce that the Western European ( anti- ) labour laws that the ANC imported into South Africa since 1996 will be packed-up and sent back to whence they came . Those laws were never fit for purpose in a developing economy that has millions of unskilled people desperately trying to find work . <p> The Labour Relations Act , the Employment Equity Act , the National Minimum Wage Act and all their associated regulations need to be repealed entirely during the first parliamentary session . After these three , other labour laws must also eventually arrive at the chopping block . The common law of labour must fill the void , and must be developed in line with the best principles of our equitable legal tradition . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allegations of severe social injustice from the domestic and global left , and even the new , emerging woke capitalist class will complain about it . But it is something that must be done and must be done with unmatched speed . <p> Anyone who says that it can not be rushed must immediately be retired from political service , as to not rush it would be reckless and irresponsible . Millions are unemployed and millions more are likely to join their ranks , unless swift and unequivocal legislative action is taken . <p> At the end of this process , any national labour department or apparatus must be disassembled , and any residual scope for labour regulation must be entrusted to municipalities ( see ' Devolve , devolve , devolve ! ' below ) . <h> 2 . Send them into unemployment and prison <p> Once the worst anti-labour laws have been got rid of , the minister of public administration must , at will , fire every civil servant in the central government who was appointed by the previous government . This must be mirrored by new governments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will have the opportunity to immediately reapply for their old jobs , but only after going through a real , merit-based vetting process . <p> Although something like this can not be done in one fell swoop , it must be done as quickly as possible in key ministries and agencies . Two of these where it must happen almost immediately is the National Prosecuting Authority and the South African Police Service . No person who is even casually associated with the ANC or its subsidiaries must be left anywhere near these organisations . These institutions must then be given a strict mandate to investigate and prosecute all suspected cases of corruption that have taken place in recent years . No more commissions of inquiry . <h> 3 . Devolve , devolve , devolve ! <p> This is going to be a bitter pill to swallow for any new , post-ANC government . The ANC had been vanquished , after all . The good guys would now be in power ; there would be no need to devolve power and authority to lower levels of government . It is clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resisted . <p> If the post-ANC government wants to ensure a potential future ANC government is handicapped if it tries to loot and destroy the state or economy again , it must speedily decentralise as much as it can . If possible , it must entrench such devolution by constitutional amendment . <p> Provinces and municipalities must be allowed to either have their own police services , or -- and this is the more constitutionally plausible option -- to be in effective control of their respective divisions of the central police service . <p> Tax policy and collection must primarily be decided and conducted at the municipal , or at most the provincial level , and must flow up in terms of voluntary agreements between the tax-collecting sphere of government and the national government . The national government , outside of wartime , must have no competency to set tax policy or collect taxes . These checks and balances are necessary and important for the following reasons : <p> It will end the disharmony between the reality on ground-level South Africa and the ivory tower of national politics . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dimensions of service delivery . <p> The central government will no longer be able to threaten or victimise other spheres of government . <p> As John Kane-Berman has suggested , Eskom 's plants must be sold in groups of no more than three to private investors . I would suggest that each ( private ) contributor to the grid must then become a shareholder in the new grid , with their share representing the proportion of power they contribute . The grid , governed by what will hopefully be dozens of shareholders , will set its own rules and standards ( see ' Cut , cut , cut ! ' below ) , provided it does not stop any new player from also contributing into the grid . <p> To the extent that it might appear necessary , Eskom may retain no more than three power plants to supply subsidised electricity to poor communities . But this arrangement must be coupled to a strict sunset clause . <h> 4 . Cut , cut , cut ! <p> The post-ANC government will feel a certain obligation to , if not increase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be created , at least keep taxes and spending at ANC levels . This desire must be resisted . <p> South African entrepreneurs , innovators and wealth creators are at the end of their tethers . They can not be saddled with any greater burden than they already are , and in fact , this burden must be speedily reduced . The post-ANC government will need a healthy , vibrant and unencumbered private sector to help to achieve its mandate to clean up the post-ANC South Africa . <p> This process of cutting will involve reimagining government as a supporting , not a leading , force in poverty alleviation and wealth creation . Today , the state is largely regarded as the primary provider of education , healthcare and service delivery . It has thoroughly crowded out the private sector and this must stop . <p> At best , the state should assist with the funding of education , healthcare and service delivery for poor communities . It must not provide , manage or oversee those services . And to whatever extent it regulates those services , this must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provincial level . <p> *** <p> There is much else that a post-ANC government would have to address early on in its administration , but these are the four most important things it must devote immediate attention to . If these four items are implemented , it would invigorate the economy and send an unequivocal message of intolerance to rent-seeking politicians and union bosses . <p> Going with this programme , however , requires the type of leadership among the ranks of the post-ANC government that would make most contemporary South African opposition politicians uncomfortable . That is why the initiative will have to reside with civil society and the electorate . The politicians will not go down this route by themselves . <p> Martin van Staden is a member of the executive committee and Rule of Law Board of Advisors of the Free Market Foundation .

@@64029233 <p> Shooting down every one of the ANC 's justifications for the Russian invasion of Ukraine , DA leader John Steenhuisen says their leadership 's thin fa ? ade of neutrality has left them on the wrong side of history , seriously miscalculating global sentiment . That he was talking to the heads of all diplomatic missions in South Africa this week is no small thing , given his comparisons of service delivery data in ANC and DA-run municipalities . The differences are stark and the best evidence of why a change in government is overdue to address the crisis we 're in . If you think that 's overly dramatic , read the evidence Steenhuisen outlines . Crisis in Chinese ( which the ANC should understand given their close relationship with China ) , means danger and movement . With half of SA 's population unemployed and 17 million on social security grants , the Ukrainian crisis will aggravate things . Time is few and SA 's dangers many , says Steenhuisen , but we 've reached an opportunity-rich tipping point for change . -- Chris Bateman <h> You 'll find DA 's values at the heart of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : The following speech was delivered by the DA Federal Leader John Steenhuisen to Heads of Mission , Deputy Heads of Mission and Political Chiefs representing diplomatic missions from around the world at the US Embassy in Pretoria today . <p> Ladies and gentlemen , distinguished guests , members of the diplomatic corps , I thank you for the opportunity to speak here today , and to share with you a perspective on South Africa from the vantage point of the official opposition -- to touch on the biggest challenges facing our country right now , and to then set out the DA 's vision for South Africa . <p> But in the light of what is unfolding in eastern Ukraine right now -- and given this audience here today -- it would be remiss of me not to start there . <p> Let me be very clear : The invasion of Ukraine by the Russian Federation under Vladimir Putin is an act of war for which there is no justification . <p> There is no moral ambiguity in this situation . The line between wrong and right has not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vast majority of nations were quick to take a position on the right side of that line . <p> Most of the world cast its vote in the United Nations to condemn Russia 's actions and call on Putin to withdraw his army . The vast majority of nations have approved economic sanctions against Russia in an effort to compel it to cease its hostilities . The vast majority of world leaders have spoken out clearly and strongly against this violation of international law . <p> " We ca n't pick sides , " said President Cyril Ramaphosa , before going on to do just that by blaming NATO and the West for Ukraine 's devastation . No one believes that the ANC has not already picked their side . No sensible person can fall for their ruse of " neutrality " . <p> President Ramaphosa might have chosen his words carefully to avoid stating outright his support for the Russian cause , but his ANC comrades were not always so careful . When the Defence Minister and the Chief of the Defence Force attend a cocktail event in honour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invasion , you know which side they 've chosen . <p> When the ANC in the Western Cape attend a Russian consulate function celebrating 30 years of diplomatic relations between the countries immediately after the start of the invasion , you know which side they 've chosen . <p> And when Social Development Minister Lindiwe Zulu proudly states that " Russia is our friend , through and through " , as Russian bombs rain down on apartment buildings and hospitals in Kharkiv and Mariupol , you know which side they 've chosen . <p> Perhaps the ANC 's own oligarchs -- those who have built their fortunes on dodgy political connections and corruption -- oppose action against Russia 's oligarchs because they fear that their day of reckoning will also come ? <p> Some have tried to argue that the ANC government speaks for all of us here in South Africa when they refuse to condemn Russia and Putin , but that is simply not true . Most South Africans do not support the ANC 's position at all . A recent poll by The Economist concluded that the overwhelming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Russia 's invasion of Ukraine . <p> My own interaction with citizens , business leaders , civil society and religious leaders has found the same . Ordinary South Africans are good people . Most are appalled by what is happening in Ukraine right now and have deep sympathy for the innocent people who are being attacked and killed by a tyrant . And most South Africans are mortified that their government has chosen the side of the tyrant . <p> I would like to assure you today that the ANC government does not speak on behalf of South Africa when it comes to Russia and Ukraine . They speak for themselves and their own narrow financial interests only . <p> Hiding behind a veneer of neutrality , and citing entirely disingenuous rhetoric of struggle allegiances of days gone by , they pretend that their refusal to condemn Russia is somehow noble and justified . But it is not . It is a disgrace that has brought shame on our nation . <p> Already , over the past two decades , South Africa 's place in the world has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the ANC government . Their decision to effectively keep Robert Mugabe in power in Zimbabwe under the guise of " quiet diplomacy " has brought untold misery to the people of that nation , which continues more than four decades after independence . <p> Their scheming complicity in helping Sudan 's former dictator , Omar al-Bashir , evade arrest and flee the country was one of the lowest points in our recent history . <p> And their refusal to allow the Dalai Lama entry into South Africa on three occasions , including for the 80th birthday celebration of his friend , the Archbishop Desmond Tutu , as well as for a summit of Nobel prize laureates , was beyond the pale . <p> If the ANC did indeed speak for all of us on the global stage , our shame would be huge . But they do n't . And I trust that enough people out there know that the people of South Africa are better than that . <p> This is why I was immensely proud when the DA-run Western Cape provincial government symbolically lit up the legislature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ similarly , when the DA-run City of Cape Town did so with the beautiful City Hall building . The people of Ukraine must know that even though our government has taken a cowardly and immoral position , they are not the voice of South Africa . <p> The rest of us stand with Ukraine against its oppressor . <p> We reject tyranny and we condemn the brutality of a war criminal like Vladimir Putin . <p> But just as the ANC does not speak for South Africans on Russia and Ukraine , it is becoming increasingly clear that they do n't speak for the majority of South Africans on domestic issues either . <p> In last year 's local government elections , they were pushed below 50% for the first time in the history of our democracy . And on a low voter turn-out , too . This marks a tipping point in our country 's history . Because , while we have already seen the ANC lose majorities in a province , in several metros and in dozens of municipalities , we are now seeing it happen on national @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leader John Steenhuisen delivers the Democratic Alliance 's " The Real State of the Nation Address " at the Speaker 's Corner on February 08 , 2022 in Cape Town . ( Photo by Gallo Images/Die Burger/Jaco Marais ) <p> This has opened the door to an entirely new path for our country . A path full of uncertainty and change , but also one that , for the first time , might not involve the African National Congress . <p> After almost three decades , South Africans are finally learning that a liberation movement does not necessarily translate into a government , and that traditional voting allegiances based on race , history and identity are not necessarily in their best interest . Our democracy is maturing , and with this comes a number of teething pains , such as tricky coalition or minority governments . But these are steps we have to take if we are to break free from the shackles this ANC government has placed on our society with its cold war-era approach to life , politics and the economy . <p> If we are to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of liberal democracy -- built around constitutionalism , non-racialism , the rule of law and a passionate belief in the enterprising spirit of individual human beings -- will have to stand at the centre of this reimagined South African society . <p> We are going to have to learn , very quickly , to make an even better case for these principles , because they must become the cornerstones on which we rebuild our country . We have to shatter the idea of an all-powerful state that owns and controls everything , and at whose mercy its citizens must live . <p> And we have to empower individual South Africans to take ownership of their lives and their dreams , and not to simply sign all of it over to a government that has neither the ability nor the will to improve their future . <p> This sounds simple enough , but it is a monumental task in the South African context , where almost half our adult population is unemployed and more than 30 million citizens live below the upper-bound poverty line . <p> Over 17 million social grants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this number grows by the day as more and more people join the ranks of the unemployed . <p> Selling a vision of dignity and independence from the state is not that easy when people have so little hope of finding work . <p> Asking people to turn their backs on the party of their parents and grandparents ; the party of the liberation struggle -- and to be the first generation to do so -- is a hard task . Particularly given our country 's brutal and unjust history which has left people deeply resentful and suspicious . But it is a step we are going to have to take if we want to make progress . And I am reminded here of the text of a speech delivered by Robert Kennedy , all the way back in 1966 , to a group of students at the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg . <p> Speaking about the role that individuals play in shaping a nation , he said : <p> " This is the heaviest responsibility of all -- a burden men have often refused by turning rule @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all-powerful state . History is full of peoples who have discovered it is easier to fight than think , easier to have enemies and friends selected by authority than to make their own painful choices , easier to follow blindly than to lead , even if that leadership must be the private choice of a single man alone with a free and sceptical mind . <p> But in the final telling it is that leadership , the impregnable scepticism of the free spirit , untouchable by guns or police , which feeds the whirlwind of change and hope and progress in every land and time . " <p> The future of South Africa lies in the hands of individual South Africans with their own dreams and aspirations . Our change and our progress will be realised when those individual South Africans unshackle our country from its stifling past and cast off this heavy ANC anchor that is dragging us down . <p> We believe there is hope because the majority of South Africans want to live in a thriving , accountable , democratic state . There is hope if those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be counted when called on to vote . But that will have to happen very soon , or there wo n't be much left to save . <p> The perilous state of our nation is often expressed in numbers and graphs -- unemployment , GDP growth , debt , poverty , inequality -- but these can never fully convey the reality that millions of poor South Africans have to face every day . For this , you 'd have to take a drive through our country 's sprawling informal settlements , through our broken small towns and our forgotten rural landscapes where people have long since given up on the dream of a better life . <p> We may not be at war , like the bombed-out cities of Ukraine , but large parts of South Africa resemble a war zone . Every service , every institution and every piece of infrastructure that is managed by government or one of its state-owned entities has all but collapsed . Our rail network has been destroyed , or carried off piece by piece to the scrap metal merchants . Our water and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And our state electricity supplier is unable to meet even the shrunken demand of our stagnant economy . <p> We simply do not have the luxury of time nor the financial reserves to ride out this volatile period of history and hope that things improve somewhere down the line . All over the world , countries are trying to exit the Covid pandemic while preparing for the fallout from Russia 's invasion of Ukraine . But here in South Africa both of those crises are secondary to our biggest crisis of all : three decades of bad ANC policy and crippling ANC corruption . Our economy was already decimated long before Covid struck . <p> We 'd already been in recession , our credit rating was already junk , and our unemployment numbers were already around 40% before anyone had even heard of the coronavirus . Everything that has happened since then -- our government 's heavy-handed , unscientific and ongoing response to Covid-19 -- just added fuel to an already-blazing fire . <p> Today , young people in this country feel entirely powerless to change what seems like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sit down to write their final matric exams , and very few of those who do will enter tertiary education or find a job afterwards . Their hopelessness and their disillusionment is our biggest crisis . <p> That is why I say we do not have the luxury of time . We might not survive another five years of this ANC national government 's disastrous approach to the economy . And the fabric of our society will not hold forever . <p> Already we are seeing rips starting to appear in this fabric as people seek to blame others for their desperate situation . The scapegoating of foreigners for everything from unemployment to housing shortages and business opportunities is becoming more and more prevalent . <p> And predictably , this xenophobia is being fanned by a host of political parties and their populist leaders . At a time when we desperately need level heads and compassion , too many are trying to score cheap political mileage by encouraging distrust and resentment of immigrants . <p> It 's hard to think of a time since the early 1990s when our country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is also the first time since the early 1990s that a different pathway has seemed possible for South Africa . <p> Along with the ANC 's slide below 50% , we now also have a situation where the DA leads more governments and governs for more people than ever before . <p> I addressed a breakaway meeting of all our mayors last weekend , and in that room were 36 DA mayors . In fact , the DA is involved in the governing of 38 municipalities right across the country . This includes four of the country 's eight metro municipalities , along with outright majorities in flagship municipalities such as Midvaal in Gauteng , uMngeni in KwaZulu-Natal and Kouga in the Eastern Cape . And , of course , we also govern the Western Cape province . <p> Never before have so many South Africans lived in DA-run cities and towns , and this gives us a precious opportunity to show instead of tell what we can do . <p> With two years to go before the crucial 2024 national and provincial elections , each of these DA-run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DA Difference ; the visible and tangible improvement in quality of life that can only be achieved through responsible , responsive and empathetic governance . <p> This is what we pride ourselves on ; the fact that we do n't just talk about making changes or bringing progress . We are already bringing about change and progress . We get things done . <p> We take immense pride in achieving clean audits in our municipalities because this indicates that we 're spending public money responsibly and where it matters . <p> We take immense pride in the fact that DA-run towns and cities consistently head up the basic service delivery statistics , because access to things like clean , running water , flush toilets and reliable refuse collection are life-changing for many people . <p> We take immense pride in offering the best access to public healthcare , or the fact that , where we govern , more children remain in school until their matric exams than anywhere else . We take immense pride in every single house or housing opportunity we hand over to a family , with full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unlock the doors to the economy for millions . Which is why we will never stop fighting national government 's plans to destroy property rights through expropriation . <p> All of these things are the basic job description of a local government , and the DA does them far better than anyone else . <p> But it 's not enough for us to simply do the things that fall under our own job description as a local government , because that would still leave people at the mercy of an incompetent national government when it comes to critical services such as electricity provision , policing and rail transport . <p> And so , our governments have had to step in , more and more , and take on some of these duties and responsibilities , in order to shield citizens from the worst failures of national government . <p> An obvious example of this is our efforts to spare people the worst effects of electricity load-shedding . You may have heard about the plans of several DA-run metros and municipalities to start procuring their power directly from independent producers instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Town manages to spare its customers at least one stage of load-shedding compared to the rest of the country . Soon it will be in a position to make the metro entirely Eskom-proof . <p> Another area where citizens have been badly let down by national government -- and where DA-run local and provincial governments have stepped in to fill the void -- is in policing and community safety . Our fight is to ultimately decentralise policing , to put it in the hands of those who know and understand the communities they serve . <p> But until we achieve this goal , our governments have introduced several law enforcement programmes to help augment visible policing in high-crime areas . One of these -- the LEAP programme in Cape Town 's gang-ravished Cape Flats -- has already shown remarkable success . <p> Over the next two years , our ability to demonstrate this DA difference where we govern is the best election campaign tool we could have asked for . This , along with some truly innovative new policy positions we have just adopted on topics such as energy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ positions us as a national government-in-waiting . <p> We have long spoken about a coming realignment of politics in South Africa , where the old alliances will give way to new formations around shared values and governing principles . <p> That time is now . Our country is entering a phase of rapid social and political change , and the DA is going to be at the heart of this change . <p> This is not going to be easy . It will require a lot of hard work and will to make it happen . And it will require the support of those international partners who place store in the democratic values that we share ; values that make up an ethical political economy as much as they do an ethical foreign policy . <p> But let 's not fool ourselves . Democracy has been on the wane for some time across the globe . <p> There has been a constant slide to authoritarianism since the mid-2000s . According to Freedom House 's latest report , only about 20% of the world 's population lives in countries classified as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In sub-Saharan Africa , that number is just 9% . <p> Unfortunately , this slide has often been aided and abetted by donors who place ' strategic matters ' such as counter-terrorism and peacekeeping programmes -- and sometimes , great power rivalry -- ahead of human rights . <p> Lord Palmerston famously put it that countries have no permanent friends or enemies , only perpetual interests . That may be true , but Ukraine has reminded us that those interests can also be long term and values based . <p> Let me put it this way : if the much-overdue Western action on Ukraine is to be meaningful , it has to take in Africa along with other regions . In practical terms , three actions stand out for external partners of African people . <p> First , there is a need for a more carefully calibrated policy that links domestic democratic conditions to donor benefits , including access to funding , markets and training . In other words , bad guys should not get benefits . <p> Second , donors must find the means to support elections . Elections @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a democracy ; that is a measure also of the health of institutions and the rule of law , among other aspects . But without a free and fair election , little progress can be made in creating the sort of competitive political systems that produce better outcomes for their citizens . Devising a platform for transparent electoral support is an imperative for Africa 's often beleaguered and bereft election parties . <p> There should be no shame in supporting Africa 's oppositions ; indeed , it is the West 's best hope for maintaining their Palmerstonian interests . <p> Third , the swathe of Southern African liberation movements that voted to abstain in the recent UN General Assembly vote on Ukraine is a reminder that the threat of authoritarianism is a clear and present danger to our region . <p> Altering this trajectory from the inevitable train smash that lies ahead should become a proactive priority for the West , not least in its messaging . A failure to do so will only make it complicit in our collapse . <p> Simply put , the DA 's ability to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ South Africa relies on far more discerning and involved global support . <p> Allow me to end with another quote from that same Robert Kennedy speech in Johannesburg in 1966 : <p> " So tomorrow 's South Africa will be different from today 's -- just as tomorrow 's America will be different from the country I left these few short days ago . Our choice is not whether change will come , but whether we can guide that change in the service of our ideals and toward a social order shaped to the needs of all our people . " <p> I believe South Africa has already opened the door to this change . And I believe it is the values of the DA -- constitutionalism , a capable state , the rule of law , non-racialism and a healthy market economy -- that will guide South Africa through this next phase of its development , and in service of its people . <p> We look forward to walking that journey along with South Africa 's international partners who share these values . <p> Thank you . <p> Press @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Government 's position on Russia 's invasion of Ukraine does not reflect the views of all South Africans <p> ActionSA met with the Ukrainian Ambassador in South Africa , Liubov Abravitova . <p> This afternoon , following the ANC-led South African Government 's abstention in a UN General Assembly vote on a resolution denouncing the Russian invasion of Ukraine and calling for its immediate withdrawal , ActionSA resolved to take a clear stance on the matter and met with the Ukrainian Ambassador in South Africa , Liubov Abravitova . <p> The primary intention of the meeting was to convey ActionSA 's support for the Ukrainian people and that the ANC government 's position does not reflect the views of all South Africans . <p> The refusal to denounce this war places South Africa on the wrong side of history together with a list of countries known for their human rights violations and disdain for democratic principles , and promotes geo-political leftist propaganda of clear-cut lines between global forces of good and evil . <p> Our blinding and unending allegiance to countries that the ANC government deems to have been our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Having come out of apartheid just over 27 years ago , South Africans should not be desensitised just because the Russian invasion of Ukraine is taking place far from our shores . In fact , we should be outraged , given that what is happening in that part of the world has direct implications for our own national and geo-political security . <p> Global agricultural products , food and fuel prices are soaring , putting even more pressure on the poor who are already buckling under the overwhelming oppression that comes with extreme poverty and who are struggling following the economic blow we have all suffered as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic . <p> President Cyril Ramaphosa has reiterated that the South African government will not take sides in the war between Russia and Ukraine . <p> Cyril Ramaphosa 's government whose delusional idea that abstaining demonstrates a strong stand on some principle can not deny that South Africa 's recent performance on the global stage under his party 's rudderless leadership has fallen severely short of the ambitions identified at the dawn of our democracy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diplomacy on Zimbabwe , we have seen our government drift further and further away from the principles embedded in our Constitution . <p> While we do not view Russia as an enemy , in the end , President Putin 's show of force against the Ukrainian people must be seen as nothing less than tyrannical and reminiscent of Hitler 's invasion of Poland , a globally devastating moment in history that led to the eruption of the Second World War . <p> ActionSA 's affirmation of our country 's post-apartheid foreign policy based on " our belief that human rights should be the core concern of international relations " and " considerations of justice and respect for international law " , compels us to stand in support of the Ukrainian people as well as the international community to avoid the possible international catastrophe that is war . 
@@64029234 <h> Trevor Ncube on living in Zimbabwe and why he would n't live anywhere else <p> Zimbabwean entrepreneur and media mogul Trevor Ncube shared his views on the final day of the BizNews Conference in the Drakensberg about whether Zim presents opportunity for investors or is a basket case .

If you want to see proper potholes , come to Zimbabwe . So , life is a pain . It 's as if Zanu-PF gathers together to say : how do we mess up their lives ? But would I be anywhere else in the world ?

Actually , they are in this thing to see if they can have a cut , a share . We are seeing this with Mnangagwa . We thought he was concerned about Zimbabweans , when in actual fact , it is time for him and his people to eat . That 's what it 's all about . We see this happening in South Africa and all over the region . That will not deliver the new Zimbabwe we want . We need new politics . We need politics driven by values , principles , constitutionalism , rule of law , and driven by the love of humanity and what is best among us , by the love of the orphans , the widows , the poor among us . What is the best thing to ensure those people are taking good care of you ? You run the country well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business and allow business to do what it is supposed to . <p> It is possible . The underlying thing there is patience . HH has been very patient , firstly . Point number two , he is a chartered accountant . He has a track record . He has run a successful business . How can you get somebody who 's never run a tuck shop to run a country ? We underrate the importance of experience , the importance of exposure , the importance of the right values in the person who says they want to raise their hand to lead . What HH has done in the past has infused in him the experience and the worldview that will help him . Look at the people who he has appointed . He is appointing professional people , Zambians who have got a track record . My sense is that he will get it right . If the forces of evil do n't come in and push him , Zambia could be a place to look forward to . <p> On the steps that can be taken to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Zimbabwe becoming what it has did not happen overnight . It was a process . And this has been happening in South Africa ; the undermining of institutions , the elevation of people that should not be in certain positions and cadre deployment . It means you 're not getting the best people to run the country . I am one of those who got excited about Cyril Ramaphosa . A generous part of me says Cyril is being patient in managing the ANC because if he rocks the boat , maybe these people might recall him . The other part of me believes he has lost time in terms of stamping his authority on the ANC and allowing things to happen . My sense is that there 's too much desire on his part for consensus to get everybody on board . There is a lack of decisiveness on his part . He 's a good man , he has done good stuff . However , the disappointment is that he does not make decisions . He does not act and is not decisive . And those around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happening , South Africa is going down the drain . I am worried about where South Africa is right now . I am worried about the things that South Africans think are important and the focus on things that have not worked . <p> Taking farms from white people is a no-no . It does n't work . It is very damaging . Should there be land reform ? Absolutely . Because there can not be justification for one race owning the biggest chunks of land when there are people who do n't have land . But let 's not make the mistake of saying every black person is a farmer and must be given land because that 's not true . So , the land reform is going to happen . First of all , there are going to be market mechanisms of deciding the value of the land , and who it is being given to . Is it being given to people who can farm on it ? I recognise things and trends we saw happening in Zimbabwe that South Africans should be looking at and saying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am concerned .

" <p> I feel just the same about wine and with the gentle flutter of falling leaves just starting , I went in search of the perfect wine list for you for the next few weeks . Wine does n't just have its season , but more , every season has its wine . <p> John Keats would have us believe that " the poetry of the earth is never dead " and as I pulled the cork on a bottle of Iona Single Vineyard Kloof Pinot Noir 2018 and settled down to my new book over the weekend , I guessed Keats must have found that inspiration from just such a moment . Pinot Noir is a change of season wine and marries particularly well with good books , soft slippers , comfy sofas , content furry friends on laps and treats of choice on autumnal weekends . <p> In the BizNews shop at the moment , you will find that Andrew Gunn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is infinitely drinkable and extremely well priced for this normally rather-pricey varietal . It smells like strawberries ( in fact , most red berries ) , cherries and sometimes cinnamon and dark rich soil . Its indescribably delicate when vinified to perfection and , as I have always said , will be the costliest love affair upon which you will ever embark . Good Pinot is addictive and cruel and once you have been caught , you will lie helpless in that trap , forever . Andrew makes three that you can choose from ; get into the shop , take a squiz and press the right buttons . The single vineyard Pinot Noirs from Iona are sublime . A glass will typically be medium-bodied , with light , bright acidity ; all cherries and raspberries , fringed with the spices of gorgeous old French oak . When done right , it lasts forever and each year adds a delicious ring of bright beauty to this lovely wine . Its rightful home is Burgundy but in our modern-day global village , it 's been successfully grown in a couple more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . We make some fabulous Pinot Noir here ... watch this space . <p> If you feel daunted or disdainful of this moody beauty , then try one of the ros ? s in the shop . I am finding that more and more we are making ros ? in a slightly more serious fashion . Rather than just being that fun , summer-sipping companion , as many of us think of her , this category can ably don a power suit and entertain a bowl of lobster bisque on a good autumn evening . Sophie Le Ros ? , Vrede en Lust The Jess ( my favourite sip for sip ) or the delicious Ros ? from Wildekrans that is vinified from 100% Shiraz grapes . Try some of those during the autumn days that lie ahead .

The same is true about business . <p> It is easier to follow than to lead . Some even say wait for someone to fail first . Even with Facebook , we had Myspace first . Yet , I do n't want to believe that is " the truth " . <p> With major change you face risks . Yet , there are people who see such risk as the time to be audacious . For others , to believe they will prevail ( how often have I heard from executives that Amazon can not afford , long-term , to deliver for free to Prime members ? ) . <p> We know from history that most companies will make some changes and believe that will be enough to sustain performance . <p> This is no longer realistic . Technology change is too widespread and deep . It is time to set-aside preconceived notions and ask the questions most of us fear to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leader , a distant number two , a challenger brand , a me-too brand , a small or a focused brand , every brand owner asks the same questions : how do we leverage technology to retain or grow competitively ? <p> Most importantly , how can the changes make our business even more competitive ? We know , that with some exceptions , most very large companies do not change . So the smaller , agile companies have a great advantage , right now . <h> Most leaders today were " first-movers " <p> First-mover market entrants and green-fields brands largely led the revenue and profitability stakes for many years in most markets . <p> Arguably , if Sony did not decide to dominate the market for video cassette systems , Beta would have won . It was widely acknowledged that Beta was the better system , yet Sony was more agile and faster to market . <p> Similarly , if Microsoft did not decide to make its operating system affordable and accessible to all , it is possible that another company would today dominate the world of software @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That decision formed the foundation for all else . <h> Then the " cosy " situation changed , very fast <p> Then the Internet happened and within twenty years , the world changed . <h> Even the way we value companies changed ! <p> When we compare the largest companies today , a few elements are evident : 1 . They became dominant fast relative to the history of global companies of the last 200 years , 2 . They became dominant , even whilst many have a lower market share than companies that existed for a long time , 3 . The market attributed value to them faster than their growth justified . <p> A re-set of the way companies are measured and valued , changed . The behaviour of consumers changed overnight . When we read that in many countries , people under 40 years of age no longer prefer traditional banks as their transaction provider of choice , we know it is possible to change consumer behaviour fast . <h> How did this happen and how do we respond ? <p> Can these new first-mover companies remain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ?

How much more can Instagram grow ?

It fragments thinking even more and makes focus harder . What is relevant ? What will prevail and what not ? What impacts and what will not ? <p> Why are some industries , at the very juncture of these changes , unable to escape their traditional business domains successfully ( Telco 's being a very good example ) ? <p> Can new insights brought about through technology , new data sources and connectivity of animate and inanimate entities , create new market opportunities ? <p> Are fully sensory experiences by customers close or still far away ? How can it be used ? Can it add advantage ? <p> Does creativity of how algorithms are used , how deeper data @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brands perceived open totally new gaps for companies ? If so , how must we view and use data ? The data discussion is about what we know , not about what we do n't know . The latter is far more relevant . <p> Operationally , we already know how large technology is in logistics , it is a small indicator of how much deeper it can be used in other areas that create market advantage . <h> Meaningful change requires hard questions <p> The only constraint to the future lies in the questions we ask . Yes , transformation is not easy , yet the substance and required speed of transformation lies in asking different questions . <p> The same questions can not drive new solutions . If you do not introduce disruptive forces and new processes to drive questions and change the mindset of people , company will be its own biggest constraint . <p> SpaceX would never have existed if the same questions were asked . <p> When CEO 's and executives are surveyed , the vast majority , across many surveys in many countries , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are at the forefront of such change , in others they are not yet clear in what way the change will happen .

I would rather know I am in trouble , than to wake-up one morning with a shock . <p> When we divorce a business from its operations , it changes what is possible . <p> There is no one single answer to these questions .

The barriers of red tape and financial obligations that come with it make it a prospect that takes valuable time and resources away from the millions in this sector . For many , losing one hour of trading to administration or hundreds of rand to bookkeeping often means the difference between their family eating or not . <p> The government has recognised the need to reduce barriers to trade for informal sector businesses . The presidency has announced a special desk in the president 's office to reduce red tape , the Gauteng legislature has recently passed the Townships Economic Development Bill and the City of Johannesburg is working on an informal sector policy , all aimed at supporting informal traders . <p> These initiatives , though well intended , will not succeed without a radically different approach to informal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ punted as a silver bullet during the Mbeki years .

And you can pull in data and services from a number of sources , integrating them and starting to really deliver powerful outcomes . <p> Creating a canvas app really is easy enough for anyone to do ( well , I did it , so you know it ca n't be that hard ) . You literally set up the data source and click " Create app " -- and your app is created .

@@89818234 <p> Eskom has submitted a tariff restructuring application to the National Energy Regulator of South Africa , proposing sweeping changes to the calculations used to determine its approved electricity prices . <p> This comes after the utility conducted an updated cost-of-supply ( CTS ) study , which showed that the current approach , in place since 2012 , was not resulting in cost-reflective revenue collection . <p> Eskom advanced three primary reasons why an overhaul of the current tariff structure was necessary . <p> " Firstly , the different tariff rates no longer reflect the different services being provided -- that is , they are not aligned with energy , network and retail costs -- because of the application of average price increases , " Eskom said . <p> In addition , the imminent unbundling of Eskom divisions required that the charges were more reflective of the costs per division . <p> The utility said that applying average increases to rates meant there was no link between the charges raised and the Nersa-approved cost per division , only that the overall sum of all charges recover the approved Multi-Year Price Determination ( MYPD ) revenue decision . <p> Finally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needed to evolve to protect all customer interests and to ensure adequate recovery of Nersa-approved revenue , the utility argued . <p> Eskom provided a summary of the costs and revenue under its current and proposed tariff structuring in the table below . <p> Eskom expects the changes will lead to an overall slight decline in revenue of R2 million -- which is a relatively flat decrease considering an overall revenue of roughly R247.8 billion . <p> On average , the utility has calculated that revenue from residential tariffs would decrease slightly by 0.81% -- a reduction of R131 million . <p> The most significant increases Eskom has proposed are for the tariffs charged for public lighting , which make up a minute fraction of its overall revenue . <p> For municipalities , Eskom calculated its costs in generating electricity for public lighting is R62 million more than the revenue it collects . <p> To compensate for this , the new tariff would allow for collecting 30.28% more revenue for public lighting from municipalities . <p> Public lighting for non-municipal areas have also seen a shortfall of R11 million , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revenue . <h> Goodbye Inclining Block Tariff -- Hello high capacity charges <p> One of the potential major changes for residential users is the scrapping of the Inclining Block Tariff ( IBT ) , which charges higher rates for higher monthly consumption . <p> Eskom said the IBT structure had proven unpopular and was difficult for customers to understand , resulting in " perverse " behaviour when purchasing at the high block rates . <p> It also argued the assumption that low-income or multi-family dwellings were low consumers was not necessarily true . <p> " Multiple dwellings may also be supplied from a single electricity supply point . An IBT structure has a significant impact on these customers , " Eskom said . <p> " In addition , there are more affluent customers , for example , with holiday homes . that unfairly benefit from the inclining block rate . " <p> For the revised Homelight tariff , which is typically reserved for low-usage single-phase residential dwellings , churches , schools , halls , clinics , old-age homes or similar customers in urban areas , Eskom would continue to subsidise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rates for lower energy usage , while consumption from 700kWh and upwards would be cheaper than under the current tariff structure , as shown in the graphs below . <p> But the picture will be very different for Homepower users . <p> Eskom said the use of IBTs also greatly incentivised higher-consumption customers to use alternative energy sources and energy efficiency , resulting in a real revenue loss not commensurate with a real cost reduction . <p> " The reduction in consumption by these customers because of the switch to alternative energy sources such as PV results in subsidies being unfairly distributed , " Eskom stated . <p> " These customers , mostly affluent , who then reduce consumption , are subsidised by those without PV . " <p> To resolve this , Eskom has proposed introducing a single energy charge ( c/kWh ) , an ancillary service charge ( c/kWh ) , a network demand charge ( c/kWh ) and a R/day service and administration charge for Homepower users . <p> These were previously proposed by Eskom in its 2020/2021 retail tariff plan and effectively meant that Homepower users @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no electricity . <p> For example , a Homepower 1 user would pay R938 instead of R218 without using a single kilowatt-hour of electricity . <p> The overall differences between Eskom 's current and proposed Homepower tariffs are shown in the graphs below . <p> Despite these additions , Eskom said its Homepower tariff would work out to be roughly 4% cheaper on average . <p> According to Eskom , the average customer on the Homepower 1 tariff structure currently has a bill of R2,857 per month , but will pay roughly R2,571 on the new tariff , a reduction of 10% . <p> The average Homepower 3 user will also be paying 3% less , whereas Homepower 2 and Homepower Bulk users will be paying 5% and 3% more , on average . <p> The current and revised monthly bills for Homepower customers are shown in the table below . <p> Although the increase in capacity charges will negatively impact solar users who make little use of Eskom 's grid throughout the month , Eskom is also proposing a new time-of-use tariff called Homeflex that could be to their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compensation for excess energy exported into the grid . <p> Eskom said this tariff would be mandatory for customers with small-scale embedded generation with the approved postpaid smart meter device and voluntary for residential customers without self-generation . <p> Eskom wants Nersa to consider the implementation of the new tariff structure for electricity prices from 1 April 2023 . <p> The regulator will make a decision on Eskom 's proposal following the standard public consultation process . <h> Partner Content <h> Join the conversation Autoload comments <p> Comments section policy : MyBroadband has a new article comments policy which aims to encourage constructive discussions .

Season 1 is available to stream locally on Showmax .. <p> Two years ago , Chris Bohjalian 's novel , The Flight Attendant , was adapted into a delightfully surprising thriller series starring Kaley Cuoco as Cassie Bowden . She 's a free-spirited , alcoholic flight attendant whose handsome one-night stand ( Michiel Huisman ) gets murdered . Looking to clear her name , Cassie embarks on her own investigation about what happened and ends up inviting all kinds of danger and shadiness into her already extremely messy life . For eight episodes , Cuoco and the ensemble cast pulled off the perfect tightwire act of high stakes mixed with wit and panache as Cassie desperately tries to exonerate herself . Along the way , she also finally faces her inner demons and addiction issues . It was a fizzy , frothy , and eventually poignant season of storytelling that could have just been a great limited series . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back , following Cassie and company one year after the events of Season 1 . While a bit of the magic and intrigue is gone in Season 2 , there is still a good amount of fun in watching Cuoco capably slip back into the driver 's seat as the adjusted series premise invites more messiness into Cassie 's life . <p> Now based in Los Angeles and one-year sober , Cassie seemingly has it all together now . She 's still tempted to drink but she 's got a stable , hot photographer boyfriend , Marco ( Santiago Cabrera ) , to keep her grounded , a wise AA sponsor ( Shohreh Aghdashloo ) , her day job as a flight attendant , and her secret side job as a CIA asset who gets paid to snoop on marks around the globe . In the premiere episode , " Seeing Double , " Cassie is keeping up with her new normal until she decides to get too nosy with a German courier she 's asked to only observe , but instead follows all over Berlin .

The plausible murder and the ensuing entanglement of her friends and work peers into the mess can most likely only be done once and be believable . Plus , the subconscious appearances of Huisman as the personification of her guilt and a by-product of her serious alcoholism was an effective interior pocket for her to work out her major issues in a weird but intriguing way . In Season 2 , what worked before now feels a lot more constructed and specious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own head work best as a constant temptation metaphor , as the older versions of Cassie serve to mentally wear her resolve down as her anxiety ratchets up . But it still does n't feel as interesting or as organic as how it was used in Season 1 as an ingenious way to integrate the fantasy guy who got away into the story . <p> However , welcome returnees like Mamet and Akdeniz prove how important they are to the show 's pithy and lightning-fast pace , especially when paired against Cuoco 's nervous energy . Annie remains a dry straight-shooter who calls Cassie out on her bullshit , which makes for some great comedy . And on the flip side , she and Max also work well as Cassie 's very smart enablers , who ca n't control their curiosity and just exacerbate situations for the worst . The show 's madcap vibe burns bright when the trio 's together and they give the new season a lot of its spark . <p> The mystery-woman conundrum fueling the action is relatively intriguing , but by Episode 2 , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also a very slow sprinkling of a returning character that feels like an outlier subplot that is n't gelling with the overall Season 2 storylines yet .

It also incorporates that 24 style of cutting , with picture-in-picture boxes that provide alternative views or multiple angles on any given scene , which means there 's always a kinetic energy keeping the episodes from flagging .

Right now , we 're cautiously optimistic . <h> The Verdict <p> The Flight Attendant returns with a new mystery that threatens to sink Cassie 's recovery and hard-won balance after the first season 's shenanigans . Kaley Cuoco slips back into the driver seat , proving her skills again at making her character funny , manic , and sympathetic despite her poor choices . And the writers make a great call in upping the screen time for Zosia Mamet and Deniz Akdeniz , as the three have terrific chemistry and work together effortlessly . What is n't as rewarding is the new scenario of Cassie 's interior selves taunting her to do bad things or the plausibility of her latest spy-centric quandary . Perhaps both will eventually pay off , but neither make the return to the series as smooth or vital as Season 1 's scenarios .

But , while there is still interest from major players -- witness Shell 's contentious seismic blasting off SA 's east coast -- commodities make up a smaller and smaller proportion of the continent 's foreign direct investment ( FDI ) flow . In fact , research from EY shows that extractive industries accounted for less than 4% of FDI in 2020 . <p> Meanwhile , at the sharp end of the wedge are the growing number of technology-based start-ups receiving international funding . African start-ups raised $4.65bn in 2021 , twice as much as in 2020 . While that is a fraction of the $329.5bn North American start-ups raised through the course of the year , it points @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is firmly on the radar of international investors . <p> While there will be opportunities in technology , especially among early-stage start-ups , for some time to come any savvy investor should have at least one eye on what comes next . <p> The case for sustainability <p> There are a number of possibilities when it comes to identifying what that " next " might be . I would argue there is a strong case to be made for sustainability . This is especially true when it comes to environmental sustainability . Even though total emissions from the entire Africa are lower than the top 40 listed companies in Europe , there is still a lot of pressure on , and within , the continent to ensure that its development is as sustainable as possible . <p> In part , that is because Africa is set to be disproportionately affected by climate change . In fact , it already is , with the UN pointing out that climate change is triggering food insecurity , poverty and displacement across the continent . There will be other effects too . Research released @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heritage sites are at risk of being lost due to climate change . <p> Rising oceans are not the only climate-based threat to Africa 's heritage sites either . A project aimed at digitising tens of thousands of historic manuscripts from Timbuktu in Mali was completed this month , for example . Most of those documents were smuggled out of the ancient city while its libraries were under attack by insurgents . It is widely acknowledged that this conflict has been worsened by climate change . <p> At the same time , large swathes of the continent still have a lot of ground to make up when it comes to growth and development . Within that context , it seems absurd that a continent that accounts for less than 3% of global carbon dioxide emissions should be punished for the rest of the world 's indiscretions . <p> Embracing changemakers <p> But within those very real constraints there is opportunity . While there are obviously possibilities for investors looking at low- and zero-carbon energy on the continent , that certainly is not the only available avenue when it comes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make changes can make a much more immediate effect . <p> We have seen that with a number of our portfolio companies . Whether they are making recycled plastic goods that are stronger and of higher quality than those made with virgin plastic , or an online retailer eliminating large amounts of waste from its operations , all are making a difference in vital ways . <p> Critically , these existing businesses are also typically committed to the communities they operate in and serve . That not only means they understand what is and is not possible , even with significant amounts of funding , they also understand that matters such as gender equity and staff upliftment have an effect on sustainability too . By backing these already viable companies that are willing to be changemakers , investors can help push sustainability while also netting returns . <p> Change begets change <p> While one-off megaprojects have their place and can be incredibly exciting , it is crucial that the existing , functional parts of the economy are made sustainable too . There are plenty of companies across Africa that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drive a wave of sustainability while still ensuring that the continent meets its development and growth goals . <p> In other words , the next investment frontier might not be some new form of technology that creates whole new industries , but ensuring that the continent 's existing businesses and industries become as sustainable as possible .

One initiative , dubbed the KwaDrabo Trust , solves a problem : more than 60% of SA 's cattle stock is in rural areas , with farmers travelling long distances to markets where they can sell them at competitive rates .

The participating farmers receive training in animal husbandry and business matters .

Indeed , if certain activities are phased out and employees can not make the leap , numerous jobs could be in jeopardy . For example , the technical expertise that may be needed for critical renewable energy projects may not necessarily be home-grown . This , of course , serves as a notable barrier to building a climate-resilient future .

In countries rife with unbankable institutions , corruption , weak structures and inadequate policies , it is unlikely that international or even local investors and investment banks will want to invest in initiatives that will actually allow these kinds of transitions to happen . <p> In response to the Treasury 's 2021 technical paper , " Financing a Sustainable Economy " , SA 's green finance taxonomy was launched earlier this month . Based on its European counterpart , the taxonomy provides guidance on an official classification that defines a minimum set of assets , projects and sectors eligible to be defined as " green " , in line with international best practice and national priorities to address climate risk and contributions towards supporting a just transition .

Additional opportunities lie in sectors such as agriculture through the financing of innovative irrigation technologies , shade netting ( which protects crops from harsh weather ) and other sustainable tools and practices . <p> Green bonds are another way to finance renewable energy endeavours .

@@90362230 <h> Mecan T now available as a compact SUV <h> Porsche 's reputation has been built on the 911 model but with the tremendous growth and demand within the SUV segment of the market , Porsche believes that this Mecan T , offering 195kW , will attract new customers to the brand . <p> Following in the footsteps of its two-door predecessors , the new Macan T features an incredibly dynamic set-up paired with a lightweight , two-litre turbo engine , in addition to an athletic design and a range of standard equipment that is ideal for a sporty driving style . This concept positions the Macan T between the Macan and the Macan S. <p> Two-litre turbo for agile response <p> Compared to the 2.9-litre biturbo V6 engine in the Macan S and GTS models , the powertrain in the Macan T weighs 58.8 kg less on the front axle . This gives the vehicle an excellent start-off performance and optimum cornering ability . <p> The Macan T has an output of 195kW and 400Nm of torque -- performance indicators that suit the precise vehicle design and deliver an exhilarating drive . As is generally the case with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fast-switching seven-speed dual clutch transmission ( PDK ) and the Porsche Traction Management ( PTM ) all-wheel drive system . <p> A broad spread of torque provides responsive acceleration in all driving situations .

@@90362234 <p> IT departments , once a relatively small part of any enterprise-scale company , have grown exponentially important over the past few years . Given the expanded role of technology in everything we do , that growth makes sense . But it comes at a cost . According to Gartner , Global IT spend is on track to hit US$4.5-trillion this year , up 5.1% from 2021 . South Africa is n't immune to those spending patterns either . In 2021 , the local market saw 5.2% growth and was valued at US$12.78-billion . <p> That does not , however , mean that IT departments have everything their own way or that they do n't face wide-scale pressures . In 2020 , many companies had to cut costs wherever they could , including in the IT department . While spending in the sector has recovered , the global economic situation remains perilous . With political tensions high in many regions and supply chains still shaky , companies of all sizes may once again be forced to cut costs at short notice . <p> Additionally , some IT departments may fear that low-code and no-code solutions will render some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be organisations that are tempted to take this route , to do so would be a mistake . They would , instead , be better off using such solutions to get previously untapped value out of their IT teams . <p> The power of low-code <p> For those unsure of what low-code means , the term essentially refers to environments that allow people to build applications using graphical user interfaces . These platforms typically use snippets of pre-built code or simple drag and drop interfaces and allow people with little to no programming experience to rapidly build business applications . Low code improves the developer experience by removing repetitive chores that previously required hardcore code changes ; now , certain tasks can be completed with a simple drag and drop . <p> Some of these platforms are stand-alone , while others include low-code capabilities as part of a wider offering . The Liferay Experience Cloud , for example , helps companies create , launch , and optimise digital experiences for their customers , employees , suppliers , and sellers . Alongside its low-code capabilities , it also includes content management @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> For the business as a whole , low-code comes with a number of obvious benefits . Chief among them is the fact that it allows people who understand what customers ( or employees ) actually need in an application , without having to translate those needs to developers . A low-code approach also eliminates some of the most challenging aspects of application development , including creating frameworks and linking databases . <p> A good low-code platform should also allow for greater flexibility . In order to do so , it should support low-code creation of custom sites and content , low-code customisation of users and accounts , and low-code creation of custom business objects . <p> While that may leave some IT departments feeling as if they 'll end up surplus to requirements , that definitely does n't have to be the case . <p> Supercharging IT <p> In fact , many of the things that make low-code so powerful can also be advantageous to IT departments . The fact that applications can be developed faster and with fewer errors than with traditional code , for example , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn , means that they 're able to respond quicker to market changes . <p> And because low-code platforms provide standard components such as forms , report templates , and ready-to-use code snippets , they also mean that the IT department can ensure a much greater degree of uniformity across the organisation 's digital offerings . Cumulatively , the time these changes free up for IT departments means that they have more freedom to explore new digital avenues that the organisation could benefit from . <p> That can only happen , however , if IT departments are given the freedom to be proactive and innovate rather than simply react to problems . <p> Rumours of IT 's demise ... <p> It 's clear then that while low-code may result in lower workloads for the IT department , it does n't necessarily mean that their demise is imminent .

@@90464240 <h> How Alphabet outsmarted Meta <p> The typical technology entrepreneur is a free thinker , a natural innovator and unconstrained , particularly when it comes to running their own business . The downside of a company culture established on this basis , however , is that it does n't always prioritise the sort of corporate governance and business disciplines necessary to achieve best-in-class status . <p> As part of the Stonehage Fleming Global Best Ideas Equity investment philosophy , we look for four fundamental pillars of quality . One of those is high-quality management . This can be understood as a combination of strong entrepreneurship , good governance and business discipline . Entrepreneurship alone , in other words , is not enough . Without the other elements that characterise quality management , a technology company -- however big -- can fall foul of the sorts of risks that accompany any business . <p> Take Facebook and Google , now rebranded as Meta and with a new parent company -- Alphabet -- respectively . On the face of it , they are two companies with a lot in common . Founded within six years of each other -- Google in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the original line-up of tech heavyweights alongside Microsoft and Apple . They are , however , very different from one another . <p> Meta has not prioritised financial management and disciplines in the same way as Alphabet <p> Meta is still run by original founder , Mark Zuckerberg . At Alphabet , while co-founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page remain major shareholders , board members and employees , they both stepped back from executive roles in the business in 2019 . Even in the early days , they were savvy enough to appoint a strong CEO ( and later executive chairman ) in Eric Schmidt , recognising the huge value a chairman brings in steering and governing a business . <p> The effects of these fundamentally different approaches are far-reaching . In 2019 , Alphabet appointed a very strong external chief financial officer in Ruth Porat , previously CFO and executive vice president of Morgan Stanley , with a long career in corporate finance . With her , she brought material financial experience and discipline to a business where the founding entrepreneurs had taken the conscious decision to step @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creativity and ambition unchecked . <h> Dominant style <p> Meta has not prioritised financial management and disciplines in the same way . Indeed , it is difficult to call to mind the name Facebook 's CFO , David Wehner , who moved internally to take the role in 2014 . Since then , investors have not heard a great deal from him . It appears to be a classic example of Mark Zuckerberg 's dominant style and apparent reluctance to grant others any real authority to own the major corporate responsibilities within Meta . It is noticeable that two other prominent appointments -- Sheryl Sandberg and Nick Clegg -- have also gone rather quiet . <p> This dominance is a phenomenon seen elsewhere at Meta . Alphabet has successfully diversified its company into different types of business " drivers " and spread real responsibility around the heads of those various businesses . Meta , on the other hand , is more monocultural in this regard , over-reliant on social media as a source of business . <p> Starting life as the Google search engine , Alphabet went on to develop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Deep Mind ( AI ) and started a cloud business , all the while continuing to work on other diverse entrepreneurial ventures . It even explored smart glasses , autonomous driving and high-altitude broadband technologies via its Loon subsidiary . <p> Meta , in contrast , has stuck relentlessly to the social media sector . Furthermore , when Meta ( then Facebook ) acquired Instagram and WhatsApp , the owners of those businesses were made to " buy into " the Facebook model . It appeared those people did so believing that they would retain overall management responsibility . That did n't happen . In a move directly opposed to what Alphabet has done in devolving real power to different business units , these key executives opted to leave Facebook . The new acquisitions were then fully assimilated into the Facebook model , thus creating a bigger one-sector company , powered by the same social media driver and subject to the same risks . <p> The author , Gerrit Smit <p> Elsewhere , Zuckerberg 's approach has not fully succeeded to put in place other fundamental business controls . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pace with the growth of social media . This has landed them in trouble with regulators on many occasions . Only last month , Meta was fined ? 17-million for breaching EU data privacy laws . The Irish Data Protection Commission Meta 's platforms " failed to have in place appropriate technical and organisational measures " with regard to 12 data protection infringements . These sorts of occurrences affect confidence in the governance of a business both internally and externally . <p> Today , by renaming the company to Meta , Zuckerberg appears to be shifting some of the business 's eggs to a different basket to compensate for the maturing social media at its core . It is still unclear how the metaverse will play out , as there is no real foundation yet for understanding how people will actually use it or how profitable it may be . Microsoft have been working in the space for a long time and may well now apply it profitably in Activision Blizzard should its US$69-billion takeover bid succeed . <p> For Meta , its latest move may be a case of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too late " . Not only has it thrown serious money at the new venture , but it also fuels the perception that social media has become over-competitive , the market having reached maturity .

@@90597230 <h> SA still writing laws for the privileged few -- analysis <p> Cost efficacy in the procurement of goods and services for the state was a much-ignored top requirement under Zuptoid state capture when a host of tender rules were manipulated to siphon trillions . Yet , an overarching 2017 legal amendment upping the threshold of BEE requirements to force all tenders to go only to 100% black-owned companies was struck down by the Constitutional Court after a Sakeliga challenge in mid-February this year . Minor chaos ensued in provincial government departments after a Treasury circular froze all tenders from 15 February onward . Treasury has yet to spill the beans on the full impact of this . This story contends that the Zondo Commission -- its first report far outshone the fourth ( a reprise of nearly all we already know ) -- has brushed over the massive and manipulative role BEE plays in advancing the interests of a select few . Those in power know how to use the rules to punish their opponents and reward their acolytes . Some near-satirical examples follow . Article courtesy of the Daily Friend . -- Chris Bateman <h> Levelling the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> By Anthea Jeffery* <p> Part 4 of the Zondo Commission report into state capture came out last week . It primarily rehashes and reaffirms the story of how Eskom was captured by the Gupta family with the help of former President Jacob Zuma . But , despite the commission 's ever-growing price tag ( R1bn and counting ) , it provides the country with little new information . <p> Anthea Jeffrey <p> Part 1 of the Zondo report , released in January this year , is arguably more instructive in describing many of the mechanisms that have long been used to circumvent the National Treasury 's comprehensive anti-corruption procurement rules . <h> Patterns of abuse <p> As Zondo Part 1 recounts , " patterns of abuse " include the ordering of goods or services that are not in fact required " either because they have already been supplied or ... could be provided in-house " . These ' patterns ' also involve the provision of " premature payment ( before delivery ) " and " payment for work not done at all " . <p> " Deviations from normal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the usual competitive requirements " . This is generally justified by some emergency need , or " where there is supposedly only one supplier available or likely to come forward " . Deviations are supposed to be the exception but are increasingly " the norm " , says Zondo . <p> Other patterns of abuse involve unwarranted " confinements " , where a single supplier is erroneously identified as having unique capacity to provide the ( often complex ) goods or services required . Also common is " parcelling " , where a high-value contract is split into many smaller ones -- all concluded with the same supplier -- so that each tender falls below the threshold at which stricter controls would otherwise come into play . <p> Zondo Part 1 pays some attention to the problem of BEE preferential procurement too . The report acknowledges that " the ideals of empowerment have been grossly manipulated and abused to advance the interests of a few individuals " . By implying this is relatively rare , the report brushes over the magnitude of the BEE procurement malaise and the damage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Different standards for different parties <p> Also ignored by the commission is the key question of how the relevant rules have been so easily circumvented in the context of ANC procurement when they are so strictly applied against the ruling party 's main political rival , the Democratic Alliance ( DA ) . <p> DA federal chairperson Helen Zille provides a telling example from 2018 , when she was premier of the Western Cape . Her office needed to send an official out to probe a local government problem in a distant municipality . He had to stay in the town overnight , so her office chose the cheapest of three quotes and booked him in at Guesthouse A. But when he arrived , Guesthouse A was full -- so he booked himself into nearby Guesthouse B , which happened to be R76.90 more expensive than Guesthouse A. <p> As Zille records , " this automatically triggered a chain reaction that resulted in a full-blown investigation lasting six months " . It also yielded " two reports ( comprising over 70 double-sided pages , with annexures ) that had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officials " . <p> During this investigation , her office had to provide full explanations of why the cheapest quote had not been used , who had approved the change , why supply chain officials had not been informed , and ( a matter clearly beyond the DA 's ken ) " why Guesthouse A was fully booked " , for which supporting documentation was also required . <p> Zille 's point in telling the story is not to decry these spending controls but to illustrate the " forest of rules " the Treasury has developed to counter potential spending abuses . These rules kick in over even very small amounts , where the costs of investigation far outweigh the sums in issue . <p> Yet , ANC cadres have been able to " steal a city " , as ANC insider Crispian Olver writes of corruption in Nelson Mandela Bay . Zupta abuses at Eskom and Transnet alone total close on R60bn , as Zondo reports , and roughly half the state 's R1trn annual procurement budget is tainted by fraud and inflated pricing , as Willie Mathebula , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Zondo at the start of the commission 's work . <p> In Zille 's view , corruption on this massive scale can remain undetected and undeterred only if entire networks of ANC officials are willing to turn a blind eye to it . This indicates that almost everyone within the ruling party is party to the abuse and expects to get away with it . <p> The harm to the majority of black South Africans is enormous , as scarce tax revenues are repeatedly siphoned off for the benefit of deployed cadres and the ANC 's patronage machine . The illicit gain to the ruling party is equally immense , as this unchecked corruption gives the ANC a level of clandestine funding that no political rival can begin to match . <p> The sheer scale of the corruption explains why the Zondo Commission is likely to prove meaningless in practice , why few prosecutions for corruption will succeed , and why the ANC can not in fact be salvaged by President Cyril Ramaphosa 's fictitious ' new dawn ' . <p> It also underscores why a ' wild dog pack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ working together to govern hung municipalities -- must steadfastly focus on bringing down the ANC ' buffalo ' and its EFF ' calf ' and ousting them from power in the 2024 election . <p> In the run-up to that election , the corruption-fuelled patronage machine that gives the ANC such an extraordinarily unfair advantage must also be curtailed . This can be done , in part at least , by bringing BEE procurement back within the relatively narrow bounds of what Section 217 of the Constitution allows . <h> Bringing BEE procurement back within the Constitution 's bounds <p> According to Section 217(1) , all organs of state " contracting for goods or services ... must do so in accordance with a system which is fair , equitable , transparent , competitive , and cost-effective " . This wording is peremptory in requiring cost-effectiveness and competitiveness . <p> Under Section 217(2) , this peremptory obligation " does not prevent " organs of state from " implementing procurement policies " that " provide for categories of preference ... and the advancement of people disadvantaged by unfair discrimination " ( emphasis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not peremptory . It is permissive , at most . In addition , preferences may be implemented only if they ' advance ' the great majority of poor black people , not harm them in the way that corrupt BEE procurement inevitably does . <p> Maintaining cost-effectiveness under Section 217(1) is also more important than BEE preferencing and must always be the over-arching requirement . As Zondo Part 1 correctly concludes , " the primary national interest is best served when the government derives the maximum value-for-money in the procurement process " and " procurement officials should be so advised " . para 532 <p> Next comes Section 217(3) of the Constitution , where the wording is again peremptory . If an organ of state chooses to apply preferences in its procurement policies , as set out in Section 217(2) , then it " must " implement those policies " within a framework " laid down in " national legislation " . <h> The Preferential Procurement Policy Framework Act ( PPPFA ) <p> The national legislation referred to in Section 217(3) is the Preferential Procurement Policy Framework Act ( PPPFA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preferential procurement under which tenders must generally go to the bidder with the highest points , as calculated under a points system . <p> This system gives 80 points for price and 20 for BEE status for tenders below a specified threshold ( currently set at R50m ) . It gives 90 points for price and 10 points for BEE status for tenders above that threshold . <p> Under the principle of subsidiarity , once legislation has been enacted to give effect to a constitutional provision , that statute provides the lens through which the constitutional obligation must be viewed . <p> In the preferential procurement context , the PPPFA ( as the required ' national legislation ' ) sets the parameters for the interpretation of Section 217(2) . The PPPFA is thus binding on all organs of state that choose to provide BEE preferences and its provisions must prevail over all conflicting BEE procurement rules . <p> Since ANC cadres are unlikely to start enforcing Treasury and other rules that curtail corruption , ordinary citizens and their political parties should at least step into the breach with strategic litigation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Conflicting BEE procurement rules -- whether in the BEE generic or sector codes or the pending Employment Equity Amendment Bill ( EEB ) of 2020 -- should also be challenged and struck down . <p> In the procurement context , the EEB seeks to bar companies that fail to meet unrealistic racial targets ( to be set by the minister of employment and labour for all job appointments in different sectors ) from doing business with the state at all . This is contrary to the PPPFA , under which all tenders must be taken into account and weighed according to its BEE points system . Instead , the EEB seeks to impose " pre-qualification criteria " that are inconsistent with the PPPFA and have already ( albeit in a different context ) been struck down by the Constitutional Court as ultra vires the PPPFA . <p> The Zondo Commission is in many ways a distraction being used by the ANC to create the impression that " something is being done " about corruption .

@@90597231 <h> Round One of The R1m Challenge : Piet Viljoen 's ' Local ' is smashing Magnus Heystek 's ' Offshore ' -- but it 's very early days <p> Six months ago , a BizNews community member stumped up R1m to put the local vs offshore argument to the test over a five-year period . Half of it was given to Counterpoint 's Piet Viljoen to invest in his SA-focused Value Fund ; the other half to independent financial adviser Magnus Heystek , founder of Brenthurst . So far , it 's hardly a contest . Viljoen 's R500,000 has grown to almost R600,000 ; Heystek 's is down to around R350,000 . But both caution it 's very early days , Heystek reminds us how Tiger Woods blew out in the first few holes of his first appearance at the Masters , only to regather and cruise home well clear of the competition . In this podcast with BizNews editor Alec Hogg , the money managers share some important lessons they have already learnt from the exercise . <p> The first point is that we are six months into a five-year race . So , we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the other point to make is this is real money . Your BizNews community member has put R500,000 into a fund , which I managed -- the Counterpoint Value Fund -- and R500,000 into a fund that Magnus recommended . This is real money on the line , it 's not a paper portfolio or gameplay . So far , the returns with the African market have been fantastic over the past six months ; they 've actually been very good over a number of years now and our assets remain cheap . The important point to make here is that this is not a bet on the success or lack of our government and implementing its policies or changing its policies to make it more market friendly . It is a bet on the second derivative . Our assets discount a negative future ; more negative than the reality will be because it 's difficult to imagine an optimistic and rosy scenario with our incapable government for the economy and the country . Our assets imagine an even worse scenario than the most likely outcome . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been for quite a while now -- that in any investment portfolio , a portion of it should be allocated to South African assets . Not all of it but at least -- given current pricing and current expectations embedded in asset prices -- a portion should be allocated . That was the genesis of this bet that your community member initiated six months ago . <p> I 'm not left in the starting stalls , I think my saddle has fallen off and I 've got a rebound . I 'm going to chase Piet who is on a winning streak next to none . The one thing I could not control in terms of this challenge was its timing . The BizNews community member came forward in October-November last year and said , here 's R500,000 each , do you want to take up the challenge ? And we both took that up , bearing in mind we were very , very close to the end of a fantastic bull run in offshore markets , S&amp;P 500 , Nasdaq , Fang , etc . I 've sent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For the first months of this little competition , that continued . But then December , January happened . In an investment world , you have to expect the unexpected . Multiple unexpected things have happened . First of all , the sell-off in high-tech stocks ( the megatrend stocks ) ; Fangs was sold off brutally . Secondly , you have the Federal Reserve 's higher interest rate policy starting to affect the larger fund managers . Then you also had the strengthening of the rand . All those things came together at once from all different directions and my portfolio was slaughtered on all fronts . However , it is still alive and I 'm not going to do what a lot of people are inclined to do in these times , wreck emotionally and start selling and panicking . We always tell people to stay in the market for the long term . I 'm not going to break that rule . I will make some adjustments over time and I 've taken my knock . There is no question about it , that 's just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ value style has done exceptionally well . <p> Piet Viljoen on having a diversified investment portfolio <p> On day one , it was invested in the Counterpoint Value Fund , and the results since then have been what the fund has done . I think there is some validity in phasing your money into the market if you 're unsure as to what level you want to buy it . The other point to make is this little race we have between offshore and onshore is also unrealistic . Any investor would run a diversified portfolio , he would n't have everything offshore or everything in South Africa . It 's not a case of either-or ; it 's a case of how much you allocate to different assets . And my argument has always been that in a diversified portfolio , given current valuations , you would allocate slightly more to South Africa . That then is your neutral position . And if your neutral position is nought , then you put a little bit here . You just weigh it slightly in favour of the valuation argument . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe in diversification . I know I ca n't forecast the future . I do n't know what 's going to happen with markets or anything , and therefore I believe in diversification . That 's a sensible strategy for any investor to follow . <p> The difference between Piet and myself is that Piet is a fund manager . He has to deal with money funds in front of him . We are a firm of investment advisers . We deal with people first and foremost , and that is always the starting point as to how much we allocate to any asset class . If we do n't do our homework in terms of risk profile , period in the market and tolerance to risk and sometimes the ability to take risk , we can not do that . There is no question there are some investors who must not be invested in the offshore market and we repeat that endlessly . We say to people : if your situation is of such a nature that you have limited capital , that you have income requirements rather than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ market because it brings in a lot of volatility in the short term if both the rand and the markets go against you as happened in the first quarter of this year . On the other hand , we have many more wealthy investors who have their needs taken care of ; they 've got absolutely no debts and tend to have a much larger exposure , in some cases 100% , some cases 70% . But you can not just make a statement that everything must be offshore or onshore . It depends on the client and a lot of other factors that we must take into consideration . In this case , we went in immediately as we wanted to get the money to work . The first five to six weeks it was doing fine and then we had January ; it was like someone had switched off the lights , the markets just went into a tumble dryer like I 've not seen in 30 years . 
@@90597232 <h> ' Eishkom ' earning its name for 2022 so far -- data analysis <p> If you have a bent for comparative data , this story will serve you best . However , if -- like me -- you get turned off by such things , the most important take-home message from the MyBroadBand piece is that severe load-shedding this year is already twice that of last year . The other take-home is the all-important EAF ( energy availability factor ) of Eskom 's generating fleet for the year so far , stands at 58.64% , compared to 61.79% in 2021 ; these ' degenerated ' stats bode ill with winter demand yet to kick in . If Eskom continues to implement load-shedding , ( as announced ) , until Monday , 9 May 2022 , at 05:00 , it will mean it would have reached 50% of the total days of load-shedding implemented in 2021 , with seven months and three weeks still to go this year . Conclusion ? We 're in for a rough winter and making alternative heat , light and computer ( plus anything else you consider essential ) , power plans is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is coming and it looks bad for South Africa -- load-shedding in 2022 vs 2021 <p> While Eskom has implemented load-shedding on fewer days in 2022 than in 2021 , the number of hours of rotational power cuts has been higher this year . <p> Eskom COO Jan Oberholzer provided the data in response to MyBroadband 's questions during a recent media briefing with updates . <p> Oberholzer said there were 29 days of load-shedding between January 2021 and April 2021 , compared to 25 over the same period in 2022 . <p> According to the CSIR , 2021 was the worst year of load-shedding when looking at the amount of power shed from the grid . There were significantly more days of stage 2 load-shedding last year than 2022 : 27 compared to 17 . However , the most severe stage of load-shedding reached during this period last year was stage 3 , which was implemented only on two days . <p> In 2022 , Eskom has had to implement stage 4 for four days and two days of stage 3 . <p> The table below compares the number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ April in 2021 and 2022 . <p> Popular load-shedding app EskomSePush ( ESP ) also provided its data on load-shedding to MyBroadband . Interestingly , this showed the full days of load-shedding had actually been slightly more this year than in 2021 . ESP co-founder Hermann Maritz said that in the first four months of the year , there had been 19 24-hour cycles of load-shedding in 2022 , compared to 17 in 2021 . At the same point in 2020 , the country had suffered 23 full days of load-shedding . <p> The graph below shows how the full days of load-shedding climbed in 2020 , 2021 and 2022 . <p> With this week 's load-shedding yet to be counted , the 2022 line is expected to pass 2020 in early May . <p> If Eskom continues to implement load-shedding until Monday , 9 May 2022 , at 05:00 , it will add at least another five days . That means Eskom would have reached 50% of the total days of load-shedding it implemented in 2021 , with seven months and three weeks to go in 2022 . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ winter , when electricity demand typically increased . <p> In the previous two years , the country barely had load-shedding during April , while 2022 had eight days . That indicates the system could be in a worse state than it was around the same time last year . <p> Eskom 's weekly system status report is further evidence of this , showing the energy availability factor ( EAF ) of its generating fleet for the year was 58.64% , compared to 61.79% in 2021 . <p> The trend is particularly worrying considering Eskom is heading into a period when it will significantly reduce scheduled maintenance . <p> Eskom uses the summer months with lower demand to take off around 5,000 MW to 7,000 MW of capacity for maintenance . Oberholzer said this has already been reduced to 4,000 MW and will be cut by a further 1,000 MW in the coming weeks . This is to ensure sufficient capacity is available for the winter when the system needs to be prepared for more radical demand fluctuations . <p> Oberholzer acknowledged it was impossible to give an accurate load-shedding outlook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the system 's unreliability . <p> The chart below compares the full days of load-shedding in 2020 , 2021 and 2022 with data provided by EskomSePush. 
@@90597233 <h> Yield curve inversion <p> The bond market tends to be a more reliable barometer of financial market conditions than the equity market . Savvy equity investors look to the bond market for clues . One of the most reliable clues historically is the one given when the yield curve inverts , which typically signals recession . The yield curve charts the different interest rates across the spectrum of Treasury bond maturities . When the curve inverts , long-dated interest rates drop below short-dated rates . Financial markets are anxious as the 2 -- 10-year curve is teetering on the edge of inversion and some observers as a result are predicting the US economy will fall into recession at some point next year . There is normally a lag time of around 12 months . <p> Other analysts are more optimistic . Yield curve signals are not completely reliable . As the saying goes , yield curve inversion has predicted 12 of the last 10 recessions . Perhaps the 2 -- 10-year curve is less reliable that the 1 -- 10-year curve , which is not as close to inverting . The curve which plots the fed funds rate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The fed funds rate is 0.25-0.50% while the 10-year bond yields 3.0% , and so on this measure , a recession is still a long way off . <p> Recessions usually only occur once profit margins have dropped to levels which stop companies from investing and hiring . US profit margins have slipped a little but remain close to record highs . Amid robust demand , pricing power and depleted inventories , companies are unlikely to slow their hiring and investment plans . They are flush with cash after the deleveraging of the 2010s . This does not look like a looming recession . <p> Moreover , the bond market may be sending out false signals . The Fed has just completed its most aggressive quantitative easing programme of all time , dwarfing the asset purchase programmes that followed the 2008/09 Global Financial Crisis . The Fed now owns 30% of all outstanding Treasury debt . The Fed 's purchases of US Treasury bonds have been concentrated at the long end of the maturity spectrum , the end which is in danger of inverting . Studies show that in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yield curve would be 100 basis points wider and therefore nowhere close to inversion . The skewing of the bond market is not unique to the US . The ECB owns an even greater proportion of euro area sovereign bonds , at 40% , and central banks in the UK , Canada and Australia are also around the 30% mark . <p> The debate continues . One concedes that consumers and businesses are flush with cash but what if they decide to sit on their hands rather than spend it ? Admittedly , the unemployment rate is close to historic lows and jobs growth is very strong , but employment has always been a lagging indicator . What is clear is that Inflation has created a headache for the Fed . The Fed can not fight inflation without incurring a cost , and that cost usually involves the loss of jobs and income and the onset of a recession , and ultimately lower equity markets . <p> However , it takes time for recessions to take hold . It is recessions that cause equity markets to drop , not rising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many months , even a year or two before correcting . The precedent that most closely mirrors the current situation is 1978 , when the nominal yield curve inverted but at the same time the real interest rate curve ( after taking inflation into account ) was still sharply positive . The same is true today . The nominal fed funds rate is 0.25-0.50% but in real terms after subtracting the current inflation rate of 7.9% , is deeply negative . So , what happened in 1978 ? Interest rates went up sharply but not enough to cause a recession , probably because real interest rates remained deeply negative , as would be the case today even if the Fed hikes the fed funds rate to 2.5% , as projected . However , in 1980 inflation spiked to nearly 15% . The rest is history , Fed Chairman Paul Volcker hiked the fed funds rate to 20% in June 1981 . <p> The US economy is unlikely to enter recession anytime soon but the current Fed Chairman , Jay Powell will be keen to avoid a repeat of 1980 inflation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a reversal of QE . The scale of Quantitative Tightening ( QT ) at a pace of $1 trillion per year is unprecedented , which may create some stock market volatility even if there is no recession on the horizon . <p> All writers ' opinions are their own and do not constitute investment recommendations or financial advice .

@@90660235 <h> AfriForum wants review of NPA decision not to seize Nova assets <p> AfriForum wants to review the National Prosecuting Authority 's ( NPA 's ) decision not to seize the assets of the Nova Property Group , the rescue vehicle of the failed Sharemax investment scheme . <p> The case goes back nearly two years to June 2020 , when AfriForum first asked the NPA to seize and freeze Nova 's remaining property assets because the civil rights organisation believed the properties were acquired with the proceeds of crime . <p> AfriForum based its assertion on the SA Reserve Bank 's ruling in 2010 that Sharemax 's financing model contravened the Banks Act , and this means the properties were acquired with the proceeds of crime . <p> Sharemax collapsed in 2012 after the Reserve Bank 's ruling , and the properties were transferred to Nova in terms of Section 311 Scheme of Arrangement ( SoA ) , which tasked Nova with repaying investors . <p> However , the NPA responded that it regards the court-sanctioned SoA as legal , and there was no need to seize the assets . The NPA also stated that an independent legal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has now formally asked the NPA for a copy of this legal opinion and will consider it as part of taking a final decision to approach the courts to take the NPA 's decision on review . <p> If AfriForum takes the decision on review , a court will have to decide whether the NPA should seize Nova 's remaining assets and possibly prosecute the former directors and other individuals who may have been involved . <p> Strongly worded letter <p> In a strongly worded letter addressed to Advocate Ouma Rabaji-Rasethaba -- the Deputy National Director of Public Prosecutions and head of the Asset Forfeiture Unit ( AFU ) -- Advocate Gerrie Nel , AfriForum 's Private Prosecutions Unit head , labelled the NPA 's decision " irrational " and to the " further detriment of the victims who have suffered enormous financial losses due to the Sharemax debacle " . <p> " We share the disbelief of most investors that after a decade , the NPA/AFU has not taken any action against Sharemax , " wrote Nel . <p> " Investors are convinced that the NPA/AFU are wilfully reluctant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a simple contravention of the Banks Act . " <p> He also said the NPA is basing its decision not to act on a report drafted by a senior counsel . " We want to see this report because the NPA -- after more than a decade -- has not only failed to prosecute but there has also not been repayment of the initial investment or dividends to the investors . " <p> Nova on the verge of financial collapse <p> However , a lot has changed since the initial correspondence between AfriForum and the NPA in 2020 , and there may be very little for the NPA to seize and preserve . <p> Nova is on the verge of financial collapse . It received an adverse audit opinion for its most recent financial statements for the year to February 2021 , which means the auditors do not believe the information contained in the financial statements is accurate . <p> The auditors also warned ( for a fourth consecutive year ) that Nova only keeps the doors open by selling the underlying properties to fund operational expenses . <p> According @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half of the 31 unencumbered investment properties it inherited from Sharemax , with very little flowing back to investors as the SoA prescribes . <p> Nova 's failure was confirmed on January 20 this year when it did not repay investors in terms of the provisions in the SoA . <p> Nel also raised this in a press statement . " The unit 's insistence on the obtainment of a preservation of property order is further highlighted by the fact that the board of directors of Nova on January 20 ( the debenture repayment deadline ) declined to redeem any debentures . One of the direct consequences of a preservation order is that no trading of properties is allowed until the court has granted a final order that it may be sold or returned to its rightful owners .

@@90660237 <h> Should you invest a lump sum all at once or gradually ? <p> BOITUMELO NTSOKO : Welcome to the Money Savvy podcast . I 'm Boitumelo Ntsoko . When investing a lump sum , should one do so all at once -- or is a gradual strategy better , and which option will yield higher returns ? To shed light on this we are joined by Elke Brink , who is a certified financial planner at PSG Wealth . Welcome , Elke . <p> ELKE BRINK : Thank you for having me , Boitumelo . It 's always nice to be here . <p> ELKE BRINK : I think there are definitely benefits to both . When it comes to investing I think it 's important to always go back to the basics and remember the principle of what you 're trying to achieve once you have exposure to the stock market . The main recipe for success is having time in the market , and the more time the better . It 's factually impossible to try and time the market . <p> So I would always say yes , ' it 's not about trying to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When it comes to investing a lump sum , for example -- of course , if you have a lump sum available -- with whatever you have available to invest , the sooner the better . <p> You can spend more time in the market , and you can possibly benefit from more positive days . <p> Quite an interesting study that has been done : if you look at not only the JSE but also the global market over a 50- or even a 100-year period , there are normally only around 50 really good days , which is actually a little if you think of such a long period of time . Whereas , if you miss some of those good days -- even if you just miss 10 of the best days in a 20-year period -- your outcome looks completely different , which is actually quite interesting . <p> I think we can maybe share one of these graphs with the podcast on the benefit of investing a lump sum . <p> This graph analyses market performance since March 2002 . It illustrates the effect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to missing out on the best five , 10 , 30 and 50 days of market performance , and being invested in cash . Source : Morningstar <p> This graph compares the S&amp;P500 and the JSE since 2000 . Contrary to what many would expect , the JSE has outperformed -- significantly . Source : Morningstar <p> If you have more time , there are definitely benefits . If you do n't have a lump sum available and you want to invest on a monthly basis , I think for the average person this is sometimes the easier thing to do when it comes to cash flow . Maybe you 're earning a salary and you 're investing X percent of the salary every month , so you do n't necessarily have a lump sum available to invest , so this is a great route to follow as well . <p> BOITUMELO NTSOKO : I know some people consider maybe taking out a loan to invest that lump sum . Do you think that 's a good idea ? <p> ELKE BRINK : At certain times in the market it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down to two things , and I think it also answers something that a lot of people often ask : should you prioritise paying off your loan , or should you rather invest ? I think this is always a very relevant question . It comes down to the current interest rate environment , and if we are looking at where we are at the moment and where we have been in the past two years , we see that we 're in an extremely low interest-rate environment and , together with that , we also look at what 's happening in the markets . <p> Now , if it was 2021 -- last year we had exceptional returns in the markets both locally and offshore -- then my advice would definitely have been you 'd rather need to be in the market because your return is outperforming whatever you are paying for your loan or your interest rate by far . So it just makes sense to rather invest this and rather earn the high return . <p> At the moment if you were to ask me this today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ volatile phase , mostly because of the war Russia/Ukraine and a lot of things that are going on economically because of it . So the average return that we are earning at the moment -- which is also a short-term answer maybe because none of us know how long this war is going to go on -- but for the current few weeks , you 're not really earning a very high return . Then I would reconsider it and rather invest funds that I already have available rather than something from my loan . <p> But to answer your question , over a long-term period , when we look at equity exposure or stock market exposure , this will always remain the asset class that gives above-inflation returns -- let 's say 10% , 12%-plus returns . But you need to have a little bit of time on your side . <p> If you have , let 's say , more than five years plus , equity exposure will always be a good thing in your portfolio . But if it 's a shorter-term decision you just need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the best time to lump-sum invest ? <p> ELKE BRINK : I think that 's a difficult thing , because we never really know how to time the market . Ideally , you can read the market a little bit . You do n't want to completely buy in when the market is at an all-time high ; or , depending on if you are also investing locally or offshore ... there may be currency changes you need to take into account or currency timing in terms of maybe the strength of the rand . <p> But overall I would say try not to time the market because you never really know . None of us expected a war to break out just as Covid started to relax . You never really know what 's coming economically in the world . <p> Rather , if you have anything available to invest , invest immediately with the mindset that it 's going to be a longer-term investment . <p> So I think the moment you do start building an investment portfolio you always need to remember this is a bit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have shorter-term investments as well and shorter-term goals . But mostly if you want to benefit from higher returns and equity exposure , you need to commit for longer periods of time . So I think if you anyhow have a lump sum available , I would say invest it and rather benefit from time in the market and time , basically benefitting from the positive returns the market 's going to give . <p> BOITUMELO NTSOKO : When investing offshore how does this situation then change ? <p> ELKE BRINK : I think when investing offshore , if it 's a lump sum , you can time the rand a little bit more . If the rand is , for example , very weak at a moment , you might want to wait until the rand recovers a little or the rand is a little stronger . So there are possibilities that you can time the currency a little bit closer if you want to buy in at a good time . Once again , I think it 's quite difficult , especially with the rand being one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not so easy to time it , but you can definitely , on a day-to-day basis , maybe just wait sometimes until you trade for a more optimal outcome . <p> I think when it comes to monthly investments -- and that 's where the benefit also lies when you 're doing monthly contributions -- should they only be local or should they be global ? <p> This is a way of trying to time the market without physically trying to do it , because you 're now buying into the market on a monthly basis . Some months you may be buying at a high , some months you may be buying at a low . So , over an average period of time , you are trying to time the market on good days and bad days . <p> Sometimes you 're benefitting more because you 're buying in at a low and sometimes you might be benefitting a little bit less because you 're buying at a high . But that 's something you 'll never know with investing . <p> At least with doing the monthly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in terms of this , when it comes to offshore investing , when you 're doing it on a monthly basis , it also comes down to not only the physical assets or equities you 're buying , but also the currency . Let 's say the rand versus the dollar fluctuates quite a bit , at least by investing on a monthly basis you 're going to be averaging out the effects of it , because none of us knows exactly when the rand is strengthening or exactly when it 's going to be weakening , if there are some unknown variables that influence it . So doing it on a monthly basis at least gives you some opportunity to get the timing correct in terms of maybe a stronger rand . <p> BOITUMELO NTSOKO : Would using a combination of both gradual investing and lump-sum investing be a better way to invest ? <p> ELKE BRINK : I think that can be the ideal . I think firstly , with a lump sum coming in , you have the bulk of the investment that 's starting to earn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equity portfolio or your diversified-investment portfolio . So that already makes a big difference in terms of , of course , the effect of compound interest and the return your portfolio can possibly enjoy by getting a bulk of the investment into the portfolio . Then , together with that , now you are adding monthly contributions to this and you get the two benefits of -- let 's say it 's a local investment -- at least trying to time the market a little bit and averaging it out . I think it 's also an easy way of investing , as I mentioned before . <p> In terms of cash flow , in terms of having the real discipline of investing on a monthly basis , I think one mistake a lot of investors make is we just simply wait too long until we start investing , or we wait for some sunny day whereas , if you 'd rather just start early on and you start smaller and you can consistently do that -- rather invest less , but you are able to do it on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much better return than waiting to have a big lump sum and maybe wait five years to be able to invest . <p> I think that is definitely the benefit of whatever you have available to invest , but then also continuing with a disciplined manner on a monthly basis . <p> BOITUMELO NTSOKO : Okay . I do n't know if you 'll be able to answer this , but could you maybe give us an idea of what this kind of strategy -- where you combine both methods -- would look like when constructing an investment portfolio ? <p> ELKE BRINK : Definitely . I think it would depend on what the investor 's current portfolio looks like . Let 's say it 's a completely new portfolio we 're starting to build . I think it 's always important also to remember that the ideal portfolio will always consist of a few different products , because every product has a different role that it plays in your life . So you will , for example , have a retirement type of portfolio . Maybe it 'll be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or a retirement annuity in your personal capacity . Perhaps together we will build in an emergency fund or a shorter-term investment which will be something accessible . <p> Perhaps let 's look at a scenario that normally happens around the end of February or at the end of a tax year , when we do a calculation for each investor . If you have a tax benefit you have n't utilised on your annual tax benefits you can add a lump sum to a retirement annuity , and you can still benefit from this before the end of February , perhaps adding lump sum to your retirement annuity before the end of every February , or a lump sum to your tax-free investment , should you have one . This is also a product that works with the financial year or the tax year that you can optimise before the end of February . <p> A lot of people prefer to just do lump sum into the investment once a year . Then together with that , into the rest of your portfolio , should it be your monthly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ combination , you can save this on a monthly basis , doing a R500 or minimum of R500 , and you can go upwards from there monthly and just consistently remain with that . <p> I think it also depends on what your type of income structure is . Maybe you 're a commission earner , or maybe you earn bonuses and get the bonus at a certain time in the year , and you have this lump sum available you can invest . So I think if there 's anyhow something additional that comes into your income earnings , there 's this lump sum that becomes available that you can rather utilise in a good way . <p> I think it 's important to also try to make a wise decision . If it 's a bonus or an inheritance or a gift or some or other additional funds that do n't form part of your normal income salary , you can always opt to invest this . <h> AUTHOR PROFILE <p> Boitumelo Ntsoko has worked as a sub-editor for Sowetan , The Times and the Sunday Times . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business section , CitiBusiness ( which Moneyweb manages ) and facilitates Moneyweb 's Click-An-Advisor .

@@90732240 <h> OLIVER DICKSON : Ramaphosa has no vision for investors on how to get us out of this hole <p> Throughout SA 's democratic dispensation there has never been a worse time to invest in the country than now , despite what President Cyril Ramaphosa 's overdrive on public relations and vacuous platitudes may have you believe about the flow of investment into the country . <p> This is not me saying this , it is reflected in the Fraser Institute 's Investment Attractiveness Index , where SA is ranked lower than ever before . This should n't come as a surprise to anyone living in the country . The reasons for our poor investability are trite -- unreliable and unstable electricity supply , a completely dysfunctional rail network , a body politic marred by endemic and insidious factionalism and rot within the governing ANC , and a misaligned political economy where our industrial policy framework operates under a different set of economic realities to our fiscal policy framework . This makes for an untenable industrial , regulatory and policy environment . <p> All those require our serious collective attention , but perhaps the most important and pervasive of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we have no clear political and economic vision for the country . An ordinary , engaged and reasonably well-read South African should be able to recite back to you the president 's ( and his executive 's ) political and economic vision and the concomitant action plan . Yet you would be hard-pressed trying to find any three South Africans who can do that for you . Why is quite simple : the ANC and Ramaphosa have run out of ideas on how to get us out of this hole and have no cogent vision . <p> If ordinary , engaged and reasonably well-read South Africans ca n't give you a conceptualisation of Ramaphosa 's political and economic vision and its concomitant action plan , then do not expect potential investors to be able to do that either . And therein lies the crux of our investibility problem . We will only be able to truly align the institutions that drive our economy and the policies to frame our economic trajectory if we have a vision along which to align . There is not a single positive adjective available @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we can positively describe our economy and polity . <p> Investors remain sceptical of SA five years after the disastrous Zuma era because they 're still not sure what they would be investing in . Ramaphosa 's positive signalling language no longer has the intended effect -- New Dawn , New Deal , Open For Business , Unity , Change , Progress . It has become clear that none of those platitudes are rooted in reality . Quite the opposite , in fact . As mining companies and investors meet in Cape Town this week , it is apparent that the country 's electricity supply is more unstable and less reliable than it was the last time they met . Transnet is far more dysfunctional today than it was five years ago and unemployment is undeniably worse today than it was five years ago . <p> So , what are investors to do when they look to SA ? They see a country with no clear realistic political or economic goals and no trackable plan attached to a vision .

Engage with the president and his administration knowing that what you ask of them is highly likely not to materialise and that you would have to make it happen despite them . <p> More importantly -- and this is the difficult part -- start imagining an SA post the ANC . It is poor economics to hitch your investment wagon to the future of the party . It lost nearly five percentage points of its electoral share in the past general elections , and it is not far-fetched to believe it will lose the same proportion or more in 2024 , making room for a coalition government as the next administration . If you consider the past local government elections as an indicator of the ANC 's likely performance ( 45.5% of the vote ) we will certainly have a coalition government in 2024 . <p> This will have a tremendous impact on political and economic institutions , the policy landscape , the regulatory landscape and the overall political and economic alignment .

Picture : FINANCIAL MAIL <p> SA government bond yields are abnormally high relative to our country 's economic growth potential . The yield-to-maturity on very long-dated bonds , about 11% at the time of writing , exceeds the IMF 's forecasts of nominal GDP growth by a hefty five percentage points . <p> Sometimes discrepancies such as these can present an opportunity to bond investors , as international market experience suggests wide differences between interest rates and growth do not typically persist indefinitely . <p> If the SA Reserve Bank 's relatively conservative inflation targeting regime remains intact over the long term , the spread between nominal yields and inflation expectations may narrow through lower interest rates , and bondholders would earn both a high real income and a significant capital gain . This remains the core investment case for SA 's nominal government bonds , as set out by several local @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yields , which in effect represent the cost of government debt , can also present a threat to investment and real economic conditions . When a government 's debt cost exceeds economic growth policymakers must , by definition , run a primary budget surplus to avoid explosive debt dynamics . <p> In fact , the longer the discrepancy between bond yields and nominal GDP growth persists unfunded the more debt accumulates on government 's balance sheet , and the more difficult it becomes to stabilise the public debt trajectory . Eventually something must break , as the pace of debt accumulation can not accelerate indefinitely . <p> Urgent change is required if SA is to avoid this kind of fiscal death spiral . In practice there are only three ways to stabilise an otherwise explosive public debt trajectory . <p> The first option , politically difficult , is to practise fiscal austerity . In SA 's case we estimate that a primary budget surplus equivalent to 2%-3% of GDP would be needed within the next five years to achieve the necessary stability in debt dynamics ( if prevailing conditions endure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The IMF , for example , expects the primary budget balance to remain in deficit for the foreseeable future , just breaking even by 2027 . <p> Graphic : KAREN MOOLMAN <p> The last time SA achieved a primary surplus at the general government level was in 2008 , immediately before the Great Recession . Today we doubt whether personal or corporate income tax rates could be increased much further without a neutralising response from taxpayers . SA may be at or beyond the Laffer Curve 's turning point , where increases in marginal tax rates perversely result in a lower tax intake . <p> On the expenditure front , the necessary austerity appears even less constructive . Inefficiency of expenditure lies at the heart of so much that has failed in SA 's public sector . However , assuming no imminent improvement in the scale of government waste , wage costs ( at about 10% of GDP ) appear to be the only practical target in pursuit of a sustainable expenditure path . <p> Unfortunately , the level of austerity required to stabilise debt implies hundreds of thousands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ undermining GDP growth potential even further , as SA 's private labour market is probably not efficient enough to absorb an influx of unemployed people at the necessary scale . <p> In fact , we have argued that the Treasury 's optimal fiscal strategy may ironically imply wider budget deficits in the near term , principally through the aggressive subsidisation of local capital expenditure . We believe SA 's growth potential is predominantly capital-constrained , and that widespread and generous depreciation allowances would produce a J-curve effect in government 's corporate revenue collection as short-term tax breaks are offset by greater private investment in the local economy . Structural changes such as these , which may produce higher real GDP growth outcomes over time , are the second , preferable option in stabilising the government debt-to-GDP ratio . <p> Failing an immediate improvement in growth conditions , and accepting that fiscal austerity is fraught with challenges , the only remaining way to stabilise the debt trajectory in the near term is to reduce the cost of debt . In this respect the Treasury should buy itself time by shortening the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curve is at an historically steep gradient , and short-dated bonds trade at considerably lower yields than their long-dated counterparts . <p> Though the strategy of regularly issuing long-dated debt has reduced government 's liquidity risks historically , we believe that under current conditions the Treasury should show more sensitivity to its cost of capital . At best , this can only be a short-term strategy as liquidity risks would eventually re-emerge and ultimately reach intolerable levels . <p> However , in the interim period a sensible reduction in the issuance of long-dated bonds would temporarily starve the market of these instruments , reduce running interest costs in government 's annual budget , and create some budgetary breathing room for the actual implementation of growth-boosting reforms . <p> None of the measures that are required to stabilise the debt trajectory ( a primary budget surplus , higher nominal GDP growth , or a lower cost of debt ) are inevitable . As patience with socioeconomic conditions wears thin and better growth outcomes take time to materialise , the risk remains that higher nominal GDP growth is pursued through the politically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will remain on an explosive government debt path . <p> The implications of this outcome would eventually extend far beyond the investment community as the balancing equation of debt dynamics would likely be resolved through a structural depreciation in the currency . The discrepancy between local bond yields and nominal GDP growth would then close due to higher inflation , and ordinary South Africans would suffer . <p> Nevertheless , as alarming as the downside scenario appears , the debt-stability equation is equally sensitive to small improvements in local variables , which will tend to reinforce each other . If capital constraints ease moderately , whether through the slow recovery of Eskom , elevated commodity prices or through greater private sector confidence , it is not implausible that SA 's economy grows at a nominal rate of more than 6% a year ( given the current level of GDP per capita ) . The cost of debt may decline in this slightly more favourable growth scenario , and the primary budget balance may come in slightly better than current baseline projections . <p> If all three variables improve moderately , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comfortable level over the next decade .

They can remain at Ninety One but switch into a portfolio of cheaper funds if cost mitigation is the sole objective . We drew a quote from Ninety One comprising a portfolio of passive ( index-tracking ) funds . The cost for investment management came in at 0.55% including VAT .

The challenge increases significantly when choosing offshore indices to track . <p> Second , the investor is taking on the key challenge of asset allocation , which is the ultimate driver of return over the long term .

And ANC treasurer general Paul Mashatile , who has been dubbed the kingmaker in certain sections of the ANC , is said to have divided the Eastern Cape in the hope that its conference this past weekend would have had a favourable outcome for his own ambitions to take the deputy president post . <p> A regional leader and known lobbyist for Mabuyane , who did not wish to be named , said ANC president Cyril Ramaphosa was not opposed to the idea of Mabuyane becoming deputy president when the proposal was put to him . <p> Regional leaders aligned with Mabuyane met Ramaphosa in April to discuss the future of the province . <p> According to the regional leader , Ramaphosa said the makeup of the top six in the party should have an idea of the challenges in rural and urban areas in the country . <p> " Someone like Mabuyane fits into this . Mabuyane is qualified as an economist . How passionate he is about the economic setup makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that space full-time . Also , people want to see themselves in their leaders . If the ANC is now being forced to rely more on provinces like the Eastern Cape to save them in the elections , you have to give them a face they can relate to , " said the regional leader . <p> " Oscar represents that in my view . The president spoke to us for over 30 minutes about his plans to develop the economy of the Eastern Cape . This tells you that the focus in future will be on the Eastern Cape , which means that there is no other way but to bring someone from the Eastern Cape to the table . " <p> But it is understood that those in the president 's camp are yet to make up their mind about who will join Ramaphosa in the top six . <p> The regional leader said they will first concentrate their efforts on consolidating the province behind Mabuyane before they start consolidating support in other provinces . <p> " We must first build an infrastructure that can help us move @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have and then build . We already have regions with a view of other provinces . What we do n't want is for the Eastern Cape to be isolated from the debate . However , it can not be the Eastern Cape leading the pack ; it must be regions , because ultimately we have to look at the numbers of regions . The conference is about numbers in as much as it is about content . " <p> Another provincial leader and ally of Mabuyane said that relations were already solidified in some of the provinces : one region in Mpumalanga , two in Limpopo , one in KwaZulu-Natal and two in the Western Cape . <p> The Eastern Cape conference highlighted the divisions in the province . Mabuyane won with only 150 votes between him and the other contender , Babalo Madikizela . <p> The result may mean that whoever Ramaphosa wants to see rising in the party as his deputy and secretary general will have a much tougher battle without the Eastern Cape 's full support in the lead-up to the December conference . <p> Those behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ party 's provincial elections in 2017 when -- even after a violent conference -- those who emerged victorious were able to unite the province behind Ramaphosa in a matter of three months . <p> A senior leader in the Mabuyane faction told the M&amp;G previously that if it was possible to unite the province within that time frame , they were confident the same could be done in the six months to December . <p> " It 's a fact that you need someone who understands the rural set-up of the country and the isolation of the rural province to integrate them into the main economic hub . That is an issue that will be interesting . All that we are saying in the province will be a futile exercise if there is no national stability and focus . We are holding the fort in certain provinces but national ; we are going down , that is almost collapsing all of us while we are holding this fort , the roof is falling on top of us , " the senior leader said . <p> Speaking to the media on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said the province had been isolated nationally in terms of economic development . <p> " We are an untapped potential , we need leadership , we need vision . We need visionaries . If you just elect people for the sake of electing them , it 's a problem , " he said . <p> Mabuyane added that there was political will to see that projects in the province were implemented to help improve the lives of people in the Eastern Cape province . <p> Mabuyane 's political report has been considered a hint of his willingness to make himself available in the national debate . <p> In his report , he said the ANC has accepted that among its weaknesses is an inward-looking tendency and social distance from its core constituency . <p> " The leadership required is that which will appeal to and connect the broader progressive forces within society as the strength of the ANC is in its ability to be a leader of the broader front which has the ability to mobilise and lead the whole oppressed . " <p> Mabuyane 's modus operandi can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Gwede Mantashe , whose relationship with those left of the party and the labour movement catapulted his rise from chairperson of the South African Communist Party ( SACP ) to the ANC secretariat and now ANC national chairperson . <p> Mabuyane 's relationship with the SACP and labour federation Cosatu has remained intact despite growing tensions between the ANC 's alliance partners and the ANC in other provinces . <p> His relationship with the alliance was pronounced when the SACP 's Eastern Cape chairperson , Xolile Nqatha , SACP leader Mncedisi Nontsele and Cosatu provincial secretary Xolani Malamlela led the call for a united slate . <p> Only Mabuyane gave them an audience during a meeting last week but regional leaders from his camp refused to listen . <p> A relationship with the alliance could bolster his ambitions for a top-six position . <p> The Free State high court ruled that the provisional restraint order will remain in place until late October , when argument will be heard for it to be made indefinite , dismissing Oakbay 's application for a postponement

@@90782237 <h> Beyond Fear review : What does it take to become a revolutionary ? <p> We are living in a time of great narcissism . From attention-seeking politicians and celebrities , to digital oversharing on social media , this inflated sense of self -- and the individualism that underpins it -- has contributed to some of the greatest challenges of our times : the destruction of our planet , inequalities and divisions , and the decline of communities and communal ideologies . <p> Ebrahim Ebrahim 's memoir , Beyond Fear : Reflections of a Freedom Fighter , is a powerful antidote to any feelings of despair . Ebrahim , or Ebie as he was known , reminds us that there are other ways to live our lives , in the service of ideas and ideals . <p> Beyond Fear provides a gripping yet poignant personal account of many of the events and ideas during South Africa 's struggle for freedom . Through his role in the ANC 's sabotage campaigns of the 1960s and his imprisonment on Robben Island in 1963 , we gain an intimate insight into the early days of the struggle . After his release from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ANC 's Political Military Committee in Swaziland . <p> The power of the book lies in its vivid account of the inner life of someone who shaped the struggle for freedom , democracy and justice in South Africa . Even when dealing with questions of life and death , courage and betrayal , the book evokes warmth and humour . Some of the most seemingly innocuous observations turn out to be the most revealing . The book succeeds in conveying humanity at its best and at its worst . Ebie has written an honest , intensely human book . <p> At its core , the book offers an additional valuable perspective for those who are already familiar with South Africa 's struggle history . For people who are less familiar with SA 's history , the book is an excellent introduction because it provides an accessible and engaging narrative of the evolution of the ANC . <p> Three aspects of this narrative are particularly striking . <p> Ebrahim and his wife Shannon <p> First , the book illustrates the stark contrast between the early days of the sabotage campaigns in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ANC later . After the South African government declared a State of Emergency in 1960 , Ebie recounts discussions amongst comrades about the use of violence and recruitment . None of them had any training in bomb-making or the handling of explosives . Ebie 's earliest acts of sabotage are remarkably amateurish , as he describes the haphazard handling of dynamite and the use of chilli powder to ward off police dogs . When he is released from jail in 1979 , the movement is much more organised and professionalised . In Angola , he was taught to handle bazookas and AK-47s , and he notes that ' this was a far cry from my early days as a saboteur ' . <p> Second , the book highlights the importance of social bonds and social networks in shaping the struggle . Beyond Fear vividly highlights the importance of solidarity and personal connections . Early on , he remarks that ' my comrades were like family ' . Ebie describes the social relations on Robben Island , the attempt by the authorities to divide , but the intuitive resistance on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life on the island involved camaraderie and friendship , and the book describes lighter moments such as catching and eating crayfish or saving penguins from oil slicks . <p> Finally , this memoir reminds us that ideas were at the heart of the struggle . Ebie and his comrades discussed how to oppose apartheid and its unjust laws , but also what kind of society might replace Apartheid SA . In the Defiance Campaign in the early 1950s , Ebie attended political classes to learn about colonial exploitation and common struggles . When he was in jail the first time , he describes political discussions with the other prisoners , on topics including the trade union movement and Stalin 's 1913 text ' Marxism and the National Question ' . These discussions would be held in the evenings , with the prisoners putting their mouth or their ear to the small peephole in their doors , depending on whether they were talking or listening . Some of the most interesting parts of the book describe the political education at the ' University of Robben Island ' . There were lectures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ followed by discussions among the prisoners at lunch time when working in the prison quarry , or in prison cells . Materials were sometimes smuggled into the prison , and eagerly read and discussed . Indeed , a common theme throughout the entire book is the constant dialogue and debate about political ideas and ideologies . Ultimately , Ebie 's own position on socialism and how and when this might be achieved is left unresolved . " I have grappled with this my whole life , " he says . <p> Ebrahim and his son Kadin in 2010 <p> And finally , Beyond Fear covers Ebie 's life in post-apartheid South Africa , his role as Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs , his involvement in conflict resolution initiatives around the world , and his enjoyment of a family life with his loving wife Shannon , his two young children Sarah and Kadin , and his elder daughter Cassia . The ability to enjoy ordinary moments of life is conveyed as an immense gift . Despite his diagnosis of lung cancer and his death at the age of 84 in December @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later years . <p> In his statement to court in 1987 he said , " There are countless others like us who are prepared to sacrifice their very lives to achieve the noble goal of the emancipation of our country . We shall achieve victory soon ! " <p> Ebie 's unwavering commitment , his optimism and spirit will undoubtedly inspire a new generation of revolutionaries . Against the backdrop of today 's political and social climate , Beyond Fear restores faith in South Africa 's potential , and indeed the possibilities for a better world . It is a powerful reminder that our lives gain meaning when we believe in something bigger than ourselves . <p> Devon E A Curtis is an Associate Professor in Politics and International Studies at the University of Cambridge .

" It is difficult to get e-subscription support for the media in Africa , due to lack of resources . " <p> One possible remedy is " sustainable journalism " , which complements solutions journalism ; it reports on sustainable environmental issues , among others , and this links to audience concerns . It is a useful prism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to become sustainable itself . <p> " In order to reclaim African journalism , we have to continue to reinvent it , " said Berger . For example , some media platforms are using WhatsApp to distribute news , but the issue is how to derive income from it , for example by getting people to sign up , which will give them access to special content , or to certain events ; or perhaps they could get sponsored content . <p> Taryn Isaacs De Vega , Rhodes University Lecturer , who moderated the webinar , asked Lydia Nambiru , Journalist and News Editor at The Continent ( a weekly online publication in PDF format ) the question : " What is African journalism , and when is it in the public interest ? " She answered by saying that it very often depends on the moment or context , what the issues are and what the solutions are to particular communities . To reclaim it in the public interest would mean investing in and supporting African newsrooms and employing more journalists , especially women , and journalists who have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compete with the market and social media , so they often focus on producing " fast journalism " , but producing content that pays does n't always serve the public interest . The Continent 's team of nine decided to " slow down " , because they realised that they had lost the competition with social media for breaking news . Their focus is instead on making sense of the madness , and providing fact-based journalism on the big stories of the week , as well as the stuff that did n't go viral on social media . " We have built up a community of 17 000 readers ; now we just have to monetise it , " she said . <p> Kavita Chandran <p> Jovial Rantao , Chairperson of the African Editors Forum , said journalism right now is under siege : Covid-19 financial restrictions have led to smaller newsrooms , lower revenues and circulation , and many publications have closed . The pandemic was also used as an excuse by conservative governments to crack down on the media and impose laws that restrict the free press . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does propaganda and the flood of fake news on social media . <p> Journalists are under attack from certain governments -- 14 journalists were recently arrested in Somalia . Women journalists face many obstacles , such as sexual and online harrasment , rape and even murder . The platform that was launched for the safety of African journalists in 2021 is working really well , as journalists face threats to their lives on a daily basis . We must not forget these brave men and women , said Rantao ; the Zondo commission , for instance , was launched largely on the basis of reports from excellent journalists . It is crucial that African journalists keep writing reports that are ethical and fact checked , so that people can use this information without thinking twice about it . <p> " For the generation of 2022 the survival of the media requires working with partners and stakeholders in the media industry . We must continue to provide information for the public good , without imposing a financial burden on them . We must find new ways to keep our media viable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to African problems , through , for instance , holding discussions such as this webinar . <p> " It can not be business and usual ; we must find new ways to address our problems , which are practical and implementable . African media is being called upon to change its business model , so that it can survive and the African story can be told , " said Rantao . <p> Kavita Chandran , Journalist and Media Trainer at the Thomson Reuters Foundation , said that " solutions journalism " has become important in an era of " news fatigue " -- many people feel helpless and do n't know how to respond to the news , so they avoid reading or listening to it . There is an erosion of public trust in both politicians and the news media . Chandran said that this is because traditionally journalists were taught to cover " issues " ( if it bleeds it leads ) and expose wrongdoing , but this results in a lot of people not reading the news at all . <p> Taryn Isaacs De Vega <p> Solutions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is not " sunshine journalism " ) , provides evidence of how results were produced , spotlights adaptive responses , how they work , and what can be learned from the efforts of others . It produces insights and discusses the limitations of approaches . For example , Guardian Columnist Afua Hirsch wrote a story about why African Covid-19 success stories are being overlooked , to counteract the widespread perception that Africa only produces " negative " news . <p> Rantao said the African Editors Forum is working on helping the media in Africa to remain viable : " You need to be able to pay journalists , and you also need to retrain them so that they write for African audiences . For instance , many of the world 's fastest-growing economies are here in Africa , so we need to tell the story of the people behind this . The forum is working on the idea of an African media diversity fund , to keep African media afloat ; and perhaps we need some big investors to train journalists to become entrepreneurs . " <p> This idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Africans should demand a special fund for digital transformation and digital start-ups in media . " Such funds would have to be independent and transparent , so that they do n't get abused , " he added . <p> Chandran said that to stay abreast of new trends , journalists have to ask : " What does the younger generation want , and how do you understand that ? What is their understanding of authenticity , and how can you upskill to address that ? " Newspapers also have to go local , and explain things better , so that people can relate , for viable and sustainable journalism . <p> Zubeida Jaffer , who serves on the 50th Anniversary Committee of the JMS School , said that African journalists need to work together to solve their problems . " On our own we are fractured and wo n't be effective . We are hoping to use the 50th anniversary of Rhodes journalism as a way to create a network , to keep having these kinds of discussions and find our way forward .

@@90782240 <h> Ramaphosa talks collaboration , innovation and a just energy transition <p> The local mining industry is thriving , but infrastructure needs to be improved and changes need to be made for the sector to reach its true potential . This was the message from President Cyril Ramaphosa , who addressed attendees on the second morning of the Investing in African Mining Indaba 2022 , taking place at the Cape Town International Convention Centre ( CTICC ) this week . <p> Ramaphosa highlighted that the event is taking place at an important time in the globe 's recovery from the impact of Covid-19 . " Across the world , most industries have had to adapt to new circumstances , confront new challenges and also prepare to seize new opportunities , " he said . <p> The mining sector in Africa is no exception . Couple this with the benefits and potential risks of rapid technological change , shifts in demand , stresses caused by climate change , as well as massive geopolitical uncertainty , and the industry has a fair amount of work to do to develop and grow . <p> Unpacking how the industry is doing right now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 11% in 2021 , recovering to pre-pandemic levels and marking the most significant growth of all industries across the economy . Despite this positive shift , he reiterated that the industry faces several real challenges . " South Africa needs to move with greater purpose to remove the various barriers , impediments , hurdles and constraints that are preventing the growth and development of the industry . " <p> According to Ramaphosa , this entails eliminating different regulatory and administrative problems , clearing the backlog of mining and prospecting rights and putting more modern and efficient exploration strategies in place . In addition , he acknowledged the need to improve the functioning of South Africa 's rail network and ports , neither of which are performing at the levels they need to enable the industry and drive economic prosperity . <p> Confronting the energy insecurity realities that face the mining industry and the economy , Ramaphosa further discussed the critical importance of regulatory and policy reform . This reform must facilitate new electricity generation opportunities , which will enable the mining sector and others to better do the work they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the threshold for energy generation , which allows companies to produce their own electricity up to 100MW without needing to apply for a licence . Government is also working to further cut red tape to speed up the process of registering electricity generation projects and securing environmental approval for these efforts . <p> Diversifying the country 's energy mix demands that the government puts legislation in place to support renewables , minimise the effects of climate change and boost investment in sustainable energy supplies such as wind and solar , he said . In this forward march towards a low carbon future , the president stressed that the country 's efforts have to be both realistic , sustainable and do n't leave anyone behind . " As our reliance on coal reduces over time , it is critical that we create pathways towards new economic activity for affected workers , communities and industries . " <p> South Africa 's energy landscape is being transformed to encourage greater competition and to introduce more diverse energy sources into the future , he outlined , noting that the unbundling of Eskom into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year . He said that government is committed to providing the resources and incentives the industry needs to promote a new wave of exploration , particularly relating to the minerals required to enable the global energy transition . <p> " South Africa plans to focus on future strategic metals like copper , nickel and cobalt . And , as a global leader in platinum group metals , South Africa is perfectly positioned to take advantage of the massive growth in demand for these resources . " The country can also play a key role in the hydrogen economy , and there are plans for it to be an important hub for the production and export of green hydrogen . <p> But this does n't mean that the mining industry should simply say goodbye to many of the minerals that have been the sector 's bread and butter for decades , he cautioned , stressing that the continent should rather protect and preserve its valuable natural resources . " As a continent with such a rich abundance of mineral resources , Africa needs to beneficiate its mineral endowments for the benefit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a shared responsibility as government , as mining companies , as labour and as mining communities to do everything we can to realise the opportunities that lie before us , he said . " I like to describe mining as a continuous sunrise sector in our economy . And , going forward , we only expect mining 's contribution to our economy to grow . " <p> He concluded : " I firmly believe that the future of mining on the African continent holds great promise . Promise for investment , for industrial development and for profit , for our people and our economies .

Back after two years , the 2022 event has been described as a reunion like no other in which industry insiders , shareholders , investors , businesspeople and political figures can come together to promote innovation across the industry and facilitate greater investment in the sector . <p> Gwede Mantashe , Minister of Mineral Resources and Energy , stressed that South Africa must beneficiate its raw materials to create jobs . <p> Welcoming delegates to the Mother City and to the event taking place at the Cape Town International Convention Centre this week , Geordin Hill-Lewis , Executive Mayor of the City of Cape Town , noted that while we have had a particularly difficult two years due to the pandemic , we have also experienced a major boom in mining and commodities . " Around the world , people are talking about the commodity boom , which has pumped up the prices of all of the things that the people in this room sell . This holds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ growth , Hill-Lewis highlighted that South Africa should be optimistic , but cautiously so . His call for hesitation is due to what he termed " state failure " , which is causing various structural constraints to economic growth and prevents the local economy from making the most of our rich mineral resources today and into the future . <p> That being said , he highlighted that some real progress is being made . Transnet seeking private partners to better enable the country 's freight and rail infrastructure , the raising of the licensing threshold for energy generation and the acknowledgement of the private sector as a key player in driving growth and jobs were all outlined by Hill-Lewis as steps in the right direction . <p> Sharing this sentiment , many of the speakers on day one noted that there are many challenges , but stressed that progress has been made and must continue being made if the industry is to grow , evolve and have a positive impact on society going forward . " The mining industry has come a long way since diamonds were first discovered here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Advisory Board for Investing in African Mining Indaba noted . " And the sector 's evolution has shaped , and continues to shape , our political and economic landscape . " <p> Geordin Hill-Lewis , Executive Mayor of the City of Cape Town , says we should be ' cautiously optimistic ' about the mineral sector 's growth <p> Also speaking on the opening morning of the event , Gwede Mantashe , Minister of Mineral Resources and Energy for the Republic of South Africa , noted that this year 's conference is taking place during an interesting time for the global economy . Given the commodities boom , the Russia-Ukraine conflict and the lingering impact of the pandemic , it is imperative that Africa keeps her mineral resources here . " If we export our raw commodities , we are exporting jobs , " he said . " And we are losing tax money . " <p> Last year , the mining industry paid around R92-billion rand in taxes and royalties out of a total of about R130-billion that was collected by the fiscus in South Africa , said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ South Africa and President of the Minerals Council South Africa . But beyond the numbers , she believes that this kind of event provides the perfect platform for the sector to ask how they show up as mining leaders , how they can engage with society and stakeholders and how they can tell the industry 's story ; acknowledging that this story is both a negative and a positive one . <p> Regarding the future impact of mining businesses , Fakude highlighted that it is imperative that the industry looks to ensure that mining is meaningful for all stakeholders today , tomorrow and for years to come . " We need to ask what are some of the big things we as an industry should be thinking about as we rebuild , reboot , recover and reclaim the position of mining in society . " -- Joanne Carew <p> -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- <h> The role of mining in enabling a new and inclusive economy <p> In Africa , every job created in the mining industry creates at least six other jobs . This is one of the highest ratios in the world , and the impact of this is most felt in the developing world . <p> But the mining industry can only have a positive impact when all stakeholders and communities are brought along for the ride . This was the overarching sentiment across a range of presentations , which unpacked how the industry can play a role in enabling a more inclusive economy . <p> Panel discussion , featuring from left to right : Rohitesh Dhawan , CEO of the International Council on Mining and Metals ; Nolitha Fakude , Chair of the Board at Anglo American SA ; and Chris Griffith , CEO at Gold Fields <p> When developed in a considered way , with the right policies and partnerships in place , mining holds incredible potential , noted Mark Bristow , Chief Executive Officer of Barrick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that serves local communities and economies , it promotes infrastructure development and it contributes to local and national economic growth , he said . <p> " Africa has two enormous assets -- its unparalleled mineral endowment and the relative youth of its population . To fully utilise and develop these assets requires a commitment between the private sector and government to foster sustainable partnerships that create a more sustainable industry , " said Bristow . This is key to ensuring that the industry contributes towards social and economic development . <p> Rohitesh Dhawan , Chief Executive Officer of the International Council on Mining and Metals ( ICMM ) , an international organisation dedicated to a safe , fair and sustainable mining and metals industry , chaired a panel discussion on the opening afternoon of the event . He noted that assessing the sector 's contribution to social and economic development means looking beyond what mining companies say they 'll do and looking at real , tangible outcomes . <p> But how does one measure impact and outcomes ? Chris Griffith , Chief Executive Officer at Gold Fields , believes that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ establishing standardised definitions around what amounts to impact , and ensuring that these are understood by all businesses across the sector . Likewise , any actions that mining companies undertake to contribute towards social development need to be made visible so that communities can see the results of the industry 's efforts and , additionally , hold firms accountable should they not live up to their promises . <p> Speaking about the industry 's impact , Griffith noted that the mining industry creates a massive amount of employment , it contributes an enormous amount in taxes and , working in partnership with government , the industry makes a significant contribution to the development of critical services in the communities where our mines operate . " I truly believe that we do a lot . But we do n't do any of it alone , " he asserted . <p> Having an impact means that in any changes we make and work we do , we need to take key stakeholders with us and include beneficiaries in our efforts , explained Nolitha Fakude , Chair of the Board at Anglo American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ multiplier industry if we are deliberate about promoting businesses in industries and sectors that support and contribute towards the work we do , she continued . This means enabling entrepreneurs , start-ups and small businesses that work along the industry 's value chain . <p> Duncan Wanblad , Chief Executive at Anglo American Group , shared this sentiment . According to Wanblad , creating an inclusive economy demands that the mining industry place people at the centre of everything it does . " When I look at this particular moment , never before has there been such an obvious and urgent demand for what we do . The metals and minerals that we mine are instrumental in spurring every aspect of modern human progress . " <p> If there are any instances when the industry is unsure of its impact , the best thing we can do is ask , explained Griffith . To ensure that the mining sector has a positive impact on the communities they work in , Griffith highlighted the value of surveying stakeholders to get a better sense of where they feel the industry is succeeding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the industry to report on the findings of these surveys and then use these insights to drive change . <p> " By transforming ourselves , we are laying the foundations for a new economy , " concluded Wanblad . It will be an economy that is more inclusive , more sustainable and one that opens up a wealth of new opportunities to those who need it most . -- Joanne Carew <p> -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- <h> Anglo American debuts world 's largest hydrogen-powered truck <p> Last Friday , Anglo American made news headlines when they debuted their prototype hydrogen-powered mine haul truck , the largest of its kind in the world . Designed to operate in traditional mining environments , the vehicle was launched at the mining giant 's Mogalakwena @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ design and build ; is capable of carrying a 290-tonne load ; is powered by hydrogen fuel cells and lithium batteries ; emits zero carbon emissions and generates more power than the diesel-powered vehicles it is intended to eventually replace . <p> Natascha Viljoen , CEO at Anglo American Platinum <p> This ground-breaking green vehicle was regularly referenced at the Investing in African Mining Indaba , taking place in Cape Town this week , as a prime example of how the industry can transform its operations and of the change that it needs to make to minimise the impact on the environment and solidify its sustainability commitments . The project forms part of the company 's FutureSmart Mining programme , which aims to leverage digital technologies to promote more sustainable outcomes . <p> Speaking about this highly innovative truck at the Mining Indaba , Anglo American Platinum Chief Executive Officer , Natascha Viljoen , noted that the project marks a step in the right direction for the industry . " If you consider the costs around developing this truck , the numbers are eye-watering . But , if you consider @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decarbonisation point of view , it makes total sense for us to make an investment like this . " <p> Even President Cyril Ramaphosa , who attended the launch of the vehicle last week , was impressed by the innovation , highlighting it in his Mining Indaba address . " It is just amazing to see the innovation that the mining industry is capable of , " he said , joking that he was so inspired by the vehicle that he 'd be happy to take up a role working with Anglo American on this incredible and innovative hydrogen-powered truck when he eventually gets fired from his current role . -- Joanne Carew <p> -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- <h> The future of work : Digital skills in a physical industry <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they desperately need skills to enable and facilitate this transition . <p> When we think about the future of work in this industry , we must ask what work needs to be done , who will be doing this work , when and where it will be done and how it will be done , explained Dr Shaniel Davrajh , a Senior Engineer at the CSIR . In asking and answering these questions , we will have a better understanding of the skills we need and we 'll be able to create the right jobs to meet the industry 's needs . Many of these jobs will be jobs we 've never even heard of , he asserted . We all know that the country has a massive unemployment problem , but it makes little sense for us to just create jobs if we do n't have people with the skills needed to fill these roles . <p> Yugen Pillay , National Director for Business Consulting and Energy and Natural Resources Industry Leader at SNG Grant Thornton , agreed . " Automation and digitisation is actually about job creation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ processes , we are creating better business and new ways of working . This creates entirely new ecosystems , which entrepreneurs , small businesses and start-ups can tap into in order to become part of the mining supply chain . " <p> As a sector that employs a large portion of South Africa 's workforce , it is understandable that conversations around digital transformation and virtual work elicit fear among workers , but Davrajh is adamant that there are many ways that we can innovate and embrace technology while " keeping the human in the loop " . This demands that the industry is strategic about how to innovate . " Human-centred innovation means coming up with ways to enable low-skilled labour to do skilled work . " <p> According to Davrajh , we know that most people can operate a smartphone , so when we automate and innovate , we must endeavour to create systems that resemble the solutions our workers are familiar with . This means creating interfaces that empower people with low literacy levels , for example , to use tools and technologies they are already familiar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't see technology as a threat to employment . It is a tool that can add to , improve and supplement many of the actions we perform , " concluded Davrajh. -- Joanne Carew <p> -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- <h> ESG and the energy transition -- is Africa ready ? <p> Acknowledging that the sector has been rather profit-driven in the past , the mining industry is looking to turn over a new leaf to secure its future . As such , ensuring that mines leverage more sustainable and environmentally-friendly energy sources and address key environmental , social and governance ( ESG ) concerns were major focus areas at the Investing in Mining Indaba , which took place at the Cape Town International Convention Centre this week . Many of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their operations in the coming decades , with some promising to be carbon neutral by as early as 2040 . <p> But South Africa is still heavily dependent on coal . Kgabi Masia , Managing Director for minerals at Exxaro Resources , admitted that change needs to be made , but said that coal is n't going anywhere ; at least not yet . With 77% of South Africa 's energy provided by coal , Masia said that the country 's energy security still depends on this fossil fuel . Until we have a viable alternative that can provide the same scale of capacity , it would be foolish to even consider walking away from coal . And others agree . <p> Speaking during a media briefing at the event on Tuesday morning , Niks Lesufi , Senior Executive for Health and Environment at the Minerals Council , acknowledged this reality , explaining that the Minerals Council has adopted a dual approach in order to secure energy security , while making simultaneously making the transition to more environmentally-friendly energy sources . This strategy entails maintaining the country 's dependence on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ encourage the move to these technologies . <p> Talking about decarbonisation specifically , Werner Duvenhage , Managing Director of Richards Bay Minerals at Rio Tinto , asserted that it has to happen in phases . Globally , renewables account for about 38% of power supply , while in South Africa this number sits at around 13% . " This means that there is a huge gap for us to get to where other countries are from a renewable energy perspective . It also means that there is a huge opportunity . " <p> But Duvenhage and others caution that grabbing this opportunity does come at a cost , which is why the different stakeholders -- communities , government , investors and industry -- need to work together . " All key stakeholders must be committed to making a change , and we need to be very careful that we do n't leave anybody behind , " said Masia . <p> When we talk about an energy transition , ensuring that it is just demands that everyone is prepared to make the shift . Masia believes that it all comes down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficulties and adapt to change . " Businesses will have to adapt or they are going to die , " noted Tshokolo Nchocho , Chief Executive Officer at the Industrial Development Corporation of South Africa ( IDC ) , adding that society will determine if a business has done enough to minimise their impact and if society decides that it has n't lived up to its promises , that business wo n't be around in five or 10 years time . <p> " What we are facing really is a global challenge . Moving this energy transition forward , minimising our impact and getting to net zero as soon as possible so that we can avoid the devastating effects of climate change is an enormous task , " said Demetrios Papathanasiou , Global Director for Energy and Extractives Global Practice at the World Bank . " It 's not about working against each other , but rather trying to work with each other . " <p> Governments , the private sector and investors need to collaborate to overcome the obstacles that lie ahead , he concluded . " We are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to come up with solutions together . The kind of conversations and engagements we are having at an event like this are so important . We have to grab this common sense of purpose and figure out how we can collaborate more effectively and more quickly together .

The UN 's Sustainable Development Plan has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to respond to global goals and targets by 2030 , with South Africa targeting clean energy , low-carbon transport , smart water , the circular economy and smart agriculture . But to do so requires substantial finance , and depends largely on the ability of development finance institutions such as the Development Bank of Southern Africa ( DBSA ) to leverage available resources to attract private investment . <p> The greening of South Africa 's economy requires substantial financing , which depends heavily on the ability of development finance institutions such as the DBSA <p> The DBSA works across sub-Saharan Africa to promote economic and social development , by sourcing and providing mostly infrastructural financing . Climate change has become increasingly important , and as such one of its priority focus areas is climate finance . According to Olympus Manthata , Head of Climate and Environmental Finance , the ability to mobilise climate finance at scale requires innovative approaches such as the DBSA 's Climate Finance Facility ( CFF ) . This is a climate-related lending facility , which is a first in Africa and is based on the " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blended finance approach , which essentially combines public finance with private finance to address market constraints and fill market gaps . These funds are for private projects that have potential but can not currently attract market-rate capital at scale without credit enhancement . The DBSA bridges this gap and catalyses private funding by co-funding alongside developmental and private sector financial institutions , with the aim to achieve a 1:5 leverage . <p> The initial debt funding of R2-billion in use by the DBSA is a rand-denominated facility and directed purely at co-funding private sector projects in South Africa , eSwatini , Lesotho and Namibia -- countries in the common monetary union . It brings credit enhancement products in the form of a first loss or subordinated funding and tenor extension of up to 15 years , combined with concessional funding provided by the UN 's Green Climate Fund ( GCF ) . <p> Development of climate facilities <p> The DBSA with support from the GCF is currently developing various climate facilities such as the National Water Reuse programme , which it aims to finalise in the last quarter of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proposal for $150-million to the GCF for the concessional part of the finance facility , and the bank aims to contribute significant co-financing for further credit enhancement . <p> " The package we are designing is aimed at making water reuse projects bankable . Water tariffs often limit the way in which water is costed ; our solution is to target new and existing wastewater treatment plants that either need to be upgraded or expanded , and increase municipalities ' awareness of how to treat effluent water for reuse , " said Manthata . <p> " We are also taking a comprehensive approach , because there is a tendency to look at such projects in isolation . However municipalities generally experience the same challenges , and there are many lessons and benefits for all that partake in the programme . And , with a single programme in use , transaction costs will lower . " <p> This proved to be the case with the renewable energy programme , once financiers became more familiar and comfortable with the conditions of the contracts . <p> About 56% of South Africa 's wastewater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The DBSA believes that it will take between 20 and 30 years to correct this , but again , it is going to require public and private sector buy-in . " If we can change the negative perceptions around water reuse , that it is not a wasted resource but has the ability to produce energy , and that its sludge has value , for example , the resulting revenue streams generated can potentially be used to finance other climate mitigating projects . " <p> DBSA 's role in key infrastructure development projects <p> Further credibility for the DBSA 's role in such projects comes from its playing a key role in developing the market for Independent Power Producers ( IPPs ) , through the Renewable Energy Independent Power Producers Programme ( REIPP ) . The bank has already invested R12.4-billion into 14 REIPP projects , of which R2.5-billion was funding support for nine BBBEE entities and 15 local community trusts . <p> The bank is also looking at investing in the country 's Embedded Generation Investment Programme ( EGIP ) to the tune of $84-million , directed at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on renewable energy . " EGIP is transformational in that it will add more than 450MW of new generating capacity , which in turn directly avoids more than 700 000 tonnes of carbon emissions per annum , " said Manthata . <p> Green Bonds <p> Yet another of DBSA 's tasks is to manage The Green Fund on behalf of the Department of Forestry , Fisheries and the Environment , which allows the bank to provide access to funds for low-carbon and climate-resilient development . The Fund had an initial allocation of R1.1-million for disbursement , for use as complementary funding for green projects and programmes . To further enhance the DBSA 's role and commitment to climate change efforts , it also issued its first Green Bond in February through a private placement with French development finance institution , the Agence Fran ? aise de D ? veloppement ( AFD ) , with whom the bank has concluded many successful infrastructure financing facilities . Worth R3.59-billion , the bond will help finance domestic projects that will contribute to the green economy . <p> " The DBSA Green Bond issuance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mitigation and/or adaptation , aligned to the National Development Plan and sustainable development goals , " confirmed Manthata .

@@90980231 <h> Benefits of Early Engagement in Engineering <p> There is no hiding that , in the world of engineering , embracing a " left-to-right thinking " methodology is crucial . This specific mindset allows you to bring into focus the end of your project right from the outset . <p> Need to produce construction deliverables in a completions-ready fashion ? Breaking down the intricate process into commissionable systems offers you the chance to ideate steps to aid both an efficient and safe plan of action . <p> How can you achieve this ? Here , we take a look at the benefits of early engagement while outlining the detrimental aspects of overlooking timely planning . <h> Early engagement vs late engagement <p> An early engagement approach encourages engineers to envision the completed project from the very beginning . To hit the ground running , and to ensure everything falls smoothly into place , it is important to collaborate with vendors and construction partners . By doing so , you are holding these parties to account while making sure that all the elements work together . <p> Ultimately , a successful completion philosophy spurs you to follow the project from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ design and engineering , discipline-level construction , and handover . What you are doing is keeping an eye on the project 's lifecycle , from mechanical completion to pre-commissioning , commissioning , start-up , and operations . <p> Late engagement of completions on the project , instead , can conceal an array of negative consequences . Why ? Firstly , it can result in substantial delays , which will end up slowing down your plans . Secondly , your costs may overrun . In fact , construction will race ahead with no visibility of how , or when , the systems being built can be livened up for pre-commissioning . Defects in construction may not delay the mechanical completion of parts of the plan . However , they can hinder commissioning and , therefore , a safe and timely start-up . <p> Embedding a completions management system early in the project can prevent these unwanted obstacles . In fact , it will provide you with immediate visibility of progress towards the eventual commissioning and start-up of both systems and subsystems . Not only that , but it will help you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> What 's more , a completions management system allows you to save check-sheets and handover certification . It also enables you to store auditable tracking , resolution of punch listing , and technical queries . <p> Missing a completions approach and baseline standard for the supply chain at the FEED ( Front End Engineering Design ) or pre-FID ( Final Investment Decision ) stages can cause issues . This would mean , in fact , that the standard is not woven into the contract clauses of the project 's supply chain . In this scenario , QA and QC ( quality assessment and quality control ) variations in the supply chain would take precedence over your own specific plans . This makes it difficult to acquire a common standard for completions or TI ( technical integrity ) assurance throughout the project delivery . <h> Useful steps to follow <p> Having a specific process in place will facilitate the positive outcome of your operations . But what should effective planning and preparation look like ? <p> Here are a few steps you may want to take : <p> Compare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's standard for TI is . This can be carried out at Inspection Test and Plan level . In this way , you will be able to identify any potential gaps early in the project and fill them in accordingly . <p> Consider connecting a vendor or installer 's digital system to the client system , so that they can effectively use their own . That said , make sure that the system has a modern API functionality or , at least , a simple Excel export function . If not , chances are that the system is not up to the job . <p> Find a data segregation method to allow the supply chain to use the client 's own system . Of course , this would have to be performed under configurable and appropriate user rights . <p> Source a way to link the system to the engineering documented asset and digital twin data . This will allow you to efficiently populate the completions management system . <p> Make full use of paperless check-sheets and test procedures . By doing this , you can benefit from live and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operations . <p> If the above baseline is set well in advance across all stakeholders , then the process will be easier to plan and execute . Furthermore , it offers you the opportunity to ascertain and verify progress throughout all the phases of a project . <p> Conversely , if you lack a solid baseline , the handover quality and status are more difficult to quantify and evaluate . This may also lead to having to deal with problems that have been left untracked and , therefore , unresolved in significant volume . Ultimately , it can represent a blow to your operations and leave you with very little time to fix any unwanted issue . <p> To conclude , early engagement within a project has a wide range of benefits . Leaving it late to check or organise your plan of action , instead , can hinder the correct flow of the operations .

The Superman actor seems perfect for the material , especially since the Witcher actor takes his fandom roles so seriously . He delivered an amazing Superman in Man of Steel , a wonderful Sherlock Holmes in Netflix 's Enola Holmes , a great Theseus in Immortals , and a perfect Geralt of Rivia in The Witcher .

@@91003234 <h> Marvel Has Complicated Iron Man 's Death Even More With Moon Knight <p> Seeing Iron Man 's journey end in sacrifice was more than enough for us to respect how the Marvel movies have treated his character , but we ca n't help but feel like death has been somewhat watered down since . This is thanks to a trend that has always existed in comic books but only recently began to make its way into the movies . And now Moon Knight has made it possible with Iron Man . <p> Death has never actually had to be the definitive end for a character in the comics because certain heroes tend to sell better . Therefore , we 've seen characters return with the power of time travel , the use of doppelgangers , retconning and whatever desperate methods exist for the sake of fanfare . Now it 's happening in the Marvel films too . <p> The biggest complication to Iron Man 's death might have come with a reveal in Disney+ 's Moon Knight TV show ( episode 5 ) where we found out about the afterlife and its accessibility to certain characters in that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it might be possible for iconic Marvel characters , like Iron Man , to make a return -- or at least be reached . <p> In Moon Knight , we are introduced to gods like Taweret and Khonshu through Marc/Steven who could potentially use mystical abilities to meet with Tony Stark 's soul and give us a glimpse into what his afterlife is like -- whether he is in the traditional Heaven or in Astral Plane or even Valhalla . <p> That said , the irreversible quality of Iron Man 's death made his sacrifice valuable . Removing that makes his death feel less important . Having him show up again ( even as a spiritual being or ghost ) makes his death feel less permanent . <p> Tony is a character that has always seemed to be self-indulgent , even when his actions aligned with the good side of the moral compass . That 's what makes his death , and the lack of any real last words for his comrades so heartfelt . Tony already gave us everything his character needed with the snap . Seeing him relaxing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't seem to fit with the image presented . <p> Basically , this reveal opens up the question of whether or not finding him or his spirit in the afterlife could also mean Tony Stark returning to the MCU again . They found a way in Endgame . Could they do it again ? Probably . It 's a comic book movie after all . <p> Of course , the upside to all of this is that the new revelation about death and the afterlife opens up many new possibilities within the MCU. 
@@91003236 <h> The Story Behind Jean-Claude Van Damme 's Predator Alien <p> Jean-Claude Van Damme 's first appearance in a blockbuster film was meant to be in the first Predator film . But things did n't turn out that way . <p> 1987 saw the release of one of the most iconic action/sci-fi flicks of all time with Predator . Starring Arnold Schwarzenegger and Carl Weathers , this testosterone-fueled film has won an army of loyal fans over the years -- even if the multiple sequels have n't always been received with open arms . <p> Packed full of violence , copious gore , and a whole lot of attitude , it was a perfect recipe for success when released back in 1987 . And yet , there was another element that helped this film become so popular ; it had a certain martial arts star attached to its production , at least , in its early drafts . <p> Die-hard fans of the original film might know that the eponymous Predator was played by Kevin Peter Hall . The actor 's imposing stature made him the first choice when directors needed someone to step into some kind of monster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Schwarzenegger 's Dutch faces off against in the film 's climax . <p> In an alternate universe , however , things could have been quite different for Predator . The first choice to play the alien creature was none other than the martial artist and renowned actor Jean-Claude Van Damme . To make things even more interesting , the suit that Jean-Claude Van Damme was set to use in the movie was radically different from the now-iconic Predator look that horror fans know and love . <p> One thing that 's worth pointing out is that Van Damme was n't as popular in 1987 as he was during the 90s . His name might not have been able to sell more Predator tickets , and perhaps that was the reason why director John McTiernan was okay having the martial artist in a silly-looking alien suit for the whole movie . <p> Speaking of absolutely unthreatening monster designs , the original look of the Predator was something that looked straight out of a cheap B-movie . The final design , made by none other than Stan Winston -- the special effects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -- has stood the test of time , looking great even by today 's standards . <p> The design of the Predator costume is one of the film 's crowning achievements and is also one of the lead reasons why Jean-Claude Van Damme was fired from the project . The first drafts of the film have the Predator being a sort of sneaky alien creature that looked more like a Xenomorph than the hulking beast that is the final movie 's design . <p> Allegedly , Jean-Claude Van Damme was difficult to work with on the set of Predator -- a set that was already marred with difficulties , to begin with . For starters , shooting an action flick in the humid Mexican rainforest is not as easy as it sounds , much less if you 're wearing a bulky rubber suit . <p> The story goes that Jean-Claude Van Damme , punished by the hot and humid weather , and unable to breathe properly due to the Predator suit 's original design , collapsed on more than one occasion , bringing the film 's production to a halt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleased with Van Damme 's predilection for kickboxing , which he tried to introduce into the Predator 's fighting style . <p> In the end , it was Arnold Schwarzenegger who proposed that they hired Stan Winston to redesign the Predator costume , and the rest , as they say , is history . Predator would have been a radically different film with Jean-Claude Van Damme , there 's no doubt about that -- still , there 's good reason to believe that the version of the movie we got , in the end , is the superior one . <p> Years later , in 2010 , Predators would pay homage to Jean-Claude Van Damme 's costume design with the ' River Ghost ' species , proving that there 's still a chance that a version of the Predator that kickboxes might exist somewhere in the movie 's universe . <h> Tell us , did you know that Jean-Claude Van Damme was the original Predator ?

On the flip side though , we might finally see some much-needed depth in a character like Velma who has always been book smart and surrounded by her friends . In this setting , she 's apparently a student , so we might be seeing her go through the coming of age experiences that make for some good TV storylines.

@@91139232 <h> This brave bunch of adventure racers took on one of the world 's most daunting challenges . This is their story . <p> Six days , 500 kilometres , 125 hours , and 12 hours of sleep ; that is Expedition Africa Lesotho 2022 condensed into one sentence . That is , for the Slowvelders , at least . They are a team of adventure racers from the Lowveld who competed together for the first time in November last year . <p> The team consists of Megan Andersen , Stephan Pinker , Harry Wiltshire and Wihan Jacobs . Adventure racing entails travelling a certain distance , consisting of various different legs , within a certain amount of time . Which in itself does not sound too challenging , until you realise the different legs consist of mountain biking , trekking , kayaking and some swimming in ice-cold temperatures and up and down never-ending mountains in rural Lesotho . <p> The first leg was a bit of a cultural experience , with each team getting a donkey to walk for about the first hour . The team laughed , saying they ended up with the most stubborn one . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned up a few notches . They navigated down into the gorge of a 200m waterfall . From there they had various checkpoints going down a river . <p> " It was raining , and then it got dark , and then it got cold , and it continued raining , and then it was raining , and we were walking , and we were walking , " the team mentioned . When the route was initially planned , they would have been right at the river 's edge , but due to it being in full flood , that was not possible and alternatives had to be found . Later on in the race , the circumstance created by the weather would also force them and numerous other teams to skip a checkpoint in order to finish in time . This was decided when organisers saw that even the leading team were about 30% behind the estimated time . The mountain biking they compared to being on the seat of a bicycle for as long as a trip to Cape Town and back would take you . Add to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ challenge . Some of the inclines were so steep , they simply could not justify burning that amount of energy on riding it out and opted to push the bikes instead . <p> During this leg , the team also had to cross a river again at some stage . They did this by paying locals nearby who had boats . During these races , it is all about making do with what you have . <p> On the other side of the river , trouble was waiting for them . Andersen and Pinker were slightly ahead , when suddenly they heard Jacobs whistling and yelling , " Julle moet kom , Harry het neergebliksem ! " He had gone over a rutty piece in the road with his bike and ended up falling into a ditch next to the road caused by the rain . He had hit his head , and hurt his wrist , arm and leg . <p> Some schoolchildren follow Wihan Jacobs . <p> The team had to make a decision : Do they stop the race completely , or get Wiltshire the help he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on ahead ; Wiltshire said he would not have wanted it any other way . <p> From there , the remaining three still had kayaking , swimming and trekking the final stretch towards the Afriski Resort to go . The kayaks were two-seaters , which meant they ended up paddling two in front and one , in tow , in the back . Jacobs had the honour of swimming to one of the control points in 10 ? C , leading to uncontrollable shivers when he met back up with Pinker and Andersen . <p> They had to work together to get his body temperature back up to where he could function and continue further . Jacobs remembered an instance later in the race when he wanted to eat a chocolate he had in his bag ; it was frozen -- that was how cold it was . " Luckily Megan had a naartjie . It was the best naartjie I had in my life . " <p> They said at a certain stage in the race " time becomes irrelevant , distance becomes irrelevant . The fact that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just know that you are still moving and you are going to be moving . " <p> The day they would reach the resort was the first with an end destination in sight . Despite the beatings on mind and body , the experience itself was entirely worth it , they all agreed . <p> " For six days you forget about everything ; you forget about home , you forget work , you forget about cellphones , you give up everything and your whole world becomes this survival mode you are in and it is the most refreshing cleansing of all the daily noise . " <p> The also reckon the experience brings them closer to God and makes them better people in general once they get back in the " real " world -- despite the sometimes two-week recovery period and a few missing toenails after a race . <p> For advertisers Lowvelder provides an established product where distribution is guaranteed and you have the upper hand in readership figures .

DYLAN JACK reports . <p> On Saturday , the Stormers will begin their journey through the Vodacom United Rugby Championship playoffs when they host Scottish side Edinburgh in Cape Town . <p> Having finished second overall on the table , the Stormers are set to host both a quarter- and semi-final and could host the final if first-placed Leinster lose either their quarter- or semi-final . <p> Ordinarily , this would be a massive advantage , but history shows the Stormers have not always made the benefit of playing on their home ground count . Starting in 1999 , when the ' Men in Black ' team finished second overall but infamously lost a Newlands-based Super Rugby semi-final to the Highlanders , the Stormers constantly seem to have tripped up in a home playoff . <p> In the last decade of Super Rugby , when the Stormers topped their respective conference four times , finishing in the top three five times , they somehow lost in the home qualifier or semi-final . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buildup to their URC quarter-final in Cape Town , captain Kitshoff said he is convinced 2022 will be different . <p> " Looking at the past , since 2010 the Stormers have been playing good rugby in certain seasons and getting those playoffs and finals , but not always going through on it , " he said . <p> " This year has been a bit different in the way we have actually started building momentum from around the middle of the season onwards , where we had our home stretch . We knew that if we keep building on our game and keep performing well that we could get into a playoff scenario and hopefully finish close to the top of the log . <p> " This team is in really good form . Everyone understands their role and the job that needs to be done . If we go in with that same mindset and just do what we normally do , but better , we will increase our chances of making it through all the playoff games . <p> " To be honest , this team is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The buzz around training is very exciting . So , I think we have a great chance . " <p> Unlike seasons past , the Stormers go into the first round of playoffs on the back of an excellent run of form , during which they won their last eight games at home , including tough fixtures against Irish sides Leinster and Ulster . <p> " Winning becomes a habit , I truly believe it , " Kitshoff said . " If something quickly happens -- like when we went behind to Scarlets early in the game -- you look at how the guys kept on sticking to the way we play . Nobody started panicking and we clawed our way back . <p> " This team , in the way we have been preparing over the last three months , it 's been about guys believing in the structures , believing that this is the way we are going to win games . That belief translates into the way we play . <p> " In tight games , it can always come down to a drop of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lose the game . But if we stick to our plan , we know we will create opportunities to score tries and prevent teams from scoring points . That 's how we see we can win big games .

Watching them play in Scotland , they have been performing quite well . <p> " Edinburgh has a very good pack of forwards , a bunch of big guys , strong ball-carriers .

Herring , the player and not the expression , has only ever led Ulster 's passionate rugby audiences to one conclusion -- and that is of a world-class player and quality human being . <p> Herring , of all the celebrated South African players who have won favour with Ulster 's rugby public , is the one who has done it as an Ulsterman . He arrived in Belfast more than a decade ago as a youngster and over the next 10 years would complete all his professional rugby apprenticeship out of Ulster . <p> Herring 's classroom education may have come in South Africa but his rugby education is all about Ulster and Ireland .

Louis Ludik , who played 112 matches for Ulster between 20014 and 2017 , also arrived as a very experienced Super Rugby player . <p> Herring 's journey is very different . He had played just two matches for DHL Western Province before making his debut for Ulster in 2012 , via a brief Academy spell at London Irish . <p> In fact , Herring told RugbyWorld magazine , that he initially turned down Ulster 's approach because he wanted to stay in Cape Town and complete his studies . <p> Herring , schooled at South Africa 's oldest school , SACS , played Varsity Cup for Maties ( Stellenbosch University ) and was intent to study first and then determine whether he had a professional rugby career . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a ' short-term crack ' at Ulster . This short term is now closer to 11 years , almost the time Herring joked it took him to finish that Varsity degree . <p> Herring 's career has always been followed closely in South Africa and his highs for Ulster and Ireland have always been well documented . <p> Ulster 's brand has also never needed an introduction to the South African rugby public because of the likes of Herring having such a presence over the past decade . <p> Herring , who has played 211 matches for Ulster , said that first season in Belfast as a 20-year-old , nearly did n't happen . <p> ' I initially said ' no ' to Ulster . I still do n't know how they found out about me but a couple of weeks after that Varsity Cup final my brother-in-law got a call from David Humphreys , who 'd heard I 'd got an Irish passport through my grandparents ' ancestry , had seen my clips and asked if I wanted to come over to play in Ireland . But I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eight months , had just started studying and was happy to be home . <p> ' Then I got a call from the Connacht director of rugby and that made me think maybe there is an opportunity over there .

If it works out I stay , if not I go home and next year I 'm studying ' . He agreed to that , so I gave it a crack .

Musk first began purchasing shares in the social media company in late January this year , purchasing 9.2% of the company , and becoming its largest individual shareholder . He disclosed this purchase on the 4th of April . Musk was offered a seat on the board which he turned down after learning that it limited his potential stake in the company to under 15% . The board attempted to limit the number of shares Musk was able to acquire by adopting a poison pill which would take place after any shareholder acquired a position higher than 15% and would then allow other shareholders to purchase discounted voting right shares which would dilute the majority shareholder 's position . This was never implemented as the board eventually agreed to Musk 's financial plan , which was to purchase the company for $54.20 a share .

Twitter had claimed that fewer than 5% of the accounts on the platform were bots but Musk believed it to be closer to 20% . However , it now seems that the Tesla and SpaceX CEO is going through with the deal , as he addressed the employees of Twitter Inc. in an employee meeting this week where topics of remote work , the future of the platform and the likelihood of extraterrestrial life were discussed .

They can rightly demand that government health policy ensures the continued growth and development of private health care . <p> To enable the private health sector to step up to the challenge , the government must stop micromanaging private healthcare provision , encourage those who can afford to pay for their own health care to do so , and encourage the development of health-care insurance products for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ costs by removing regulations that increase costs or prevent the provision of care , including scrapping all requirements for certificates of need , price controls , compulsory community service , registration requirements for medicines already approved in the European Union , the United States , Canada , Australia and New Zealand , and such other countries that meet certain defined standards . <h> Range of quality choices for the poor <p> The main beneficiaries of this reform programme will be the poor , who would be given a range of quality healthcare choices . Taxpayers will see more efficient use of taxpayer funds and have certainty that tax money earmarked for funding health care reaches the poor directly , so that they would get more , and better health care compared to the current public health system . <p> State assistance to those who should be self-supporting would be eliminated , allowing greater assistance to those who really need it . A further benefit is that over time , people who prosper sufficiently to pay for their own healthcare would be removed from the healthcare support list . <p> If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nationalisation , South Africa will lose its world-class private healthcare firms , and doctors , specialists and nurses will continue to emigrate .

@@91672231 <p> One warm Saturday evening in October 2011 , a group of eight friends , a mixture of male and female , white , black and coloured , aged between 15 and 23 , walked up a small hill behind a swimming pool in the suburb of Linmeyer in the south of Johannesburg . They went equipped to spend the night drinking , smoking marijuana and chatting around a campfire , as they usually did on weekends . But this was not a normal weekend . <p> Hours later the majority of the group had fled , while two of them stumbled and crawled back to town : Kirsty Theologo , 18 , most of her body covered in third and fourth degree burns , somehow assisting Bronwyn Grammar , then 16 , her arms and body burned from trying to roll her friend in the sand and douse the flames that were covering her . Soon after , her brother found Kirsty in the kitchen of their home , so heavily burned that she was barely recognisable . She was rushed to hospital where she lapsed into a coma . The fire had severely damaged her lungs and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story began emerging almost immediately of a planned attack in which the other members of the group soaked Kirsty with petrol , set her on fire and left her to burn to death . Lurid details including a bloody ritual , five-pointed stars drawn on the ground and the desecration of a bible led to a swift diagnosis by press and police that this was a ' Satanist murder ' , a phrase that has a long resonance in South Africa . Six people were arrested : five male , the oldest of them 21 , and one 15-year-old female . <p> The Theologo murder shocked South Africa , garnering a comparatively large amount of press coverage for a country with a high rate of violence against women . Journalists , editors , religious leaders and politicians flocked to report and comment on Kirsty 's brutal fate . <p> Hers was far from the only story of " satanic " killing to appear in the South African press in recent years . In the summer of February 2014 , just days after some of the accused had been jailed for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ near Dobsonville in Soweto , Johannesburg , stumbled across the mutilated bodies of two local teenage girls . Best friends Thandeka Moganetsi , 15 , and Chwayita Rathazayo , 16 , had been missing since the previous day . <p> The girls , both pupils at nearby George Khoza Secondary School , were found metres apart , still wearing their school uniforms , with open wounds on their backs and cuts on their hands and necks . Three razor blades and a black candle were found near the bodies , once again leading to a quick diagnosis of Satanism from the press , police and parents . <p> Distraught friends told tales about satanic cults operating within the school that may have " sacrificed " the girls . Two teenage boys , pupils at the same school , were quickly arrested . Religious and political leaders descended on Dobsonville to decry the scourge of Satanism in schools . Once again , these killings received an unusual amount of media and public attention in a nation that often glosses over public violence . <p> The press narratives that surrounded the deaths @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not just examples of news sensationalism . While there were undoubtedly features of the events of both nights that could be described as satanic , the media 's overdetermined focus on these elements of the murders meant that they were defined as a bizarre and unusual occult crimes rather than as part of South Africa 's ongoing epidemic of gender-based violence . <p> In repeating moral panic tropes around Satanism to the exclusion of all other potential contributing factors , newspaper reporting on these cases disregarded the disturbing truth that violence in South Africa is usually structural and often gendered . The focus on Satanism also allowed newspapers to avoid considering the forms of these murders , which , in their echo of late apartheid violence , recall historical trauma . Within the reporting , anxieties about the alleged threat of Satanism displaced knowledge of how male violence and the residue of apartheid atrocities shape contemporary life , especially for the poor . <p> Elements of these murders that could be defined as occult , ritualistic or satanic were descriptive rather than fundamental . They tell us as much as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Africa : punishment for sexual or gender " misconduct " , as in cases of corrective rape ; jealousy , as in domestic violence ; the influence of drugs and alcohol , as in many random acts of extreme violence that happen to women . <p> Any one of these causes could have been brought to bear without changing the base facts of the murders . Media claims that these killers were working under the influence of supernatural evil are just one of many ways to understand violence . Nonetheless media outlets failed to consider any meaning to the murders other than Satanism , a diagnosis that they , hand in hand with police , had imposed . In valorising Satanism as the only possible motivation for what was done to these girls , the South African press in effect legitimised its own claims . <p> In these cases , the spectacular violence of a Satanist act almost entirely erased the possibility of more " normal " ( equally brutal but less sensational ) violence against women . The deaths of Moganetsi , Theologo and Rathazayo were made exceptional , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the rates of death of South African women or of other acts of violence perpetrated against them . <p> Unlike in the case of Anene Booysen , whose killing was clearly sexualised , responses to these murders almost entirely avoided talking about them as instances of the rage and aggression meted out so frequently on the bodies of South African women by South African men . The spectacularisation of Satanist murders allowed the media to sidestep the disturbing awareness that , in fact , the greatest monsters are not monstrous at all : they are human , familiar , part of our communities and our worlds . <p> The deaths of Chwayita Rathazayo , Kirsty Theologo and Thandeka Moganetsi were individual tragedies , appalling crimes and symptoms of a larger condition . They reveal the continuation of the embedded structural violence that has wounded South Africa since the start of the colonial project . The press ' incapacity to see past the screening fiction of Satanism recalls the way in which apartheid-era realities were deferred by privileged white people who claimed not to know about the violence and injustice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose murders go unreported and unnoticed , Theologo , Rathazayo and Moganetsi are victims of this willed blindness , this refusal to know and concurrently to act against both the structural causes of violence and those pathological modes of gender that work out their rage , despair and fear on the always-available bodies of women . <p> This is an edited extract from the book Worrier State : Risk , anxiety and moral panic in South Africa , published by Wits University Press . <h> The views expressed are those of the author and do not reflect the official policy or position of the Mail &amp; Guardian . 
@@91672232 <h> Ramaphosa will build trust if he opens up about the theft at his game farm <p> In South Africa , leadership failures and the denigration of ethics have undermined our concept as a nation . The sense of who we are , what we believe and what gives us collective pride is something that we can no longer grasp or imagine with confidence . <p> The Irish political scientist , Benedict Anderson , talks about nations as " imagined communities " . Such collective imagination imbues nations with myths and a healthy dose of pride that fuels social and economic progress . <p> Stirring collective imaginations and energies towards a positive end is one of the defining features of great leaders . <p> What enables leaders to do this is their ability to cultivate connectedness based on trust and shared interests between them and those they lead . Citizens can only trust leaders when they feel a sense of proximity , real or imagined , with them . When societies perceive a divergence between their interests and that of their leaders , confidence erodes , and a chasm of mistrust opens up between the leaders and the public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and especially at the end of the Mandela era , we have endured a series of leadership disappointments in ways that cut deep and scar our collective concept as a nation . <p> In its more than 25 years of existence as a democracy , South Africa has had only fleeting moments of superb leadership , the kind of leadership that elevates the public spirit , enriches the ethical quality of society and flickers the hope of economic progress . <p> Such moments were evident during the embracing of the constitutional order and nation-building during Nelson Mandela 's era , a period of high economic growth and the African Renaissance project under president Thabo Mbeki , and when President Cyril Ramaphosa stopped president Jacob Zuma 's state capture project in its track and pulled the country back from the brink . <p> During those phases , when we saw a light of hope , there were also intractable tendencies that contained seeds of institutional decay . These tendencies included the arms deals corruption case that began under the watch of Mandela 's presidency and haunted the Mbeki presidency , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet to be prosecuted . <p> The Zuma era of state capture was particularly corrosive because it set a new -- and much lower -- standard of what is acceptable in public leadership and ethical conduct . At the end of Zuma 's tenure , the only credential for leadership was simply to be slightly better than Zuma , a dismally low bar . As long as you are not stealing from the public coffers , you are considered fit and proper for leadership , according to this fallen standard . Leadership is now a stampede of the average . <p> This erosion of standards has also filtered into the bureaucracy at various levels of government . <p> At this rate , it will be much harder to establish a new framework of ethical leadership in the government , because many who , under normal circumstances , would judge themselves not qualified for leadership will now be convinced that they are worthy giants . <p> This debasement of leadership virtue counts among the worst legacies the previous administration has left us with since the onset of democracy . <p> But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recent events of criminality on Ramaphosa 's farm and its implications for ethics and leadership in the country . <p> It has been widely reported that there was a theft in the president 's property that the public did not know about for two years , which has raised a dizzying amount of speculation . <p> There are unanswered questions about the source of the foreign currency stolen from the property and whether this was declared under the South African Reserve Bank regulations and speculation that various individuals may have used the president 's property as an avenue for laundering their money and that tax laws could have been breached either by the sellers or punters in the game industry or both . <p> These are matters under investigation by law enforcement agencies , and the law can grind slowly as fragments of leads and evidence are painstakingly pieced together . <p> Aside from what the law enforcement authorities may conclude , the president has a social contract with the citizens . The public has a certain expectation of how he ought to conduct himself . They want to know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has erred , they want him to be candid so they can find it in themselves to reconcile with him and have proper closure rather than tarry in suspense . The cloud of smoke and silence is not helping to rebuild trust and may instead risk creating an unnecessary blot on the legacy of the president . <p> There is a level of esteem with which Ramaphosa is held in society even outside the political office . Most people know that he was a businessman when he took office and that he is wealthy because of his commercial enterprises that are not entangled in the state . <p> Very few people consider the unlikely possibility that the money on the president 's property is a result of proceeds from corruption . <p> It is not about the theft of public money that disturbs those who trust him and who are genuinely asking tough questions . <p> Rather , what is of great concern is the ethics of his dual role as a businessman and president and his perceived lack of transparency and accountability on the more specific questions that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his money was stolen . <p> These incidents and how the president eventually responds to them -- and not what the law enforcement agents find -- will be one of the country 's significant tests of leadership and ethics . <p> He must choose whether he wants to be remembered by history as a cattle auctioneer or as one of the finest leaders who not only turned the country from the brink but set it on a path to prosperity . <p> If the latter , he may need to use all his energies to run the country , especially given the difficult economic times it is going through , and work on honing his legacy . He must close the door to private auctions until the end of his term . <p> Where to from here ? In search of new pathways to renewing leadership and values , we must hold on to radical pragmatism and not shirk our responsibility to squeeze the president hard for accountability and transparency by appealing to his conscience -- but stopping short of taking the pressure to its logical conclusion , namely , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we are facing a precipice as a country and many of those baying for his blood are vultures in the garb of radical economic transformation . <p> Those implicated in state capture activities will be keen to weaken Ramaphosa or force him out prematurely . If they succeed , they will set the ground to further erode independent institutions in the same manner they did after the recall of Mbeki in 2007 . <p> These revelations about the theft that took place on the president 's farm have conveniently come at the time when the governing party is gearing itself up for its December conference and the Zondo commission is releasing its explosive reports on state capture . <p> When leaders avoid public scrutiny , their actions negatively shape public ethics and conceptions of leadership . The president must rebuild public trust in his leadership . The best way to do so is by being candid about the events that took place on his farm two years ago . <p> The views expressed are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the official policy or position of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @

Late-comers are not allowed in , and while most shows are close to the CBD , down your drinks quickly slow-pokes because some venues are a bit of a trek . For those challenged in the administrative department , here are some tips to ensure you make it to your show on time : <p> Know where the venue is . Things can get pretty distracting in these streets , and it 's best to check locations at least a day or a few hours before the show starts so you can plan how you will get there . <p> Give yourself an extra ten minutes in case you get lost .

Pictured here is the drum which features heavily as an accompaniment to the cast 's singing . Source : Supplied <p> THEATRE : I am sorryReview by JENNA KRETZMANN <p> After creeping down into the depths of the Monument and finding the Rehearsal Room , I was not too sure what the empty stands suggested . An empty show often means one of two things : the production is terrible or severely underestimated . I am sorry , written and directed by veteran theatre practitioner Brian Nhlanhla Phakathi , definitely falls into the latter . <p> Set in the Vimba Squatter Camp in the hustle-and-bustle of Johannesburg , the play explores themes of unemployment , corruption , crime , violence , substance abuse , and gender-based violence . Phakathi draws inspiration from the experiences of his cast , as well as those in and around their communities . Serious topics are explored delicately and maturely by the dynamic cast of high school students from Phoenix College . <p> Phakathi 's brainchild @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' project whereby 16 schools within Johannesburg are chosen , and students are selected to participate in theatre works to stimulate conversations surrounding local challenges . I am sorry brings attention to the United Nation 's Sustainable Development Goals centred on children 's rights and gender-based violence . The production is funded by a German-based performance company , Kinderkulturkarawane , and is set to tour Germany , Austria and Slovenia from August until November . <p> In a world where television shows such as Netflix 's Stranger Things have a production value of well over $1 million per episode , it is refreshing to enter a bare theatre space . The cast challenged me to use my imagination to picture the setting , piecing together suggestive props and costuming and exploring the boundless uses of a single rostrum . It reminded me of countless Grade 12 Drama lessons discussing Grotowski 's theories of Poor Theatre . Although the set and costuming of this performance style appear simplistic , the actors need to be highly coordinated and in tune with one another to ensure a smooth running . I was very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and although rough around the edges , I believe that by the third performance , it will be stellar . <p> The ensemble work was strengthened by the voices and choreographic work of the cast . The only music in the production is the acapella chorus sung by the actors , accompanied by beautifully choreographed indigenous South African dance forms . <p> Dealing with gender-based violence through theatre should be done with caution . I am sorry does warn the audience in the blurb , but the director is responsible for ensuring their actors deal with such subject matter in a way that is not harmful to themselves or their audience . Phakathi does this innovatively . Without giving too much away , the rather biblical use of an apple to signify sexual assault is interesting and encourages one to contemplate the psychology behind violence and control . Phakathi noted that his actors know how to tackle such tricky subject matter through the help of counselling provided by the Nobuhle Virgie Foundation ( NVF ) . <p> I am always one to root for the underdog , especially when it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ range of theatre-goers would enjoy this experience and leave the theatre feeling a sense of faith and pride in the youth of South Africa . <p> The young and talented cast of ' I am sorry ' will be performing daily until 27 June in the RehearsalRoom at the Monument .

This was the question facing the organisers of the National Arts Festival . " You go back to your mission , " says chief executive Monica Newton . " And your mission is to host the annual festival . " <p> Despite many challenges , the biggest gathering for arts in South Africa , which has been running since 1974 , is back in Makhanda for the first time in two years . <p> " We do it because it 's important , because the festival matters , because the arts matter . If we do n't play our role in the ecosystem of the arts sector , then we 're not fulfilling our mission and mandate .

Photo : supplied <h> In at the deep end <p> Newton and Seethal , appointed in the latter half of 2019 , faced the daunting task of running a festival during a global pandemic in their first year at the helm . Rather than back down , they ran the 2020 festival digitally for the first time in history , with all the work on show created remotely . A fourth wave of Covid-19 pushed the festival online again in 2021 , but with work produced in Makhanda . <p> The pandemic was a blow to the festival in many ways , affecting arts creation , performance , production and the experience for audiences . It also had an enormous impact financially on travel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was achieved in the digital domain during those two years , says Newton . " How the art sector responded to the challenge with the innovation and the can-do attitude was humbling .

" This year , it is definitely a festival of its time , " she says . " We are a little rusty . We have n't done this in a while . And the bigger impact of two years of not working in the artistic community has been very difficult . We 've lost people , missed opportunities , the normal engine of content ground to a halt for a couple of years . So , imagining the festival almost returning to its roots has been a very interesting process .

And they have incorporated the National Schools Festival into the main festival for the first time . It made sense to allow schoolchildren to be part of the festival , Newton says : " These are going to be the artists and ticket buyers of the future . " <p> This model works beautifully for the jazz festival , where the integration of various schools is central to its programming . The jazz festival heard recently that main sponsor Standard Bank had discontinued its funding after 24 years , although the bank has confirmed its support of the broader festival and its awards . <p> The printed programme moves online for cost and environmental responsibility reasons this year . The festival has partnered with Rhodes University 's School of Journalism and Media Studies , as part of the latter 's 50th anniversary , to resurrect the festival newspaper Cue , which will run as amultimedia daily . <p> Left : We Regret To Inform You , anexhibition by Wezile Harmans .

" It was a really tough decision , " says Newton . " The festival in its entire history had never , ever litigated against a donor . " But when artists were left hanging in the middle of creating works , the festival fought for the financial commitments the NAC had made -- and won . <p> The fringe programme has also scaled down this year . The organisers see this year 's more intimate festival as a " hard prune " , which they say " is not a bad thing , because this programme feels much more manageable and easier to navigate " . <p> They are unsure of the audience this year and hoping for good ticket sales , but are aware that these are hopes and not guarantees . " The uncertainties this year are almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years , " says Newton . " Digital work does a lot , but at this point , it does n't replace revenue from ticket sales . " <h> Screens on stage <p> A new initiative the festival is working on is artist residencies that connect to the main programme . " There is this question of what this festival is and how do you have a national and international festival in this very precise little town in South Africa , " says Seethal . She sees the residencies as a way for artists to engage with their projects on a deeper level . <p> There was no central theme guiding applications , but Seethal was drawn to works that engaged strongly with feminism and gender-based violence . There are international productions from India , Japan , the Philippines and Sri Lanka . <p> The online element runs alongside the live festival .

" <p> This year 's festival offers the arts community a long-overdue gathering , and the organisers are taking brave steps to rebuild the National Arts Festival . " There are concerns about whether or not this is going to be financially successful . But we 're non-profit ; we do n't do this for the money , " says Newton . It still has the support of local , provincial and national governments , and all the festival 's partners are on board . <p> " Two and a half years later , here we still are , living with the complexities of economies , societies , livelihoods and infrastructure .

@@91722238 <p> " Democracy requires that citizens be continuously engaged in governance through interaction with those who make decisions . Marking a ballot and dropping it into a ballot box every few years is an important element of democracy , but it is only one step in building a society that genuinely serves the interests of all its people . Those elected to make policy and laws on behalf of the people are required to fulfil their mandate in continuous consultation and dialogue with the citizens on whose behalf they act . In South Africa , the gap between those with the resources to influence government and those whose influence , for historical reasons , is limited by poverty and disadvantage is deep and wide . Thus there is a genuine danger that , while the voices of the powerful may be heard , the majority remain imprisoned in the silence to which their history and circumstances have condemned them . If these imbalances are allowed to persist , we will be jeopardising our transformation into a meaningful democracy . By failing to create and maintain the channels through which the majority of the people may express their views and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reinforce patterns of marginalisation and exclusion . The reconstruction and development of our society can not be reduced to words on paper . We must secure and maintain consensus among all our people -- by involving them , empowering them and engaging them in the issues at the very heart of transforming our society . The voices of the people must be heard in our legislative and executive institutions , but this will not happen if we sit back in our committee meetings and offices . We need , instead , to seek out those voices and opinions and facilitate ways and means of engaging all sectors of society in crucial debates . This is what is meant by a " people 's parliament " . It is what we must strive for in our endeavours to open the doors of our political processes and discussions . We must work particularly hard to ensure that the voices of the hitherto voiceless are heard in the debates that shape their lives . This means reaching far into rural areas and accessing the views of the poor , particularly women . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to those who may struggle to enter because of disability , age or poverty so that they may speak frankly and openly about the issues that concern them . This must be the vision that guides our daily work. i " Dr FRENE GINWALA , Speaker of the National Assembly , Parliament of South Africa <p> In a reply to a motion from Councillor Geoff Embling ( DA ) , the Mayor and Speaker expressed their satisfaction that the local community was consulted . Interestingly , both acknowledged that residents in Ward 4 were not consulted at all . This in itself is problematic because every resident must be consulted and involved in the municipality 's decision-making processes regardless of social status or political affiliation . <p> The Mayor and Speaker must explain why residents in other wards were denied an opportunity to express their views on such an important issue . An answer such as " we are happy with the consultation process " is not good enough . <p> Before answering the question of whether the local community was indeed consulted on the budget and determination of tariffs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remind the Mayor and the Speaker about their legal obligations regarding community participation . I hope that the reminder will help them to change their attitudes . <p> The short answer to the question is no . The local community , which includes ratepayers , businesses , sports clubs , NPOs , etc. , was not consulted . If the Mayor and Speaker claim that the local community was indeed consulted , the opposition ( DA/EFF ) must demand that the Speaker table a detailed report on the consultation meetings . <p> The Speaker is the custodian of public participation in the municipality . The fact that the Speaker brushed aside Councillor Embling 's enquiry on the consultation process is cause for concern . It is evident that the Speaker can not fulfil his legal obligations regarding community participation in the municipality 's affairs . <p> The Manager for Legal Services should bring the following legal precedents to the attention of the Mayor and Speaker : Doctors for Life International v Speaker of the National Assembly ( 2002 ) ii , South African Property Owners Association v The Council of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Africa ( Pty ) Ltd and others v Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality ( 2014 ) iv . <p> It seems that the Mayor and Speaker do not have a good grasp of their legal obligations as specified in the Municipal Systems Act ( 2000 ) v and Municipal Finance Management Act ( 2003 ) vi . <p> When the Mayor and Speaker ignore the residents and law with impunity , the ANC leadership and MECs for Cooperative Governance and Finance must be summoned to Makana to rescue the municipality from its incompetent cadres . <p> When the community is undermined and marginalised from participatory decision-making processes , it is a recipe with unavoidable consequences . <p> The budget can not be prepared and adopted without any input from the local community . The lawvii is very clear on this issue . The Mayor and Speaker can not be allowed to impose their own will and laws on the local community . If this is allowed , the municipality will remain dysfunctional in the hands of persistent lawbreakers , and residents will continue to suffer . <p> What are the options @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ administration ? I suggest that ratepayers across wards and businesses reject the adopted budget and unaffordable tariffs .

@@91780230 <h> The Cape Town Entrepreneur Who Wants to Help Grow Businesses in The Informal Sector From The Ground Up <p> Sebastian Daniels ' Ground Culture is focused on bringing township entrepreneurs into the formal economy , helping bridge the gap in Cape Town with an online store and caf ? s stocked with products made locally by them . <p> WHAT happens when a 52-year-old beekeeper from the Khayelitsha township in Cape Town meets an entrepreneur born in 1994 ? Old school meets new energy and honey gets sold at 10 times the rate it used to , as the beekeeper is now connected to the formal market . This is what Sebastian Daniels does best , integrating the informal eKasi economy in Cape Town with mainstream market systems . <p> Daniels ' parents were both journalists and he had a good upbringing , also at times attending protests with his mom . This was the beginning of understanding how deeply segmented South African society was -- and continues to be . Delving into history and Steve Biko , Daniels desired change . <p> First , he began working with the idea of creating a Stokvel app called Yethu @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where members contribute an amount regularly and receive a lump sum payment . It 's how many in the lower-income groups in South Africa save up for buying furniture , building houses or sending kids to school . <p> " People were so interested in what we had to offer . But what ended up happening is that we started building a system around the formal economy , and lost track of who our actual customer was in the end , " explains Daniels to FORBES AFRICA . <p> " When we launched people were like , ' oh , we do n't want this , this is the bank ' . You know , and that 's kind of really where you can start to like really see that the divide still exists , and that the informal economy operates in its own way that the formal sector does n't understand and does n't want to understand . The formal sector wants it done its own way . " <p> Daniels and Siki Dibela <p> Two and a half years ago , Daniels ' dad passed away after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dad wrote ' Sunny Side Up ' breakfast reviews that featured in ' Weekend Argus ' for years . He was familiar with most of the coffee places having done reviews of over 150 establishments . <p> Inheriting that public connect , Daniels too made a commitment to go into Khayelitsha once a week , in order to understand the informal sector better . <p> Since then , he has made many connections that have eventually led to successful collaborations , such as between Siyabonga Mbaba and George Kirkinis . Mbaba runs the event , Ghetto Sessions , and it resonated with Kirkinis , who found sponsors for the music festival . <p> " That 's one of the proudest connections I made because I wanted to take someone that I felt was cool , to something that I thought was cool . And through that , a whole lot of other stuff happened , " explains Daniels . <p> " And that 's the level of where we need to understand white privilege and that kind of thing . It 's so much more than meets the eye . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do sometimes than you think . It 's often just one connection , one bit of guidance . Help someone with a pitch or a plan . Small things . It 's much smaller than you think . We need to get rid of that negative stereotype , " Daniels adds . <p> Incorporating all their products , during the lockdown , Daniels developed Ground Culture , an online store for local goods focused on bringing township entrepreneurs into the formal sector . He started strong , with 100 orders a month , and many repeat orders . <p> Ground Culture reinvests 10% of profits into the businesses it works with . Daniels says it was successful in the start , but as lockdown restrictions eased , people went back to the shops . <p> " So that 's why we 've now come back to the coffee shop to have physical space to kind of just build foundations , and share our sustainability . <p> " You know , people really want to support township entrepreneurs , there is just difficulty . It 's not accessible . Where do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on shelves , so you go back and it 's out of stock , " Daniels explains . <p> One of the biggest success stories out of Khayelitsha is the gluten-free spinach bread from Spinach King . Ground Culture receives endless calls about the product , and it 's their number one selling product by far . <p> " People get really annoyed because it 's out of stock quite frequently . And this is , again , the logistical problems that exist working between the informal economy and the formal economy ; sitting in a factory in Khayelitsha , and somehow figuring out delivery routes to get into the formal sector with a fresh loaf of bread every single day . " <p> He says the logistical problems include inventory tracking , invoicing and following up on them -- these things are not necessarily inbuilt because the informal economy is predominantly a cash-based system . <p> " It 's cash on delivery . If you borrow money , you learn that the whole community knows about it . It operates in a very different manner . So the formal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but they 've been ingrained with a different kind of upbringing . " <p> Ubusi Honey is the right example for Daniels for what he believes the formal sector can do for township business . In March 2019 , he met Zilani , a beekeeper in Khayelitsha who was originally selling 25kg of honey a month in the township . <p> " It 's been a super-cool relationship to work with him , because we come from totally different backgrounds , and to compare our differences and be really open and honest is what makes the relationship work . " <p> Over the course of 10 months , they worked together to rebrand the product and supply coffee shops . After almost a year , Ubusi Honey sold 250kg a month . <p> Similarly , Siki 's Koffee Kafe is the place Daniels has based a lot of his thinking off , and what he calls home in Khayelitsha . <p> " It 's been amazing to watch his Dibela 's progress , because it 's taught me so much about building a business in the sense that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one little step at a time . " <p> Daniels says that while he is blessed that he can fall back on family , go to the bank or get a credit card loan , in the informal settlements , there 's little going around to back any idea . <p> Dibela has worked for six years , and is now getting another coffee shop in Claremont with big names like Cassper Nyovest popping by to buy his coffee . <p> Behind the Claremont coffee shop is a clothing factory that offered Dibela the front courtyard free of charge , until he 's in a financial situation to pay rent . <p> " That 's the kind of collaboration that we need to see between the informal and the formal sector . Not the formal sector setting stringent rules on the informal sector players <p> that are just stepping into the game , just stepping into the market , " says Daniels . <p> A challenge that Dibela has faced is sourcing a roasting machine , and money for petrol to drive around to hand out samples between Khayelitsha and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ access to markets . It 's just incredibly difficult , and the resources do n't exist to bridge that divide . And so that 's kind of what we need to be talking about and enabling -- how do we make infrastructure that can allow for that to grow ? " <p> Ground Culture is looking to be the first point to market for entrepreneurs that are testing out products , to get their foot in the door , and provide an income stream . <p> Ground Culture has a second caf ? on Long Street in Cape Town , complete with local products , coffee , and food . They employ five people full-time and are looking for 30 new products for their online store . <p> Ubusi Honey 's Msokoli Zilani with Daniels <p> Tied to their grant funding , 20 entrepreneurs who have been through training are going to be showcasing their items in the online store . <p> Speaking about the grueling effects of lockdown for all businesses , and the restrictions eventually lifting , Daniels says : " The kind of stuff we are starting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business . Now , a lot of people are tired and have resources . And then on the other side , there are people that do n't have any resources , but a lot of energy and good ideas .

Do n't worry , we 're here to learn together . <p> Some vodkas are made from potatoes but others are made from a wide-ranging assortment of ingredients . The brief list below comes from Mashed : <p> Some vodkas are made from grains such as wheat , rye , and barley ... <p> Some vodkas , meanwhile , are made from milk or corn , while others are made from grapes or sugar cane . Across all vodkas , though , the overall consensus is that the main ingredient is water . <p> Today 's useless fact , which is perfect for breaking out at the next braai , is that the word vodka is derived from " voda " , which means water in Russian . <p> With that wide range of starting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all vodkas taste the same . In April 2020 , the US government finally came to its senses and agreed with a new ruling by the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau ( TTB ) : <p> Prior to this ruling , the United States defined vodka , for legal identification purposes , as a spirit " without distinctive character , aroma , taste or color " -- essentially calling it flavorless spirit and rendering all vodkas the same . <p> ... the evolution of the spirit has resulted in a wide array of distinctive-tasting vodkas , all of which get their flavor from various distillation methods , filters , base ingredients , and more . <p> South Africans are slowly cottoning onto this revolution , thanks in part to local distillers upping their game . <p> Albatross Cape Grape Vodka , inspired by the majestic birds ' independent spirit , is distilled from a selection of the finest Cape Grapes and the purified water of the Table Mountain aquifer . <p> This results in a pure , classy vodka with brilliant character and depth .

James Bond would n't lead you astray , would he ? Yup : <p> According to bartenders , " James Bond destroyed drinks . " <p> Experts note that alcohol-heavy drinks , such as martinis , Manhattans , and old fashioneds ( and vodka martinis , for that matter ) should always be stirred . <p> Shaking changes the overall texture of the drink and just does n't blend the ingredients in the same way . Stirring is always the way to go if you want to retain the quality of your favorite boozy beverage . <p> Finally , I have saved the biggest myth for last . <p> Vodka may be derived from a Russian word but that does n't mean they can lay claim to having invented the spirit : <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ By around 1430 , a monk is credited with fine-tuning the Russian vodka-making process ... But prior to that , other nearby countries , such as Poland , were making their own version of vodka -- first for medicinal purposes and then later as an aphrodisiac . <p> Image : Express To Russia <p> In the late 1400s , vodka production was also already taking place in Sweden as well . However , in 1472 , Tsar Ivan III above instituted the first state monopoly on vodka in Russia , paving the way for an economic and cultural transformation that is probably part of the reason we still associate the spirit with the country today . <p> Whenever I bring a vodka shot to my lips , I ca n't help but shout ' Nostrovia ' . <p> I just learnt I should be shouting ' Na Zdorovie !

" Up until now , most analysts have been relying on the commodity boom to carry SA 's fiscus .

While things were currently " very dark " , the various reforms that allow more significant private generation over time gives them comfort that this will not be a permanent feature , providing hope for " light at the end of the tunnel " . <p> Further worrying signs <p> BNP Paribas economist Schultz said in a research note in April that a confluence of factors in South Africa , including deep economic variables , event risk and rising wage expectations could trigger more strike action later this year as employers and employees fail to reach an agreement . <p> The country has already experienced a busy start to strike season , most notably in the commodity sector . <p> " We think a period @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , due to the historical expiration of wage agreements -- for the private sector -- in early winter , " said Shultz . <p> " We expect unions ' opening demands in the coming days/weeks to be a rise of around 7-8% .

@@91895231 <h> The Class of 2022 : Money and Meaning <p> The FORBES AFRICA 30 Under 30 class of 2022 cares about being visionaries of change and catalysts for innovation . Being on the most-anticipated list on the continent , for these young trailblazers , is not just about commerce and clout but about ensuring they represent well their countries and the diverse , heterogeneous Africa they want to serve . Celebrating its eighth edition , the list this year features the best and the brightest , but importantly , the most resilient , who have taken the time to not only shine a light on the issues plaguing Africa 's growth in a pandemic era but also work towards shifting the narrative , one tiny , tenacious step at a time . <h> METHODOLOGY <h> External Judges <p> The category experts whose role was to survey all the finalists of the 2022 30 Under 30 list ; rank them and provide commentary on each candidate . <p> BUSINESS AND TECHNOLOGY : Phuthi Mahanyele-Dabengwa , the South Africa CEO of Naspers " I am honored to have adjudicated the Business and Technology Innovation category for this year 's FORBES AFRICA 30 Under 30 list . The list comprises impressive young visionaries and risk-takers who are transforming business and society . This year 's cohort bears testament to the potential of Africa 's young leaders who represent a continent made up of about 20% of the world 's youth , according to the United Nation 's population trends ( 2015 ) . Celebrating innovation and excellence on our continent is important if we are to inspire and mobilize the next generation . " <p> CREATIVES : <p> Lebohang ' Lebo M ' Morake , South African singer , performer , producer and composer " It has been a privilege to have participated in this honorable and important project . I 've taken the last week of our European Tour reading and re-reading details provided and juxtaposing as much as possible of the various talents , making it very difficult as an exercise as each and every one of the names provided is exceptional and deserves to be in the top 30 . The KEY secret to success in global competitiveness is to be grounded in your authenticity . Embrace your African identity in excellence and quality . " <p> Gert-Johan Coetzee , South Africa 's award-winning designer " to the stars " " I think it 's quite a dynamic group and all of them are so worthy of being part of that list . It was quite a hard process judging it ... That is why I really love initiatives like this because I think it really is a boost of confidence that everyone needs in their career -- that pat on the back to tell them you are going in the right direction . " <p> HEALTH : Professor Glenda Gray , an NRF A1 rated scientist , CEO and President of the South African Medical Research Council ( SAMRC ) , a qualified pediatrician and co-founder of the **26;835;TOOLONG Perinatal HIV Research Unit in Soweto , South Africa " The addition of a science category to the FORBES AFRICA 30 Under 30 list is a very encouraging and significant step for the science community , and could not have come at a better time . Since the advent of Covid-19 , science has been at the forefront of the global response -- once again reiterating the high social value of science in tackling global threats , including health pandemics . " <p> SPORTS : Carol Tshabalala , award-winning television and radio sports broadcaster ring announcer ( boxing ) scriptwriter , voiceover artist , and executive producer " It is a great privilege to be a part of the judging panel for some amazing African talent under the age of 30 and shortlisted by FORBES AFRICA magazine . " <p> AUDIT PARTNER : FORBES AFRICA partnered again with SNG Grant Thornton to vet the business and financial statements of candidates . This involved understanding the landscape , the profitability , growth and most of all , the scalability of each business . <p> BILLIONAIRE entrepreneur Patrice Motsepe boldly said at the Forbes Under 30 Summit Africa in Gaborone , Botswana in April this year that " this is Africa 's time ... and it 's an exceptional time " . For the past seven years , FORBES AFRICA has been celebrating young leaders under the age of 30 trying to make the continent exceptional . And , this year too , it would seem the common word to describe the class of Under 30s would be ' meaning-makers ' : they do what they do to create a difference . Following the Covid-19 pandemic , beyond the categories of business , technology , creative and sports , this year , we also looked for visionaries in the healthcare sector . <p> We added Health/Science to the mix to headline young thinkers , professionals , and entrepreneurs working tirelessly on the frontline to reinvent Africa 's medical sector . The list reflects the diversity of industries and talent on this great continent of 54 countries , with nominees also applying for and shining in multiple categories at the same time . <p> For example , for the first time , we have under-30s who are making a mark in not only the creative industry but also the technology sector . Together , they are a stellar collection of individuals who have faced one of the most difficult times in history and refused to back down in the face of a global pandemic . If their firms , businesses and brands have grown during this period , it 's down to their win-no-matter-what dictum . Africa 's economic progress may sometimes be marred by coups and political unrest , staggering unemployment rates and yes , even corruption , but the one thing that has always stood by it ? <p> The resilience of its people and the positivity of the entrepreneurs firing up the engines of growth . <p> According to a report released by the African Development Bank , Africa has one of the highest entrepreneurial rates in the world with 22% of the working-age population starting businesses . In addition to this , in a 2021 study , Emerald Insights stated that entrepreneurship has become a primary response to Africa 's youth employment challenge <p> " There are 300 million young people between the ages of15 and 25 on the African continent . We have to connect with them . We have to be where they are . We have to hear what they say . The future for Africa is exciting and beautiful , " added Motsepe at the summit in Botswana , where for the first time , some of FORBES AFRICA 's 2022 Under 30 semifinalists also gathered to meet like-minded young leaders from around the world and spark exciting conversations . <p> Featuring under-30s -- the youngest being our cover star -- from Namibia to Nigeria and Senegal to South Africa , the following pages are an annual report card of the tenacity of Africa 's youth and their grit and gumption to take the offbeat , less-traveled road to success . ( The list that follows is in no particular order ) . <p> " RISKING YOUR JOB FOR 10 MINUTES OF SLEEP ... THAT 'S CALLED SACRIFICE ... " says Majimbo , donning her iconic sunglasses . " If I get up on time then what is the snooze button for , " she asks , proceeding to crunch on a crisp , perfectly-rounded potato chip . <p> When you think of that Kenyan accent , the 90s-themed sunglasses , the potato chip , and the hallmark giggle , Majimbo immediately has you thinking " iconic " . Just ask any one of her loyal followers on Instagram . <p> The Nairobi-born Majimbo , who spent her days playing chess and attending college , was not aiming to be an internet sensation with her laughter-inducing , pared-down videos when the Covid-19 pandemic hit in 2020 . <p> " I made these videos to make myself laugh and then one day my friend told me that I had gone viral , " she tells FORBES AFRICA . The videos became a sensation and Majimbo a social media star . Two years on , Majimbo sits with over 2.5 million followers on Instagram . <p> At this year 's Forbes Under 30 Summit Africa , she said : " Growing up , I always knew I would be iconic . I did n't know how I would do it , but I knew it would be done . " <p> Once Majimbo 's videos broke the internet , she immediately informed the journalism institution she was attending and dropped out ; she did not even tell her parents . <p> " I think it was a relief for me because I always say this , I never liked school , " Majimbo says . On set at the FORBES AFRICA 30 Under 30 photoshoot in Gaborone in April , Majimbo 's energy was infectious . " One thing people always get wrong about me though is that I am always happy . I have bad days too guys , " she laughs . <p> At just 20 years old , Majimbo has already graced the covers of Teen Vogue , Verified , Harper 's Bazaar and GQ South Africa . She has been featured in Maison Valentino campaigns and has won ' entertainer of the year ' awards for both GQ South Africa and FORBES WOMAN AFRICA . <p> Currently the young starlet is on her way " to make that Hollywood money " in her new home in Los Angeles where Majimbo 's short documentary , Elsa , will premiere at the Tribeca Film Festival in June . <p> " You 're going to see me on the big screen , " she promised at the summit . When it comes to her millions of followers , she always ensures that she is authentic and inspires them to go after their dreams . <p> " Enjoy your life ... it 's never that deep . People will try and discourage you and you can do whatever you want , " Majimbo says . " Chase that bag until it starts chasing you ! " <p> In an effort to not be financially excluded from university , the young BSc Applied Maths and Economics student started working at Investec Private Bank in Sandton , Johannesburg , as a client support banker , so he could pay his own tuition fees and assist his mother . <p> " I worked afternoon and night shifts while studying full time during the day , " Nkululeko Lehapa says . <p> " My biggest challenge was the fact that I could not afford formal wear ( suits ) . I then decided to make my own formal work attire and received much attention for the quality and craftsmanship of my clothing . " <p> And so Busanimen Studios was born . <p> The market for men 's tuxedos is not one that receives the most amount of attention in the fashion sector , but according to our Under 30 adjudicator , Phuthi Mahanyele-Dabengwa , " this is an important industry " . <p> " Our business model was to provide a mobile service where we sold quality suits , at the best fit , at the best price and this was superefficient , " Lehapa says . <p> Busanimen then moved from being a mobile service to having a studio in bustling Braamfontein , Johannesburg 's city center . <p> " In 2019 , we made our first R1 million ( $62,875 ) in sales in a studio with a production capacity of only three machines , " Lehapa says . " This milestone validated our existence as it meant we had a well-defined business model , however , as a result of this achievement , we found ourselves starving for growth and expansion . " Busanimen is also now working with the fashion school at the University of Johannesburg to assist students with work and career guidance . <p> Having grown up as a conservative Northern Nigerian girl , it was ingrained in Fatima Babakura that at a certain age , inevitably , she would have to finish school and then get married " to someone rich who can take care of you " . <p> But Babakura was never going to let this happen . <p> " Living in Lagos gave me a different perspective because I was living around people whose mindset was ' make your own money and then go to school so it 's not like you are waiting for someone to come and take care of you ' , " Babakura says to FORBES AFRICA . " And because I was privileged enough to experience that , I am not your average Northern Nigerian girl . " <p> Babakura is the founder , chief executive officer and designer of Timabee , an accessories brand that redefines luxury in Africa and beyond . Her sharp eye for design and curiosity of imagining a product and bringing it to life gave her the drive to start Timabee . <p> Babakura began the brand in her first year of university in Canada . She had designed a ' simple ' handbag and given it to her close family friend as a gift . <p> " I did n't even think it was that great , " she laughs . " But I could n't get it off my mind as it was very unique and I had never seen anything like it . " <p> Continuing on with her theme to be " curious " , she set out to find a manufacturer who would make this bag . <p> " Keep in mind , I was an accounting student with no business or fashion background . I did a simple Google search which led me to Alibaba where I found a company that agreed to make me a sample for $150 in December 2013 . " <p> From the pocket money she received from her parents , 17-year-old Babakura set out to spend the $150 which she ended up losing as " I interacted with a fraudulent vendor and had no clue " . <p> " Losing money did not stop me however . I was determined to find someone else to make my bag , but this time a lot more careful and I did my due diligence in researching about the company . " <p> One of the biggest highlights for Timabee was in 2021 , as the brand was approved by award-winning artist and businesswoman , Beyonc ? . <p> " Last year , when Beyonc ? ' s team compiled a list of black-owned businesses , we were honored to make the list . It just goes to show that as a small , growing brand , the work we put in every day does not go unnoticed . " <p> Having taken the pro-women approach when it comes to running her business , she wants to encourage many women , including those who may look like her to feel empowered to start a business . <p> " Starting Timabee as a young girl , there were many mistakes I made as I did not seek out mentorship earlier on due to the fear of being rejected . I learned a lot through trial and error , many of which cost the company money and could have easily been avoided had I sought mentorship , " Babakura says . " This is a major reason why I have set up Timabee global resources , a concept aimed at helping entrepreneurs in the accessory business navigate their way to global recognition and achieve success . I truly believe in paying it forward and so in the next three years , I hope to open a mentoring school specifically for high school and university students where they can have hands-on experience on the business of fashion especially as it relates to Africa . <p> " Many girls from Northern Nigeria aspire to marry rich as a " career path " sadly . I believe that through my mentorship program , the right mindset will be the foundation for future success especially since I will be an example to them through my achievements as a Northern girl . " <p> If you have ever found yourself watching prime time South African celebrity parodies , it 's probably because of this young entertainer and YouTuber . Growing up , Dambuza 's mother would take him for TV auditions every week . They would drive from the township of Soweto to various locations in Johannesburg , and even Pretoria , South Africa 's capital city . <p> Photo Supplied <p> " Despite all our efforts , hopes and prayers , I would never get the roles I auditioned for , " Dambuza says . <p> " I come from humble beginnings and was raised in a home where we could not afford a life of luxury ; everything had to be planned , and we could not simply leave home just for the fun of it . <p> " I was 12 when my mother sat me down and explained that our auditions ' endeavor was not yielding any results , nor was it financially sustainable . " <p> If only she knew . With more than a million followers on Instagram and over 750,000 subscribers on YouTube , Dambuza is today a household name in South Africa . <p> " When my career kicked off 10 years ago , I did not anticipate it to be the whirlwind that I have come to experience over the years . " <p> In March 2021 , Global Citizen reported that in response to ongoing student protests across South Africa , Dambuza launched the #R10GoesALongWay initiative to help students struggling to access funds to keep attending university . <p> Our judge for the creatives category , Lebohang " Lebo M " Morake , South African singer , performer , producer and composer , said it best : " Animation is critical and does not get attention on the continent . " <p> For 28-year-old Lwazi Msipha , it is about making sure that it gets all the spotlight it deserves . As the founder of Old Fashioned Youngin , an animation company with the sole purpose of creating animation that tells our African stories unfiltered , he has created and directed a TV show for Cartoon Network , an American division of Warner Bros cable television channel . <p> The show , My Cartoon Friend , is the network 's first-ever 13-episode hybrid animated show , profiling the adventures and dynamics of an artist who lives with a cartoon friend in real life . <p> " I created the animated show , which is still airing on Cartoon Network , with limited resources and skills . When I received the call from them , I had no prior experience in what they were asking of me , but I did not let that stop me , " Msipha says . <p> " It is not the ' norm ' that the African talent needs to be exposed to this medium for its sustainability and capacity to keep a child 's spirit and soul engaged through art the most , " Morake said in his evaluation of Msipha . <p> " We are excited over Lwazi 's future also because we are encouraged by his sense of content and quality . " <p> A lot of us have been through this , when your phone breaks or your screen cracks and the first thing that comes to mind is ' who can fix it and will all my data be recovered ' ? <p> Do n't fear when Mr Nell is near . <p> When Jaen-Jacques Nell was in grade 12 , his parents encouraged him to find a job , as they had been retrenched during a difficult period in South Africa . <p> " I first went for an interview at South Africa 's biggest retailers for a job , which offered me R21 ( $1.30 ) per hour ; while waiting to see if I 'd be chosen to become a shelf-packer , I went into a cell phone shop by Grey Owl Centre in Centurion and also asked if there were any vacancies . The gentlemen at the store , Ali , said I could start work . " <p> Ali taught him to fix smartphones and tablets and they struck a deal where Nell would bring in the business using social media and Ali would offer his services . Nell says he owes a lot to Ali . " He trusted me to pay him after I got paid . Ali was my first-ever creditor , I had no money to pay him upfront for the work or parts . <p> I was privileged enough to have a motorbike and promote CellMidFix ( CMF ) , which gave me the edge . I could collect the broken devices and delivery them the same or the next day , which no one was doing . <p> " Starting with zero rand , and being able to do a turnover of R10 Million ( $628,000 ) in our last year , is extremely challenging in a growing business , " Nell says . " Our humble team of four staff members has allowed us to grow , and add value to our workforce . " <p> " Jaen-Jacques is a true entrepreneur who has overcome obstacles of tough circumstances and seen himself through . I look forward to seeing his upward trajectory in time to come , " attests FORBES AFRICA 30 Under 30 list business and tech category judge Phuthi Mahanyele-Dabengwa , the South Africa CEO of Naspers . <p> Born in Giyani and raised in Polowane in South Africa 's Limpopo province , he started his music career whilst in Grade 7 , quite by chance . <p> " The keyboard player at church had to leave , " Musa Makamu recalls . " And I was the only one left at that period of time " . <p> In a 2021 interview with FORBES AFRICA , Makamu , popularly known as Musa Keys , revealed that music was not his first choice ; civil engineering was . " I studied sound technology at Damelin ( an Afrikaans technical school ) . <p> " And it was slowing my growth mainly because I felt like what was being taught , I knew already . You know , if they teach me about sound recording , I already record people ... So , then I dropped out and I started my career . " <p> His debut extended play ( EP ) Widlysm boasting hit song Samarian Boy is still one of his biggest productions to date , the track 's success was powered by the love showered on him by the public . <p> " People were like , ' yo , this is massive ' . They made me love that song ! " Makamu says . " My unique offering is weirdness . My music is weird in the things that are being sung and how they are sung . I 'm trying to capture the whole world with a universal sound that caters for . " <p> What Covid-19 exposed to many across the globe , but specifically on the African continent , is that access to affordable and reliable medication is easier said than done . <p> Franck Verzef ? saw this as an issue even when he was a student . He had stumbled on the work of a third-year student who was looking at different ways to differentiate between real medication and counterfeits . <p> " The research was based solely on superficial characteristics like packaging font , color , density but not on the chemical concentration of its constituents , " Verzef ? says . " I then wondered how I could know for sure if a drug is true or falsified without comparing the different chemical components and their concentrations . " <p> Having enough capital , Verzef ? conducted his research and experiments in the Democratic Republic of the Congo , Nigeria , Cameroon and Ivory Coast . He wanted to " understand how drugs are falsified from a chemical point of view and which technology would be effective and adaptable to African realities " . <p> " I then built a professional team and started TrueSpec-Africa . Today , it develops an artificial intelligence called RAI ( Real Active Ingredient ) , which coupled with a spectrometry device , enables identification of the chemical composition of drugs and structuring the data obtained in less than 20 seconds , " <p> Verzef ? explains . Besides being a member of both the United Nations ' International Telecommunication Union ( ITU ) and the World Health Organization 's ( WHO ) Artificial Intelligence for Health ( AI4H ) , Verzef ? has also been ranked by the WHO among the 30 best African innovators . <p> Like many of our Under 30 listers , this founder and CEO too had humble beginnings . Orphaned at the age of 10 , Magayi grew up in Mukuru , one of the biggest slums in Nairobi , and became a mother at age 16 . <p> When her two-year-old daughter suffered a severe burn injury caused by a " traditional stove " , Magayi was moved to provide safer cooking technologies for her community . <p> " When I started the business , the plan was to distribute or manufacture cookstoves that were stable enough to limit the risk of danger to children under the age of 10 , " Magayi explains . <p> " But then we saw that the greater need was to fix household air pollution and fuel consumption for households living under $2 a day . So that was the dream . That 's what we 're working on currently . " <p> Having won the Waislitz Global Citizen Award in 2019 , The World Bank 's inaugural SDGs and the AWIEF Empowerment Award in 2019 , Magayi has been recognized and awarded for her fight against household air pollution and global poverty and her work to empower marginalized women in Kenya . <p> " She 's phenomenal , " says Tine Ward , Founder of The Darfur Project . " I mean , at length , to be honest , I could see Charlot running for president of Kenya or something at some point , she has that kind of gravitas . There 's something about her . " <p> ( Photo by Jean Catuffe/Getty Images ) <p> The Olympics called her the " African breaststroke queen " and the ' latest breaststroke diamond out of South Africa " when she won the gold medal and set the world record in the 200-meter breaststroke and also won the silver medal in the 100-meter breaststroke at the Olympic Games in Tokyo last year . <p> Schoenmaker was brought up in Roodepoort , a town in the Gauteng province of South Africa , before moving to the country 's capital city , Pretoria . <p> At the 2022 FORBES WOMAN AFRICA Leading Women Summit in March , Schoenmaker said : " I do n't know if sports was my first love all the time ... But I do think you get to love the sport ... When I was younger , I used to do a lot of sports so choosing swimming as the only option was not on the cards for me . But I do think when I pursued my swimming career , I fell in love with it . " <p> And what does being on the FORBES AFRICA Under 30 class of 2022 mean to her ? <p> " It 's amazing , " Schoenmaker says . " To think that you are one of the 30 from the whole of Africa to make it on there , it is an amazing achievement and such an honor . I definitely do n't know how to describe the feeling , it 's always difficult to say . When that moment comes , you kind of like feel shocked . " <p> This is a story that started off with ? 50,000 ( $120 ) in her mother 's backyard in rural Ajegunle , Nigeria and a paint brush . <p> Photo supplied <p> " I just completed my university education and as soon as I got back home , I applied to train under master artist , Wallace Ejoh , " Tonia Nneji says . " I started out with ? 50,000 from my mum , which was to be repaid as soon as I sold my first painting , which I did about a month later ... I could only paint in the backyard for a specific time every day to avoid disturbing other tenants and to prevent the younger kids from touching or ingesting oil paints . " <p> From a backyard studio to being profiled by renowned African author , Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie for Harper 's Bazaar in February 2020 . In the same year , in Vogue , New York Times , Elephant Magazine and the Los Angeles Magazine . <p> " I had my first solo exhibition at Rele Gallery , Lagos in 2020 and my works are part of important collections around the world including Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie and the Louis Vuitton Foundation . " <p> A lot of Nneji 's work derives from her personal experiences with the Nigerian healthcare system as she has been diagnosed with PCOS ( polycystic ovarian syndrome ) . <p> " I wanted my artistic practice to help educate women who suffer from the same ailment , as well as the people around them , " Nneji says . " I wanted to help them understand that there is hope , no matter how bad their situations are . With my work , I am also shedding light on the failed healthcare system in Nigeria as well as the practice of extortion and arbitrary judgment that precludes access to religious spaces in Nigeria . " <p> When a 16-year-old Brett Lyndall Singh from Pietermaritzburg , South Africa , was unable to perform CPR on his sick grandmother , he used this traumatic experience as his calling to become a doctor . <p> " It kind of cemented the idea of me making sure that I have the skills to be able to save people 's lives , " Singh tells FORBES AFRICA . <p> The congenial doctor has a spring in his step when we meet him , as he speaks about his journey around the world in medicine and health . <p> " Unfortunately , I could n't study in South Africa due to a lack of space in medical school , " Singh explains . " And I took a leap of faith and applied to universities around the world and got a great offer from China . And so , I moved to China when I was 17 going on 18 back in 2011 . I then studied at Wenzhou Medical University for my bachelor of medicine and surgery . I was then able to do some internships and electives at the Royal Melbourne Hospital in Australia . " <p> When Covid-19 became a vast and ugly reality across the globe , Singh spent days in Covid wards in China , and says was even invited by President Xi Jinping and the Communist party to go to Beijing to volunteer during the pandemic as one of two African doctors . <p> Singh is now also involved in South Africa 's national response to Covid-19 and is also currently the chairperson of the Global Value Chains working group of the Department of Trade and Industry Cooperation 's national healthcare master plan . <p> " My job is to unlock the strategy and investment and opportunities around ' made in South Africa ' medical devices and healthcare products . So , as a doctor , getting involved in research and development and in the healthcare business started with my thesis in combatting sub-Saharan Africa 's malnutrition ... <p> " I am helping to create a device that could make a doctor 's life better , and could also contribute to stimulating the economy of South Africa and Africa ... And I 'm trying to be the bridge to help technology transfer like what we did in our project for rapid antigen , as well as component manufacturing , so that we can stimulate the economy , do more research and development and go forward . " <p> When Covid-19 first broke in 2020 , whilst with Plame Biotech , Singh 's company Alpha and Omega MedTech contributed to medical advancements in coronavirus diagnostics by way of the KOVIFAST Rapid Antigen Test , which compared to a PCR Test , only needing 15 minutes to identify a test , rather than six to 18 hours . <p> Alpha and Omega MedTech was soon approved by CDC Africa 's Africa Medical Supplies Platform as an official supplier of Diagnostic and Therapeutic Medical Devices . Singh 's company has one of the youngest founding teams to hold a South African Health Products Regulatory Authority ( SAHPRA ) license . His work on diagnostics , and its pairing with digital healthcare in epidemiological tracking was presented at the First International Conference on Public Health in Africa hosted by CDC Africa . <p> Photo Supplied <p> This is an industry that is not for the faint-hearted . <p> And Lehl ? Bald ? has proven that being resilient is a key attribute when it comes to being a journalist , as the editor for a leading medium for business and economy news in Nigeria . <p> Prior to being the editor of Weekender , BusinessDay 's first Saturday publication for millennials , Bald ? ' s journey into journalism and media quite happened by accident . <p> " Growing up , I lived in eight countries but I describe myself as a pan-African person , " Bald ? says . <p> And her journey in journalism began because of her grandmother . <p> " My grandmother had served as a journalist and later press secretary for the post-colonial Senegalese presidential administration in the 60s . I always felt a void because I never got the chance to meet her and thought that she had passed before her time , " Bald ? says . " In some bizarre way , I felt that it was my calling and could not wait to start what was the beginning of what I thought would be my career in journalism . " <p> Besides being one of the youngest newspaper editors in Africa , Bald ? has partnerships with some of the biggest names like the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation , Ford Foundation , Nestl ? , and Endeavor . She is also an Acumen West Africa fellow 2021 and International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) Youth Fellow 2021 . The Future Awards Africa gave her the 2020 Intrapreneurship award and she was also listed on the 2020 Top 50 Women in Media in Africa and the Top 50 Young Women in Development in Africa 2020 . <p> " In fighting the spread of Covid-19 and mitigating its effects , a collective brainpower of the medical health research community was required , " says Under 30 Adjudicator in the Science/Health category , Professor Glenda Gray . <p> Words like ' collective ' and ' collaboration ' are at the forefront of Sikander Kalla 's mind , especially when talking about Covid-19 and mental health . This is exactly why the 29-year-old clinical psychologist founded Cohesive Collaboration . <p> " This is an entity of the practice that seeks to strengthen values of sustainable collaboration , mindful cohesion , rehabilitative redress and optimized development by promoting mental health awareness , as well as offering consulting services and wellness programs to corporate partners in an attempt to normalize mental health in South Africa , " Kalla says . <p> In an academic report released by the Psychological Society of South Africa , titled Mental health and Covid-19 in South Africa , it was noted that public mental health has also been negatively affected by the pandemic , and this comes against a backdrop of an ailing mental healthcare system . <p> " We argue that the psychology profession , as a mental health profession and behavioral science , working as part of a multidisciplinary team , ought to play a significant role in addressing the mental health ramifications of the pandemic , " the report reads . <p> " The pandemic has made us realize that valuing our mental health should not be deemed a luxury , but rather a necessity that is essential to any framework of functioning that embodies values of optimized wellbeing , sustainable solutions , cohesive engagement and collaborative efforts -- all of which I think are fundamental to Africa 's development , " Kalla says . <p> Kalla currently also treats patients in the Pretoria region and assists medical students with optimizing their mental health and overall development through the consulting position he holds at University of Pretoria 's Faculty of Health Sciences , whilst also sitting on the Health Sciences Health Committee as an expert in his field . Besides also having a private practice in Sandton , Kalla assists community members at Folateng Clinic . <p> In a testimonial written for Kalla , Dr Zuleikha Ahmed , Senior Counselling Psychologist at the University of Pretoria , states : " Mr Kalla , at such a young age , has been quite involved in Mental Health Awareness Advocacy . He has also flourished in both the business and Entrepreneurial aspects . He has utilized innovative ways to increase the awareness on mental health in both the business and professional world . " <p> This was a company born out of a desire to tackle injustice . <p> " I grew up learning that the only voice which mattered was that of the wealthy , " Sandra Chukwudozie tells FORBES AFRICA . " I watched people in my country suffer inhumane treatment , because a flawed system , which should have protected their interests , was set up in a way that only benefited those at the top of management . This fueled a passion within me to want to change the status quo and break the cycle of injustice that has been ongoing for decades . In this regard , I 've always viewed myself as a rebel with a cause or somewhat of a revolutionist . " <p> Even though Chukwudozie grew up in an " oil and gas family business " , her ultimate aim was to champion the diversification of her corporation by introducing clean energy . <p> Unfortunately , Chukwudozie presented the plans to her father which ended in a " bitter spat " . <p> " That singular moment was a defining one for me , because I knew that my journey would be lonely . I was fighting for the future , against the status quo , and against ' the system ' . It was time to show how much I believed in myself and how badly I wanted this change . Failure was an option I could never accept . " <p> This rebel with a cause took her monthly salary of $1,200 to create Salpha Energy , a renewable energy company that focuses on solar solutions whose core focus is affordability and access to clean energy . <p> " I call my team members ' alphas on the move ' because we are on an aggressive mission to bring clean and affordable solar energy through the design of innovative solar products across the African continent , while at the same time growing African talent which we hope will benefit the continent as a whole . " <p> According to the World Wide Fund for Nature 's 2017 report , 10 million tons of food goes to waste every year in South Africa . " Of this , fruits , vegetables , and cereals account for 70% of the wastage and loss primarily throughout the food supply chain -- from farm to fork , " the report further stated . Part of this problem is easily associated with water pollution . <p> Rand Water , a South African water utility that supplies potable water to the Gauteng province , further said that " in South Africa , the scarce fresh water is decreasing in quality because of an increase in pollution and the destruction of river catchments , caused by urbanization , deforestation , damming of rivers , destruction of wetlands , industry , mining , agriculture , energy use , and accidental water pollution . " <p> In 2017 , when severe drought hit South Africa , a younger Himkaar Singh did not see a solution in sight . <p> " So , I decided to leave the country to study a Master 's degree in Water Management in Germany to try find a solution . By using my life savings , I lived in Germany for five months , and then Vietnam for five months , followed by five months in Jordan , to get diverse perspectives on how to address the water problem . " <p> It was during this time that Singh discovered that the soil 's impact on the water cycle is the most significant factor out of any other related to water management . According to Singh , there was one critical aspect of soil which is particularly important ; the organic matter content . The organic matter is what enables the soil to act as a sponge , holding onto water when it rains , and letting the water infiltrate into the natural groundwater system . <p> " I realized that if we want to create lasting change to South Africa 's water situation , we need to repair our soil 's ability to hold onto water by adding organic matter back to the soil , " Singh says . <p> When he came back to Johannesburg in 2019 , he immediately founded The Compost Kitchen , which collects food waste from households on a weekly basis and then recycles the waste into vermicompost using thousands of earthworms . Singh 's business gives the vermicompost back to the customer each month , which they can use in their vegetable garden to repair their soil , and customers pay R190 ( $11.79 ) per month for this circular economy model . <p> " Singh has used his life savings to complete the research and to develop a business that is a key sustainability-focused organization , " Phuthi Mahanyele-Dabengwa said about the candidate . " He is doing so successfully which is also hugely valuable . " <p> All eyes fell on Phupho Gumede as he strutted into the Image Lounge studio in Botswana " ready for his close up " . This was true testament to the story of how a young " isiZulu queer " stylist from Durban , KwaZulu-Natal , had made it . <p> " I was always the smartest in the class , the most awarded at school year-end ceremony and an overall over-achiever , " Gumede tells FORBES AFRICA . " That made me really gravitate towards a career in academia . It was until I was 11 years old , when the fashion bug bit . " <p> Unfortunately , having grown up in a traditional African household , it was expected after he matriculated from school he would have to go to university . And that is exactly what happened , as he studied a Bachelor of Science in Biology at the University of KwaZulu-Natal . <p> " I was miserable because I could n't have time to even dress myself up , " Gumede says . " The need for fashion started suffocating me . Halfway through the second semester , I deregistered . I packed my bags and moved to Johannesburg without my family 's knowledge and I was ready to tackle a career in fashion . " <p> From being an in-house stylist for Kwenta Media , he is now styling looks for the likes of GLAMOUR , GQ , Reebok , and Netflix ( to name a few ) . <p> " All the ups , the downs , the sleepless nights and 48-hour shifts I 've put on to get where I am and it inspires me even more . Ten years ago , I would have never thought I would be here , " Gumede says . <p> The world of sports has always been very male-dominated and this is no different in the online gaming realm of e-sports . This does not stop Sylvia Gathoni , also popularly known as QueenArrow , from literally and virtually KNOCKING OUT stereotypes . <p> " I have had to deal with my hard work being looked down upon by some , as they felt that I had only achieved what I had because of my gender and not because of the concerted effort I put in to become better at the game , " Gathoni says . <p> Her career in professional gaming began in 2017 at the East African Gaming Convention where she participated in the Mortal Kombat XL tournament and came in fourth place . <p> " I decided to continue gaming professionally because I enjoyed the rush that came with competing and the fact that I got to challenge myself to become a better competitor through an available community where I could ask questions about the game and practice with them . Since then , I been part and parcel of the Tekken fighting game scene in Nairobi . " <p> In 2018 , she became the first Kenyan and East African to be signed to XiT Gaming , an American e-sports club based in New Jersey , United States . Gathoni is currently part of the UYU , an American e-sports club as a Tekken player and content creator . She is also a member of the Athletes , Players and Communities Commission on the Global Esports Federation ( G.E.F ) , representing Kenya and the African region " by offering my insights as to how the G.E.F can foster good and healthy relations with the gaming and e-sports community and ensuring that Africa 's interests on the committee and federation are represented " . <p> Photo Supplied <p> From Davido to Burna Boy , and then Bonang Matheba to Kehlani , AshLuxe that has been worn by some the biggest names in entertainment . The hands behind the sewing machine , sketch board and business is Nigerian-born Olayinka Ashogbon , known as Yinka Ash . <p> While at Caleb University in Lagos studying Biochemistry , Ashogbon says he always had a flair for fashion . <p> " During my years in the university , I was recognized among my peers as well-dressed and many would often tell me to help them source clothes and shoes , " Ashogbon says . <p> With a small loan from his father of $2,000 , in 2014 , he started to buy and import discounted items he found online to resell to the already growing client base he gained on his Instagram business page . <p> This has now led him to becoming a recognized brand that prides itself in its collection ranging from men 's clothing to women 's attire , and androgynous ready-to-wear clothing . <p> " This is revered for incorporating multiculturalism and ethnographic references from Lagos to Johannesburg , Geneva , Paris , and Florida , " Ashogbon adds . " Our pop-up stores held in London and South Africa in 2021 furthers the brand 's exertion in seamlessly tapping into the global streetwear market . This has shaped a unique label identity . " <p> Photo Supplied <p> The ever-growing need for commuting services is something that needs to be prioritized in countries across Africa . Shahzeb Memon , the Global Head of Transportation As A Service at unicorn ridesharing company SWVL told FORBES AFRICA in December that : " There are millions with not enough transport opportunities available , and the transport options available for people are limited . " <p> At the forefront of trying to solve these issues is Velani Mboweni with his company LULA Loop , a venture backed mobility startup ( launched in 2016 ) that connects company commuters to private shuttles to enable sustainable and productive commuting in Africa . <p> " This is a business founded with the mission to harness Africa 's demographic dividend by connecting them to economic opportunity one shared ride at a time , " says Mboweni . <p> Since its inception , Mboweni has grown the company " six times in the past year , doubled the team size , reduced hundreds of tons of CO2 from the environment , scaled to three new cities , and quietly raised millions of dollars during the global pandemic from world-leading institutional investors " . He has been recognized as a Top 200 Young South African by Mail &amp; Guardian and a Top 30 Under 40 by Fast Company magazine . <p> " He 's passionate about creating a positive social impact and economic opportunities , whether through LULA or in his personal capacity , " says Mboweni 's co-founder Xabiso Nodada . " He will never say no to helping someone , whether he knows the person or not is irrelevant , if he can help , he will . He enjoys bringing people together , people from different walks of life , different cultures , different ages , different backgrounds . His love for the continent and its different cultures is one of his most amazing qualities . " <p> Photo Supplied <p> In 2008 , the International Conference On Multi-National Construction Projects released a study Women In South African Construction concluding that women are underrepresented in the construction industry and that although they may face many challenges and barriers , women are competent to rightfully take up a position on-site within the industry . South African Builder further noted the Register of the Construction Industry Development Board ( CIDB ) states that a total of *44,100 construction enterprises of which 48% are owned by women . <p> " As we are women in business , we often get discriminated against and not taken seriously , we have had to work hard to prove ourselves and to tackle this male-dominated industry , " says Kekeletso Tsiloane . <p> Ironically , it was their father who inspired her and her sister to start the business . <p> " Our father had a construction company , he would take us to site often and without a plan , we would resort to our own comforts and for me that was on site where trenches , big machinery , and the manual labor was being done , I 'd walk around and inside the trenches asking lots of questions . " <p> In the same breath , Tsiloane was always concerned about waste and in 2016 started taking interest in the green economy ( recycling and upcycling ) . She then dove into the trenches of research and approached her family about the idea of making bricks out of plastic . <p> " My family and I started prototyping the idea in my mother 's yard at home , " Tsiloane explains . " We bought waste from waste pickers and from landfills ... We started not only the product innovation but the know-how and machinery , with my sister 's salary , savings , and small profit we made from the construction projects . " <p> Photo Supplied <p> Born and raised in Malawi 's capital city , Lilongwe , Mona-Lisa Das ' main objective has always been to create more opportunities for African women . <p> " My mother and grandmother have given me great strength as they empowered other females around them . Witnessing my mother accommodating other women who were finding their feet in Ireland by any way she could help them to assimilate , really influenced me in what I do today . " <p> Das moved to Ireland in early 2011 to pursue a degree in Business Management , but in 2013 co-founded a record label as head of AR and helped discover artists like Masego , a Jamaican-American musician , and many more local Irish artists . In 2018 , she then launched Gxrlcode , a platform amplifying female talent worldwide . The brand has worked with high-profile brands like Heineken and PrettyLittleThing , as well as received recognition in British Vogue for empowering and supporting women worldwide . <p> Daniel Da Trindade , Creative Director at the Embassy of Ireland Malawi , stated in his testimonial for Das : " She has an uncanny ability to bring the best out of Malawi as she constantly markets it to brands in Ireland . She has created a massive potential for jobs in the creative sector in Malawi and ... On a personal note , I am a testament to the effect that she has on people . " <p> Photo Supplied <p> Muhle Ndwalane says he has always had leadership qualities , an innovative mindset , and business acumen . His international exposure has propelled him for great success in his journey . <p> Besides highlighting the importance of frontline workers , Covid-19 did a fantastic job of showing how digital marketers are the creative backbone of corporates . <p> At the helm of this trend is Ndwalane 's company , Asante Solutions -- a digital solutions agency that delivers digital marketing and technology-based solutions to clients . One of them , Clinalytics , a healthcare technology company that gives healthcare professionals tools that enable them to provide healthcare services , talks about how quickly Ndwalane 's company adapted to creating content for the health space . <p> " I was very impressed with the way Asante Solutions carried out the work , from analysis to implementation and post-production support . Their analysis was always very complete , and easily understood by users and management so different system extension options could be evaluated with all relevant information , " says Founder and Managing Director at Clinalytics , Jabulani Nyembe . <p> " I feel like we Asante Solutions are at the forefront to drive solutions to organizations so that they can grow , optimize , and create a competitive advantage based on the customers ' needs while driving human experience . This will ensure that our client 's future is well-shaped and propelled for future business activities , " says Ndwalane . <p> In her assessment of Ndwalane 's business , Phuthi Mahanyele-Dabengwa notes that " Muhle is building a creative digital business that has potential to play a key role for many corporates . " <p> This was not the only time Luvindao noticed big discrepancies in healthcare . Having lost both her parents when she was six years old , she realized the disparities between healthcare afforded to those in the lowest socioeconomic groups and those in higher income groups . <p> This is how the journey for the medical doctor and health advocate began in Namibia . Luvindao is also the founder of one of Africa 's first free online medical consultation platforms , One Step at a Time , and a health expert for the Office of the First Lady of Namibia , Monica Geingos . <p> " I 've personally seen a lot of these kinds of lists , " Geingos tells FORBES AFRICA when approached by the Under 30 team for her take on Luvindao . " And a lot of the people end up on these lists and you do n't find them anywhere 10 years later . I 'm certain that you will find Esperance somewhere 10 years from now . And the Forbes list I think wants to have people who in the future are going to go out there and set the world on fire . And I think it 's brilliant . " <p> For Luvindao , it has never been about the exposure or being celebrated by a newspaper that wrote that she is " a Namibian doctor awarded by the Queen for offering 44,000 online consultations or telehealth services " . She says for her , it 's about how does this help people in areas not always helped . <p> " It was an ' aha ' moment , " she tells FORBES AFRICA . " Because when we did the interviews later to explain how we reached so many people in the rural areas , a lot of people were like , ' oh , wow , you can do that , and why did we never think of that ' . <p> An enlightening moment for me was when the Minister of Health in Namibia reached out to me after this article , and said , ' I want to work with you , because I think for a lot of us , we have limited healthcare access to hospitals and clinics ' . " <p> With a passion for business growth and solutions-based interventions to the transport constraints among Small and Medium Enterprises ( SMEs ) , in 2017 , Daniel Mukisa started Ridelink , a ride-hailing service that links travelers to cars for transportation in Uganda . <p> " I fully conceptualized the number one problem with why SMEs do n't scale and many of them die in their infancy in developing countries is due to transport , " Mukisa says . " Transport has been the top cause of SME failure accounting for up to 40% of all the costs in the supply chain . " <p> According to the Center for Strategic and International Studies ( CSIS ) , in Africa , SMEs provide an estimated 80% of jobs across the continent , representing an important driver of economic growth . <p> Sub-Saharan Africa alone has 44 million micro , small , and medium enterprises , almost all of which are micro . <p> Growing up in rural Eastern Uganda , Mukisa 's mother ran an agricultural produce store where the whole family was expected to participate and contribute towards the daily running . <p> " I noticed that a lot of the proceeds from the store went towards transporting the produce from the store to the market . I challenged myself to come up with a solution that would curb the high transport costs that ate deep into the bottom-line of our small business . Ridelink was born out of the need to solve the mismatch between the transporter and the producer and has since cut transport costs of its users by 30% . " <p> In a testimonial written for Mukisa , Thokoza Mjo , the head of the Anzisha Prize Fellowship , that Mukisa is a part of , stated : " Daniel has demonstrated a great ability to build a business of value that has the opportunity to make a significant contribution to youth unemployment across the continent . " <p> Photo Supplied <p> This is a candidate who got his " first taste for entrepreneurship " at the age of 15 . <p> " I was developing , playing , and selling video games while also working part-time with SOKO LTD , a printing and publishing company owned by my father , " Walter Isoko says . <p> He co-founded Flux Technology Africa in 2016 , an enterprise software solutions company providing technology solutions and services for SMEs , blue-chip organizations , governments , and institutions in Africa . <p> " I am responsible for the business development and overall operations in Africa . Under my leadership , Flux Technology Africa has handled major IT projects for major blue-chip firms and global brands with a capital base of over $100 million . " <p> A key vision for Isoko is to bridge the technology gap between Africa and the rest of the developed world as this has been a major concern for the Nigerian government and private sector in the last decade , according to Isoko . So far , the organization has trained over 10,000 youths and children from underserved areas in West Africa . <p> " I am very committed to this , for me , it is a matter of vision and it is clearly in line to tackle unemployment , bridging the technology gap and poverty that have hindered the capacity of many to do work and earn an income in a continent like Africa , with millions of multitalented people and limitless opportunities . I am fixing this problem . " <p> " I founded this company when I was sick , " Carla Frankel says with a shaky voice , when we meet in Botswana in April for the Forbes Under 30 Summit Africa . When she says that , the people around her listen , as she unravels to FORBES AFRICA the story of how she created the Top Drawer Collection , retailing personalized luxury sleepwear , in South Africa . <p> " In life-altering moments , I stood at the crossroads and pushed boundaries and used negative experiences to create really great products and experiences , rather than choosing the road of defeat and victimization . " <p> At the age of 21 , Frankel was walking around campus and suddenly felt her feet burn , which actually turned out to be Sagittal Sinus Thrombosis . <p> " In other words , I had a stroke ! " she recounts . Two years before that , Frankel had already been diagnosed with two autoimmune diseases ; antiphospholipid syndrome ( APS ) as well as Lupus . During her second year at university , she had another stroke during a four-hour exam . This resulted in three weeks of hospitalization and Frankel being unable to finish her exams . <p> It was during the recovery phase that she realized that the only thing in that " dark period " that lifted her spirits was the pair of matching pajamas her mom had bought for her from retail chain Woolworths . <p> " We would make quite a moment of them , put on face masks , and watch our favorite movies . Those pajamas with my mom were n't just pajamas -- they were a layer of comfort and safety . They were an armor of sorts to me that helped me feel beautiful and safe even while so disconnected from myself , in this foreign body that did n't feel like mine . " <p> Coming into this moment feels almost full circle for Frankel as she admits that she started reading FORBES AFRICA 30 Under 30 lists five years ago and had always been inspired by the stories of the founders in them . <p> " I noticed that a large commonality in each person was overcoming challenges to create solutions and innovate . Most of all , I found inspiration in how most of these people made the choice to voyage forward into the path of success despite circumstances being against them . <p> " A near-death experience is the reason Top Drawer Collection exists , and with every negative health experience I face , a new , even better product is born to meet the need that I would only know how to fulfill by walking through the thorns and making it to the other side . " <p> Within six months of starting Top Drawer , Frankel says she received orders from South African celebrities such as actor-producer Connie Ferguson and influencer Kefilwe Mabote . Corporates like Unilever were also ordering sleepwear from her . Even when Covid-19 hit , she still managed her business . <p> " We have reached the market cap for the units that can be produced locally . I sell what I have , and there is a waiting list unbelievably long for those who did n't manage to secure a set on a restock day . I am very grateful for the desire for the product . " Frankel says . <p> A lot of the time , the focus is always on the cover star , the subject or just the muse ; never the person behind the lens . The saying ' the picture is worth a thousand words ' is the perfect description for Apampa Owolabi , also known as Dammy Twitch , as he walks into the studio to meet us in Gaborone . <p> His tall presence captures everyone 's attention but his quiet demeanor tells us that there is definitely more to the story ... more or less a thousand words . <p> " In 2011 , I developed an interest in photography . I currently ca n't decide if nature sponsored my interest or it was just an excitement to bond with the camera my uncle had gifted me as I started taking the pictures of nature , " says Owolabi . <p> When Owolabi was at Taidob College at the time in Nigeria , he wanted to open his own studio but did n't have the finances . Self-taught in video editing watching YouTube tutorials , Owolabi decided to use the only N50,000 ( $120 ) saved up from his allowance and rented the equipment to book his very first photoshoot . Unfortunately , it did not go according to plan . <p> " I never got paid , the client changed his mind about the video and would n't take my calls . I could n't call home for more money as I could n't justify the ask . <p> So I sucked it up and lived off my friends for the next couple of weeks , " Owolabi tells FORBES AFRICA . <p> " This is a good place to insert an inspirational quote about tenacity but nothing about the hunger and dependency of those few weeks inspired me . I was ready to quit and just focus on school . " <p> But thankfully , Owolabi continued with his passion and has been the man behind the lens for some of the biggest names in entertainment like Jimmy Fallon , the Grammy Awards , Wizkid and Davido . <p> " The Nigerian A-list artist Davido was performing at the Lagos City Marathon and I got a DM from his management asking me to come to take pictures and videos of him . His team had commissioned three guys for the same job and on delivery had commissioned three guys for the same job and on delivery , they loved my pictures and videos and brought me on board as a team member ... This mindset got me on tour with him to about 30 countries and that was a major breakthrough in my first year of video directing . " <p> Photo Supplied <p> According to a study released by the African Leadership University , in 2015 , Euromonitor International estimated that $1.1 billion worth of shampoos , relaxers , and hair lotions were sold in South Africa , Nigeria , and Cameroon . Furthermore , according to a 2014 Reuters report , the dry hair industry which includes weaves , extensions and wigs is also estimated at $6 billion a year . <p> Part of this very lucrative market is Natasha Kasanda Chikonde , who began her business while in her fourth year of medical school in St. Petersburg , Russia . <p> " After having saved for a year , in March 2015 , I had about $3,000 and I took my first solo flight to China to go and purchase synthetic hair that I was going to sell on the Zambian market . " <p> When Chikonde arrived in China , she had bought " the worst batch of hair which never sold and no one bought " . Devastated that all her savings were depleted , Chikonde went back to medical school and eventually graduated in 2016 , soon thereafter , she started practicing at the University Teaching Hospital of Zambia . <p> " I was not your conventional doctor because I was always told that I had the best hair in the hospital by my patients and fellow doctors . Most people asked me ... ' why hair ' , and I said ' hair is every woman 's crown ' . So , I wanted to empower women and make them embrace their beauty with a variety of different hairstyles . " <p> She began saving up her monthly salary to start Hair Kween ( labeled a luxury hair brand on social media ) and Chikonde has sold hair worth about ZMW1,000,000,000 ( $59,000 ) in April 2021 . <p> " This made me believe that it is possible to achieve anything if you do n't give up regardless of your background , social status and economic status , " Chikonde says . <p> Photo Supplied <p> " I started the business with 3,000 Kenya Shillings that I used for the name search and domain registration , " says Dr Joan Ruguru Kimani . <p> In a world where parenting has been made difficult due to finances or emotional instability and now especially coupled with Covid-19 , Kimani 's whole aim is to bring back that positive spin on parenting . In addition to that , educating parents on children 's health . <p> The idea of Exciting Parenting began when she was a student in a small residence room . <p> " I saw this as an opportunity to offer professional information in regards to parenting and child health . Other topics such as marriage and real estate have information sources from people who have dedicated their whole lives into doing this kind of work . I realized the field of parenting was pretty scarce , " says Kimani . <p> In a testimonial for Kimani , Jomo Kenyatta University Senior Lecturer , Chairman and Dean for the School of Medicine , Dr Justus Maingi Simba says : " At her age , Joan has done what most individuals would achieve in their lifetime . I am confident the opportunity presented to her by being in this class will help her make the world a better place than she found it .

@@92088233 <h> Jacob And The Sea Beast - Review <h> A Sea Change . <p> The Sea Beast , though a touch bloated , is an endearing , rollicking animated adventure that makes for fine summertime family fare . Hailing from Netflix Animation , the film tackles well-traveled themes but the gentle genre mix here , of pirates vs. ocean monsters , as well as some nicely executed action sequences , helps craft a fun fable about acceptance and forgiveness . <p> Directed by Chris Williams ( Big Hero 6 , stories for Moana/Emperor 's New Groove ) , The Sea Beast delivers a soft rogue 's tale about a world filled by giant water creatures and heroic " hunters " tasked with bringing them down . A few generations have gone by since the " Dark Times " ( when these monsters were said to outright attack coastal towns ) , and hunters are now so prevalent , with their precarious occupation , that orphanages now exist for kids left parentless because their folks went to war with a colossal sea serpent . <p> Zaris-Angel Hator 's young Maisie is one of these orphans , though she dreams of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monster-hunting like her mom and dad . The set up , establishing both Maisie and one of her heroes , Karl Urban 's beast-slayer sailor Jacob , gets a little lengthy -- as there 's most definitely a shorter , tighter ( better ? ) movie in here -- but the best , most effective parts of The Sea Beast make up for the chewier parts . Each act is a teensy bit guilty of repeating moments that have already been addressed but the end result is still a fun flick with some great-looking animation . <p> Hator and Urban create a palpable pair , emitting surrogate father/adopted daughter vibes as they bicker then bond over what 's to be done about the monsters . At first , they 're both on the same page , sea demon-wise , as Jacob 's set to inherit the role of captain of The Inevitable from his own adopted father Captain Crow ( Jared Harris ) while Maisie 's ditched her orphanage digs and stowed away on the ship to join her idols in serpent skewering . Then along comes " Red " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also doubles for King King , at times ) , and Jacob and Maisie start up a debate about who the real monsters might be in this never-ending conflict . <p> The Sea Beast struggles with pacing , antagonists ( Dan Stevens voices an arrogant royal nemesis , but all-to briefly ) , and story payoffs/outs , but it 's also charming , and the new life Jacob is tossed into , after being so set on one path for so long , makes for an absorbing , awesome character 180 . And as both Maisie and Jacob learn to love Red , and empathize with sea monsters in general , The Sea Beast still allows the monsters to keep their fangs . These are n't peaceful , docile creatures , necessarily . They , like humans , contain layers and will lash out even if the moment does n't call for it . This adds a pleasant bit of complexity to what could have been a much simpler story . <h> You 've got a visual feast that 's able to capture both the grandeur of the ocean and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delightfully in the film too , with most monsters getting to occupy their own place on the spectrum -- so much so that Maisie names a few just based on their hue . Add to this the big set pieces involving ships , waves , whirlpools , gnashing teeth , and lashing tentacles and you 've got a visual feast that 's able to capture both the grandeur of the ocean and the emotions of a child . <p> Jared Harris , as Captain Crow , seems like he 'll be the type of father figure Jacob might have to avenge , but he blossoms into something much darker and more interesting . There are some unresolved elements with regards to Crow and his inner turmoil ( and dealings with a witch ) as the credits roll , but the story still makes better use of him than most other movies with a similar character . To be fair , Crow is n't the only lingering thread at the end of this tale , which is a shame since it seems like there was ample time to address everything . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and known for other wonderful sci-fi grumpiness in Dread , Star Trek , and Almost Human ) , gets to engage in some kindness here , as Jacob blossoms from narrow-minded to protective and compassionate . Jacob , as someone being task with breaking a cycle of violence , has a steep leaning curve but his time with Maisie and Red ( and Blue ) is handled with enough care to make his transition buyable . <h> The Verdict <p> Despite the story itself needing a shave , The Sea Beast is a sweet , delightful distraction filled with maritime monster melees , a solid emotional core , and bewitching visuals . It 's got heart , decent world-building , and a vital message , though the set up 's overlong and the ending 's choppy .

It removes all the irritations of real-life power washing - lugging a bulky machine around , tripping over extension cables etc. - focusing instead of the act of sending water screaming into a wall . The complete lack of music and voice acting only adds to the calm , with only the sound of water breaking the silence -- aside from the ' ding ' noise that sounds each time an object is fully clean which adds a real Pavlovian edge to proceedings . <p> Each job starts the same way : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the brown team won faces you , and your mission is to clean the mess and return it to its original spotless state .

It 's a highly satisfying loop though , as a daunting 100-square-foot roof gradually becomes a clean slate to be proud of -- not before leaving a second-rate Jackson Pollock and childlike messages in the dirt , that is . <p> A majority of the levels are extensive , often taking well over an hour to scrub to 100% and gain that valuable five-star rating . And with 38 jobs in total , there 's a significant amount to keep you busy . The more stars you collect in career mode , the more complex the levels you unlock . Earning both stars and cash is how you progress , allowing you to splash your earnings on better power washer equipment to make future jobs that much easier . Progression may be limited to only a few options over the course of the whole campaign , but the tangible improvements to each tool can be felt - with each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> That being said , there 's not a great deal of experimentation needed and I soon settled on my loadout of choice , complete with a long extension that maximised the washer 's range , and the second-widest angle nozzle , which offers a satisfying balance between pressure and area of effect . I enjoyed it so much that I even found myself blurting out the phrase " 25-degree nozzle OP ! " as I hosed down the side of a fire station , like I was on a rampant Call of Duty killstreak . I must have looked like an idiot . <p> Cleaning liquids -- one for each relevant surface such as metal , wood etc. -- can be applied , but come in fairly short supply , so have to be used smartly to maximise their effect . While they do make some challenges a bit simpler , in truth I neglected them for the most part , favouring a sharp burst of water instead as it just felt more enjoyable due to the satisfying nature of the blasts and the base level of skill it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be moved around each area to help reach dirt in high places and get a new blasting angle , which adds a light puzzle element but nothing that strays too far into challenging territory . <p> Very occasionally , the levels themselves throw something different into the mix as well to keep things moderately fresh . Examples include a mansion that tests your sniping skills as you clean it from a distance behind a gated wall , and a carousel which requires you to turn it on and off -- making it rotate -- in order to scrub every inch of dirt . These challenges are few and far between though , and require spending only a little more brain power than usual . In truth , PowerWash Simulator is not a game that 's worried about difficulty spikes or introducing complex mechanics , but much more at home treating us to a relaxing , casual affair . In this endeavour , it often found a sweet spot that kept me coming back for more . <p> Every so often , frustration can set in when trying to find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I found myself scouring the seemingly endless floor of a skatepark looking for smudges of dirt with a highlighting tool in a manner not dissimilar from using a UV light to uncover the more unsavoury stains at a crime scene . However , it 's a bit less exciting than that because the only crimes being committed here are unforgivable levels of uncleanliness on show from whoever owns these properties . <h> It 's not taking itself too seriously , and it would be frankly bizarre if it did . <p> Maps range from the mundane to the fantastical , with riffs on fairytale homes , a suitably red-dusted Mars rover , and a statue from an ancient civilization . There 's a very loose plot to trace , but PowerWash Simulator clearly is n't too worried about telling a great story -- it 's all about getting you cleaning as varied and interesting a set of buildings and vehicles as possible . It 's not taking itself too seriously , and it would be frankly bizarre if it did , with some genuinely amusing moments coming from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There 's no voice acting to interrupt the silence . <p> Outside of the single-player campaign , there 's the option to play the whole of career mode with a friend in co-op , or any job unlocked in free-play with up to five other players . There are no competitive options aside from racing against the clock to clean like the wind in the challenge mode , but it does serve as a relaxing space to treat as a chat room while you subconsciously hose down a carousel inexplicably covered in a field 's worth of mud . <h> The Verdict <p> By most standards , PowerWash Simulator does n't offer the level of variety or progression you 'd hope for , but there 's something just undeniably cathartic about the whole experience . Is it going to trouble the likes of Elden Ring in the game of the year race ? No . Am I ready to pack in all this writing nonsense , rent a power washer , and start a new career as a water-fuelled saviour in a blue boiler suit ? No . Did I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within an inch of their life ? Absolutely . I may only be 30 years of age , but have come to fully accept that this is my life now -- a man who cleans bungalows for fun .

" said the leader , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not there when we arranged that he speak alongside Dakota Legoete , he also failed to come when he was meant to appear alongside Malusi Gigaba . He then told us , okay , if you are serious then endorse me , but it was too late . " <p> The conference was delayed by six hours , but has been hailed as having had a smooth start by the NEC members in attendance , including ANC acting secretary general and treasurer general Paul Mashatile . <p> By the time it started , it had become clear that the battle for chairperson would come down to a contest between Zikalala and Duma , and that the other candidates , who Zikalala described at a press briefing as having " nominated themselves " , were never serious contenders . <p> On Friday night , delegates greeted Mashatile with a rendition of the song Wenzeni uZuma , expressing their displeasure over the recall of the former president by the ANC leadership and its response to his incarceration for contempt of court . <p> Mashatile and Zikalala were stony faced during the singing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the singing was an expression of the " pain " ANC members in the province felt over the issue . <p> Mashatile said the ANC was " faced with the very real possibility of losing the moral high ground and our position as the trusted leader of society " and had no choice but to continue with its renewal path if it were to continue governing the country . <p> The focus of ANC structures on internal organisational battles meant that they were in a poor state and were being abused to further the " self-interest of individual leaders " rather than the aspirations of the communities they purported to represent . <p> " This is characteristic of the social distance that has emerged between our movement and the people of South Africa . This social distance was evident in the outcome of the November local government elections , " Mashatile said . <p> In his political report , Zikalala said the " prestige " of being an ANC leader had been " replaced by the price tag " and election depended not on struggle credentials but on " dispensing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phenomenon is that people who do n't deserve to be in the leadership , some even to be in the ANC , find themselves leading the ANC even at the highest level , " Zikalala said . <p> He was critical of national leaders attempting to influence the outcome of the provincial leadership contests in a bid to boost their own campaigns , saying that this would need to be dealt with by the NEC.

The spice island beckons with unspoilt beaches and new tourism bravado . <p> NOT JUST FOR ITS UNTOUCHED beaches and swaying palms , Zanzibar , the sunny archipelago off the coast of Tanzania lapped up by the warm waters of the Indian Ocean , may now also be known for its opportunities . <p> New regulations are set to allow non-Tanzanians to invest <p> in property and own businesses for the first time with greater ease ; with tax breaks on offer to investors establishing businesses within Strategic Investment Projects on the island and 99-year leases with residence permits . <p> According to the World Bank , Tanzania is projected to reach 4.5%- 5.5% growth in 2022 and average 6% over the medium term as exports and domestic demand recover , assuming pandemic conditions ease . Agriculture , mining , and tourism contribute to the economy . <p> The new interest is attested by some of the real estate players on the island . Grant Anderson , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Investment Project in Zanzibar , says Zanzibar actually is rife with opportunities for young South African entrepreneurs . <p> " And so the people there are now wanting goods and services and professional services more and more every single year . Houses are being built , there 's a requirement for furniture and healthcare and everything like that , " says Anderson to FORBES AFRICA . <p> " It 's just this massive , untapped resource thatby African standards is amazing because it 's a safe investment ; there 's no sort of security risks , there 's no political risks , it 's very stable . " <p> Anderson , a conservationist first and foremost , is heading up development at the resort with sustainability in mind . The project is installing solar panels , and looking to use synthetic grass for the golf course on site to reduce the use of water and fertilizers that would otherwise run off into the sensitive reefs on the island . <p> He says normally a golf course would incur $50,000 in maintenance monthly , but synthetic grass cuts those costs in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoreline , in order to protect the turtles , and 10 meters away from the coral heads . <p> Turtles use the beach to deposit their eggs , and the eggshells provide nutrients that nourish dune vegetation , helping prevent coastal erosion . <p> Tourists like South African freelance writer and publicity strategist Alice Draper , who visited Zanzibar in December last year , say the best part is the strong sense of community on the island . <p> " Coming from South Africa , Zanzibar just felt so safe , " Draper says . <p> ISLE VISION <p> Part of the plan is also creating self-employment opportunities for youth through agribusiness , but it is not easy . Says Sinthia Habib , training officer at the Zanzibar Technology and Business Incubator : " Among the challenges are poor technological <p> knowledge and skills , lack of startup funds for youth to be able to make large production with good machines and high branding which could allow their product to access the big hotel market and be transported out of Zanzibar . In a nutshell , it is expertise , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The coast presents plenty of opportunities though to develop the ocean economy . <p> Ali Sharif , the Executive Director of the Zanzibar Investment Promotion Authority ( ZIPA ) , said at a news conference in December last year that the small islands , or islets , will be leased to developers for investment opportunities and to promote the blue economy . <p> The phase one of the small island program that rolled out in2021 included Chumbe Island , Changuu , Bawe , Pungumbe , Kwale , Misali , Pamunda A and B , and Chapwani Island , bringing in a capital investment of $261.5 million . The islets of Sume , Popo , Kwata and Miwi in the Unguja South region are also for rent . In Pemba North , so too are Fundo , Njao and Kashani , and in Pemba South , Jome and Matumbini Islands . The islands range from a few to hundreds of hectares . <p> Chumbe Island is most notable among them . A commercial operation with a conservation approach , it 's a zero-impact environmental project with solar power water heating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The bungalows intentionally have no Wi-Fi , remaining off the grid , and all the products are sourced locally . <p> Most staff have worked there for 15 years , and 41 of the 43 employees are locals , reports Diane Koerner , a conservationist on the island , to FORBES AFRICA . <p> Chumbe initially invested $1.2 million into the island . The direct input into the economy of Zanzibar has been $8.6 million , and the revenue generated remains within Zanzibar . The annual turnover has been $527,000 , over the last 10 years . <p> Koerner explains that it is the first privately-managed marine protected area in the world . Though it is run entirely off the proceeds of tourists , it has put fishermen as well as 8,000 children through marine conservation and sustainable management programs , free of charge . <p> It 's often the first time children have gone snorkeling and seen the wonders of the coral reef . <p> " So it 's really one of the rare properties and projects in Zanzibar , I would say where it 's really ecotourism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is really to have a few people enjoying the environment or learning and having this very immersive experience , " Koerner explains . <p> " And through the protection of the islands , so nearly 30 years , we have managed to really create this biodiversity hotspot . We have one of the most thriving , healthiest coral reefs in the whole of East Africa . We have had species that have grown in population that have returned to our ecosystem , because it has been so well-protected . " <p> The coral reefs are patrolled round the clock , and its protection has replenished fishing as well as seen a return of reef sharks -- a sign of a flourishing ecosystem , Koerner reveals . She says having nearby villagers in their advisory committee is important , as is educating school children . It 's crucial for influencing the next generation of policymakers and tourism stakeholders , she adds . <p> " The fact that a limited number of people visit the island really allows that you can experience nature in its purest form . " <p> Zanzibar recognizes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fishing and agricultural communities . Therefore , potential developments require a holistic approach and careful planning . Sharif has said that the customary practices of the locals will still be allowed on the rented islands . <p> So , the next time , if you wish to see a coconut crab on Chumbe Island , it 's a short boat trip from the main island .

After all , it 's a story about Superman 's pet dog Krypto , a minor fixture in the comics and shows , bumped up here to an integral part of the hero 's origin . But no matter how thoughtful or energetic the movie gets , it 's often hampered by its voice cast of celebrity screen actors , who by and large do n't have the skill set to breathe life into a children 's movie . If there were a version of the film with the dialogue track removed , it would probably be more effective . <p> Via pretty sci-fi designs and doe-eyed characters , Super-Pets re-tells the Man of Steel 's tragic childhood origin , only this time , his alien parents load a puppy into his pod for his protection as they jettison him to Earth .

However , it 's a lot less engaging when the characters stop flying and start talking to each other . <p> Super-Pets rests on the performance of a monotone Dwayne " The Rock " Johnson , who voices Krypto as if he were reading old wrestling promos he 's long forgotten ( though not as his smarmy ring persona , but as Dwayne Johnson the brand , the Instagram tequila salesman , the guy who exists as more as a concept , at this point , than he does as a real performer ) . Superman is voiced by John Krasinski , who has so little kindness or charisma as the character that it 's a relief when he leaves the movie for lengthy stretches .

Luckily , Ace is surrounded by a handful of other potential pets waiting for adoption , who add a sense of color to the proceedings . Vanessa Bayer voices P.B. , an enthusiastic potbellied pig and Wonder Woman fangirl ; Diego Luna plays Chip , an anxious squirrel ; Natasha Lyonne voices the foul-mouthed , century-old turtle Merton , who can barely see ; and rounding out the shelter crew is the hairless Guinea pig Lulu , a former Lex Corp experiment who now has megalomaniacal plans of her own .

But while these allusions all poke fun at DC lore , the movie 's other comedic instincts grow stale pretty quickly . For one thing , the film 's conceit is that none of the animals are actually speaking English to the human heroes , so it 's funny the first time it cuts from a close-up of intense dialogue to a wide shot of Krypto barking at an incredulous Superman ( or likewise , Lulu squeaking at her human crush , Lex ) , but it 's a little less funny the second time , and a whole lot less funny when it becomes the only real go-to for animal-human interactions . <h> Johnson and Hart 's apparent improv is filled less with actual jokes and more with off-the-cuff references to nothing in particular . <p> Similarly , there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of tension-diffusing gag of closeups of serious dialogue being undercut by snarky responses ( as dramatic music cuts to silence ) before it feels mechanical . To make matters worse , it 's almost always Krypto or Ace doing the snarking , so the reactions are rarely loaded with something worthwhile . Johnson and Hart 's apparent improv is filled less with actual jokes -- i.e. setups and punchlines -- and more with off-the-cuff references to nothing in particular , as if outtakes were all that were recorded . It 's palpably , painfully awkward , making for the kind of animated movie where even children are at a loss for when to laugh , or what to laugh at ( the kids at my screening were n't having a very good time ) . <p> That said , director Jared Stern makes certain sequences sing , despite the personality black-hole at the movie 's center . The action is always momentous , with characters using their power sets in tandem as the " camera " sweeps between buildings , catching glimpses of a detailed world ( DC die-hards will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ O'Shaughnessy 's on every corner ) . The glistening Metropolis makes for a worthwhile battleground when things go awry , if only because you do n't want damage to come to its gorgeous Art Deco facades . The movie 's soundscape is just as thoughtfully conceived , with music that draws from classic Superman and Batman themes at key moments , but for the most part , Steve Jablonsky 's propulsive and original score grants the animal heroes a sense of sincere gravitas , even if their respective stories do n't always manage to . <p> There is , for instance , an attempt at a wistful , Toy Story-like flashback centering Ace 's abandonment , but like almost every other character , he does n't really have a story until and unless it becomes relevant to the main plot . So , it does n't carry the weight it should , and it certainly does n't help that Hart sounds positively unenthused . The more the film goes on , the more its silences and action beats land , but the more its jokes and frequent dialogue scenes grate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may have on-screen chemistry ( at least during their press tours ) , but neither one has the chops to create a fully or even partially formed character through voice alone , let alone a character whose jokes are delivered with a sense of fun . Keanu Reeves is a clear exception , as a hilariously self-effacing Batman with pitch-perfect timing , but unfortunately , he is n't in the movie all that much . <p> DC League of Super-Pets is inoffensive , passable entertainment , but its filmmaking and design elements are clearly aiming for more than just " okay . " Ultimately , it 's another Rock/Hart vehicle , but one where the comedic duo drags down the whole production , rendering even its best , most thoughtfully conceived and propulsive scenes a blur . <h> The Verdict <p> DC League of Super-Pets may have thoughtful filmmaking on its side , but what it does n't have is a voice cast that can lend life and personality to its characters .

" <p> By way of example , Dart noted three office buildings in the heart of Bloemfontein 's CBD that are going under the hammer in High Street 's multi-property auction on August 11th , that have already attracted bidder attention : <p> The Trustfontein &amp; Transtel Buildings at 149 to 151 St Andrew St. The Trustfontein comprises ground floor retail and five floors of office space , while the Transtel is a single-level building with retail and warehousing components ; and <p> Thuto House at 155 St Andrew St , which is a five-storey office building . <p> " Bloemfontein has a well-publicised student housing crisis and with six tertiary education institutions surrounding these buildings , they are crying out for conversion to student accommodation , " said Dart . <p> The largest of the nearby campuses is the Central University of Technology , which has a student body of more than 21,000 and only houses approximately 5,000 in accredited on- and off-campus accommodation . <p> " Besides the smaller colleges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , just down the road there are two University of the Free State campuses which have a student body of more than 33,000 and a hopeless shortage of accommodation . <p> " Bloemfontein is n't the only city with these reconversion opportunities given a recent World Bank Group International Finance Corporation report that noted South Africa 's student housing supply-demand gap already exceeds 500,000 , " he said . <p> This trend is also international , with DigsConnect saying last month that global investment into purpose-built student accommodation exceeded $16 billion in 2018 , and " despite the pandemic , this asset class is resilient and still growing rapidly as student enrolment increases each year " . <p> " As with student redevelopment , location is key , which is why we 've had so much interest in the Salt River city block that 's going under the hammer on August 11th .

" <p> Dart said the smart money is also still looking to industrial property , which has been the strongest commercial investment performer throughout the Covid pandemic . <p> " Industrial property is the most affordable property class and arguably the most adaptable , while also benefiting from a gearing up of the logistics sector for greater levels of online retail . Relatively speaking ; therefore , this class has quite a bit going for it , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Dart said High Street will auction a variety of industrial properties across the country in August , from small light industrial premises suitable for SMME owner-occupiers to large warehousing ideally geared towards the logistics sector .

@@92496230 <h> ANC politics -- so funny , but sadly , so true <p> What a pleasure to read something so hilarious and yet so apt . In the article below , Andrew Donaldson examines former president Mbeki 's claim that an Arab Spring is looming in South Africa ; looks at the present ANC , which has become " a squabble of warring factions , gangs and collectives united only by a wardrobe of silly regalia " -- and referring to Minister Lindiwe Sisulu 's statement that she had transported the formula for " nuclear medicine " for cancer from Russia in her mind to save her ailing friend Jessie Duarte , questions whether the minister 's " mind is a suitable facility for the transport of such medicines ?

Yet , at the weekend , it published an alarming report warning that , one day , South Africa is " going to explode " . <p> Wherever , you may ask , do they get these ideas ? <p> Well , Thabo Mbeki , for one . The former president reportedly told mourners at a memorial service for Jessie Duarte that record unemployment , poverty and growing unrest have put the country on course for its own version of the Arab Spring upheavals . The ANC government , which Mbeki described as " corrupt " , had no " national plan " to tackle the deepening crisis in the country . Cyril Ramaphosa , he added , was directly to blame for this . <p> " When he delivered his state of the nation address in February , he said in 100 days there must be a comprehensive social compact to to address these matters , " Mbeki was quoted as saying . " Nothing has happened . Nothing . " <p> Such comments are somewhat hypocritical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cancer of state capture , after all , metastasised during the Mbeki era . The rotten arms deal was signed off on his watch . Ditto the 2004 decision not to charge then deputy-president Jacob Zuma with corruption alongside Schabir Shaik . <p> Eskom began its collapse into obsolescence at much the same time . The Mbeki administration belatedly announced , in 2007 , a R200-billion plan to build two new coal-fired plants , Medupi and Kusile , but the awarding of tenders to design and build the plants was fundamentally flawed , with Chancellor House , the ruling party 's " investment " company , emerging as a shareholder in one the project 's principal contractors . <p> The Virodene affair was another scandal , given Mbeki and then-health minister Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma 's enthusiastic promotion of this quack HIV/Aids drug which had as its chief active ingredient the industrial solvent , dimethylformamide . <p> All this is perhaps effluent under the bridge .

More intriguing , though , was this from Burke : <p> " Many analystspredict the ruling party will lose its majority at the coming general election or by 2029 , whether or not Ramaphosa succeeds in pushing through reforms that might boost economic growth or simply restore reliable power supplies . This would open a new era of coalition politics , with a radical and populist leftwing party the most obvious partner for the ANC . " <p> I 'm not sure who Burke has in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Economic Freedom Fighters ? Julius Malema himself has on several occasions flatly ruled out such a partnership . Then again , who can believe anything the tub-thumper says ? <p> Which leaves the only option of the ANC going into coalition ... with itself . <p> This is not as bizarre as it may seem . Consider : the chief take-out from the KZN provincial conference is that the party is finished , vrek , kaput . It is over . In its place is a squabble of warring factions , gangs and collectives united only by a wardrobe of silly regalia . <p> As is the custom with such events , the start of the conference was delayed for hours as delegates from the eThekwini region dithered over which mob to support -- the pro-Zuma " Taliban " faction or their opponents , premier Sihle Zikalala 's " Ankole " bunch , so named as a reference to Squirrel 's prized cattle . <p> The former , led by former ANC Youth League provincial president Siboniso Duma , emerged as victors and now control the province .

I did not put it in my pocket , it 's in my head . I brought in my mind a new medicine that we could try on Jessie . I did n't put it in my bag as it is administered by doctors , I 'm not a doctor . I was trying to look at the efficacy of their cancer medication as they have an excellent facility there , all based on nuclear .

What exactly is this " new medicine " , and what does she mean that it 's " all based on nuclear " ? Furthermore , is the minister 's mind a suitable facility for the transport of such medicines ? Supposing the drugs survive the impact in transit of all those colliding half-formed ideas , how are they then transferred from that bedlam to the patient ?

This may well explain why ANC leaders favour treatment over there ; much of what passes for policy -- pun intended -- appears to originate from that overworked end of the alimentary canal . <p> As for Sisulu 's suggestion that we all go to hell ? <p> Maybe , but not just yet , say the regulars at the Slaughtered Lamb ( " Finest Ales &amp; Pies " ) , at least not until Duarte has settled down and become less disagreeable .

No one is arguing that Du Toit 's actions were anything but reprehensible and juvenile : but that 's a far cry from being intentionally racist , the verdict the central disciplinary committee issued last week . It found Du Toit guilty on most charges , including of " racism " , and ordered his immediate expulsion from the university . But in the wave of self-righteous denunciations that followed there was one voice that was missing , that of Du Toit himself . The Weekend Argus reported that those who knew him regarded him as anything but a " racist " . He had been very drunk at the time of the incident and could not even remember it . Read the evidence below to make up your own mind . Article was first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Theuns du Toit <p> By James Myburgh <p> On 15th May 2022 the news broke of an apparently horrific racial incident at Huis Marais , a residence at Stellenbosch University . In the early hours of that morning a drunk white student , Theuns du Toit , had gone into the room of a black student , Babalo Ndwayana , and urinated all over his desk , damaging various items including a laptop . <p> In a statement issued several hours after the incident SASCO Stellenbosch condemned this " racist " attack stating that " when asked by the victim the racist response was that it is what they do to black boys . " Anything short of expulsion and potentially criminal charges , SASCO decreed , " would he regarded or as seen as injustice , this racist criminal act deserves the highest punishment . " <p> That evening a video of the incident was posted to social media , and the following week mass protests were held at the university with black students holding up signs saying , " We are not toilets " . An online petition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Anke Spies , stated that this was a " racially motivated attack , and in response to his actions , Du Toit claimed ' this is what we do to black boys ' . " It soon attracted tens of thousands of signatories . <p> On the Monday Stellenbosch University issued a statement condemning this " destructive , hurtful and racist incident " and announced that Du Toit was being suspended from the university pending disciplinary action . The University would also go on to appoint the former Constitutional Court judge Sisi Khampepe to lead an inquiry into allegations of " racism " at SU . In the public debate Du Toit became the focus of the common South African ritual of the " Two Weeks Hate " -- the object of intense popular hatred ; the face of enduring , lying and insulting notions of white superiority . A stream of denunciations followed -- refuting , smashing , and ridiculing both Du Toit 's disgusting actions and the horrible and repulsive " racism " that had motivated them . He was denounced by the Minister of Justice , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ANC , GOOD SA , and many , many others . <p> How is it possible , News24 Editor Adriaan Bassonasked , " that in 2022 , a young white man thinks it 's acceptable to urinate on the desk , laptop and books of his black peer ? " In a column in the Sunday Times , the newspaper 's deputy editor Makhudu Sefara denounced Du Toit as a " racist " who " hated black people " whom he probably regarded as " subhuman " due to his racist upbringing post-1994 . My view , Sefara continued , " is that young man Du Toit deliberately acted out his barbaric behaviour because he knows black life is not only cheap , but that even our political leaders show no respect for it . " <p> In the wave of self-righteous denunciations that followed there was one voice that was missing , that of Du Toit himself . The Weekend Argusreported that those who knew him regarded him as anything but a " racist " . He had been very drunk at the time the incident occurred and could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Toit , in which Ndwayana refused to participate , concluded at the end of June . The report of the Central Disciplinary Committee was issued last week . It found Du Toit guilty on most charges , including of " racism " , and ordered his expulsion from the university . The ruling was welcomed by many at the university , although Du Toit 's lawyer did say he would file an appeal . <p> If one takes the popular narrative as one 's guide , one would think that a monstrously racist act was committed , that Stellenbosch University acted resolutely to deal with it , and another blow has been struck against " racism " in South Africa . And yet if you look at the facts set out by the disciplinary committee , the significance of which it clearly missed , the explanation for Du Toit 's actions is both obvious , and obviously not " racism " . And if one accepts this in turn , it is clear that Du Toit has been the victim of great wrong . <p> I <p> According to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the incident was the following . On Saturday evening 14th May 2022 at around 7.30 pm Theuns du Toit and a friend " Mr. Y " sat down together at their residence Huis Marais and polished off a bottle of brandy together . Du Toit drank about half of it . At around 10pm that evening the two went out to two establishments in town where Du Toit would consume another eight double brandies with " mixes " . <p> During this period , Du Toit told his disciplinary hearing , that there were periods of the time at the establishments where he ' blanked out ' and could not remember what happened . <p> Du Toit and Y returned , obviously drunk , to Huis Marais at 3am Sunday morning . They went into the room of a friend , Mr Z , jumped on his bed and woke him up . <p> After about 10 minutes Y left to go sleep in his room . Du Toit meanwhile , who was intoxicated and slurring his words , unsuccessfully sought to call another friend in the residence , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Z tried to wake him but could not , after which Z also went back to sleep on his bed . <p> At around 4.30am , needing to relieve himself , Du Toit got out of Z 's bed , went out into the corridor and then into a room two doors down ( the door was unlocked ) , and without turning on the light , started urinating in a corner . <p> This was the room of a friend of Du Toit 's -- whom Du Toit knew was away for the weekend -- and of Babalo Ndwayana , who Du Toit had met and been on amicable terms with previously . Ndwayana , hearing someone in his room turned on the light and saw Du Toit urinating on his study desk and over his laptop , a textbook and three notebooks . <p> Another student ( Mr X ) was walking by , saw what was happening , and advised Ndwayana to record the incident on his phone . In the clip that was recorded the conversation proceeds as follows : <p> Du Toit then left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " white boy thing " in response to a further question from Ndwayana about what he thought he was doing . It was only Ndwayana who heard this and while he related a version of this comment to others soon after the incident he refused to testify at the inquiry . His claim could thus not be probed , tested , or put in context . <p> The committee confirmed that Du Toit had never said " this is what we whites do to black boys " as claimed in the initial SASCO statement or in the online petition , now with over a hundred thousand signatories , organised by Anke Spies . <p> Du Toit then went back to Z 's bed and fell back asleep . He awoke at 6am and returned to his own room to sleep . When he got up at 10am that morning he remembered much of what had happened the previous evening , but he had zero recollection of the urination incident . <p> He was informed of it on waking up after which he went to Ndwayana 's room with three others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inadequately , in Ndwayana 's view ) to try and clean up his mess . At this point Ndwayana would have learnt -- from his side -- that Du Toit had no memory of what had happened . <p> Since he had no memory whatsoever about the event in question Du Toit could not present to the disciplinary committee any sort of explanation or defence of either his actions or his words . All he could do was argue that he had not behaved " wilfully " -- that he lacked capacity and intention . It was not in his character to destroy someone else 's property intentionally , he testified , or act out of base racial motivations . His " friends of colour " told the committee that he was a " non-racist " individual . <p> All of this was relayed , and none of it disputed , by the disciplinary committee in its report . It also accepted that Du Toit was a first-time offender , showed " true remorse " , and ( unlike Ndwayana , whose legal representatives it strongly criticised ) had at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Toit could present no explanation for his motivations , he very much threw himself on the mercy of the committee . Although it decided by majority vote that his expostulation was the word " boy " it cleared him of this charge , as this was not regarded as a racial insult by students of his generation . <p> The committee however said that his state of heavy intoxication could not be taken as an excuse . It said he was in control of his body when he " walked himself into Mr Ndwayana 's room , he relieved himself on Mr Ndwayana 's property , he engaged in conversation with Mr Ndwayana , and then finally , he walked himself out of Mr Ndwayana 's room . At no point did he lack the capacity of conducting his own bodily mechanics . This is indicative of wilful conduct . " Furthermore , and " most damningly " , Du Toit did not stop urinating after the lights were turned on , and he could see where he was , and what he was urinating on . The fact that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The committee convicted him under the disciplinary code of trespassing , of damaging Ndwayana 's property , and of " racism " for his " white boy " comment . The committee decided that interaction should be viewed racially . Although Ndwayana had refused to testify , and his claims could not be tested and probed -- and Du Toit could not remember either what he had said or meant by what he had said -- the -- the committee decided that what he had intended to say was that " peeing on other people's/people of colour 's property is a white boy thing " . <p> The committee opined that , in line with Constitutional Court precedent , it would take into account the fact that this was a " white man perpetrating an offence against a black man " and accordingly it could not conclude that this " statement is anything but racist . It is purely racist . It assumes such dominion over another person -- effectively portraying Mr. Ndwayana and people of colour as the toilet for white men . " It ordered Du @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the " white boy " charges . It recommended that a copy of its ruling be made public and be sent to Justice Khampepe . <p> At this point this judgment reads like a vindication of all those who accused Du Toit of " racism " and demanded his expulsion . There is just one small problem . The committee was evidently so eager to convict Du Toit of this moral crime , and to signal to the world that Stellenbosch University had no tolerance for it , that it missed the obvious explanation for Du Toit 's strange actions , one that was sitting right in front of its nose . <p> II <p> If you return to the undisputed facts , they are as follows . Du Toit clearly drank far too much over the evening . He then fell fast asleep in someone else 's room early in the morning and about an hour-and-half later , at a time of deep sleep , he got up out of a pressing need to relieve himself ( alcohol being a diuretic ) . When asked by Ndwayana , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a bizarre fashion , nor did he desist from what he was doing . When he woke up the following morning , he had complete amnesia . <p> The disciplinary committee regarded all this as evidence of " wilfulness " , but this is quite wrong . Both the facts and circumstances of the incident point to this being an episode of parasomnia . Du Toit was , in other words , sleepwalking throughout the incident . As one online medical source puts it : " Sleepwalking is when you 're moving around and look awake but are actually asleep . You wo n't remember it the next day . Sleepwalking is most common during a stage called deep non-rapid eye movement ( non-REM ) sleep early in the night . " It can be brought on by being drunk . <p> As another medical source states : " Sleepwalking or somnambulism is an arousal disorder resulting in ambulatory behavior in stage three of sleep . During these nocturnal episodes , the individual is disoriented with eyes open , and the events may range from ambulating aimlessly , playing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the closet , driving or moving out of the house or resulting in self-injurious action like walking off the balcony . These events can be alarming and disrupt the quality of sleep of their bed partners as well . " A third one notes " Sleepwalkers typically do not respond to redirection during the episode . " <p> This phenomenon of individuals urinating in inappropriate places while sleepwalking -- after falling asleep following an evening of heavy drinking -- is one familiar to anyone who went to a university with a strong drinking culture . It is also a topic of discussion on many Reddit threads , and there are videos on YouTube of it happening . One woman recounted her experience as follows : <p> " My boyfriend and I were asleep after a night of drinking when he woke me up by getting out of bed . I assumed he was getting up to go pee in our bathroom but instead he just walked to the other side of the room and stood there facing away from me . I then heard what sounded like someone peeing in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I thought I was crazy at first because what I was seeing did not match up with what I was hearing -- he was clearly not standing at the toilette , but he was definitely peeing . I sat up , looked down and realized that he was pissing in our dog 's water bowl . I immediately yelled " WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING ? " to which he responded with " It 's OK , Phil does it all the time " . Phil is our dog . He does not pee in his water bowl . <p> Through my continuous screaming he kind of snapped out of it , cut off his stream , walked to the toilette and continued peeing . Once he was done , he yelled " SHIT ! " , got the dog bowl , poured the pee into the toilette , and washed it out . <p> The next day , all he could remember was me yelling at him and him snapping out of it . I found it hilarious ( because there really was n't any harm done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There can be little doubt that the same thing happened in Du Toit 's case . Unlike the girlfriend quoted above , Ndwayana did not recognise this at the time it happened , failed to snap Du Toit out of his sleep state , and initially believed that he was being deliberately targeted and demeaned , probably based on his race . <p> Yet rather than allowing for the matter to be sorted out within the residence during the day , Ndwayana had already escalated his complaint to the Students Representative Council by lunchtime . After this the incident ( and his video ) would soon be taken out of his hands and used by others to promote their own agendas , and he would be swept along ( apparently ) unenthusiastically . <p> III <p> If one accepts this central fact -- that this was an episode of parasomnia -- the way the whole incident can be perceived changes by 180 degrees . It would be self-evidently wrong to violently condemn , let alone severely punish , someone for their disgusting actions and nonsensical utterances when they were not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beating a small child for having wet a bed during the night . To impute grotesque " racist " motivations to Du Toit then for what he did and said while he was sleep walking is also both ridiculous and self-evidently unjust . <p> What though of all those in the student body , the administration , and the media , who went after this young student ? They do not have the excuse of being heavily inebriated and operating while literally still in a dream state . <p> In its initial comment on the incident , Stellenbosch University stated that " Human dignity is non-negotiable and must be respected , upheld and restored when affected . " It is an obvious infringement on a person 's dignity and privacy to film them while they are urinating , and especially when they are in a state where they are not even conscious of where they are , what they are doing , and what is going on around them . <p> In the moment it was entirely understandable for Ndwayana to do this . But this recording was also highly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such its further distribution deserved to be extremely limited . It was presumably though forwarded on from one person to another and by the evening it had been posted to social media where it was subsequently viewed by tens of millions of people all over the world . Since this was not a " racist " incident after all , and internal processes still had to run their course , there was absolutely no public interest in putting this material online . <p> Stellenbosch University has said and done nothing about this . So upholding human dignity is clearly not a " non-negotiable " for them at all . At best it is heavily conditional on the race of the person concerned . The university has also claimed throughout the affair that it has a " zero-tolerance " approach to " racism " . And yet if anyone was being racially defamed it was Du Toit himself . <p> He was being accused , judged , convicted , and condemned -- by SASCO , the SRC , student protesters , the administration , and ultimately by members of the disciplinary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colour . None of these organisations and individuals could believe that he could have acted out of anything other than ( white ) " racism " . As a result of their own visceral racial reactions , they failed even to consider any other explanations for his actions , no matter how compelling . <p> One of the common rationales for apartheid , as formulated by Stellenbosch University intellectuals in times gone by , was that it would remove " racial friction " , and therefore occasions for racial discord , from society . There can be no such inter-racial incidents -- whereby a sleepwalking student urinates in the room of a person of a different race -- if institutions such as residences are strictly segregated . If you want racial integration -- as Stellenbosch University now claims to do -- then you also must accept that inter-racial incidents , accidents , and misunderstandings will occur . These then must be dealt with wisely , calmly , and proportionally by adults in authority . <p> The " racists " in a multi-racial society , in the originating and true sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incidents and accidents , impute malign racial motives to the culprit , and use them to stir up racial hatred and discord more generally . This is exactly what racial demagogues used to do in pre-Nazi Germany . <p> It is an indication of the profoundly inadequate ( not to mention perverse ) contemporary understanding of " racism " that similar behaviour in our media and politics today is not just condoned but is celebrated as somehow " anti-racist " . <p> If Stellenbosch University is serious about tackling the actual evil of " racism " in the institution , a key focus of the Khampepe inquiry should be the cruel , cowardly , and racially driven way key organisations at the university went after Theuns du Toit. 
@@92496233 <h> Counting our blessings in Zimbabwe -- Cathy Buckle <p> As neuroscience has developed , we have learnt that our neural pathways literally change when we habitually live from a place of gratitude . Our brains become ' wired ' to notice the good in life more and more . And lessons in Positive Psychology show that gratitude is key to living a fulfilled life . Surely this must contribute to the enjoyment of life in Zimbabwe , where the infrastructure continues to deteriorate , with the electricity supply in major cities sporadic -- and now the supply of water too . But humour , and the kindliness of strangers , and the abundance of wildlife persists , and dwelling on those features is what makes life still bearable for those who choose to count their blessings rather than dwell on the vicissitudes of life . -- Sandra Laurence <h> Jewels in the dust <p> By Cathy Buckle* <p> Cathy Buckle <p> While the youngsters were cleaning spanners and putting tools away , the plumber and I stood chatting . We talked about the crisis situation with water in the town . An electricity power surge had apparently blown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the entire town . We were on day eight without a drop of water , storage tanks were empty and I was down to the last dregs in a single bucket . The well at the bottom of my garden ran dry two years ago after illegal houses were constructed and wells sunk on the wetland just above the stream , and early every morning people in urban residential areas walk with buckets and 20-litre drums to find water . It is painful to see it , 42 years after independence , old and young , men and women pushing wheelbarrows , dragging trolleys , carrying heavy containers of water from wells and boreholes in urban residential areas . But this letter is n't about the absurd , unnecessary facts of daily life in Zimbabwe , it 's about the jewels in the dust . <p> The plumber told me one of the youngsters helping him was just learning ' a few manly things ' before he started at university in a few weeks ' time . With top marks in maths , physics and chemistry , the youngster is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , confident and keen , ready to do great things . When the lads had packed away the tools one asked if they could have some firewood and while they squashed more wood in the boot of their small car than seemed possible I learned that they never had municipal water in their suburb anymore and had been carrying buckets every day for years . The lucky ones had dug wells and found water . A couple had boreholes but the electricity to pump it is expensive and so they cook on firewood to stretch every dollar because we 've all learned to cope without electricity , but not without water . <p> After lots of joking and laughing and with their rear suspension almost touching the ground , the plumbers left but I could n't stop thinking about a future scientist sitting learning ' manly things ' in the dust . That old saying ' Chop wood and carry water ' is so apt but also sad that a young man about to start university has never known anything better than this toil in his life . Born @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and only a little boy during the 2005-2008 hyperinflation and economic collapse , this young man has never known his country as the breadbasket of Africa , the land of plenty . <p> Two ZEC ( Zimbabwe Electoral Commission ) officials were on a door to door campaign urging people to go and check that their names were on the voters roll . They explained the procedure to me and told me where the nearest inspection centres were . I thanked them and said it would be a pointless exercise for me ; I had been struck off the voters roll after the 2005 election and had tried to vote every election since then but had been turned away . They were shocked and asked why and when I told them that I had been born in Zimbabwe and lived here all my life , but could not prove that my father had been a citizen of Zimbabwe at the time of my birth . My disenfranchisement is because my father was born in the UK despite the fact that he lived and worked in Zimbabwe for 30 years . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the fact that I have lived in Zimbabwe all in my life . At every election since 2005 I have gone with my proof of birth and proof of residence and registered an objection in their huge ledgers but every time have been barred from voting . I have been to the top administrative offices locally and even tried in the capital city -- to no avail . <p> The two ZEC officials were wide-eyed and clearly in shock as I told my story . " Oh that legislation was changed , was n't it , " the ZEC official said , adding in question to himself " or I think it was ? " I shook my head . It was n't changed . If my father had been born in the SADC ( Southern African ) region I would be allowed to vote , but he was n't and I 'm not . The constitution says I am a citizen by birth but the legislation has not been enacted to enforce it . " I am very sorry , Ma'am " the ZEC official said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ please come back and tell me if I 'm wrong and it has been changed . " We made a joke about something and laughed and they waved as they trudged up the dusty dirt road . <p> And the final jewel in the dust this week was a beautiful Long-crested Eagle sitting in a bare thorn tree in a dusty field a few metres off the highway . Regal and imposing , its long crest standing up and mouth open . I knew the mouth open pose well , the eagle was screaming and for a second I closed my eyes and was back on my farm in an instant , the Long-crested Eagle sitting high on a post screaming in the wind overlooking the swaying golden grass . 
@@92496234 <h> How not to get caught up in the power generation story <p> Bronwyn Nielsen spoke to Thiago Almeida , Sector Lead Power and Infrastructure at Nedbank Corporate and Investment Banking , about the tendency to get caught up in the power generation story to the detriment of focusing on distribution and transmission .

And we so dearly need that . But what we 're seeing more and more is that we are unable to connect some of these magnificent engineering generating projects to deliver electricity where they need to be , if we do n't have investment in infrastructure . These investments are both on the transmission grids and also on the distribution grids , all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So , that 's a key area of focus and one that has a phenomenal amount of investments to be done and for the private sector to participate in . <p> On whether enough attention is being paid to transmission and distribution <p> No , absolutely not . There is an estimate by the International Energy Agency . We require about $40 billion per year for the next five years for investment in this space . And most of that is actually on transmission . So these are high voltage lines to get power across multiple borders . We 're not giving enough attention to this . It 's a problem we 've known was around for many , many years now . We have the resources to do it . There is a framework , but we need better legislation . We need better integration between the various power pools in the continent . We need the public sector to work with the private sector . We need DFIs to work with commercial banks in order to unlock this significant challenge . <p> On the role of DFIs <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find many of our utilities . Over half of our utilities are very close to insolvency in the continent . So , restructuring tariffs at a government level , you know , associated with lending is very key . We need to be able to make sure that these utilities are able to recover their costs through adequate tariffs , through adequate mechanisms , so that their balance sheet is healthy enough that they can deploy projects and really improve the sector . So , DFIs have a very important role in de-risking the sector . It is about building capacity , de-risking and getting the African utilities to where they should be , helping them to unbundle when that 's necessary , and setting the road for private sector participation throughout the ecosystem . <p> On shifting attention to transmission and distribution <p> We have some cases like , for example , Kenya , that has over 10% of its energy generated from renewables . It almost has an energy surplus and is unable to sell the electricity to its neighbours because of the lack of transmission systems . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for example , in the SADC region , which has increased the amount of energy it generates . But it 's starting to get to a point where it is unable to deploy some of its electricity out into the system . It goes hand in hand . You ca n't consider one without considering the other . However , I also think we need to focus a lot on the distribution space , and that 's very much associated with collection of revenue from clients that are paying for subsidies for tariffs ; commercial industrial clients . That also needs a lot of interest and investments .

@@92496236 <h> Direct indexing is in : here 's why you should be doing it <p> *This content is brought to you by Shyft , the global money app , powered by Standard Bank . <p> One size does n't fit all . Netflix and Spotify know this , which is why you get personalised recommendations based on your watchlist or listening habits . Across the spectrum , big data and smart algorithms are creating a hyper-personalised world where -- at the risk of being exposed to only one worldview -- you are ( as you should be ! ) seen as an individual . Now , thanks to a new model called direct indexing , your investments can work the same way . <p> Direct indexing allows you to replicate the performance of an index by buying a representative amount of the underlying shares . If that sounds a lot like an exchange-traded fund ( ETF ) , then you 're close ... but there 's a key difference . Unlike with traditional index funds , where you indirectly invest in the companies that make up an index ( say , Naspers or MTN in the JSE Top 40 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those companies . <p> In an ETF , you 're also tracking the index -- so you 're not a shareholder in the individual companies , and you ca n't buy or sell shares within that index . With direct indexing , you 're basically building your index from scratch , so you can customise it and tweak it as you go . <p> This allows you to align your investments with your needs and values . Do n't like the way " Evil Corp " ignores its ESG responsibilities ? Then do n't invest in them . Easy . While your friends are stuck with " Evil Corp " in their Top 40 ETF , you can happily sit with your own Top 39 , knowing that you 're not helping to destroy the planet . ( Think of it like a personalised Spotify playlist , where you have your favourite artist 's greatest hits , minus that one awful song that you hate . ) <h> Easier access <p> Until quite recently , direct indexing involved specialised expertise and prohibitive trading costs . It was expensive , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has changed that , enabling a massive shift towards commission-free trading and fractional shares , making direct indexing more accessible to many more people . So while mutual funds disrupted the investment scene by allowing Average Joes and Joannas to access financial markets , and while ETFs gave them diversification , direct indexing is the next major investment game-changer . <p> The biggest benefit of direct indexing lies in its flexibility , and in how it allows you to align your money with your personal values and investment aims . While there are several ETFs or tracker funds that target specific factors , sectors or geographies , you might find that you 'd prefer to pick and choose individual equities or industries to create something that matches your preferred allocation . <p> Your reasons for wanting more personalisation and flexibility may be values-based . Maybe it 's the ESG issue we mentioned earlier ; maybe you have moral or religious reasons for not wanting to put your money in a booze or tobacco business ; or perhaps it 's less about avoiding certain companies or sectors , and more about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe that South Africa 's mining industry is where the future 's at ; maybe you 're super into tech stocks ; or maybe you want more exposure to India or Brazil than , say , the MSCI Emerging Markets Index is giving you . <p> All of that is possible with direct indexing . Just remember that the more you stray from a particular index , the less likely you are to match its returns ( which could be a good thing or a bad thing ) . <p> Another benefit of direct indexing is that it can help you generate additional capital losses . That -- for those who 're new at this game -- is a good thing , if you need to offset your capital gains from other investments . If you 're an investor who does n't really have any other capital gains , then the tax benefits are obviously limited and you can safely ignore this paragraph . <h> Lower costs , lower fees <p> There 's a catch , though . Most ETFs are passively managed and simply seek to track an index @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of research and market analysis . You pick an index , track it , and watch your money grow ( in theory ) . As a result , the operating expenses are low and so are the fees . That 's why so many entry-level investors love ETFs : they 're cheap and cheerful , and they let you feel like you 're matching or beating the market . <p> Management fees for direct indexing portfolios will vary , but they 're typically higher than what you 'd pay for an ETF . That makes sense : direct indexing can be complex to manage , requiring constant updates on changes to the index you 're tracking , with tweaks and adjustments as you go -- and all while keeping an eye on the tax implications . <p> But they 're still lower than most other investment vehicles , and those costs are offset by the increased personalisation . Instead of picking an index out of a catalogue -- JSE Top 40 , Nasdaq 100 , MSCI World , whatever -- you 'll have the power to design your own , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prevailing market conditions . <p> With a mobile app like Shyft , it is now very simple to personalise your investments and ? ? construct a custom investment portfolio that mirrors the composition of an index .

@@92496237 <h> Petrol price deregulation -- be aware of the pitfalls <p> The energy department 's recent announcement that it plans to deregulate the fuel price by imposing a price cap on 93 octane petrol could have a major unintended consequence . If the price of fuel exceeds the market cap , there is no incentive to import or produce the product at a loss . In extreme situations this could lead to pumps running dry . In a broad-ranging interview , BizNews spoke to Justus van der Spuy and Enrico Ganter , executive directors at Capital Energy Resources , about market forces driving high oil prices , and the state of South Africa 's strategic petroleum reserve . They also shed light on where Russia 's crude is going as Europe looks to wean itself off that country 's oil and gas in the wake of their invasion of Ukraine . -- Michael Appel <p> Justus van der Spuy on the status of our strategic petroleum reserves <p> We do n't know which transactions might have been agreed or concluded in the background , but as far as we know , the oil was still there . And given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in other words , current oil prices are much higher than for the future oil prices . If somebody had bought that oil , they would n't be keeping it stored in Saldanha Bay because you simply lose value by holding onto it . So perhaps something was contributed . Perhaps not . You know , I 'd like to think that we had also at the time written to the DOE and suggested that concluding oil swaps was a more nuanced and continuing value greater than not selling the silverware , so to speak . So we know the oil is still there . We believe the oil is still there , but we do n't know whether something has been transacted . <p> In simple terms , when energy markets exhibit the current oil price structure , which is where as you go forward in time , oil prices that you would contract today are progressively lower . It simply means that if you are sitting on oil in inventory , as South Africa does by virtue of its strategic stockpile , that if you were to release @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for our numbers and lend it to somebody or lease it to somebody , if you contracted to take re delivery of that loan of oil in , say , 12 months time , you would earn yourself anywhere between ten and $15 a barrel . Basically , without exposing yourself to what the price of oil might be in the future . <p> On how Brent Crude has been performing and what 's driving the price <p> it 's dipped below and then gone above the hundred dollar level . And it 's a 10% variation at $205 or so , it does n't sound like a lot . It is obviously a lot in dollars per barrel . It 's varied , of course -- Russia , the events in Ukraine are going to be very much news driven . So market perceptions of whether Russian crude will be replaced in the European refining system and where the other oil will come from . There 's also the fact that on the other side of the coin , we have interest rate increases . Central banks are announcing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to , you know , historically low cost mortgages are having to fork out more money . So there 's also a question of demand destruction creeping in at these prices . You know , this is traditionally the northern hemisphere 's driving season . If you look at gasoline demand , you 'll see that driving activity is 38% below what it was a year ago . There is currently a buildup of gasoline inventories and because refineries are earning very good margins in the current market , they 're all running full tilt . So annual refinery maintenance is being delayed . We see all these factors combining to create growing inventories of refined petroleum products . And as markets read these factors , interest rates increase , and an element of demand destruction starts taking place at these prices . The oil price will obviously react , but then you might have another event . A missile being fired off in a particular direction changes the direction of an oil price for a few hours . So in this sort of situation , the daily fluctuations can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Enrico Ganter on long-term refining capacity not surviving in SA <p> I think in the past , you know , the industry negotiated with the government in terms of making the investments required just in terms of meeting the new fuel specifications and then negotiated with the government for mechanisms to claw back the investment . And that would generally be passed on to the motorists . But in these times , the last thing any government is going to do is increase the fuel price to pay for this kind of thing . It 's political suicide . And I think , you know , this upgrade , which has been spoken about for years now , they just have n't made any progress on that front . So it 's unlikely to happen if you look at the various refineries to wind down -- and Glencore is coming back on stream . According to them , the engine refinery , they 've made the decision not to bring it back on stream and turn it into an import facility . And that 's the most common use for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because the infrastructure is there , but partly because they would all have a very high remediation cost that would be crystallised if they ceased to operate within having to fix up the land . So they tend to just keep it on as storage . <p> On the statements politicians make about Russian crude oil <p> A political statement that really just does n't make any sense because , you know , like Iranian crude , any sanctioned crude , Venezuelan crude , the product , if it were to come into South Africa , would have to be handled by American companies -- Shell or British BP or whatever . And even the South African company like Sasol is unlikely to touch any sanctioned crude . Sasol is heavily invested internationally and in America , so they 're not going to do anything silly like Glencore . Likewise , you know for our ministers to be saying that they can import product into South Africa and take advantage , they simply ca n't unless they change the structure of the industry and nationalise the assets and , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ India and China because , you know , the governments and the companies themselves are able to do it . But it 's not likely to happen in South Africa . <p> Justus van der Spuy on energy departments around the world looking to drive down demand for petroleum products <p> The US Department of Energy recently played with the same idea of reducing fuel levies and taxes to to relieve the pain for the consumer . But the conclusion the US Department of Energy came to was it 's not productive to do this , because you will be stimulating demand . And the last thing you need to do in the current environment is to be taking steps to stimulate demand , which a blanket reduction of taxes and levies would achieve . So they felt that , you know , maintaining and letting the market do its job would be the better way to go . And we see that , of course , with petroleum . Petrol demand in the US being down 35% already at some point , higher prices force a rethink , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're a farmer and you have fields to plough , you might not have that much choice . But there are other ways of compensating those parties who have fewer choices . <p> Enrico Ganter on the deregulation and price cap of 93 octane being placed <p> Governments make these commitments , like the fuel levy and or putting a cap on prices . But these things have to be very well thought through because it 's very difficult for any government to take on market forces . This cap , I do n't know if it 's already been introduced in South Africa or if it 's just being discussed as it 's gone through Parliament now being tabled . <p> All I can say is if you look at the mess we 've ended up with in the UK in terms of regulated gas prices , it 's not a dissimilar situation . So the government puts a cap , it says the price ca n't exceed whatever . Basically it 's a political statement that kind of works if the cap is higher than the market @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will flow as long as the cap is above the price . The moment the price goes over the cap , people will stop bringing gasoline in or producing it . So suddenly you have no fuel in the country because the cap wo n't allow you to import fuel . Nobody 's going to import at a loss . And so you go from political rhetoric , where it has no impact at all is , you know , if the caps are higher than the market price that 's that low and they just make no impact . And if it 's below that , then , you 're going to run out of fuel in the country . So putting a cap in like that is just too simplistic . And what happens ? They always then manage the price where it 's close to the cap , and what would happen in the UK is that the smaller companies , because they do n't hedge , are n't able to manage the long-term supply around the price cap . And so the moment the market price @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basically , people stopped supplying the gas .

In the US , the Federal Reserve ( Fed ) has raised rates twice this year already -- by a quarter of a percentage point in March and by half a percentage point in May . <p> They 're now at 0.75%-1% in the US and 1% in the UK after the Bank of England , the UK 's central bank , increased rates four times since December 2021 . <p> Interest rates are also at 1% in Canada , where the central bank has raised rates twice this year , while in Australia rates have been increased to 0.35% . They 've also been raised in many emerging markets including India , Mexico and South Africa . <p> Locally , South Africa 's interest rate is at its highest level in five years -- on 21 July , the South African Reserve Bank ( SARB ) announced that interest rates would increase by 75 basis points ( bps ) , taking the repo rate to 5.5% and the prime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rates will continue to rise . Our economists at Schroders predict that rates in the US will reach 3% by the end of the year and that in the UK they 'll hit 2.25% sometime in the first quarter of 2023 . <p> What are interest rates ? <p> Interest rates represent the cost of borrowing . <p> When a central bank , such as the South African Reserve Bank , Bank of England , US Federal Reserve or the European Central Bank announces a new rate , this determines the cost to local banks when they borrow . In turn this steers the rate at which banks lend to each other , and it also influences the interest rate at which they will lend to the consumer ( that 's you ) . <p> So when the bank rate goes up you would expect your mortgage rate to go up too , and vice versa .

Most central banks have an inflation target or an inflation target band . <p> For example , the Bank of England 's and the European Central Bank 's inflation target is 2% while the Fed targets an average inflation of 2% over the long term . In both economies , current annual inflation is at close to 40-year highs at 9% in the UK and 8.5% in the US and 7.5% in the eurozone ( as of April 2022 ) . <p> In South Africa , the Reserve Bank 's target band is 3%-6% . Current annual inflation is over 7% ( as of June 2022 ) . <p> Central banks try to influence spending habits when they change interest rates . Interest rates influence the overall level of activity in the economy . <p> If interest rates are higher we 're more likely to save , because we 'll earn more interest on our savings .

@@92515238 <h> South African energy crisis : the practical implications of the government 's proposed interventions <p> On 25 July 2022 , president Cyril Ramaphosa announced the Government 's intention to implement various " bold , courageous and decisive actions to close the electricity gap " in South Africa and bring an end to load shedding . <p> Attorneys from Webber Wentzel have unpacked the legal and practical considerations of five key interventions as proposed by the government . <p> 1 . The procurement of new generation capacity <p> President Ramaphosa announced that Eskom is taking active steps to add new generation capacity to the grid on an urgent basis . The following noteworthy steps are proposed in order to procure new generation capacity : <p> ( i ) Surplus capacity bought from generators with excess power : <p> As an immediate measure , Eskom will buy surplus capacity from existing independent power producers ( IPPs ) , mines and other private entities which generate excess power . This will be beneficial for entities that have built projects with excess capacity which can be sold to Eskom . <p> If Eskom purchases this electricity while the current legislative regime is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Electricity Regulation Act , 4 of 2006 ( ERA ) will need to be issued . In terms of section 34 of the ERA , the Minister will identify the procurer and whether or not a procurement process should be followed for that purchase . <p> It remains to be seen how the surplus capacity will be procured and whether or not a procurement process will be required , or whether the section 34 determination will deviate from such a requirement . It is also unclear how the tariff will be determined for the purchase of surplus capacity , especially if no procurement process is followed . <p> ( ii ) Acceleration of IPP procurement programmes : <p> 2,600 MW of capacity has been procured through Bid Window 5 of the Renewable Energy IPP Procurement Programme ( REIPPPP ) , which should add capacity to the grid from early 2024 . Efforts are being made to ensure that all Bid Window 5 projects commence construction as scheduled . <p> These efforts include taking a pragmatic approach to local content requirements ( which have been a major difficulty for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the requisite manufacturing capacity in the local market ) and prioritising the need to build new capacity as quickly as possible . Clarity is required on what this " pragmatic approach " would entail . <p> Any change to the Bid Window 5 local content requirements may be subject to legal challenge by unsuccessful bidders on the basis that it results in the procurement process being unfair because it benefits the preferred bidders to the detriment of both unsuccessful bidders or entities that failed to submit a bid as a result of the specified onerous local content requirements . <p> A mitigating factor may be that the relaxation of these requirements would open the door for any such bidders to participate in a less stringent Bid Window 6 . <p> 2,000 MW of capacity has been procured through the Risk Mitigation IPPP Procurement Programme ( RMIPPPP ) . The majority of RMIPPPP projects are struggling to reach financial close , with only three of the 18 selected projects having reached financial close to date . <p> Financial close for RMIPPPP has also been repeatedly postponed from the original date of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ efforts were specifically mentioned to ensure that RMIPPPP capacity is realised , and it is unclear whether or not the Government has any plans to prioritise addressing the challenges facing the RMIPPPP projects . <p> President Ramaphosa has announced that the generation capacity to be procured through REIPPPP Bid Window 6 will be doubled from 2,600 MW to 5,200 MW . This significant increase in the Bid Window 6 generation capacity raises some practical issues : <p> The bid submission date for Bid Window 6 is currently 11 August 2022 , which is just under three weeks away from the time of writing . It is not clear whether bidders can expect an extension of the bid submission date , although an extension may not be necessary as previous rounds have been oversubscribed in terms of the MWs bid . <p> As matters stand , only bidders registered under Bid Window 6 would be entitled to bid projects into Bid Window 6 . New bidders would therefore be excluded from participating in Bid Window 6 at this stage because they are not registered bidders . It is not clear at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Window 6 . <p> The Eskom network in the Northern Cape faces capacity constraints , with bidders across the various programmes competing for Budget Quotes on a first come , first served basis . It is unclear whether or not there are any plans or strategies in place to increase the capacity of the Eskom network , particularly in the Northern Cape . <p> ( iii ) Power purchased from the SAPP : <p> Eskom will purchase power from neighbouring countries , such as Zambia and Botswana , that have excess electricity capacity , through the Southern African Power Pool ( SAPP ) . We note that Eskom is already a member of the SAPP . <p> If a cross border project is intended prior to the enactment of new legislation , then there must be due regard of the requirements in regulations 6(4) and 8 of the Electricity Regulations on New Generation Capacity ( as issued in terms of ERA ) . <p> These require , among other things , that the Minister needs to be satisfied ( when issuing a section 34 determination for a cross border project @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are in place or will be in place between the Government and the relevant foreign government or international organisation , as are necessary to enable that cross border project . <p> ( iv ) Procurement of battery storage and gas-fired power : <p> Eskom will be constructing its first solar and battery storage projects at Komati , Majuba , Lethabo and several other power stations . This will result in over 500 MW being added to the grid . By storing excess power for a later time when it is most needed through battery storage technologies , the grid is able to deploy that power to address demand during peak periods . <p> A request for proposals for battery storage capacity will be released by September this year , and a further request for proposals for gas power will follow . We note that there has been no mention of new coal , nuclear or hydro procurement in the President 's address . <p> 2 . Easing of distributed generation regulations and new legislation <p> In June 2021 , the licensing requirement for generation projects up to 100 MW was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the licensing requirement for embedded generation . This will incentivise further private investment in electricity generation and reduce the lead times to commence construction of projects . <p> While these projects will not require licences , all new generation projects will still have to register with NERSA , comply with environmental legislation , and meet technical requirements for grid connection . Although this development is welcomed , some practical concerns arise that will need to be clarified by NERSA : <p> The reference to " embedded generation " by the President creates some uncertainty because it is a term that is understood differently in different contexts . For example , it is not clear whether wheeling projects are included or not within this term . <p> A question arises about transitional arrangements . What happens to projects that are envisaged to be above the 100 MW threshold and have already submitted licence applications to NERSA ? Will these applications be carried through , or will they be converted into registration applications ? NERSA will need to consider any changes in law in assessing the approach to such projects . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expedited basis to address the legal and regulatory obstacles to new generation capacity , for a limited period . In the meantime , Government will waive or streamline certain regulatory requirements where it is possible to do so within existing legislation . The following has been proposed : <p> Reduction of the regulatory requirements for solar projects in areas of low and medium environmental sensitivity . <p> Expansion of Eskom power lines and substations without needing to get environmental authorisation in areas of low and medium sensitivity and within the strategic electricity corridors . <p> Establishment of a single point of entry for all energy project applications , to ensure co-ordination of approval processes across the government . <p> Departments and entities are reviewing all existing timeframes to ensure that all applications are processed on an urgent basis . <p> To meaningfully address legal and regulatory obstacles , the " special legislation " will also need to other regulatory and permitting requirements and provide a regime for how these can be expedited . These include the following : <p> Ministerial approvals in terms of the Subdivision of Agricultural Land Act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sale of portions of agricultural land ; <p> Section 53 consents in terms of the Mineral and Petroleum Resources Development Act , 28 of 2002 , for use of land surface ; <p> Local municipal requirements regarding land use ( zoning ) as well as general compliance with municipal by-laws ( such as those relating to water ) ; and <p> Appeals and review proceedings , including how objections and appeals can be dealt with in an expedited manner . <p> 3 . Incentivising investment in rooftop solar through feed-in tariffs <p> The government has acknowledged the potential for households and businesses to install rooftop solar solutions and to connect this power to the grid . To incentivise greater uptake of rooftop solar , Eskom will develop rules and a pricing structure , known as a " feed-in tariff " , for all commercial and residential installations on its network . <p> This means that those who have installed solar panels in their homes or businesses will be able to sell surplus power to Eskom . There are some complexities here as most of these installations occur within municipal distribution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is unclear at this point the extent to which municipalities have bought into this regime and it will be interesting to see what proposals are made to deal with issues of net metering and billing within the municipal system . <p> 4 . Improving the performance of Eskom 's existing power stations <p> To address the red tape around buying spares and equipment to effect critical repairs at power stations , it was announced that Eskom 's budget for critical maintenance will be increased over the next 12 months . Eskom is actively recruiting skilled personnel who will work towards reinstating world-class operating and maintenance procedures . <p> We suspect Eskom will be relying on emergency procurement procedures which allow deviation from the ordinary requirements to have to go through a competitive tender process in order to buy spares and equipment on an urgent basis . <p> This is something which is self-evidently open to abuse and has the potential to be a vehicle for corruption and looting of this increased budget allocation . It remains to be seen what structural mechanisms will be put in place to ensure that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protections , does not result in abuse . <p> 5 . The fundamental transformation of the electricity sector <p> National Treasury is finalising a sustainable solution to Eskom 's R400 billion debt , and the Minister of Finance will outline how this matter will be dealt with in the October Medium-Term Budget Policy Statement . <p> The government will use climate funding provided through the Just Energy Transition Partnership to invest in the grid and will also repurpose power stations that have reached the end of their lives . <p> The government has previously announced that the restructuring of Eskom will result in the establishments of three entities , namely an electricity generation entity , an electricity transmission entity and an electricity distribution entity . Eskom has already established an independent transmission company and is on track to separate its generation and distribution businesses by the end of 2022 . <p> It will soon be appointing boards for the transmission and generation entities . The grid will remain state owned , despite these interventions . The unbundling of Eskom and the broader reforms to establish a competitive electricity market will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compete on an equal footing . <p> Broader reforms to establish a competitive electricity market will be expedited through the finalisation of the amendment of ERA to promote private sector investment . The second amendment Bill to ERA was published in February 2022 and the DMRE has been engaging with various stakeholders to incorporate comments and release an amended Bill later in 2022 . <p> To ensure that these measures are implemented in a co-ordinated manner , president Ramaphosa has established a National Energy Crisis Committee ( NECC ) which is chaired by the Director-General in the Presidency and brings together all the departments and entities involved in the provision of electricity . <p> Conclusion <p> The Government interventions proposed by President Ramaphosa to address South Africa 's electricity supply crisis are very positive and long overdue . The implementation of these measures will be critical to rescue South Africans and their economy from the ravages of the ongoing load shedding and lead them towards sustainable economic growth and well-being .

In addition , the network rollout that is already taking place remains skewed towards urban areas and less toward rural ones . <p> These are relevant factors , and ones that have been thrust into the spotlight following the Covid-19 pandemic .

@@92651234 <h> Key considerations for agritech <p> According to Oxford Business Group 's Agriculture Africa Report 2021 , the sector contributes around 15% of the continent 's GDP and employs a significant amount of people . <p> Estelle Lubbe , co-founder and CXO of The Awareness Company , believes technology can play a significant role in streamlining agricultural operations across the value chain to enable efficiencies , maximise yields and contribute to food security on the continent , but there are several considerations to take into account . <p> " There are some very important questions that an agricultural business must answer before procuring technology , " she says . " It is important to first determine whether your farming business is ready for technology and what your technology strategy is . It is also important to have a clear idea of what you would like to improve with the technology , whether you have the budget and how this will disrupt your business . Equally important is to ensure that you have overall buy-in from all the decision-makers of your business , otherwise , you are setting yourself up for failure .

" <p> She adds that the farm might also require electricity for the solutions depending on what type of solution is deployed , which means they would need to consider the different options around available solar or generators and keep future maintenance requirements in mind , planning for those accordingly as well as take the security of the equipment into account . <p> " The next big part of your agritech deployment is the adoption of both the technology and the processes that come with it . It is important to understand what type of skills will be required and upskill your employees , giving them insight into the value the technology will bring to the farm and , in turn , to them . This will increase your chances of success and return on investment , " says Lubbe . <p> It can be difficult to determine the return on investment ( ROI ) , which is why setting goals and objectives upfront is crucial . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ process and employee efficiency , crop quality improvement , money and time savings , how long you will benefit from the technology and increasing your environmental sustainability as a farm through reduced water consumption , " she says . <p> The costliest mistakes made in the process of procuring agritech lie in not doing adequate research , therefore the initial research is imperative . " Once you have identified the outputs you are after and determined your ROI goals , it becomes a lot easier to identify potential solutions and service providers , " says Lubbe . <p> " Ask for demonstrations and testimonials , so that you can understand the technical capabilities of your suppliers , and check that you will have access to local support for any hardware and software you implement . Ensure the technology is simple enough to use so that it does n't detract from your core business and make sure any peripherals required , such as replacement batteries are readily available and at what cost . <p> " Start small and scale from there and ask for advice from your peers , " concludes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deploy on one or two use cases and build on it from there .

@@92710234 <h> An Unspoken Gender And Racial Bias Problem Stifles African Healthtech <p> In the past year , disturbingly skewed funding trends have persisted , with black and all-female founding teams suffering the most , and perhaps evidently more so in the healthtech sector than others . <p> Black female founders , for instance , only received 2 percent of all funding in the previous year , despite the fact that the African market for digitized healthcare supply chains has developed significantly over the previous two years , as exemplified by data that suggests funding for local healthtech operations hit USD 78.5 M last year . <p> There has been significant development and promise in the market , according to a Salient Advisory report on market intelligence . However , the report 's primary suggestions were motivated by the challenges faced by founders of colour , founding teams made entirely of women , and entrepreneurs without ties ( to high-net-worth nations ) through schooling , marriage , or funding . <p> The data below shows the harsh realities of discriminatory funding : <p> 56 percent of innovators who raised funds in the last 12 months were black founders , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> In contrast , companies with mixed-race founders ( 22 percent ) combined to raise 59 percent of the total funds . <p> All-female founder innovators Maisha Meds , Kahsa , One Health , myMedicines , and Medsaf raised USD 7.4 M , albeit a huge chunk of this total was raised by Kahsa and Maisha Meds who are white founders . <p> 79 percent of all types of funding went to startups led solely by men , and 12 percent went to startups with mixed-gender founding teams . <p> More than 82 percent of global investors are men . Due diligence processes have been designed primarily by men for male investors . Hence , women tend to be overlooked by the majority of investors . <p> All of this begs the question of what black and female business owners need in order to accelerate the growth and impact of their enterprises . How could the needs of , say , enterprises operated by women be different from those of other businesses ? How does a lack of funding affect the solutions provided exclusively for women by inventors like Kasha @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Senior Consultant at Salient Advisory ; a healthcare consulting firm offering advisory services to clients who invest in healthcare programmes in emerging markets , recently shared some valuable thoughts from the vanguard on the subject of recommendations for more inclusive funding opportunities with WeeTracker . <p> WT : Why is the topic of gender and racial gaps in the African healthtech sector important with respect to how things are shaping up and the relevant shortcomings ? <p> Uwase : The African healthtech sector is growing , making it critical to have homegrown solutions by Africans . Therefore , equity is important , and opportunities need to be made available to all founders , with particular attention paid to women founders since they face more barriers to entry . <p> Localisation is also important for supply chain resilience and sustainability , hence the need for greater investment in African founders who have more skin in the game and a more natural understanding of the challenges and cultural context . <p> WT : For context , how is the ' game ' rigged against certain groups in practice based on your observations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Our research demonstrates that founders with ties to high-income countries ( HIC ) receive more funding . This was magnified in our 2021 report on innovators in the supply chain sector that found the majority of African founders without HICs ties who have received external funding have raised less than USD 150 K. <p> In stark contrast , the majority of innovators with ties to HICs -- through work experience , education , or non-African co-founders who have raised external funding -- have garnered over USD 1 M in support . Therefore , receiving education from or garnering work experience in HICs , and having nationals from HICs as founders or co-founders on the team , can play a key role in facilitating access to global investor networks . <p> This apparent fundraising ceiling reflects long-running beliefs about perception bias on the part of global investors in Africa 's tech ecosystems , particularly among venture capital investors who appear more likely to fund innovators with HIC ties . <p> WT : What factors are responsible for the funding disparities in the sector and why are they so entrenched ? <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few factors may contribute to the exclusion of African women from funding opportunities . Below are factors highlighted in our 2022 report on innovators in the supply chain sector . <p> The investment sector is dominated by men . Therefore , due diligence processes and methods to identify new investment opportunities tend to cater more to men . <p> Women entrepreneurs that seek funding face gender bias . As an example , women can be perceived as less skilled than their male counterparts . <p> Capacity-building programs are not well suited for women . As an example , these initiatives can be designed in ways that do not cater to the schedules of women that need to balance work and family responsibilities . <p> WT : In what ways do the racial and gender gaps affect the progress of the sector or stifle innovation ? <p> Uwase : These gaps mean there are fewer solutions coming from African founders , who are most familiar with the unique challenges plaguing the health systems . Similarly , there are fewer solutions from female founders catering to unique health challenges being faced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cultural norms and economic challenges in the geographies where they are implemented .

What would you recommend as a step to be taken that could close the gaps ? <p> Uwase : A more equitable playing field would be when affirmative-type action is taken by funders to ensure that women and African founders get funded at higher rates as compared to the status quo , with female founders also receiving support to address structural barriers they face . <p> Recommendations are : <p> Develop more mechanisms that allow African founders to access funding and support easily .

Because of the reduced number of women in tech in the ecosystem , there is a lack of access to women mentors , especially back when we founded our company in 2007 . <p> This also means that there is a lack of access to diverse and inclusive spaces for minority women , " she says . <p> The Woman Boss is part of a growing movement on the continent and unique in The Gambia as it works to improve the tides for women in the technology sector . <p> Particularly , in the tiny West African nation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have little exposure to technology as a career option even if they make it into tertiary education . <p> " They tend to pick traditional subjects but never tech . This could be because there are no recognizable leaders in the industry for them . We want to change the norm so when it is time for graduation , they view tech as an option . They are curious about technology as they become familiar with it , " explains Lowe-Khan . <p> Gender disparities in The Gambia are far-reaching but can be seen clearly when analysing the country 's technology sector . According to a recent World Bank study , in the country 's budding digital economy , gender gaps in the industry begin as early as primary school . It is believed that only 10% of adolescent boys and 6% of adolescent girls ( between 15 -- 18 years old ) in The Gambia have even basic ICT skills . <p> " Returning to work after maternity leave can be quite challenging for some , and as a result we now have a cr ? che facility for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we hope that other institutions can follow suit .

Part of The Woman Boss mandate is to sensitize young women across the country 's high schools with the awareness of the technology sector as well as preparing them for leadership within the field .

Innovations , a leading software developer in the country 's capital , Banjul . Even she admits that the tech track was an unusual one for a Gambian woman but she entered the industry boldly thanks to the support of her family . <p> " When I completed high school , my peers naturally went to university or college .

This is not always due to the lack of talent or commitment , but mostly down to the patriarchal society we are in . Often when we get married or have children , as women , we are expected to stay home and care for the family . It is often a huge challenge to get back as there is no support from government , family etc to return to the field , " she explains . <p> This does n't mean that these obstacles ca n't be overcome .

Act when the safety of others is at risk . <p> " Companies and CEOs are having to speak up constantly on social issues , " she says , " and I was trying to think about how we could shift the narrative from isolated issues -- LGBTQ+ rights , guns , Roe -- and wondering what kind of framework we could build that is rooted in fact , and depoliticizes issues that ( have been ) wrongly politicized . These are not political issues , they impact the safety , health and well-being of humans across the board . " <p> The premise is great , but how exactly does one appeal to humans across the board when the pieces on the board are more akin to chess pieces battling than disparate parts of one whole ? <p> To Ellis , it begins with Maslow 's Hierarchy of Needs . " If you look at Maslow , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " So , the framework should be simple and factual : it 's all about people 's safety . Safety in schools , safety at work , safety for women , safety for the LGBTQ community . Safety for the under-represented . You 're either for safety or against it . " <p> Who could reasonably be against safety ? Well , at a time when 7% of Americans believe chocolate milk comes from brown cows , anything 's possible . As Ellis points out , " there is a fringe that will always be fringe and you ca n't argue with them , but you can have a stance and a framework that is for good and for all . " <p> But even " safety " can be subjective . When asked what she 'd say to those would argue for the safety of the unborn child , she admits , " There 's no perfect framework . But CEOs are having to speak up all the time on one or another social issue and it 's a race on narrative . You 've said you support us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and procedures , but what are you doing in the public sphere when the rubber hits the road ? We think ' safety ' lets them get ahead of issues and creates a decision tree that can help them do the right thing when the right thing seems hard . " <p> For businesses , no matter what or whom you ally with or against there will be those who love you for it and those who do n't . This has always been true -- it 's just more so now , with no signs on the horizon that it will become less so moving forward . Employee , consumer , shareholder and stakeholder activism and expectations all but mandates corporate action , accountability and transparency in ways heretofore unconsidered . And this is true regardless of whether you fall on Hobby Lobby 's side of the conversation or Patagonia 's . <p> Ellis is , of course , right . No perfect framework for this exists in these particularly imperfect times . And as much as she thinks this is a framework for any one CEO , her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coalition of them . " The biggest thing is CEOs going in together and signing some sort of shared declaration , " she says . " ' We believe in the safety of our employees and customers . This is where we stand , and we will act in support of ( it ) whenever it is challenged . ' " <p> Ensuring social , cultural , and economic safety seems a reasonable bar for businesses to hurdle . After all , if you ca n't stand resolutely for the safety of those you work with , sell to , and seek to serve , what exactly can you stand for ? <p> By Seth Matlins , Forbes Staff <h> Sign Up for Our Newsletter Daily Update <p> Get the best of Forbes Africa sent straight to your inbox with breaking business news , insights and updates from experts across the continent . <p> Get this delivered to your inbox , and more info about about our products and services .

@@92801231 <h> Why Power Outages Are Getting Worse In The U.S. <p> The average American experienced just over eight hours of power outages in 2020 . The overall duration of power interruptions in the U.S. more than doubled over the past 5 years . Beyond just inconvenience , blackouts cost the U.S. an estimated $150 billion every year . They can also be fatal , as most recently seen during the 2021 outage in Texas . So why is the U.S. power grid so unreliable and can it be fixed ? Despite the Biden administration 's effort to improve the situation , recent actions would suggest the federal government lacks the ability to enforce a grid modernization . There were a total of 549 policy and deployment actions on grid modernization during the second quarter of 2022 , but of the $12.86 billion in investment under consideration , regulators only approved $478.7 million , according to the NC Clean Energy Technology Center . " Electricity systems are an area of shared federal and state jurisdictions , " according to Romany Webb , senior fellow at the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia University . " The fact that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the states is one of the factors that contributes to the complexity of the sort of modernizing the grid and building out additional infrastructure . " What 's more , certain state and regional regulators often have political incentives to fight against changes to the power grid . " The state entities that regulate electric utilities are called state public utility commissions , " said Webb . " In some states , those commissioners are elected . So if we 're talking about making investments that are going to be really expensive and are going to be increasing electricity bills , they might see a lot of pushback from customers about that and that might affect the commissioners ' chances of reelection . " Those directly affected by grid-modernization efforts say there are valid reasons to fight against such disruptive projects . " We 're not opposed to solar , but it does not belong on farmland . It does n't belong in an agriculturally zoned area and it certainly does not belong on timberland , " said Susan Ralston , president of Citizens for Responsible Solar . " These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end of the day , we 're trying to do what 's right by our county .

No matter the industry , customer data and insights are vital to helping deliver meaningful experiences , create strong engagement and achieve customer satisfaction . <p> So , since marketing is so integral to driving direct sales and revenue , why is the much-needed data so elusive ? Well , marketers are stuck in the clutter from how organisations have evolved in the digital era . Layers of technologies and touchpoints have made marketing complex , overwhelming marketers with endless tasks and data black holes . <p> The pressure is on marketers to collect , connect and stay current on customer data to deliver business value . Still , the tools , competing priorities and ingrained ways of working make it very difficult to modernise how marketing works . <h> Getting the data house in order <p> At Accenture , we surveyed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to learn how marketing is changing and what leaders expect for the future . We segmented them into 17% Thrivers , 66% Strivers , and 17% Survivors -- based on how they treat customer relationships . <p> One group of marketing executives has cut the clutter . They are called Thrivers . They deliver superior revenue growth , profitability , and customer satisfaction , and their teams are invigorated . Everything that Thrivers do relates to how well they continually collect data , extract insights and act on them in a timely way to deliver data-driven experiences . <p> More than half of marketing organisations fall into the Strivers category -- they have always struggled with customer data . They usually do n't have a strategy for managing first- , second- and third-party data , often do n't connect anonymous to known data , and sometimes lose opportunities to derive signals and patterns that drive better experiences . So while they have data from more channels than two years ago , they still admit to a data gap .

@@92908233 <h> Collaboration the only solution to bridge massive skills gap <p> Aug 17 , 2022 <p> Kathy Gibson reports -- South African stakeholders from government , education and industry need to work together and take urgent action to alleviate the ICT skills shortage so the country can drive a vibrant economy . <p> This is the overriding message from a white paper released today by EY and Huawei , which examines the current skills shortage and recommends action to address it . <p> Angelika Goliger , chief economist of EY Africa and sub-Saharan Africa representative in EY 's geostrategic business group , presented the findings from the paper , " ICT Talent Development for the Digital South Africa " , this morning . <p> " We are all aware of having gone through significant volatility globally and in South Africa , with severe economic distress , " she says . " The South African economy has just managed to reach pre-pandemic levels . <p> " At the same time the ICT sector has shown resilience , largely as a result of the needs driven by the pandemic . But South Africa 's ICT growth has had a ceiling because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ICT skills needs go well beyond the ICT industry , Goliger points out , with ICT a vital part of all industries . " Technology can be a multiplier in the economic sense , and is critical for a country 's development . " <p> The white paper identified three key challenges facing the country . <p> " Firstly , we need to speed up the process of moving South Africa to the digital economy . Rapidly-evolving technologies have the potential to spur industrial development , attract investment and create conditions for inclusive growth . But people and skills are needed to enable this . " <p> The second finding is that there is already a significant demand for ICT talent , and this will continue to grow . <p> " There is also a demand for more foundational skills , " says Goliger . " And these skills need to evolve as the technology evolves . " <p> Companies realise they need to continually upskill , with 44% of people 's skills having to change as they go forward , and 75% of orgnanisations looking to provide reskilling for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need to increase the supply of ICT talent to cater for future demand . " The education sector is still not yielding enough graduates , " Goliger says . " And the skills they do produce need to be in line with demand . " <p> This situation is exacerbated by a very real brain drain , and the ability for skilled individuals to work anywhere in the world . <p> The white paper concludes with a number of recommendations for action by government , the education sector and the ICT industry . <p> " If there is one takeaway from this exercise , it is collaboration , " Goliger says . " Everyone needs to work together to achieve a vibrant and healthy ICT sector that can support a growing economy . " <p> Government 's role in the collaboration starts with policy . " There are great policies in place , but they need to monitored and evaluated , and tweaked where needed if they are not producing results . <p> There is also a need to ensure flexibility in the education systems for ICT skills , making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With the fast-moving nature of technology and ICT , the industry is calling for a more responsive educational approach ; and collaboration could be structured differently . " <p> The education sector is urged to conduct a feasibility study to develop a framework for ICT and digital education content , and set up a platform for how it can be developed and grown over time . <p> There is also a need to support educators and teachers in understanding digital technologies . <p> " Education needs to work in conjunction with all relevant entities to define a long-term strategic vision , " Goliger says . <p> The ICT sector has an important role to play in this collaboration , and should provide regular training events and help to create job opportunities . <p> " The industry should be providing universities and TVETs with information on the current and emerging skills that are required . " <p> In the workplace , the ICT industry should also focus on providing continuous , lifelong learning for employees ; and also ensure that we benefit from imported skills . <p> Chen Ka , deputy-CEO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been an enabler throughout the Covid years , and will continue as such for years to come . <p> " This means more skilled people are going to be required to meet current and future needs , " he says . <p> Ka believes there is a multi-layered demand for ICT talent : to empower ICT policy-makers to better utilise digital tools ; to reskill and upskill the ICT workforce for current and future innovations ; to build a pool of young talent for the long-term ; and to promote digital awareness among ordinary citizens in order to drive a knowledge-based society . <p> " I call for closer collaboration between government , academia and industry to explore the possibility for more ICT development programmes , " says Ka . <p> " I also want to stress that Huawei commits to continuing to help bridge the digital divide , nurture South Africa 's ICT talent , and provide inclusive opportunities for all people .

These tools are invaluable not only in how they reduce data rot and duplication , but in how they cut the costs that are rising up around data like skyscrapers in New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ data storage , interpretation , management , insights and analytics , among other things , is n't going to come down , " says Raubenheimer . " Companies need solutions that ensure they only collect what they need , help reduce their storage , and that give them the requisite expertise to make sense of the data and squeeze out its value . It 's the most sustainable way forward , not by rejecting data but by investing into solutions that make it relevant and accessible . " <p> One such solution is cloud-based data lakes . These are built in the cloud and allow companies to store data relatively inexpensively and to implement data management architectures that will help them identify and consume only the data that 's valuable . The adoption of these more agile and scalable solutions will likely see a shift in how vendors approach customer data solutions -- they will increasingly focus on models that allow customers to remove the noise and bring the valuable data to the surface . Money will not be found in adding more and more storage to the bottom line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want . <p> " It 's definitely time to listen to what organisations want and to change the way data is managed and controlled , " says Raubenheimer . " The industry as a whole has to find a new route to data best practice that allows for organisations to consume data more effectively without extensive reliance on expensive infrastructure . The future is about adding value -- to the data , to the business , and to the customer . " <p> Looking ahead at the rising data numbers -- both in cost and in volume -- organisations need to change the way they look at , and consume , data . If not , data will outgrow budgets and infrastructure while dodging the value bullet and simply making it harder for the business to do just that ... business . This is the right time to build data muscles that can flex and adapt and that have the strength to carry the right data while giving the organisation the space it needs to marry the data to the intelligent systems that can refine and define it properly .

With its intuitive control system , excellent object interaction , and some great UI design , this adventure is one of VR 's most polished games yet . It 's unfortunate that combat does n't quite hit the mark but there 's some delightfully tactile puzzles to sustain the six-hour story .

@@93037237 <h> How Eskom crisis is taking South African society to the brink <p> SOUTH African industries , businesses and households are scrambling to generate their own electricity in the face of a widening power shortfall , which is set to persist and probably worsen until the private sector can play a much bigger role in meeting the country 's energy needs . It also needs to collaborate with government on an effective strategy to address the crisis . <p> Eskom will not be able to fix the problems at its coal-fired plants until the power gap is closed and there is enough additional spare generation capacity to give the state-owned power utility the space to take units offline for extended periods of time . <p> The outlook is rapidly worsening as many of its coal-fired plants are near the end of their operational lifespan and due for retirement in 15 years . <p> At present Eskom can only reliably provide about 27,000MW of power to SA 's faltering economy -- not much more than half of its installed generation capacity and well below peak winter demand levels of around 34,000GW . Its electricity production declined 5.3% between 2012 and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Over the same period , the energy availability factor at the utility 's coal-fired plants has fallen dramatically , hovering just below 60% this year compared with 72% in 2018 and 85% in 2010 . <p> Eskom has been forced to implement rotating power cuts , or load-shedding , since 2008 in order to protect the national grid , and breakdowns have steadily increased due to its inability to catch up on maintenance . A skills shortage , slow procurement process , theft and sabotage have all exacerbated the challenges of fixing the power plants . <p> By the end of the first week of July , the intensity of load-shedding had surpassed the levels seen in 2021 , which were an annual record . At that point the country had already experienced 73 days of power cuts compared with 29 in 2021 , and the vulnerability of supply was highlighted after a strike by unions at the end of June forced Eskom to intensify power cuts to six hours a day . <p> Industry executives and analysts warn that , without focused solutions agreed between the private sector , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worsen over the next few years , raising the risk of a national blackout . <p> Installing renewable energy , mainly solar photovoltaic ( PV ) , to cover the existing 4,000-6,000MW shortfall is seen as the only way to plug the gap in the near term and they say the private sector must drive the process as it has the finances , expertise and ability to do so . <p> But even in a best-case scenario , load-shedding will persist for another two years . An independent study published by Meridian Economics in June warns that in the absence of urgent intervention , power cuts will increase substantially over the next few years , rising fourfold in 2024 and tenfold in 2026 . <p> " From a South Deep perspective , we can navigate this but if you look at the broader context , the fabric of our society is being eroded by this crisis . People are losing jobs because of businesses going bust -- there 's anger growing and my bigger concern is for the broader economy and the breakdown of social trust . <p> " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this crisis , it 's going to become an emergency . " <p> Harmony Gold CEO Peter Steenkamp concurs : " If you look at the country , it 's very much an emergency situation we 're in at the moment . It 's something we need to fix -- the sooner we get the red tape out of the way and actually start building RE renewable energy plants and getting more capacity on the grid the better . " <p> South Africa 's mining sector , which consumes about 30% of Eskom 's electricity , has been at the forefront of building new generation capacity , which will help meet its needs and take some of the pressure off the state-owned utility . <p> According to Roger Baxter , the CEO of the Minerals Council South Africa , miners have a pipeline of 73 new projects , which could add 5,100MW to the grid , with an investment value of R77bn . Most of them utilise solar power but also hydrogen , wind , battery storage and gas . <p> As things stand , the projects being built by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this year , rising to 931MW by the end of 2023 and 2,294MW by the end of 2024 . <p> This would reduce the sector 's exposure to Eskom by between 20% and 30% and go a long way towards achieving its net-zero carbon emissions target set for 2050 , according to the Minerals Council head of communications , Allan Seccombe . <p> A building boom is taking place to install generation capacity across the private sector , with 1,300MW of solar PV already in place within the residential , commercial and manufacturing sectors , according to the South African Photovoltaic Industry Association . Industry sources have a much higher estimate of 2,000MW , and say around 70% is probably unregistered . <p> What has taken place is helpful but far from enough to address an energy shortage that is choking economic growth , exacerbating unemployment and stoking social unrest . Estimates vary but analysis suggests that load-shedding at the stages being implemented so far in 2022 are costing the economy between R1bn and R1.5bn a day . <p> PwC chief economist Lulu Kruger estimates that this year , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ domestic product . " The bottom line is that the number is scary . This is because load-shedding is not a once-off break in the value chain , it moves from production to logistics and diverts investment as people buy inverters , generators and solar panels to address their power needs . " <p> The problem is that the private sector can not address the crisis by building its own generating capacity piecemeal , particularly with regulations that slow down the process of getting approval for projects . At the time of writing this article , there was deep concern that given political constraints , President Cyril Ramaphosa would be unable to galvanise enough consensus in government to take the steps needed to kickstart a rapid rollout of renewables by the private sector . <h> Cut red tape , reframe IRP <p> Ramaphosa 's decision to force Minerals and Energy Minister Gwede Mantashe last year to raise the cap on private generation not requiring a licence to 100MW from 1MW has not proved to be the silver bullet -- there is still a pipeline of approvals across different government departments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of SA ( Nersa ) will register the project . <p> Intense lobbying by industry and business has elicited a positive response from Operation Vulindlela , a joint initiative set up by the Presidency and Treasury to speed structural reforms . This has shortened the approval process , which used to take up to two years , and Nersa said in June that since the cap was lifted , it had approved 216 registration applications . <p> But much more speed is needed and overlapping measures are being proposed by a number of key role players in the economy . Recommendations from the National Planning Commission ( NPC ) , set up by government in 2010 , are likely to be taken the most seriously . <p> On 6 July , it urged that an " energy emergency " had to be declared to make it possible to override some of the red tape that is hampering new generation capacity being delivered rapidly . <p> It was possible to bring 10,000MW of new generation capacity in the form of wind and solar power as well as 5,000MW of storage capacity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steps were taken , it said . <p> The NPC recommends that the 100MW ceiling for registering projects at Nersa be removed , as an authorisation for grid access from Eskom is all that is needed to regulate the market . <p> Any Nersa generation process that delayed the implementation of projects should be scrapped and replaced with an online registration procedure while environmental and water use approvals had to be streamlined , it said . <p> Most controversially of all , the NPC said there should be a temporary exemption from local content requirements for the construction and commissioning of new generation and storage capacity due to come online in the next 36 months . <p> NPC member Mark Swilling has said the consequences of a business-as-usual approach by government were " too ghastly to contemplate " . <p> Other measures are seen as essential by companies that are about to become big producers as well as consumers of electricity . These include a framework allowing them to easily ' wheel ' their excess power across the grid to other customers , and feed-in tariffs to allow Eskom to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chairperson of the Energy Intensive Users Group , says although there have been steps in the right direction , there is a " notable absence of a joint vision " for the energy supply industry . " We need to come together as different stakeholders to ask how this is going to play out , what role are we each going to play ? " <p> Martin says although the immediate priority is simply to add capacity to the grid , there is also an urgent need to update government 's Integrated Resource Plan ( IRP ) , which assesses the country 's future electric needs and plans to meet those needs . <p> " It needs to be a strictly technical and economic study without political influence -- it should not be artificially constrained and manipulated , " he says . The Department of Mineral Resources and Energy has put a tentative deadline of the end of 2023 for a new IRP . <p> Energy analyst Chris Yelland says the IRP should be an indicative , not a prescriptive or binding plan , as it has been in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stands and is being implemented , the prescriptive IRP is a massive threat to electricity customers , the economy and the country . " <p> The expensive local content requirements for the government 's Renewable Energy Independent Power Procurement and so-called Risk Mitigation Independent Power Producer Procurement Programme are likely to further delay those projects or even result in them being cancelled , according to Meridian Economics . <p> They would have brought a combined 4,435MW on to the grid , but are already running well behind schedule . " While it appears that policymakers are not aware of the impact of their actions , this problem is now directly exacerbating load-shedding , which will of course result in much greater damage to the economy than any benefit that could possibly be achieved by these uninformed policy measures , " Meridian said in its report . <p> Demand for power always increases in winter , and this year there have been two big additional contributors to energy shortages . An explosion in August 2021 at Medupi , one of Eskom 's two new power plants , took one of its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ action and it will not be back online until August 2024 . <p> In addition , one of the two units at Koeberg nuclear power station , providing 920MW of power , has been taken offline for a 155-day outage to refuel and replace three steam generators that will allow the life of the plant to be extended another 20 years beyond July 2024 . <p> People are losing jobs because of businesses going bust -- there 's anger growing and my bigger concern is for the broader economy and the breakdown of social trust . <p> However , as the generator replacement has been postponed and the repairs are behind schedule , the unit is due to return to service only in mid-August . <p> The other unit must go through the same process but given the delays and problems encountered at Koeberg so far , there is a real risk that the plant , in the past one of Eskom 's most reliable power sources , will not get its licence renewed in time for the deadline . <p> Against this grim backdrop , Eskom CEO Andr ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ utility 's management and his allies in government , Ramaphosa and Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan . <p> On his watch , Eskom has launched a programme whereby companies can lease Eskom-owned land in Mpumalanga province for the development of renewable energy projects that can easily be connected to the grid -- selected projects so far will provide about 2,000MW of power . <p> De Ruyter and his team have also come up with a plan to improve grid access in the Northern Cape , which is too saturated to take on new renewable energy projects despite the province being SA 's most resource rich . <p> He has said that the initial tranches of the R130bn pledged by developed countries to help SA transit from a high-carbon to a low-carbon economy will focus on transmission projects in the Northern Cape and on adding transformer capacity in Mpumalanga , where most of the new development is due to take place . <p> Miningmx is a digital publication which provides independent news and analysis related to the African mining sector .

@@93084236 <p> It 's been seven years since the Hawks started investigations into corruption at the Passenger Railway Agency of SA ( Prasa ) . <p> On Wednesday , investigative research and advocacy group Open Secrets released its latest report ' Bad Cops Bad Lawyers ' , and it 's a disheartening roll call of seemingly wasted law enforcement effort . Multiple inquiries , thousands of pages of evidence published by the Zondo Commission into state capture , 110 cases referred by Eskom to the police since 2018 and 60 more referred to prosecutors by the Special Investigation Unit of the police , just on Eskom -- and still no convictions . <p> This comes just a day after the Hawks held a media briefing to outline what progress it had made in locking up the bad guys . <p> It focused on 45 high profile cases , but missed a few of the obvious ones : the theft of a large amount of US dollars at President Cyril Ramaphosa 's Phala Phala game farm and the irregular efforts subsequently used to track the thieves and the money ; the lawlessness that allows illegal miners to operate seemingly without hinderance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movers behind the July 2021 riots in KwaZulu-Natal and Gauteng . <p> The Open Secrets report uses evidence submitted to the Zondo Commission , confidential National Prosecuting Authority ( NPA ) documents , court judgments , and investigative reports to tell the story of how the Hawks and the NPA have failed to take on state capture cases . It also recommends that true reform in these agencies will not be possible unless they hold their own to account . <p> Much of the problem appears to lie with the Hawks themselves , which is actively recruiting to fill some 200 vacant posts . In a media address on Tuesday , Hawks boss Godfrey Lebeya outlined the extent to which his roughly 2 600 staff were investigating 22 477 cases with a combined value of R1.5 trillion . <p> A total of 4 447 convictions have been obtained in the last four years , but what was noticeably lacking from this victory parade was any high-profile arrests and convictions for state capture . <p> While much of the information in the Open Secrets report is in the public domain , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and law enforcement . <p> For example , former National Director of Public Prosecutions ( NDPP ) , Bulelani Ngcuka , was accused of being an apartheid spy by a group of supporters of Jacob Zuma -- primarily former intelligence boss Mo Shaik and Mac Maharaj , Zuma 's former spokesperson when he was president . " Ngcuka was the subject of a gruelling judicial commission of inquiry after he was accused of being an apartheid-era spy . While his name was cleared by the commission , Ngcuka resigned as NDPP , in 2004 , after six years in office , " says Open Secrets . <p> This smear campaign coincided with the NPA 's investigation into the arms deal , which also implicated Zuma . <p> Interference <p> SA has cycled through six permanent and three acting NDPPs since 1998 . None have lasted the full 10 years in office . Ngcuka 's successor Vusi Pikoli became the subject of an inquiry into his fitness to hold office after he issued a warrant of arrest for late police commissioner Jackie Selebi . Pikoli was dismissed two years after taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a ' person of unimpeachable integrity ' . <p> Public trust in the office of the NPA declined even further under the Zuma presidency , when Menzi Simelane , then the director general of the justice department , was appointed to the to position of NDPP . Simelane had been found to have unduly interfered in the Jackie Selebi case and made misrepresentations under oath . <p> Things stepped up a notch in 2015 when Shaun Abrahams was appointed NDPP . He authorised some dubious cases , such as the investigation into former SA Revenue Service ( Sars ) officials Johann van Loggerenberg , Ivan Pillay , and Andries Janse van Rensburg for operating an alleged ' rogue unit ' -- later debunked . It is widely suspected that the accusations of a rogue unit were an attempt to knee-cap a legitimate investigation into big tax cheats . The case was dropped in 2020 when the NPA found no reasonable prospect of a successful prosecution . <p> The office of the NDPP was also used to run interference for political allies in other cases . <p> This includes the charges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Independent Police Investigative Directorate ( IPID ) , who had been investigating allegations of corruption against former SA Police Services ( SAPS ) Commissioner Khomotso Phahlane . Charges against McBride were dropped in 2016 . <p> Former national Hawks boss Anwa Dramat and former Gauteng Hawks boss Shadrack Sibiya were under investigation after being ( falsely ) accused of illegally renditioning Zimbabweans back to their home country . McBride cleared them of wrongdoing .

This is how the proud German society disintegrated into complete chaos after the hyperinflation of the Reichsmark .

@@93084239 <h> Email this article <h> How Ninety One is finding sustainable income in global markets <p> ' We think there are more interesting ways of delivering return and protecting the portfolio than just buying lots of government bonds , which is what people have done historically ' -- fund manager John Stopford . <p> FIFI PETERS : Markets have been smashed across the board this year due to inflation , rising interest rates , the Russia-Ukraine war , and concerns about slowing growth or recession . Finding sustainable income in this environment across the global markets -- and places where you can actually put your money for it to grow -- has been pretty difficult , given the fact that there have been few places to hide . <p> We have investment group Ninety One on the show to share their market playbook with us . Joining us for that conversation is John Stopford , head of multi-asset income at Ninety One . John , thanks so much for your time . It is pretty rough out there right now . I 'm interested in how Ninety One is finding sustainable income in global markets , given that hiding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , thanks . It 's been a very challenging market I think for everyone . I guess our approach is somewhat differentiated from many investors in that we start with , first of all , a global multi-asset universe , so we can look pretty much anywhere for opportunities , and then the first place we look is at the security level . <p> Our focus is very much on trying to find sources of resilient income , so we 're looking across bonds and equities to try and find not just decent yields , but yields that are underpinned by strong and ideally growing cash flows . We think that 's the best way to deliver a resilient return and income . <p> So we 're not trying to generate significant capital growth , but we do think you can find attractive yielding securities , even in difficult markets . <p> Importantly , one of the big challenges , I think , for investors at the moment is clearly inflation . So finding a decent yield and a growing yield is I think pretty helpful against the backdrop of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and eat into cash returns more generally . <p> FIFI PETERS : What is also notable is that the traditional formula of investing around 60% of your portfolio in stocks and the remaining 40% in bonds has n't really worked out as well this year . I 'd like to know why you think that is . <p> JOHN STOPFORD : Well , we 've been in a bond bull market for most of the last 40 years , and I think that 's made investors maybe somewhat complacent , assuming that the bond portion of a balanced portfolio will always deliver reasonable returns , and also will act as a diversifier in times of market stress . <p> I think the problem this year is it has become clearer that the sort of long-term backdrop of falling inflation and falling yields is probably over . We might even be in a sort of medium-term inflation and bond bear market . So trying to rely on particularly government bonds , but duration and yields on fixed income generally , to bail you out in times of equity market stress -- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have to look at other ways to diversify and you also need to be much more conscious of not running a lot of interest rate risk , particularly in times when inflation is rising and where interest rates are rising . You need to have other strategies to deliver return and to shelter the risk of the equity part of your portfolio . <p> FIFI PETERS : What is your take on where bonds are headed ? And what do you think the bond market is telling you about the probability of a recession ? <p> JOHN STOPFORD : A great question . Our view would be that over the medium term the risk is that bond yields are going to continue to rise , and that 's going to be a drag on fixed-income returns . Central banks have created a lot of money . There 's a sort of fiscal policy pushing behind inflation . Private sector balance sheets also are in much better shape . There are a lot of things that were causing inflation to fall that no longer really seem to be in place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are waging does n't really seem to be that aggressive and yes , rates are going up . But , relative to where inflation is , arguably the sort of efforts that central banks are making are not great . <p> So yes , there 's potentially a tactical opportunity at some point to own government bonds simply because , as you say , the risk of recession looks to be rising and the bond market itself , with longer-dated yields trading below shorter-dated yields , is usually a sign that a recession is coming over the next sort of 12 to 24 months . <p> In those circumstances bonds may provide a temporary source of return , but our view is that fixed income has become a more tactical asset class , particularly government bonds in an era where inflation and interest rates , on average , may be higher in the future than we 've been used to for most of the last decade or so . <p> FIFI PETERS : So that would be your defensive play in this environment ? <p> JOHN STOPFORD : Not really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ add a little bit of duration . Our defensive plays essentially are to look for resilient securities without a lot of interest rate risk . So either equities or bonds , where the market is pricing in caution already , and the underlying cash flows are relatively resilient . Also just to directly hedge some of the risks . <p> So we are running currently a pretty low net-equity position just over 10% . That 's towards the lower end of our typical range , and that reflects caution going forward in markets . <p> When equities offer better value , when the risks of recession look to be fully priced in or behind us , we 'll look to increase that and take advantage of potential upside in securities like equities . <p> In fixed income we think there are much better opportunities in some of the sort of shorter-dated investment-grade bonds , some floating-rate bonds , parts of emerging markets that have maybe priced in too much in terms of future interest rate risks and inflation in the short term , particularly hedged back to dollars . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ risk relative to the dollar , but we do think that there are more interesting ways of delivering return and protecting the portfolio than just buying lots of government bonds , which is what people have done historically . <p> FIFI PETERS : John , thanks so much for giving us insight into your current playbook .

@@93144236 <h> Right of Reply -- You confused Ninety One with Coronation <p> We appreciate this clarification from Ninety One , considering the very shaky ground it is on . As a Sean Peche tweet ( below ) points out , its SA business banked R600m in ' Performance Fees ' in the last financial year . Its UK business -- not sure , but Seanlooked at every one of NinetyOne 's UK funds ' Key Investor Information Documents ( KIID ) and he could n't find a single one that charged performance fees . But more of that in due course . In any expose ' , one NEVER shoots all your bullets in the first salvo . As for the " demand for an immediate and public correction " -- with pleasure . I apologise for naming Ninety One , when the culprit was Coronation . This mistake was an off-the-cuff reference in the course of a discussion with Magnus Heystek during Ep 42 of our BizNews Business Briefing . I simply mixed up the two companies . The audio has now been edited to reflect this . Interesting , though , how Messrs Khojane and Sewnath express @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That speaks volumes . Especially as Coronation 's CEO is chairman of ASISA , the asset management industry 's self-regulating body . Given its MD and Deputy MD 's outrage at such behaviour , a rational mind would anticipate Ninety One will express its view just as forcefully at ASISA -- perhaps even resign in protest from the organisation .

In other words , over and above the normal fees that it charges ... to me that is like criminal . It 's almost preying on the ignorance of the South African investor .

Your reporting does not highlight that in Ninety One 's case all funds with a performance fee class also offer a fixed fee option . The conclusion that investors have no choice regarding the kind of fee structure they are subject to is misleading and untrue . <p> 2 .

This was standardised across the industry via Association for Savings and Investment South Africa ( ASISA ) to avoid investors making decisions on shorter-term fees , which could be skewed by future over- or underperformance . <p> 5 . Your reporting failed to highlight that all funds that invest in equities , including tracker funds and Ranmore , collect fees when short-term returns are negative . These funds are not designed for short investment holding periods , hence implying that only performance fee classes collect fees during periods of negative performance is misleading and untrue . <p> 6 . Your reporting failed to accurately present fees on a like-for-like basis . You were often comparing wholesale fees with retail fees . If you were to accurately compare retail fees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you would not have concluded , as you did , that fund costs in the UK are dramatically lower than fund costs in South Africa .

@@93144237 <p> It was inevitable that last week 's explosive expos ? on asset managers with Sean Peche of Ranmore Funds was going to create waves . Alec Hogg 's interview with Peche unpacked a critical analysis of the fees that South African asset managers charge in spite of underperforming funds . Below Sean Peche responds to Ninety One 's right of reply . <p> Sean Peche 's detailed response to Ninety One 's right of reply : <p> Dear Ninety One , <p> Firstly , thank you for engaging so that we can achieve the desired objectives of increased transparency and fairness for South African retail investors . <p> 1 . Your reporting does not highlight that in Ninety One 's case all funds with a performance fee class also offer a fixed fee option . The conclusion that investors have no choice regarding the kind of fee structure they are subject to is misleading and untrue . <p> Firstly , I could not find anywhere on your website that explained the difference between the classes : A , E , G and H but I trust you will forgive me ( and all retail investors ) for thinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , A grade etc . It appears not . <p> I also note that the Opportunity " A " class July ' 22 fact sheet advises that fixed unit classes are available , but when I visited " **28;1920;TOOLONG " as requested , I received the message , " Page not found , oops .... something went wrong " <p> 2 . Your reporting claims that 83% of assets in the unit trust industry which are non-income funds are invested in performance fee classes , but this statement incorrectly assumes that all assets in a fund have performance fees . In fact , only 22% of the fund assets are invested in performance fee share classes . <p> I used the A classes or default fact sheet for each of the top 10 funds that any retail investor would see when visiting each fund manager 's website . Perhaps you could tell us where you get the 22% number from , because the fact sheets that I looked at only disclosed the fund AUM and not the class AUM . Had the Opportunity Fund A class fact sheet disclosed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I would certainly have questioned whether I 'm looking at the most desirable class . <p> But you raise an interesting point -- wholesale investors are more sophisticated than the retail investors and you say they make up 78% of AUM . <p> So if the sophisticated investors do n't want performance fees , why is the industry selling them to unsuspecting retail investors ? <p> 3 . Your reporting implies that that the SA top ten funds have average total expense ratios ( TERs ) of 1.5% and that this reflects the experience of the average retail investor . This is misleading , as almost 90% of assets in SA unit trust funds are held via platforms and priced wholesale at significantly lower TERs . <p> I simply used the TERs off of the default or A class fact sheets that reflects the cost any direct retail investor would experience . I certainly did not encounter any disclosure of better wholesale pricing being available on any of the fund manager 's websites , nor that I could pay a lower fee by investing via a platform -- is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if as you suggest , direct retail investors are paying higher fees than wholesale , then where is this disclosure and why are retail investors being prejudiced ? This is certainly not how we treat investors in the Ranmore Global Equity Fund . <p> 4 . Your reporting compares one-year performance with fact sheet TERs . This is misleading as TERs disclosed on fact sheets represent average TERs calculated daily over a three-year period . This was standardised across the industry via the Association for Savings and Investment South Africa ( ASISA ) to avoid investors making decisions on shorter-term fees , which could be skewed by future over or underperformance . <p> I take your point about the TER being the three year average , except I could n't see any disclosure to this effect on your Opportunity Fund factsheet . I 'm sure you 'll also agree that the management fee and performance fee comprise the vast majority of the TER and that a one year TER does n't usually differ materially from the three year TER . <p> Please do also take the opportunity to explain how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three years when the three year return for the Opportunity Fund to July ' 22 was 7.9% p/a and the benchmark was CPI + 6% , so 10.8% . It would also be most helpful if you could also confirm that Ninety One calculated performance fees on a gross basis ( before management fees ) in sharp contrast to international norms ( even for hedge funds ) where performance fees are calculated on the performance on a net basis ( after management fees ) . <p> 5 . Your reporting failed to highlight that all funds that invest in equities , including tracker funds and Ranmore , collect fees when short-term returns are negative . These funds are not designed for short investment holding periods , hence implying that only performance fee classes collect fees during periods of negative performance is misleading and untrue . <p> I think every retail investor understands that management fees are charged all the time , even when short term returns are negative . What I think they most definitely do NOT understand , is why performance fees are charged when funds underperform the benchmark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suffer negative absolute returns . If performance fees are charged in these circumstances internationally , ESMA requires a " prominent warning " to investors . <p> You are also quite correct , these funds are not designed for , " short investment holding periods " but then please take the opportunity to explain to us all why the A class of the Ninety One Opportunity Fund talks of " the daily performance fee ... " In other words , why does the performance fee crystallise daily for a long term investment ? Not even hedge funds crystallise performance fees daily . ESMA recommends the matching of performance fee crystallisation frequency with the recommended investor time horizon . That seems entirely reasonable to me but it seems Ninety One disagrees , so an explanation would be most helpful . <p> 6 . Your reporting failed to accurately present fees on a like-for-like basis . You were often comparing wholesale fees with retail fees . If you were to accurately compare retail fees consistently across the funds you referenced in your reporting , you would not have concluded , as you did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than fund costs in South Africa . We highlight some further detail on a like-for-like comparison below : <p> In respect of SA fund fees , the TER for the Ninety One Equity Fund A class is 1.85% for the performance fee class and 1.75% for the G fixed fee class . In addition , your reporting did not account for the fact that SA funds include 15% VAT while the UK funds are VAT exempt . <p> Eight out of the ten largest funds in the UK are tracker and passive funds , with the ninth investing 90% of its assets in passives . These nine funds account for 82% of the assets of the top 10 funds in the UK . Therefore , posing a 0.5% TER as a like-for-like comparison for active fees in SA is illogical and misleading . <p> I do accept your point about UK funds being VAT exempt . <p> I ca n't have been comparing wholesale fees to retail fees because I do n't even know where to find these wholesale fees you talk of . <p> In my interview , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trackers so I 'm afraid I respectfully disagree here . You 'll also notice I talked of " less than 0.5% " I was being generous . <p> What I do n't understand and what you have n't addressed , is how at tiny $60m fund like mine can have a lower TER than a R63bn giant like the Ninety One opportunity fund with all the benefits of the scale of the fund 's fixed costs . I estimate my TER falling below 1% at $200m and that 's only 5% of the size of the Opportunity Fund . <p> I stand by my point that investing in UK funds for UK investors is cheaper than investing in SA funds for SA investors and there really is no reason why this should be the case ( other than high fees caused in part by performance fees ) . <p> You mention the Fundsmith R class but that 's a cross border , non advised class . Fundsmith 's T class is for direct retail investors and that KIID reflects an " OCF " of 1.04% ( nothing about wholesale ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of passive funds , frequently referring to them in my writing as " driverless cars " and " who wants to be a passenger in a driverless car during a storm ( and right now I think we 're in a storm ) ? " <p> So we 're on the same side of the fight against passive funds BUT unfortunately comparing the fees for active funds to passive funds is the reality of the world in which we live . We must embrace reality . <p> As active managers , our only hope of surviving is to offer something different and treat our clients , fairly and transparently . <p> Based on what I 've seen , I think the South African Fund management industry needs to do better on both these counts . <p> While your reporting , conversation and analysis show deficits and inaccuracies , we trust , now that you are aware of the facts , you will adhere to professional standards of journalism and make the necessary rectification .

Operation O Kae Molao was led by SAPS <p> ILLEGAL mining is a huge and growing problem across much of Africa but it seems to be particularly prevalent in South Africa , where it is getting rapidly larger and more organised in scale . <p> According to Orion Minerals CEO Errol Smart , who is also the Minerals Council South Africa 's executive for the promotion of junior mining , " ... illegal mining here is not junior mining , it is mega-scale corruption and crime " . <p> What started out involving isolated groups of ' zama-zamas ' ( ' people who keep on trying ' ) working on small operations on alluvial diamond diggings and old , shallow gold mines on the Witwatersrand some 10 years ago , has evolved into large-scale mining operations . These involve gangs of illegally operating miners working underground in various deep-level Free State gold mines for months at a time . <p> Just how bad the situation is was underscored in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operation on Thungela Resources ' Khwezela Colliery Kromdraai site near eMalahleni in Mpumalanga was exposed publicly . It only came to light after a serious toxic water spill from the site , for which Thungela was initially blamed , but the company then revealed it had been caused by a major illegal mining operation on ground which Thungela was rehabilitating after it had been mined . <p> According to reports , Thungela has been to court multiple times and won interdicts to stop the illegal miners from operating , but the South African Police Service has not enforced these court orders and the mining has continued . <p> This is nothing new : the Minerals Council sounded a warning back in 2016 that illegal mining was getting out of control . Then president of the Council Mike Teke commented that the body was " cooperating and working with the Department of Mineral Resources and the South Africa Police Service " . <p> Minerals Council security coordinator Neil Metzer said at the time the issue of illegal mining had been taken up " at the highest level of the country 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Diamonds ' major tailings recovery operation at Kimberley had been invaded by more than 1,000 illegal miners and , despite both Petra and previous owner De Beers having obtained court orders to stop this illegal activity over several years , nothing had been done . <p> Despite the Mineral Council 's pleas , it is clear there is little being done to meaningfully combat illegal mining . The reason , according to Democratic Alliance shadow minister for mineral resources James Lorimer , is corruption , plain and simple . <p> Lorimer told the Junior Indaba conference , held in Johannesburg in early June , that he had visited the eMalahleni illegal coal mining site . " This has been completely ignored for the past six months . Nothing is being done about it and it 's quite clear there 's a lot of crookery going on . <p> " The police are doing nothing -- they are probably being paid off .

Choose the partners that are not going to make short-term promises that they may not keep .

For a company that is listed on a developed world stock exchange , this can be extremely problematic . <p> According to the Minerals Council , some 20% of the world 's gold production comes from artisanal mining , which has " become integral to the economies of many mining countries in the developing world " . The Council also points out that artisanal mining is " plagued with exploitation of children and women . In Africa it is estimated that about half of artisanal miners are women and 10% are children . " <p> That 's an issue that gets huge attention from NGOs , but the underlying crucial issue -- the elephant in the room , if you like , that few are willing to come to terms with -- is the financial loss being caused by the illegal miners . <p> This kind of mining is essentially theft from the mining companies that hold mining rights over the ground being invaded . It is also theft from the host nation in lost taxes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the commodities , which are invariably moved out of the county illegally . <p> Gilbertson told the 2022 Mining Indaba that " the mineral resources get sterilised because , where the pits have been dug , some 40% to 50% of the resource gets left behind but it is now too dangerous to access or it is no longer economically viable to mine because 50% to 60% of the value has disappeared . <p> " The resource is also squandered . Africa has lost billions of dollars from its natural resources from the evaporation of gemstones from the continent being mined by artisanal or illegal miners , and they are sold for a fraction of the true international value ... like 10c on the dollar . " <p> Last year , Gilbertson told Miningmx that the extent of the illegal ruby trade was difficult to assess , but it was huge . He said Gemfields had sold about $620m worth of rubies since it started operations in Mozambique , but he estimated another $600m worth had left the country illegally .

" It has always been part of the metals supply chain . Our interventions can be straightforward and simple : capacity building , optimising logistics and giving them a social licence to operate . " <p> But that 's easier said than done : South Africa 's Department of Mineral Resources &amp; Energy last year published a draft artisanal and small-scale mining policy that has been rejected out of hand by mining legal expert Hulme Scholes , who declared it to be unrealistic and unworkable . <p> " The policy is a fantasy , " says Scholes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it intends to magically create vast valuable open-cast areas where artisanal miners can profitably mine , as previously mined areas are excluded to prevent artisanal miners from attracting environmental liabilities . <p> This is like allowing drug dealers to continue selling drugs if they obtain pharmaceutical qualifications and pay tax on their earnings -- it just wo n't happen . <p> " It also assumes that platoons of zama-zamas will miraculously stop their illegal activities overnight , undertake formal training , use PPE personal protective equipment and pay taxes and royalties . This is like allowing drug dealers to continue selling drugs if they obtain pharmaceutical qualifications and pay tax on their earnings -- it just wo n't happen . " <p> There are two probable outcomes of the policy , one of which is already apparent , says Scholes . The first is that it will become the responsibility of mining companies to conduct training and equipping of artisanal miners operating on their properties , at huge cost . The second outcome , which is already present in communities , is an expectation that there will be services @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This short-sighted creation of expectations will cause even more problems for mining companies , which are already battling to manage communities who look to mining companies to satisfy basic needs that a failed state should have provided in the first instance , " Scholes says . <p> " Gwede Mantashe the mines and energy minister and his DMRE must put South Africa before the ANC and bin the policy .

Following this trend , ETF holdings are expected to continue to fall in 2022 , declining by a total of 550,000 oz , the council said . <p> Paul Wilson , CEO of the WPIC said the increased annual surplus should be seen in the context of " exceptionally strong " physical demand for platinum from China . Although the council does not capture this " speculative " data , sustained high platinum lease rates during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Covid-19 pandemic -- " are a clear indication of shortages of physical metal in the market " , Wilson said . <p> Total platinum supply is forecast to fall 8% -- some 626,000 oz -- this year to about 7.51 million oz partly owing to a 4% decrease in Russian output . Mined supply will decline 7% to 409,000 oz year-on-year . <p> On April 8 , the London Platinum and Palladium ( LPPM ) Market suspended two government-owned Russian platinum refiners from its good delivery and accreditation list . This followed a similar ban on certain PGM bands delivered by Russian refiners by the CME Group/NYMEX exchange following the invasion of Ukraine by Russia . <p> Anglo American Platinum ( Amplats ) CEO , Natascha Viljoen said in June the previous bans had had almost no impact on the market and that sanctions -- even tougher ones -- might not stem metal supply . " Metal continues to flow out of Russia . " We do n't see the ban on the good delivery bar by the LPPM has had an effect . We do not see that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Recycling fell a fifth in the second quarter . The WPIC said automotive recycling was forecast to be 15% lower by some 210,000 oz this year as a result of the semi-conductor chip shortage and its impact on new car availability . This would force consumers to run existing vehicles for longer thereby reducing the supply of scrapped autocatalysts . <p> Despite this the semi-conductor shortage was easing . Automotive demand for platinum grew 8% , about 50,000 oz , year-on-year in the second quarter . For full-year 2022 , platinum automotive demand is expected to increase by 14% ( 376,000 oz ) to just over three million oz . <p> Miningmx is a digital publication which provides independent news and analysis related to the African mining sector .

@@93342236 <h> ANDREAS KLUTH : Are windfall profit taxes just cynical populism ? <h> Germany just became the latest to ingratiate itself with angry voters by promising a windfall tax on energy companies <p> 06 September 2022 - 16:49 Andreas Kluth <p> Picture : GETTY IMAGES/ROB PINNEY <p> Germany 's government just became the latest to ingratiate itself with angry voters by promising a windfall tax on energy companies . One way or another , these levies aim to seize " excess " profits and redistribute them to needy consumers aching from the soaring costs of electricity and heating . <p> Several countries , from the UK to Italy and Greece , have already done something similar . Others -- including the EU -- are lining up their own proposals . <p> No matter the specific form , the sheer notion of windfall or excess-profits levies is cynical populism , and therefore bad policy . Proponents offer them as a deceptively simple solution to big but complex problems , thereby playing on the emotions rather than the intellect of voters . <p> Here 's their populist narrative : There 's an energy shock , caused by a distant and evil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and causing prices to soar . Greedy and selfish companies in the West are profiteering from this emergency by making oodles of money even as ordinary people suffer . That 's unfair . Let 's confiscate those undeserved winnings . <p> Like all effective demagoguery , the storyline is n't wholly wrong , just grotesquely oversimplified . Yes , British companies exploring oil and gas in the North Sea are making unexpected bundles as prices for their output soar . So are German providers of cheap electricity , because prices in that market are set by the suppliers with the highest marginal cost -- currently , those using natural gas to generate power . Simultaneously , many households obviously are hurting from higher utility bills . <p> A proper economic exegesis , however , is more complex and would turn off most of the intended audience . It starts with a reminder that all those companies now catching windfalls already pay taxes -- corporate , income and other . <p> If they 're able to profit from the unusual market situation , it 's because they invested in the past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When they made those decisions , they knew that the " lucky " scenarios might never pan out . But they took that risk in the hope of a reward -- and on the assumption that governments would n't seize that reward arbitrarily . <p> Trying to assign moral grades to such investments leads nowhere . Oil and gas companies were already loathed before the crisis for keeping us hooked on evil fossil fuels . They stuck around anyway . Was that laudable or deplorable ? <p> Germany 's producers of solar and wind energy , by contrast , placed their now-lucky bets while donning environmental halos . Now their electricity is suddenly the type that has the lowest marginal cost , and under current market rules they get to bag the difference between their cost and that incurred by gas rivals . The same Greens who used to shower them with subsidies suddenly want to cap their gains . <p> Recall , for a moment , a few other recent instances in which populists demanded windfall taxes . In the early days of the coronavirus pandemic , there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ramped up production soon rolled in money . " Speculators " or saviours ? <p> What about the makers of Covid-19 vaccines ? Some literally spent unremunerated decades researching the science around mRNA . They did n't do it for money -- the ascetic founders of BioNTech struggled for years just to find outside funding for their labs . They dreamed instead of curing cancer and other diseases . Then , one day , a new pathogen showed up , and they were ready . " Profiteers " or heroes ? <p> There are , of course , specific cases in which profits are objectively excessive , immoral or even illegal . Those include the so-called economic rents that accrue to members in a cartel , for instance . But that 's what antitrust law is for , with rules that are made in advance and enforced in an even-handed way . <p> The rest of the time , taking risks in the hope of rewards is legitimate : It 's called investing . But investment will dry up if we threaten to arbitrarily confiscate rewards ex post -- whenever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to determine whether a given profit is fair or unfair , and how we should tax it . <p> Psychologically and politically , the recurring attempts by some politicians to declare returns as deserved or undeserved , good or bad , have two origins . One is ideological -- that is , socialist . This worldview is based on envy , and a lust for the power to judge market outcomes . The other is populist . It 's the unprincipled willingness to give mobs -- the vox populi -- whatever they bay for .

@@93367234 <h> F1 Manager 2022 - Review <h> P1 , baby ! <p> A good sports management game should n't just accurately represent the sport on the cover ; it also needs to show some personality . It needs to be a storyteller . In any sports organisation -- as time , championships , seasons , and people come and go -- their story grows and changes , building a folklore and a history that makes them unique and loved by their fans . It 's what gives them an identity . F1 Manager 2022 , despite being a first attempt at the genre by Frontier Developments , is definitely a storyteller ; one that will help you shape the future and history of any current Formula 1 team into one of your own making . Despite its quirks and the fact that it 's missing some features that experienced sim fans might expect , F1 Manager 2022 is more than worth the long , 22-year wait since EA 's similarly named , but unrelated , F1 Manager . <p> Gameplay is split between two main themes : the race weekends , and the management screens in between them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ design and manufacturing projects to help improve the performance of your car , manage your race team staff and drivers , upgrade and do maintenance on the team 's facilities , and more . It 's certainly got a learning curve and can feel a little fumbly at first , but the impact of your choices feel immediate . Then it 's off to the excitement of the race weekends , which see you jetting around each of the 22 circuits that make up the Formula 1 World Championship , managing your cars and drivers through practice , qualifying , and the race itself . Moving between race weekends and the factory feels good , too , with the post-race analysis acting as a nice moment to decompress after the excitement and stress of managing a team through a Grand Prix . <p> The opening few screens in F1 Manager 2022 can feel overwhelming to begin with , which is n't unexpected in any management game -- but it 's especially true for one that 's wrapped in the fast-paced world of Formula 1 . There 's an abundance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough data to satisfy even the most passionate of bedroom analysts and engineers . It gets very deep into the weeds , but none of it feels like filler ; every screen has something useful you can use to help make informed decisions about where your team needs work , like in the car parts screen where you can view a detailed analysis of your cars ' raw performance numbers with new and old parts , or see its expected place on the grid compared to the other teams . <h> I urge you to slow down a bit because you 'd be missing half the fun in skipping ahead . <p> It does n't throw you straight into deep and prolonged explanations of what you 're looking at either , unless you go digging for them . Instead , it helpfully grabs you by the hand from the beginning and offers you a simple path forward to a race weekend , which is where the majority of your time in F1 Manager 2022 is spent . After the first race is where you 're encouraged to look around some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fully-voiced tutorial . <p> Race weekends are busy and lively affairs , with three one-hour sessions of practice followed by another three sessions of elimination qualifying -- and then , finally , the race . Sprint races , a format introduced to the real-world series in 2021 , are sadly missing , and it 's disappointing they 're not included given how they 've shaken up the qualifying format since their introduction . Each session can be run in real time if you 've got a few hours to burn , but you can also fast-forward time up to 16x speed to move things along in the quieter sessions . It can be tempting to lean on this a lot during a dull race -- especially because it is so good about slowing everything down when your attention is needed -- but I urge you to slow down a bit because you 'd be missing half the fun in skipping ahead . <p> When your drivers are out on the track , there are three different views that give you more information than you 'd find on the Ferrari @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can see data on the state of the track , the condition of the car and all of its critical parts , the weather conditions , and the predicted weather for the remainder of the session . Weather plays a huge part in Formula 1 race strategy , and predicting which tyres you should have on and the best time to stop and change them can gain you a huge advantage in a race . That said , it could be better at pointing some of these options out dynamically , either by suggesting things directly or analysing those opportunities after the race so you can be better at spotting them . <p> Then you have the Data view where you can dig into the finer details of sector times and tyre stats and other various statistics from the current session . This section is more informational than anything , offering an overloaded picture of everything that 's happened in the race up until that point . It mostly comes in use alongside the Strategy view for working out gaps between the cars you 're racing , and seeing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There 's almost too much on display here , and it needs some kind of customisation so you can really focus in on the details you need at that moment . <h> It does n't feel like you 're coaching your drivers , but rather gently advising them . <p> Lastly , but most importantly , the Race view lets you tap into the various cameras placed around the track , as well as the onboard cameras available on each car . It 's where you 'll watch the majority of the on-track action as it happens . You can direct your drivers when to push or save their tyres and manage fuel and ERS battery use , and while this can feel a bit overkill to begin with , it makes a lot more sense when in the context of a race . If you notice one driver is pushing their tyres too hard , order them to back off and you can avoid a costly late race pitstop . It does n't feel like you 're coaching your drivers , but rather gently advising them on how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ falls into feeling like micromanagement . <p> Each circuit feels lovingly recreated from their real-life counterparts , from the sun-drenched desert surrounding the Bahrain International Circuit and the glinting seas and packed-out harbour that laps the shores of the Circuit de Monaco to the brand-new tarmac of the Miami International Circuit , under the shade of the Hard Rock Stadium in the Miami Gardens . Track and weather conditions also look great ; clouds roll in and cast shadows over the track when rain threatens to dampen proceedings , and day noticeably turns to night during late afternoon sessions with the bright-orange sun brilliantly washing the ground in harsh light as the circuit lights slowly take over . Despite some excessive blooming and a few flickering artefacts here and there , it 's both impressive and immersive enough to pull me into the action on screen . <p> On track sessions are mostly well-presented thanks to both the impressive cars and tracks and the surprising detail of using the same TV-style camera placement as they use at the real-life races . On the other hand , the accompanying commentary from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot to be desired . Both of them come off sounding like they 're reading through forced smiles while under duress , though mercifully these scenes can be skipped and you can dive straight into preparing your cars for your first session . On that subject , it 's a shame there 's no media or fan interaction to speak of , given how important the relationship a team has with its fans can be when determining sponsorships , team morale , and more in real life . <p> Any practice or qualifying session can be left in the hands of your team , and they 'll handle all the necessary race preparation work . However , taking control of practice yourself will help you find that extra bit of performance that your team usually ca n't . In the garage , the simple slider system means you do n't need a mechanical engineering degree to see what changes you 're making and how they 're affecting other things , with your driver 's feedback also clearly visible . Each change is a compromise to something else and finding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; seeing the payoff in performance is more than satisfying enough to make it worth the time . <h> What We Said About F1 22 <p> With its typically deep and rich career mode and its usual class-leading spectrum of assists and difficulty options , F1 22 maintains this series ' run as the most fully-featured and accessible reproduction of a single modern motorsport on the market -- and long-awaited tweaks to some of its most reused elements have n't gone unnoticed , either . It 's not quite as bold as F1 2021 , though , and the **31;1130;TOOLONG F1 Life mode really is n't a patch to cover the lack of last year 's ambitious story mode . - Luke Reilly , June 30 , 2022 <h> Score : 8 <p> As the late former voice of Formula 1 , Murray Walker , once famously said , " Anything can happen in Formula 1 and it usually does , " and F1 Manager 2022 brings that same level of excitement and uncertainty , albeit in its own unique and sometimes awkward way . The racing action can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ race , although it can veer into " Hot Wheels with your brother " territory when you see cars softly park themselves in the barrier , or when there 's an almighty smashup under a shower of sparks and debris before both cars roll away back to the pits like their drivers did n't just have the biggest accident of their lives . <p> But the almost slot-car-like AI racing on display still produces the same storylines and on-track rivalries we see in real life , and it 's here where F1 Manager 2022 finds its stride . Is your driver faster than the cars in front but stuck in a DRS train ? Why not pit them a little earlier , giving them a tyre advantage and see if they can leapfrog them during the pitstop phase of the race ? Or perhaps you 've noticed there 's some rain on the way and want to gamble on going to wet tyres before anyone else . As different race strategies unfold and events take place , watching the field shuffle about with drivers jostling for position and scouring through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a real thrill , particularly when a risky strategy call pays off . <h> Hearing the real drivers ' voices adds a layer of authenticity that I did n't know I wanted . <p> F1 is full of unique sounds , and F1 Manager 2022 's audio feels nicely authentic thanks to some awesome trackside and onboard engine sounds , plus the inclusion of real driver and race engineer chatter for some added immersion . During any session each race engineer will communicate with their driver , providing feedback on car setup , track conditions , and any incidents happening in their path . Pierre Gasly swears and shouts down the radio whenever his tyres are nearing the end of their life , while Alex Albon 's awkward charm comes across even in short spurts of radio banter . Even its roster of Formula 2 and Formula 3 junior drivers , who will replace the eventually ageing F1 field as they near retirement in later seasons , have some voiced radio . While there 's not as much variety for each as I 'd like -- it can get annoying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -- hearing the real drivers ' voices adds a layer of authenticity that I did n't know I wanted until I heard it . <p> When the dust settles on a race weekend you 'll head back to the factory to decompress and look ahead to the next race , as well as anything else that can get done before you 're off to another full weekend . This can range from checking your spare parts in the warehouse to ordering emergency parts to be built before the next grand prix , starting research projects on improving next year 's car , and a lot more . <p> How you go about this will be mostly dictated by the stature of the team you start your career with . A team like Williams , for example , has the worst car , is resource poor , and needs better staff and facilities before you can start thinking about bolting on new parts for increased performance . Here you might look to first improve the base facilities to give the team some much-needed development and performance bonuses to build confidence , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can start challenging for points positions instead of battling away for pride in the lower half of the field . Whereas a team like Red Bull already has a car it expects to challenge for the championship with , so you can focus all your resources on gaining all the extra performance you can find . Despite all aiming for the same ultimate goal of winning , it 's refreshing to know that each team will require a unique touch to progress . <p> Everything you do in F1 Manager 2022 is to please the almighty board , who sit upon high in their fancy-shmancy board room and set your expectations for both the following season and longer-term goals they 'll want you to have achieved at some point in the future . You can get away with failing to meet your goals for a little while but , like any boss , if you let them down for too long and fail your board reviews they 'll bring down the hammer : you 'll be given less and less budget to play with before being asked to leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is also true ; impress them enough and your budget will soar , opening up new avenues of investment for you to explore . <p> Money does n't solve every problem , though . Once you 're near the top and pulling in the big bucks F1 's cost cap regulations reign in overspending , so forget about throwing your abundance of millions at any one problem . Upgraded facilities are n't bulletproof -- they degrade over time and lose effectiveness , needing costly refurbishing to bring them back up to standard . If you 've got crash-happy drivers , emergency spare parts can quickly churn through a limited budget . This beautifully twists what would normally be a huge advantage of having all the cash in the world into another point of tension , so you can never truly get too comfortable with your progress . <p> Key staff will helpfully monitor and report through emails on their areas of responsibility so you 'll never miss out on important information , like when the design team has finished work on a new part or when you have a driver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also help you decide which direction to take car development , identifying weaknesses for improvement . But when it comes to making and acting on these key decisions you 're given free reign to accept or ignore this advice as you please . The comparison data for every car on the grid is there , which is admittedly a little unusual given how secretive F1 teams really are , but I appreciate that you are n't led down any certain path . There 's no one right way to the top , and F1 Manager 2022 feels like it strikes the right balance between guiding novices in the right direction while not standing in the way of those who want to forge their own path to glory . <h> The Verdict <p> Even after my worst race results , where everything fell apart at the seams despite having what I felt was a concrete strategy and top-line drivers , I never walked away from a session in F1 Manager 2022 without a dumb smile on my face . Sure , sometimes the racing can look a little robotic and there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ missing entirely , but this never detracts from the thrill of watching my drivers cross the line for some hard-earned points or their first-ever podium . The excitement and thrill of Formula 1 is here in spades .

@@93392231 <h> Email this article <h> Future considerations for investors , in a world of uncertainty <p> You wo n't be able to rely on static allocations to provide an adequate return for investors ' needs : Philip Saunders -- Ninety One . <p> By Nzinga Qunta 8 Sep 2022 00:02 <p> NZINGA QUNTA : With many global and local uncertainties , the investing world may seem even more daunting than before . Philip Saunders , the director of the Investment Institute at Ninety One in London , joins us now . A very good evening to you . Thanks so much for your time on the Market Update with Moneyweb . The investment world is a confusing place at the moment -- what do you think people should be doing as investors ? <p> PHILIP SAUNDERS : Yes . Well , that 's starting off with a really challenging question . Look , we are in a bear market ... but we 've had bear markets in the past and typically we eventually will see a recovery . <p> So I think for the moment it 's right for investors or investment managers to remain precautious because the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at levels that we have n't seen in decades , there 's a war going on , and interest rates are going up at a time when growth is weakening , which is very unusual . So I think we 've got a difficult period to get through . <p> But one of the good things about that of course is that more or less everything was expensive before because of the kind of monetary policies being pursued , which drove asset prices up in a very general way , particularly during the Covid period . <p> So the fact that value is being restored and there are actually some bargains around is potentially a good thing for investors , because you can at least invest in assets over the medium term that you 're likely to get a good return from . <p> NZINGA QUNTA : How do you think the Ukraine crisis is likely to play out , and would geopolitics be a factor that investors have to continue to take into account in the future ? <p> We had a long period after the Cold War when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not negligible , but it did n't really have any meaningful impact on markets -- at least on a sustained basis . <p> Now we 're into a new world . We 've got the shift in the relationship between the US and China . That 's the really sort of big one . And of course Russia , which has been in an uneasy position since the Soviet Union broke up , and is trying to assert itself now . So I think that the geopolitical framework is going to remain more fractious in the future . <p> PHILIP SAUNDERS : I think in the end it 's probably going to be relatively transitory , to the extent that I do n't think we are going back into a sort of 1970s-type inflation regime . So it 's similar in the sense that it 's resulted from a shock ; the context , however , is different . <p> There are a lot of powerful disinflationary forces at work , including things like demographics . Western populations are ageing , and that tends to imply de-leveraging , and there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come down from these very high levels , but it 's going to remain higher than we 've witnessed since the global financial crisis . <p> So we have a high level of inflation , a different interest-rate regime . This whole lowflation , zero-rate kind of environment that was in place after the global financial crisis -- that is in the past . We 're having a reset in terms of interest rates ; we 're having a reset in terms of inflation . In the States , for example , inflation had averaged something nearer to 1% on an annual basis . Again , we are looking at something maybe that will eventually settle sort of sub-3% . So that 's very different from the 1970s . <p> NZINGA QUNTA : Okay . Staying in the United States then , has the belief that the US Federal Reserve will step in with accommodative monetary policy to buoy markets -- specifically the US equity market -- if prices fall too fast , too quickly , been cancelled ? <p> PHILIP SAUNDERS : ... Look I think that , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something like that , then monetary policy will again have to be supportive . But I think that , as we were talking earlier on about the new interest-rate regime , the ability of Western central banks to be very soft in terms of monetary policy and suffer no inflationary consequences has clearly changed . <p> And therefore now they basically have to fight for their inflation-fighting credibility and that means that generally QE quantitative easing and zero rates are very much last-resort policies . I 'm not saying never , but I suspect that the sort of trade-off is going to be different in future . <p> NZINGA QUNTA : And what do you think will drive the eventual recovery ? <p> PHILIP SAUNDERS : I think that it 's very easy to get too gloomy when you 're going through a recession . In the West the recessions have been pretty mild , because governments and central banks have stepped in to sort of provide aggressive liquidity to markets to keep asset prices -- which form a lot of the collateral -- up . When they can no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that has to happen . <p> But thereafter I think that we potentially get more balanced recoveries that are less dependent on monetary stimulus simply inflating asset prices . So it 's more sort of real , and I suspect it 's going to be more along the lines of a sort of capex-driven recovery , an investment-driven recovery in housing and in the energy transition in particular , in response to the geopolitical issues as well as the threat of climate change . <p> So I think that the next cycle is likely to be pretty different from the cycle that 's preceded it , and I think investors need to think very carefully about what that implies for which parts of the equity markets are going to do well , because I suspect that the next cycle is not going to be led by the big-tech giants that we 've seen in the past cycle . It may well be associated with a weakening rather than a strengthening dollar . <p> NZINGA QUNTA : Those traditional 60:40-type portfolios have experienced one of their worst periods of performance ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? <p> PHILIP SAUNDERS : I think -- and we 've been saying for some time -- that after a four-decade bull market for conventional beta , both equities and bonds , when all investors had to do was invest passively in a sort of 60:40 combination of international equities and international bonds , they 've had great returns -- it has been fantastic and risks have been moderate . And when there have been recessions and bear markets , bonds have performed to offset the poor performance on the equity side . <p> So it has been a sort of great model , but that started to break down really a decade ago as far as bonds were concerned . So we 've adopted a much more tactical approach to fixed-income markets , given poor valuations . <p> And so , going forward , I think that having 60:40 as a sort of starting point is probably going to be okay . But I think you 're going to have to be a lot more flexible around it . <p> So simply relying on sort of passive allocations , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ providing a sensible return or an adequate return for investors ' needs , you 're not going to be able to rely on it . The management approach is going to be crucial and I think flexibility is the thing . And I think you 've got to make more choices as portfolio managers in order to actually get the returns that you need . But as a starting point , I think it 's still fine . <p> NZINGA QUNTA : Philip Saunders , the director of the Investment Institute at Ninety One in London , joined us there .

Split caring arrangements are not allowed . <p> " Only one person can apply for a grant for up to a maximum of six children . In other words , one person can apply to foster six children .

@@93416232 <h> Take action on suicide prevention instead of just talking about it <p> World Suicide Prevention Day on Saturday 10 September provides another opportunity for more public conversations about a global public health issue that results in about 703 000 deaths a year worldwide . But what more is there to say about suicide that has not already been said ? And what is the point of talking about suicide prevention unless we are willing to act ? <p> People have been talking about suicide and suicide prevention for ages . Although suicidal behaviour has been understood in different ways at different times in history , the practice of suicide prevention has evolved into an evidence-based science and there is growing consensus among professionals about best practice to reduce suicide rates . <p> Suicide has been variously constructed as a personal choice , an existential crisis , a spiritual matter , a moral failing , a criminal act , a symptom of mental illness , and more recently as a human rights issue . Ancient scholars wrote about suicide and thought deeply about when , if ever , suicides were justified . Since at least the 5th century religious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 10th century laws prohibiting suicidal behaviour were established in a misguided effort to curb suicide . <p> The first academic suicide prevention conference was held in 1908 and suicide prevention centres and suicide helplines have been around since the 1950s . In 1968 the American Association of Suicidology was born and the field of suicidology ( the scientific study of suicide ) was officially founded . In the past 70 years , the field of suicidology has rapidly expanded with several academic journals now entirely dedicated to the subject . <p> The proliferation of suicide research has shown that suicide is preventable and that zero suicides may not be an unrealistic pipedream . We are far from clueless or helpless to reduce suicide rates and we have a fairly good idea of what needs to be done . <p> Effective suicide prevention strategies include promoting access to evidence-based treatment for mental health problems , training primary care physicians to recognise and treat depression , equipping health professionals to recognise suicide warning signs and intervene in a suicidal crisis , educating young people about depression and suicidal behaviour and actively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crisis . Other strategies , such as gatekeeper training and internet and helpline support , seem promising but have not been researched as thoroughly yet . <p> The media has an important role to play in suicide prevention . The evidence suggests that by adhering to responsible reporting guidelines , the media can help to reduce suicide rates and the contagion effect associated with irresponsible coverage . <p> Restricting access to lethal means is a very effective prevention strategy , especially control of analgesics ( medications that relieve pain ) and poisons , as well as interventions at locations frequently used for suicide by jumping . In Sri Lanka , for example , suicide mortality was reduced by 21% between 2011 and 2015 by banning several pesticides ( paraquat , dimethoate and fenthion ) known to have the highest suicide case fatality rates . And there is evidence to suggest that interventions focused on establishing barriers and nets in places where people frequently jump to their death are associated with a 28% net decrease in annual suicides by jumping . <p> We also know that to be effective , suicide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a community level . Suicide prevention at a population level requires interventions to reduce poverty and unemployment , address gender-based violence , create safe communities , reduce social isolation , increase belonging and establish bully-free schools . <p> We know that substance use is strongly associated with suicidal behaviour , and interventions to reduce hazardous substance use are integral to any national suicide prevention strategy . <p> Alcohol , for example , increases the likelihood of suicidal behaviour through multiple mechanisms . First , as a central nervous system depressant , alcohol intoxication can increase impulsivity and psychological distress , which are well-established risk factors for suicide . Second , alcohol dependence precipitates and exacerbates symptoms of mood disorders , which are strongly associated with suicidal behaviour . <p> Third , alcohol dependence can have a serious negative impact on work and relationships , reducing social connection and support . It can result in frontal lobe executive dysfunction , which , in turn , impairs problem-solving ability and future orientation , all of which are further risk factors for suicide . A recent systematic review of alcohol interventions on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individual 's consumption of alcohol led to significant reductions in self-harm . <p> Although we know a great deal about what needs to be done to reduce suicide rates at an aggregate population level , it is much more difficult to prevent suicide at an individual level . There are many reasons for this , including the fact that mental health professionals struggle to predict who will complete suicide and we do n't always see the warning signs , except retrospectively . We can identify groups of people who are at elevated risk of suicide but even the best statistical prediction methods based on current scientific evidence are only slightly better than chance at predicting which individuals will attempt or complete suicide . This can sometimes create the impression that " suicides come out of nowhere " . <p> If we know what needs to be done to reduce suicide rates at a national level , why are we still talking about it ? It is easier to talk than to do the difficult work of mobilising resources , changing attitudes , strengthening our public mental health care system , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ safer schools , building communities where people can find a sense of belonging , ensuring that mental health care is an integral part of our primary health care system , reducing poverty and ending sexual violence . This year 's World Suicide Prevention Day is an ideal opportunity for us to stop talking and to start acting purposefully . Actions do speak louder than words , after all . <p> Suicide is preventable and help is available .

@@93416236 <h> Interest rates , inflation , growth : What are the alternatives to South Africa 's current monetary policy ? <p> We are currently in an upward trending repo rate cycle as the South African Reserve Bank ( SARB ) is trying to contain rising cost-push inflation with monetary policy . Photo : Dean Hutton/Bloomberg/Getty Images <p> We are currently in an upward trending repo rate cycle as the South African Reserve Bank ( SARB ) is trying to contain rising cost-push inflation with monetary policy . This policy is implemented even though the economy is under recessionary pressure . The governor of the bank hit the panic button by increasing the repo rate by 0.75% at the 21 July monetary policy committee meeting to an upward trending repo rate of 5.5% . <p> This increase is the highest single increase since September 2002 . The interest rate increases 20 years ago contributed to pushing the country into a recession . The GDP growth rate for quarter two was released on 6 September , indicating a negative growth rate of -0.7% . The 2022 growth rate is predicted at between 1.8% to 2.0% . The SARB has also already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2023 and 2024 , respectively , will continue . <p> Despite the negative growth rate for the second quarter of 2022 , pointing to a struggling economy , more interest rate increases are expected this year . The next increase will most probably be announced on 22 September of between 0.25% and 0.5% . This upwards cycle is only expected to turn in 2023 , with inflation only expected to reach the 4.5% mid-point of the SARB inflation target by then , according to the SARB . <p> The SARB governor stated in the monetary policy committee statement on 21 July that the bank will do its best to protect household income from inflation . The question could be asked : What impact will this and future interest rate increases have on economic growth and consumer spending , and what will the extent of job losses be ? The governor wants to protect people 's income from rising inflation , but the increase in interest rates could cause a recession with more unemployment . <p> For the first time in decades , the South African inflation rate is lower than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) and the UK ( inflation rate 10.1% ; repo rate 1.75% ) . Another example is Poland , whose inflation rate has reached 16.1% with a repo rate of 6.75% , as the fastest-growing Western country over the past 20 years . <p> South Africa has an inflation rate of 7.8% versus a repo rate of 5.5% . Maybe we should think out of the box in the fight against inflation . I am not saying monetary policy should not be used at all , but how will increasing interest rates reduce rising and extremely high energy costs ? Maybe there are other tools to fight inflation . <p> On a global scale , inflation has been rising rapidly in both developed and developing countries . This rising inflation rate is mainly a result of Covid-19 and , at the beginning of 2022 , the Russian-Ukrainian war . These two events have disrupted the global economy and supply chain systems . The supply side of economies has been affected negatively , resulting in rapid price increases . <p> The world inflation rate was stable at approximately 3.2% from 2017 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rate has increased to 4.7% in 2021 and in mid-2022 to 7.4% . South Africa is at the global average of inflation . The global trend is still upwards towards the end of 2022 . It must be stated that a few of the major economies have already researched the inflation peak . <p> The worst performing countries regarding the containment of inflation are Zimbabwe at 285% , Lebanon at 168% , Venezuela at 137% , Turkey at 80% and Argentina at 71% . These countries are experiencing hyperinflation , which has dire consequences for any economy . <p> The term is used when the inflation rate increases by more than 50% a month . Hyperinflation is caused by the rapid rise in the money supply , or in other words , the printing of money by the government . Many countries , including South Africa , are also experiencing another type of inflation , namely stagflation , where output falls , but the price level rises . <p> Within the G20 group of countries , the inflation monster has also reared its ugly head . China still has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ G20 countries are showing increases in inflation levels . The Eurozone and the US have more than 8% inflation , which levels have not been seen in 40 years . South Africa 's inflation has risen above the SARB upper band . <p> However , South Africa 's inflation rate usually lags behind the leading developed countries and trade partners . Inflation is expected to rise over the next few months to above 8% towards the end of 2022 , not because of growing demand but due to rising and high energy prices , leading to general price increases , especially food prices . <p> As stated , the main driver of inflation in the country is the rapid increase in energy costs ( fuel and electricity ) . Since 2010 , the South African inflation rate has been contained within the inflation target band between 3% to 6% . Still , unfortunately , economic growth was generally low or even negative . From June 2021 to date , the petrol price has increased by approximately R 10 per litre ( although on 5 September it was reduced by more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reduce by as much as 1% if the price remains at this level ) . Economic modelling indicates that each R1 increase in the fuel price could lead to about a 0.3% to 0.5% increase in inflation . Predictions are that inflation will peak only at the end of 2022 . Depending on oil and electricity prices , inflation will stabilise during 2023 and decline again in 2024 towards the SARB mid-point target of 4.5% . <p> Therefore , more interest rate increases are expected during 2022 and possibly even in 2023 , peaking at approximately 6.5% to 7.5% ( repo rate ) . These increases will continue to deliver financial pain to consumers who are already under enormous pressure . Any decline in consumer spending , which makes for two-thirds of aggregate expenditure , will probably push the economy into a recession . <p> Another vital issue to consider in this debate is the level of core inflation in South Africa . Core inflation excludes prices of food , beverages and energy . Over the past 12 months , the core inflation rate increased from 3.0% in July 2021 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 4.4% . The excluded products account for close to 60% of the rise in inflation . These numbers confirm the cost-push inflation environment in South Africa . <p> The excluded products drive our inflation rate to a much greater extent than most of our trade partners , including the US , at 5.9% . Core inflation has fallen since March in this country . A similar situation is experienced in the UK , with core inflation down to 5.8% . Demand-pull inflation plays a more significant role in these countries compared to South Africa . Therefore , using monetary policy in these countries could make more sense . <p> Interest rate differentials are critical to attracting investment and strengthening the currency . Central banks in South Africa and the US are increasing interest rates aggressively . For example , the SARB increased the repo rate on 21 July to 5.5% from 4.75% , while the US central bank raised the interest rate also in July . A decreasing differential usually leads to an outflow of capital from the country and puts pressure on the exchange rate . This is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But these increases are expected to have dire impacts on the economy . <p> The global inflation crisis is caused by the disruption in the supply side or , in other words , by cost-push inflation . This type of inflation is caused by an increase in prices of inputs such as fuel prices , electricity , labour , raw material , global supply chains and so forth . This increase in prices of production factors leads to a decreased supply of these goods . In the current situation , the global economy was recovering at the beginning of 2022 with rising demand and improved supply lines . <p> But the Ukrainian war has even had a more significant impact on the supply side . It has driven inflation to highs not seen in four decades . We , therefore , have low levels of supply , pushing prices upwards . But the other problem is that low levels of economic growth are usually accompanied by cost-push inflation . <p> A decrease in supply is the leading cause of cost-push inflation , with rising costs of production leading to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ higher wages , leading to higher production costs and further pressure on prices . The counter to cost-push inflation is supply-side policies , which are challenging to implement and usually take a long time due to their structural change nature . <p> Supply-side policies have the aim to increase aggregate supply in the economy . Monetary policy , as currently implemented , usually causes even lower economic growth and subsequent job losses . The increase in interest rates will not reduce fuel and electricity prices , the main drivers of price increases across the board in the current economic environment . <p> Globally , central banks are trying to curb rising inflation , but what could be done to curb cost-push inflation ? <h> Monetary Policy <p> Central banks usually treat inflation in general terms and do not necessarily distinguish between the various types of inflation . The primary goal of the SARB is to protect the currency and , therefore , price stability ; a secondary goal is to ensure economic growth . <p> The SARB predicted the economy to contract by 1.1% in the second quarter , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still shocked by a huge interest rate increase . To curb whatever kind of inflation , the SARB increased interest rates because this policy move is deflationary . But , using monetary policy in a cost-push inflation environment is like hitting the economy with a sledgehammer . It could stop fast-rising inflation but also severely affects the already low economic growth environment , leading to a possible recession and loss of jobs . <p> On the one hand , higher interest rates discourage consumer spending and capital investment , so needed for growth . On the other hand , higher interest rates support the currency 's appreciation but make the export of goods more expensive and imported goods more attractive , leading to a possible negative trade balance . The rand has depreciated from R16.50 to R17.30 to the US dollar since the increase on 21 July . In any policy decision , there are consequences and opportunity costs . <p> Central banks , however , could decide to allow this type of inflation to remain high , expecting the cost-push inflation to be of short-term impact and not permanent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a result of the Ukrainian war . For example , the high fuel price is expected to be temporary . The SARB has , however , used monetary policy over the past decade to keep inflation at a low level , even in a cost-push inflation environment . This is one reason we have been trapped in a low-growth situation since 2017 . <h> Fiscal policy <p> The government could pursue a deflationary fiscal policy , such as higher taxes and lower government spending . This alternative is not an option due to the already high personal income tax scales in South Africa and the dampening effect it will have on economic growth and employment . <h> Supply-side policies <p> The most suitable solution to curb cost-push inflation is to use policy to increase production by reducing or stabilising production costs and increasing supply . But history informs us that supply-side policies take more effort from the government to implement compared to increasing interest rates and take a long time to take effect , similar to monetary policy . What type of supply-side policies could be implemented by the government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the government should allow for incentives for increased production . Rising energy costs currently push up production costs . More flexible energy policies should be in place to keep oil and electricity prices stable even if the trend is upwards . Obviously , a stable electrical supply is also needed with no load-shedding . <p> Second , supply chain and transport bottlenecks should be minimised to ensure that all ports work efficiently . Also , ensure road and rail transport routes work well in transporting goods . <p> Third , wage increases should be minimised at below-inflation rates . In South Africa , wage pressure is built from institutions such as Eskom and government labour unions . <p> Fourth , the government can significantly reduce red tape , creating a more conducive environment and easier to do business and attracting investment . <p> The other additional impacts of rapidly rising interest rates include an increase in the cost of borrowing , reducing consumers ' disposable income and limiting consumer spending . Business owners also cut back on their expansion plans leading to a decrease in capital investment , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rate differentials lead to an appreciation of the currency due to a net capital inflow . Rising interest rates also lead to an increase in government debt payments . <p> Any policy takes time to have an impact due to time lags . The effect of increased interest rates will not immediately affect inflation . Still , it could take six to 12 months to have any effect . The battle against inflation requires an integrated approach that includes data-based decision-making , supply-side and demand-side policy tools , and strong leadership and implementation . It is essential to support the economic base sectors , including agriculture , mining , manufacturing and tourism , for job creation and economic development . <p> Maybe an inflation mid-point target of 4.5% is too low for a developing country such as South Africa to allow higher levels of growth so desperately needed .

@@93416238 <p> Europe is entering what will likely be a bitter winter , as a Russia-induced energy crunch threatens power supplies and the continent is sent into a recession . <p> A tight energy market -- made worse in recent weeks after Russia 's state-owned natural gas exporter Gazprom closed its main pipeline to Germany -- has been a boon for South Africa 's coal exporters , which have enjoyed higher prices amid stronger demand . <p> Europe 's winter is set to extend coal 's hot streak , even as the world turns to renewables . However , efforts to initiate a green economy will continue to threaten producers , who find themselves increasingly on the outs . <p> The coal price surged to a new record high of around $460 per tonne earlier this week , amid continued robust demand and persistent Russia-related supply disruptions . The International Energy Agency ( IEA ) sees coal consumption in Europe rising by 7% in 2022 on top of last year 's 14% surge , with the continent now turning to seaborne coal from South Africa and elsewhere in the world . <h> Volatility <p> In another statement representing the energy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reportedly said last week that the excitement of moving from coal to renewables was becoming a myth and that Germany had painfully learnt of its effect on energy security . <p> A similar statement was made in coal exporter Thungela 's interim results , released almost a month ago .

The DA has in the past resisted attempts by its coalition partners to force it to elect a mayor from the smaller parties . <p> A breakdown in multi party coalition running the City of Johannesburg led to Cope councillor and chair of chairs Colleen Makhubele to call an extraordinary sitting to elect a new speaker against the wishes of the other parties . The ANC and the EFF were aided by councillors belonging to the coalition to oust Vasco da Gama as the council speaker . <p> Makhubele has broken rank with the coalition and sided with the ANC which aims to file a motion of no confidence against DA mayor Mpho Phalatse . Makhubele has called a special sitting set for 13 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her actions ' fraudulent ' , accusing her of throwing the democratic processes aside in order o grab power and subvert the rule of law . <p> The coalition says only the municipal manager can call a council sitting in place of the speaker and is threatening to go to court . Makhubela is adamant that she is acting within the rules of the law as set in the Municipal Structures Act . <p> Negotiations are underway in the multi party coalition for the election of a new speaker , but the Mail &amp; Guardian understands that the smaller parties want to strong-arm the DA to vote for one of their own . <p> Last November , ActionSA tried to force the DA to hand over the reigns in the Johannesburg council to its leader Herman Mashaba in exchange for voting for DA mayors in Tshwane and Ekurhuleni . This failed and Mashaba 's party opted for positions as heads of council committees as well as members of the mayoral council . <p> This week Mashaba told the M&amp;G that the vote of no confidence against the speaker passing in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Coalition partners were frustrated with Da Gama when he moved to force the council to vote for chairs of committee during coalition negotiations shortly after the 2021 elections . The negotiations were meant to determine which parties would chair committees and which portfolios would be handled by the DA 's coalition partners in the mayoral committee . <p> " We have been raising the issue of the speaker with the DA and they failed to proactively deal with the challenge . That is why it has led to this unfortunate situation , " Mashaba said . <p> Mashaba said that ActionSA was of the view that the speaker must be replaced by someone belonging to the smaller parties . <p> " We are going to replace the speaker but one thing the DA must understand is that the speaker position this time is not going to be a DA one , it must go to one of our coalition partners . We are not interested in that position but its not going to be the DA , " he said . <p> " Once they are ready to give this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the numbers , we are going to appoint the new speaker and the mayor is very safe . ActionSA is fully behind the coalition . We are not supporting the DA because we are friends . We do n't want the hyenas of the ANC . We want the DA to show respect and not display arrogance . " <p> Leaders from the coalition -- which includes the DA , ActionSA , Freedom Front Plus , Inkatha Freedom Party , ACDP and Cope -- have all been scrambling to quell dissent among their members in an effort to save Phalatse from the impending motion in council . <p> Last week , ActionSA fired Johannesburg councillor Albert Kiviet 's membership after he was absent from the voting of the motion against Da Gama . ActionSA has also filed a criminal complaint against the ANC , accusing it of attempting to bribe its councillors to vote against the DA speaker and mayor . <p> Coalitions in Tshwane and Nelson Mandela Bay have also imploded . In Tshwane , DA mayor Randall Williams is under investigation over an unsolicited bid from a company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tshwane for R26-billion , which would bind the city to a 30-year contract with the bidder . In the ANC led Nelson Mandela Bay coalition , the DA reached an agreement with the governing party 's partners to elbow out mayor Eugene Johnson . <p> The M&amp;G spoke to eight opposition party leaders about why coalitions have been rocky since 2016 . <h> ActionSA -- Herman Mashaba <p> " Whether we like it or not coalitions are the future of the country . The one thing that is sure is that the ANC will forever be in crisis and lose voter support . The challenge is to make sure that we can have the leading party to respect the other parties . " <h> One South Africa -- Mmusi Maimane <p> " Coalition actually in some way delivers a much better outcome for citizens compared to the one party dominance which eventually leads to state capture .

In Tshwane we had a coalition but it was never based on anything written down but in principle but this time around we decided we will have coalitions with an agreement written somewhere ...

" <h> UDM -- Bantu Holomisa <p> " The ruling party did publish a document in 2016 to the effect that they must destabilise any municipality that they have not won .

@@93572233 <h> PlayStation VR2 : The First Hands-On <h> High-end VR for the masses . <p> When the original PlayStation VR launched in 2016 , it already felt a bit dated , with its stationary setup and PlayStation Move controllers outclassed by the room-scale VR offered by its PC competitors . PlayStation VR2 , thankfully , brings things up to parity . Room-scale VR is on offer here thanks to inside-out headset-based tracking , and the controllers feel on-par with Meta 's latest . <p> PSVR2 also brings some new features to the table . Its eye-tracking is a first for a VR headset , as is haptic feedback built into the headset itself . The controllers also leverage the same haptic feedback and adaptive triggers found in the PS5 's excellent DualSense controller , which if implemented well will be all the more effective paired with the immersion of VR . <p> It 's also , however , still rooted -- or should I say -- tethered to the past . Like other PC-based VR headsets , the PSVR2 still requires a wired connection to your PS5 . It 's a single thin cable that 's relatively uninhibiting , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it could feel limiting for people who have gotten used to the tether-free experience of the Meta Quest 2 . <p> Last week I went to PlayStation 's USA headquarters for the first hands-on with PSVR2 . I played four games : Resident Evil Village VR , Star Wars : Tales from the Galaxy 's Edge Enhanced Edition , The Walking Dead : Saints and Sinners Chapter 2 , and Horizon Call of the Mountain . Let me tell you about all of it . <p> Let 's start with the hardware itself . PlayStation VR2 has a similar headset design to its predecessor , with a band that rests on the crown of your head and hugs the nape of your neck . This gives a nice weight distribution that does n't feel front-heavy like some VR headsets can . On the back of the band is a button that slides it out when pressed , as well as a dial that lets you tighten the band further if necessary . There 's also a button on the face mask that lets you slide it in or out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adjust to a comfortable position . While I did n't test it this way , a Sony rep did demonstrate that there 's ample room inside the headset to accommodate glasses . Once the headset is on , there 's a dial on the top left of the face unit that adjusts the lenses in order to make sure everything 's in focus . <h> I did n't notice the dreaded ' screen door ' effect at all . <p> The OLED panels inside offer a 2000x2040 per-eye resolution at up to 120hz . This is the highest resolution available among the mainstream VR headsets , and provided an outstanding level of visual fidelity . I did n't notice the dreaded " screen door " effect at all during my time with the system . This is further aided by something called foveated rendering , which essentially means that the system uses its built-in eye-tracking to increase the resolution of whatever you 're looking at . <p> PSVR2 uses four cameras built into the headset for inside-out tracking of the controllers and your surroundings . When you first set up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slowly look around as it scans the area -- including the floor and ceiling -- and it designates a safe area for you to play within . From there you can draw lines on the ground to manually add or subtract from the area , exactly the same as how it 's done on Meta 's headsets . There 's also a button on the bottom right of the headset that activates a pass-through camera , allowing you to see your surroundings and pick up your controllers . <p> Speaking of controllers , their design is relatively similar to those of PC VR systems . Each has a thumbstick , two primary input buttons ( Triangle and Square on the left , Circle and Cross on the right ) , as well as a PS and options button apiece . For triggers , there 's an L2/R2 , which are activated by your index fingers and serve as the primary trigger for guns and other handheld devices . R1/L1 meanwhile rest underneath your middle/ring fingers , and are used to articulate gripping items . <p> The controllers also have capacitive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touching the controller even if you 're not pressing a button . This is relatively similar to the Valve Index 's " Knuckles " controllers , though I found the finger tracking to be not quite as accurate as Valve 's implementation . Valve 's controllers also have a strap across the back of your hand that holds the controllers in place if you completely open your palm , whereas the PSVR2 controllers require you to at least grip them slightly at all times . This was most noticeable while playing The Walking Dead : Saints and Sinners , where simply closing my hand was n't enough to grip a weapon , and instead I had to hold down the L1/R1 bumper with my middle and ring fingers . The button is n't particularly hard to press , but having to keep pressure on it for an extended period of time -- like when you 're holding a gun or knife -- started to cause my hand to tire and cramp after playing for more than 20 minutes or so . <p> The controllers also feature the same haptic feedback @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Unfortunately , neither really stood out to me during the game demos I played . All the developers I talked to mentioned plans for implementing both features in their games , but aside from Horizon Call of the Mountain , they were n't yet present in the demo builds that I played . In Horizon , I also did n't particularly notice the triggers doing anything special , but the section I played only used a bow and arrow , so I did n't have any other weapons to compare the sensation with . The developers told me that other weapons later in the game would further leverage the triggers , such as a large mounted ballista that would feel heavy to pull . <h> The controllers feature the same haptic feedback and adaptive triggers as the PS5 's DualSense controller . <p> In addition to the controllers , the headset itself also has haptic feedback built in . Again this was most notable for me playing Horizon VR -- either it was n't yet implemented in the other games , or was n't present enough for me to remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a nice addition to the haptic landscape , though I mostly just noticed it when taking damage or otherwise being tossed around . It was n't distracting or uncomfortable at all , but I also did n't particularly feel that it added a layer of immersion that I could n't live without . I suppose that , like the DualSense 's haptics , its implementation will vary from game to game and all depend on how much effort developers put into utilizing it . <p> The headset does n't have integrated audio , instead leaving you to rely on either TV/speaker sound or a pair of headphones -- either wirelessly connected to your PS5 , or via a 3.5mm headphone jack on the PSVR2 headset . I found this solution to be a bit of a letdown compared to the Valve Index 's spatial off-ear audio , as it meant requiring a pair of headphones if you wanted spatial audio . Personally , I felt the headset/headphones combo to be a bit bulky and cumbersome , and made it harder to get the VR2 in the perfect position in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ VR2 's marquee launch game is Horizon Call of the Mountain , a standalone entry in the Horizon series . Set during the events of Horizon Zero Dawn , you play as Ryas , a disgraced former Carja soldier who , at the beginning of the game , has been taken out of prison for as-yet unknown reasons . <p> Ryas is an expert climber , and much of Call of the Mountain 's exploration gameplay consists of traversing the peaks of the Carja Sundom . This means physically moving your hands from grip to grip , pulling yourself up and across crags , cracks , and other climbable areas . The climbing paths appear similar to those in something like Uncharted or Tomb Raider , but moving your hands to scale these routes feels tremendously more satisfying than simply holding down a climb button . <p> The exploration portion I played was relatively linear , but the verticality of the level design , and how the paths sometimes fold over themselves as you reach greater heights , make it feel far from simply moving in a straight line . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I played , Horizon 's devs told me that levels would have multiple routes to the destination , with plenty of nooks and crannies to explore . <p> During these exploration sections , you can use your bow and arrows to shoot targets . In the section I played this simply lit some signal fires that seemed to be mostly for getting you accustomed to shooting in VR , but I would n't be surprised if later areas required you to shoot switches or levers in order to solve puzzles or open paths . <p> The other half of Call of the Mountain 's gameplay is combat with the mechanical beasts of the Carja Sundom . When you enter combat , the game shifts into a circular arena with you locked to a ring-shaped path with your opponent in the middle . You can dodge left and right by holding the a button and swiping your right arm , which is used to both move along your circular path as well as dodge incoming attacks . Attacking uses the same bow-and-arrow pantomime as in the exploration sections -- hold down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an arrow , nock it to the bow and pull back , aim , and release the trigger to shoot . <p> I played two combat encounters , the first against a single of the raptor-like Watcher enemies , which attacked with tail swipes and charged slow-moving energy balls .

As with all new pieces of hardware , the question now falls to whether there will be enough games to make the investment worth it .

The CCMA , in applying the above considerations , found that : <p> Although the issue of vaccination is controversial , the client company was not imposing mandatory vaccinations but merely incentivising employees to consider them . <p> The employee , despite protesting that he was merely sharing information , clearly aligned himself with the article . <p> The WhatsApp group had not been established for the purpose that the employee used it for , and he was aware thereof . <p> Although there was no specific rule about not posting on the group , it was reasonable that an employer could not be expected to publish a rule for every possible transgression .

He fits the role of a typically bad guy . Not only does he want to destroy the Kingdom of Dahomey , with specific reference to the fact that they 're defended by women soldiers . Additionally , he also forms the bridge to the slave trade with the Portuguese to Brazil , capturing and selling off to the highest bidder .

Looking at each individual performance and character and you 'll be left with about half of it being really worthwhile . <p> There is the love interest of Nawi that never develops beyond starry eyes and no great war at the end . From an action perspective , we get a few minutes of choreographed fighting , which at times is really good . With the main battle also over before it reaches its climax , as a viewer , you 're left wanting . These battles also do n't have much of an emotional attachment to them apart from showcasing the skills of the women fighters -- which is great , nonetheless . <p> While I was caught up in the moment and heavily invested in the film throughout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't help but feel quite a lot of potential was lost in the film . Irrespective of the director , Gina Prince-Bythewood , taking liberties with a creative licence on historical accuracy , it feels very Hollywood .

Whether you 're into Call of Duty Vanguard , or perhaps you refuse to say goodbye to GTA , you still need a quality gaming sanctuary . This space does n't have to be big , but there are things that have to be right . The priorities are comfort , lighting , and storage , but how can you do it well on a budget ? Check out these top tips for creating a quality gaming space without breaking the bank . <h> Lighting for less <p> Getting the right lighting is key , and a gaming room is certainly not the space for bright lights . Even a small lamp can cause problems , with annoying reflections on the screen . What you need is ambient and indirect lighting . The best choice for a gaming room is strip LED lighting , which is luckily more affordable than ever . If you shop around , you can pick up a roll of 5m for as little as 400R .

Most gamers like to be close to the floor , in a semi-reclined position . The obvious answer is a gaming chair , but these can be extremely pricey . Cheaper ways to get hold of one include shopping for a second-hand seat or waiting until the sale season . Another option is to make your bespoke gaming chair by adapting an old office chair , or car seat . You 'll need a basic set of tools , some excellent all-purpose adhesive , and a fair bit of patience . Difficult as it sounds , you can find lots of guides for building your own gaming chair online . Those on a serious budget but also lacking in time , should consider a beanbag ; comfortable , simple gaming seating . <h> Entertainment Centre <p> Where you put the TV/monitor , and the gaming unit itself , is super-important .

Budding carpenters , however , can try to build their own . Although , the simplest solution is to upcycle old furniture . An old modular bookshelf or storage unit is ideal , especially one with box shelf spaces . <h> Painting the walls <p> A lick of paint is the cheapest way to transform a room .

Excellent choices include vintage film posters or comic book prints , as well as game release posters , or even landscape scenes from within games . Choose one or two larger prints and frame them for a classy , but gamer-friendly look . Manga and Anime prints also look great in a games room . You can find posters for less by shopping for second-hand prints online or taking a look at Etsy , where talented but unknown artists sell unusual prints for immensely low prices .

@@93725237 <h> The 10 Best Movie Scores Of All Time <h> Did your favourites make the list ? <p> Music can be as essential to a film 's plot as any part of its screenplay . Not only does it evoke a powerful range of emotions that can completely alter the mood of any given scene , but it 's also a great way for directors and writers to subtly influence viewers without saying anything out loud . Many movies are made even better by their musical scores , just like the ones we 're about to see on this list . <p> For this list , we 'll consider only movies that have an original musical score -- that means no Bohemian Rhapsody or 8 Mile . Secondly , we 'll rank movies themselves and not composers -- otherwise , this would be just a list of John Williams ' accomplishments . With that said , let 's take a look at 10 of the best movie scores of all time ! <h> 10 . Back to the Future -- Alan Silvestri <p> It 's hard to imagine the ' 80s without remembering Alan Silvestri 's iconic Back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perfectly capture the essence of the franchise , but also of the entire decade Marty McFly originates . Songs by Huey Lewis and the News were at the forefront of the film 's soundtrack but , in hindsight , it was Silvestri 's score that was the true standout . The main theme from Back to the Future is boisterous , heroic and memorable enough to instantly identify it with the films . <p> The score gets even better with each new entry into the series -- going from the electric guitars of the ' 80s to the more traditional western sounds heard in Back to the Future III . The result is a soundtrack that is just as thrilling to hear as watching the films . <h> 9 . Pirates of the Caribbean : The Curse of the Black Pearl -- Hans Zimmer <p> Considering the state of modern blockbusters -- and the way it has been for more than a decade -- the success of the Pirates of the Caribbean is something that seemingly happened overnight . <p> The epic swashbuckling saga might have Captain Jack Sparrow 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effect of Hans Zimmer 's epic score can not be understated . For many , it was the Star Wars of their generation , with a main theme that 's just as recognizable as anything John Williams has ever composed . <h> 8 . The Grand Budapest Hotel -- Alexandre Desplat <p> Wes Anderson 's characteristic visuals might frequently come accompanied by compositions made by Mark Mothersbaugh , but it was Alexandre Desplat who gave us what is arguably the soundtrack that best captures what Anderson is all about in his films . <p> Inspired by classic European tunes , The Grand Budapest Hotel has one of the more whimsical scores we 've ever heard on an Oscar-nominated film . However , that 's just par for the course for any Wes Anderson film these days . <h> 7 . The Nightmare Before Christmas -- Danny Elfman <p> No , The Nightmare Before Christmas was n't directed by Tim Burton -- we have Henry Selick to thank for that . However , many fans remember the movie for its stellar score , composed by Burton 's regular collaborator , Danny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ task , but Elfman was absolutely up to the challenge , and he passed with flying colours . Nightmare Before Christmas ' score has become as timeless as the movie itself , with songs like This is Halloween eventually becoming seasonal landmarks over at Disney . <p> It 's also worth mentioning that this is the only entry in our list where the composer played a prominent role in the film . Elfman not only composed the film 's soundtrack , but he stars as Jack Skellington , the film 's lead character . <h> 6 . Superman -- John Williams <p> One of the very first blockbuster superhero films ever released , 1978 's Superman 's challenge was to establish the tone for a genre that was n't really that popular in Hollywood at the moment . <p> What John Williams created is an impressive musical score that becomes as much of a character as Superman himself . The film 's iconic main theme has been synonymous with the Kryptonian for generations , a feat that , to this day , seems impossible to replicate . <p> Now that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's almost baffling to see that almost no Marvel or DC flick has a noteworthy score : they all blend with each other in an ocean of unoriginality . That 's what makes the Superman soundtrack such a legendary piece among comic book fans . <p> This is a superhero film with one of the best movie scores of all time . <h> 5 . The Godfather -- Nino Rota &amp; Carmine Coppola <p> How do you make a movie about one of the most ruthless crime families of all time even more memorable ? Easy : add a mesmerizing musical score to the mix . The subtle yet menacing nature of the score by Nino Rota perfectly conveys the feelings of unease felt every time Vito Corleone is on screen . <p> Rota 's eerie melodies and the masterful arrangements by Carmine Coppola create a score so hauntingly beautiful that many would argue it has become a masterpiece in its own right . <h> 4 . Psycho -- Bernard Herrmann <p> With Alfred Hitchcock 's iconic 1960 film Psycho , we were introduced to the genius of Bernard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always a difficult task , but Herrmann 's unique style managed to strike the perfect balance between disturbing and emotional . <p> Who could forget the notoriously frightening shower scene ? After all , it 's arguably one of the most famous scenes in cinematic history . What 's even better is how well the score matches the imagery . <p> In addition to the obvious use of suspense , it also uses elements of sadness and desperation . The film 's main theme is also a master class in the use of violin notes to create a haunting sense of dread that permeates for the duration of the film . <h> 3 . The Lord of the Rings : The Fellowship of the Ring -- Howard Shore <p> Arguably one of the greatest fantasy trilogies in history , Peter Jackson 's The Lord of the Rings trilogy is also considered by many to host one of the best movie soundtracks of all time . <p> Even more surprising is that this epic soundtrack comes from a composer who 's mostly known for his work in horror films ! Howard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fantasy novels , with many considering the soundtrack as the ideal companion to Jackson 's adaptations . <p> Peter Jackson and his writing team were drawn to Shore because he displayed considerable skill in adapting literary works . These included The Fly , Silence of the Lambs , Naked Lunch and Looking for Richard . Shore 's score for The Lord of the Rings is vast , operatic and filled with leitmotifs that relate to Middle Earth cultures and characters , a tour de force that equalled Jackson 's grand vision . <h> 2 . The Good , The Bad and The Ugly -- Ennio Morricone <p> The best entries in our list perfectly encapsulate the movies they represent -- on the other hand , Ennio Morricone 's work defines what it means to be a Western film . Morricone 's score is iconic to the point that it 's almost impossible to imagine anyone else providing the soundtrack for a good cowboy film . <p> The reason for this is simple : Morricone 's score perfectly combines the aesthetics of traditional Westerns with modern musical techniques to create a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so well with the dusty , lonely landscapes of the American West ? ( Or , in Sergio Leone 's case , the Spanish desert ) . <h> 1 . Star Wars : Episode IV -- A New Hope -- John Williams <p> A soundtrack that needs no introduction , John Williams ' Star Wars score is a cultural landmark , just like the franchise itself . But why exactly does the score stand out so much ? In short , it 's because it has a bit of everything : a mix of heroic themes , lighthearted numbers , and moments of pure tension . <p> Pieces like the Imperial March and Luke 's theme as he watches the sunset on Tatooine might be taken as the perfect examples of what Star Wars is all about : a struggle between the primordial forces of good and evil . It 's pure cinematic bliss . <p> Perhaps the best part about the Star Wars score is that no piece is better than the rest : they all coexist , adding up to a soundtrack that perfectly complements the visuals . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ encapsulate the timeless stories of a galaxy far , far away . <p> Before Star Wars : A New Hope , there was a dearth of classical , orchestral film music . Movies from the 1950s onwards utilised mainly , pop , rock and jazz . After Williams ' work on Jaws , Steven Spielberg recommended the composer to George Lucas for work on Star Wars . For the film , Williams wrote a romantic orchestral work that celebrated music from the golden age of Hollywood . The success of Star Wars helped revive classical music in film and cemented Williams ' status as a great film composer . <p> The Star Wars theme is one of the most recognisable and best movie scores of all time . <h> Honourable Mentions : <h> The Matrix -- Don Davis <p> Fantastic contributions by Marilyn Manson , Rage Against the Machine , Juno Reactor and The Crystal Method did not overshadow Don Davis ' jarring yet fresh and interesting avant-garde score . Davis ' dissonant brass-heavy tones and dissonant strings give the impression all is not as it seems . <h> Batman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tim Burton collaborated on the cult hit , Beetlejuice , which also has a memorable soundtrack . Yet it was Elfman 's work on Batman that cemented his status as a notable composer . <h> Conan the Barbarian -- Basil Poledouris <p> Poledouris ' score veers between brutal and tender . To capture the brutality and energy of the ancient setting primal fifths and huge orchestras are utilised to marvellous effect . Tender moments are found in minor-keyed melodies and Poledouris ' keen awareness of ancient folk music and chant . <h> Ben Hur -- Miklos Rozsa <p> Before pop , rock and jazz became the main musical idioms in Hollywood during the 60s and 70s , Rozsa 's music for Ben Hur was arguably the last representation of the golden age of Hollywood film music . Rozsa effectively exploits leitmotifs and thematic transformation to show the development and change in characters , pulling on your heartstrings one moment and then raising your spirits the next . <h> Predator -- Alan Silvestri <p> Silvestri 's score is primal and rhythmically complex , perfect for those jungle scenes . The trumpets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and unsettles you are the wild dissonances of the strings , ethereal and fantastical . Ambient electronic sounds are perfectly used within the acoustic orchestral compositions as well . <h> Harry Potter -- John Williams <p> John Williams scored the first three Harry Potter films . Consequently , their scores are the best in the series . While Williams does not reinvent himself he still managed to create a memorable and magical soundtrack . <h> The Battle of Algiers -- Ennio Morricone <p> In the history of cinema , Morricone is a titan . Some of his credits include A Fist Full of Dollars , The Good the Bad and the Ugly and Once Upon a Time in the West . The Battle of Algiers is not one of his more commonly known or celebrated works but the score is excellent nonetheless . The low piano passages and militant percussion encapsulate the revolutionary spirit of the film .

The fossils studied were from the Mio-Pliocene ( 5,2-million years ago ) fossil site called Langebaanweg ( West Coast Fossil Park ) on the West Coast of South Africa where at least three different types of sabretooth cats have been recovered . <p> Sabretooth cats , with their distinctive , large sabre-like canines that project out of their upper jaws like steak knives , are charismatic carnivores known globally in the fossil record . The previously undescribed sabretooth cat ( felid ) fossil remains were discovered by Dr Alberto Valenciano , a former postdoctoral fellow at the University of Cape Town ( UCT ) and the Iziko South African Museum , now based at University of Zaragoza , while examining the collections at the Iziko South African Museum . <p> Shortly after , UCT Palaeobiologist Professor Anusuya Chinsamy-Turan and her then honours student Caitlin Rabe began their work on the remains . They found that this sabretooth cat lies between two previously described genera and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and other findings have been published in the international journal Papers in Palaeontology . <p> Now a doctoral candidate at UCT , Rabe explains how the research process began : " We cast our net wide , by comparing our fossils to those of many sabretooth species from around the world , and we also included modern representatives in our analysis , like the African Lion ( Panthera leo ) , to better understand what our cat looked like relative to the rest of the felid family . " <p> This comparative analysis revealed that the Langebaanweg sabretooth had similar limb bone proportions to two known African and European sabretooths -- Lokotunjailurus emageritus from Kenya , and Machairodus aphanistus from Spain . <p> Rabe adds : " These results were surprising because despite being a large-bodied cat , our specimen was different to the large-bodied genus at Langebaanweg Amphimachairodus . " <p> While the genus Machairodus has been previously reported in Langebaanweg , the genus Lokotunjailurus is currently known only from the Lothagam fossil site in Kenya , and Toros-Menalla in Chad . <p> Co-author Valenciano shares : " Our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ biggest known sabretooth cat from Langebaanweg , but that it was a new large-sized cat . This indicates that we had two large-bodied sabretooth cats that were living on the West Coast of South Africa about five-million-years-ago . " <p> " This is not the end of the fascinating story of the diversity of the sabretooth cats from Langebaanweg . There are still several other undescribed sabretooth fossils ( including skulls and mandibles ) that are crying out from some research attention , " adds Professor Chinsamy-Turan . In addition to identifying the sabretooth , Rabe also described the disfigured , diseased bones and was able to deduce the animal was afflicted with osteoarthritis . <p> " The erosive pathological features visible in the sabretooth indicate that it suffered from severe osteoarthritis . Just looking at the bones it is obvious that something is seriously wrong .

@@93807236 <h> Reform process key to improving supply chain performance <p> Sep 27 , 2022 <p> The impact of the Covid-19 pandemic , corruption and breach of ethics , rising unemployment , power interruptions and the conflict in Ukraine have created an extremely volatile and uncertain environment around the world , meaning that resilience in supply chains has become more important than ever . <p> According to Malcolm Harrison , CEO of the Chartered Institute of Procurement &amp; Supply ( CIPS ) , the global professional body for procurement and supply professionals , it has become critical for supply chains to be balanced and aligned to deliver agility and innovation , to conserve the planet , mitigate risk and benefit end customers . <p> In early September , Harrison toured Namibia , Botswana and South Africa , speaking at a number of business breakfasts , roundtable discussions and the region 's CIPS graduation ceremony in Johannesburg . Attendees included government bodies , private sector businesses such as Auditor-General South Africa , SAPPI , ABSA , FNB , Standard Bank , Department of Justice and Constitutional Development , Transnet , AfriSam , NTP Radioisotopes , Telkom , BP , Rand Water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and SARS . <p> The gala graduation ceremony was held at the Hilton Hotel in Sandton on 9 September and attended by over 230 guests and dignitaries , including graduating MCIPS members from Gaborone City Council , Namibia Breweries Limited , Commission for Conciliation Mediation and Arbitration ( CCMA ) , Transnet , Standard Bank Lesotho , Public Procurement Regulatory Authority : Botswana , Eskom , Shell , Northern Cape Department of Education , Heineken South Africa , Eswatini Water Services Corporation , Ministry Of Tourism , Liberty , EThekwini Municipality , Gauteng Provincial Treasury , The Foschini Group and Rand Water , as well as family and friends of the graduates . <p> CIPS , has over 3 000 full MCIPS members in South Africa as fully trained professionals , and provides universities , study centres and students the opportunity to access teaching and learning of a world-class professional qualification accredited by the South African Qualification Authority ( SAQA ) . This support for the procurement and supply chain profession not only contributes to best practice in ethics and sustainability but also contributes towards an ethical and sustainable society @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Harrison says the considerable challenges occurring in Southern Africa have not escaped South Africa , which was already in a precarious economic position even prior to Covid-19 arriving on its shores , despite the wealth of resources , talent and possibilities the country offers . <p> In 2019 , the country 's economy grew by only 0.1% , partially caused by the resurgence of Eskom 's load-shedding , and while there has been a slight recovery , GDP growth is still only expected to be 1.7% over the medium term . <p> Coupled with the global impact of volatile trade relationships around the world hampering the smooth running of supply chains , the situation is daunting , but procurement and supply professionals are rising to the challenge , Harrison says . <p> " Procurement professionals have always managed risk and disruption , and the recent challenges have stretched this profession even further , but trained professionals are adept at finding solutions and building resilience . Our professionals understand true value across the supply chain , which is not just about cost efficiencies . The most expensive item you will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up and our professionals understand that other issues , such as ensuring supply , come into play when managing disrupted supply chains . " <p> After years of corruption and state capture , the South African government is attempting to reform , addressing the professionalisation of public service first and raising skills levels in the workforce which CIPS is providing support on . <p> The reforms will result in a more ' business-friendly ' environment , create a more transparent environment for suppliers to have more success in bids and tenders and reduce the level of disruption and lack of clarity as much as possible . <p> While Harrison notes the Public Service Act Amendment Bill and the Public Service Commission Bill are key to giving effect to the government 's efforts to institutionalise professionalisation of the public service these critically important interventions are yet to be concluded and signed into law by President Cyril Ramaphosa . <p> On another note , Harrison believes digitisation of government systems will also go a long way in driving procurement reforms , creating effective communication platforms that can be utilised by the state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public value and trust , lead to greater transparency , improve citizen participation , stimulate proactive service delivery and enable economic development and growth , " he says . <p> Harrison tackled many issues during his visit , also mentioning sustainability . <p> " The reality is the world is running short of vital resources at a fast rate . Wildfires droughts and floods are a regular occurrence , and we can expect to live with pandemics for the foreseeable future . Now is the time for procurement teams to get a handle on the risks to their supply chains , " Harrison says . <p> The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report in 2021 declaration of " code red for humanity " has made it a business imperative to increase the focus on actions to establish more sustainable supply chains . <p> " In many organisations , 90% of the impact on the climate is in the supply chains , not from within the walls of an organisation 's activities . No organisation will address climate change or truly have a sustainable business model unless they focus on addressing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> For procurement professionals to not only negotiate but overcome the many challenges disrupting supply chains , both in South Africa and globally , Harrison recommends that they : <p> * Embrace technology and seek out new opportunities to find better ways of working and drive greater transparency for risk and sustainability ; <p> * Understand the available data and become a go-to person for stakeholders to gain valuable insights and information ; <p> * Embed themselves within the business and align with stakeholders ' goals and language . <p> * Add true value to their organisation not just in terms of cost efficiencies , but the good they can do in society which includes the contribution to tackle climate change <p> * Seek out opportunities to embed sustainability and local value within sourcing projects . <p> " Procurement professionals are in a very privileged position to make significant changes for good , and should use their knowledge , skills and influence over supply chains to make a difference now and for future generations , " Harrison concludes .

@@93807240 <p> The doctrine of common purpose is a well-known principle in criminal law . In essence , if two or more people , having a common purpose to commit a crime , act together in order to achieve that purpose , then the conduct of each of them in the execution of that purpose is imputed to the others . <p> From a labour law context , the doctrine is relevant in instances of violent strike action . The vexed question is whether an employer may apply the doctrine of common purpose to dismiss employees for misconduct where the employees were spectators to a violent assault during an unprotected strike . <p> One hundred and forty-eight employees participated in an unprotected strike , during which a rogue group of twelve employees violently assaulted the employer 's head of HR . <p> The employer instituted disciplinary proceedings and eventually dismissed all 148 employees who had participated in the strike and had been present during the assault . The chairperson found all the employees guilty of two counts of misconduct -- both the assault and participating in an unprotected strike . <p> Forty-one of the employees challenged this decision and both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( LAC ) found in favour of the employer . The LAC held that to avoid liability under the doctrine of common purpose , the employees in the vicinity of the assault had an obligation to take positive steps to disassociate themselves from the conduct of the perpetrators and intervene to stop the violence from taking place . <p> Constitutional Court Finding <p> In its finding , the CC unanimously overturned the decision of the LAC . The CC found that 12 of the 148 employees were actively engaged in the assault , and 41 of the employees were unidentified . <p> Despite the probability of the unidentified employees being at the premises during the violent action , the CC found that the LAC misconstrued the doctrine of common purpose by requiring bystanders to take positive steps in disassociating themselves from the actual perpetrators , and intervening in stopping the violent action . Common purpose requires active association with the violence before its commencement . <p> The mere presence at the scene of the violent action does not invoke the doctrine of common purpose and impute that conduct to all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear evidence that the employees intended to associate themselves with violent actions .

Therefore , an employee is entitled to choose silence for fear of retaliation and animosity . <p> The CC set aside both the LC and LAC findings and referred the matter back to the LC to consider an appropriate sanction on the charge of participation in an unprotected strike only . <p> Comments <p> The CC clarified the application of the doctrine of common purpose , and its application in the context of employment law .

South Africa must also consider targeted interventions -- a " whole of government approach " -- that could include a basic income for poor households , subsidies for taxi owners , price caps for electricity increases and large reductions in the fuel levy . <h> The views expressed are those of the author and do not reflect the official policy or position of the Mail &amp; Guardian .

The critically acclaimed film , which stars Viola Davis , Mzansi 's Thuso Mbedu , Lashana Lynch , Sheila Atim and John Boyega , smashed projections by bringing in $19-million instead of the expected $12-millon . <p> The film was shot in Mzansi over 63 days from November 2021 and is based on the true life Agojie , the all-female warrior unit which protected Dahomey during the 17th to 19th centuries . <p> At an advance screening of the film in New York , days before it opened in the US , Prince-Bythewood said Blanchard was the obvious choice for the composer job as soon as she took on the project and working with him was " the most inspiring musical collaboration " of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ M , also a Grammy winner , to write three songs which were sung by a South African choir in Fongbe , a language spoken in Benin . <p> Prince-Bythewood said during initial research they learned that the Dahomey used to create songs and elaborate dance sequences to get ready for battle and to honour the king and each other . The Lebo M songs -- Tribute to the King , Agojie It 's War , led by Jabu Chirindah and Blood of Our Sisters , led by Nokukhanya Dlamini -- were also taught to the cast to sing in the film during the song and dance sequences . <p> Blanchard 's music does not have lyrics , but it does carry vocal improvisations and choir .

This lack of a credit score and any history of credit activity is certainly an impediment for these unserved consumers to get their first credit product , as many lenders are hesitant to extend credit to consumers without any credit history or score . For these traditionally unscoreable consumers , they face a " chicken or egg " conundrum of how to get that first credit product when they lack a credit history . <p> " This reality underscores the importance of incorporating alternative and trended data into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ credit invisible . Once these consumers can be evaluated by financial institutions , lenders can better determine where there might be new opportunities for growth and how they can expand credit inclusion , " says Naik . <p> Every year a portion of the underserved consumer population -- those with minimal credit activity -- become more fully credit active by opening additional credit products , while many remain in that underserved segment . To better understand how underserved consumers transitioned to becoming more fully credit active , the study looked at the number and type of credit products consumers had opened within the two-year period . <p> For the purpose of the study , underserved consumers transitioned to served if they opened additional product types over the two-year study period -- for example , when a previous credit card-only consumer also opens a vehicle finance loan . Alternatively , they could become newly served if they opened additional products of the same type -- for example , if they opened additional accounts of the same product type and reached three or more open accounts over the two-year study period . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consumers in South Africa were clothing accounts ( 59% ) , followed by personal loans ( 31% ) . This mirrors broader trends that TransUnion has observed in South Africa , where clothing accounts and personal loans are the most common first product for consumers entering the credit market . <p> This varied by country , however , as the study found that in other emerging markets like India and Colombia , the product type most commonly held by underserved consumers were agricultural loans and microcredit loans , respectively . In Canada , Hong Kong and the United States , credit cards were the most commonly held product by underserved consumers . <p> In South Africa , 78% of underserved consumers that migrated to credit served within the two-year period did so by opening a second product type . The most commonly opened second product types were personal loans , clothing accounts and retail revolving facilities . <p> When looking at the demographics of underserved and served consumer groups , the age distribution between the two is very similar with just a slightly higher percentage of Millennials ( born 1980-1994 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to served ( 42% ) , and slightly less Gen X ( born 1965-1979 ) as a proportion of underserved ( 28% ) compared to served ( 36% ) . <p> The demographic data reflects an opportunity for lenders to expand credit access for younger underserved consumers . Increased access enables economic advancement and upward mobility opportunities for these consumers who might be looking to buy their first vehicle or home , or to fund higher education as a further means of advancement . <p> The report also observes that consumers who progressed to being served over the study period have very comparable , and sometimes better , performance on new accounts opened compared to consumers who were already served and more credit active at the time of origination . In the case of personal loan delinquencies in South Africa ( as measured by 1+ months in arrears ) , newly served consumers were less delinquent ( 19,3% ) when compared to credit established consumers ( 21,8% ) six-months post origination of a new personal loan . <p> Combined , TransUnion 's age- and risk-specific insights clearly show a wealth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that could benefit both lenders and consumers alike . <p> " Consumers who migrated to being credit served are mostly young with comparable risk to already established consumers , who are no longer new to credit , but for whom graduating to being credit established or served has taken longer than for other consumers , " says Naik . " These consumers appear to want more credit , but they are not necessarily able to access the credit they want , potentially due to their limited credit history . This highlights a missed opportunity for lenders who are seeking to grow and add new customers . <p> " Many of these underserved consumers would likely be well-performing and profitable borrowers , but because of their limited credit history , lenders are reluctant to extend them credit . Expanding the use of alternative and trended data on consumers into lending decisions could enable lenders to get a fuller picture of the financial capacity of underserved consumers and make credit available to more of them .

It provided a huge and very welcome change , raising the operation back to days of the much-missed efficiency of Manuel and Ramos . <p> In recent years , arrangements for those reporting on this critical event for shareholders of SA Inc ( ie We the People ) has deteriorated from lackadaisical to chaotic . That has now been firmly reversed . Critically , the " lockup " starting time is back at 6am , giving those of us with responsibility to work through tomes of material time to do them a modicum of justice . <p> Better still , when I arrived at the appointed moment , a clutch of Treasury staff were already in attendance , bright eyed and attentive -- with the material laid out at suitably spaced workstations . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and wait ' of , maybe 7 for 7:30 , maybe 8am kick off pre-Enoch . <p> That seemingly small thing reflects what is happening at the far more important broader level . <p> The thought applied to the way the country 's finances are being allocated and managed is a breath of fresh air . It speaks to a national financial director who sees the big picture ; who actually knows what is happening in his ' business ' ; and what needs to be prioritised . <p> Admittedly , Enoch has benefitted from unexpectedly fair weather in a storm engulfing much of the world . Down here in the southern tip of Africa our fiscal sails are being filled through higher commodity prices . <p> Of course , it could have been much better . But still , even with Transnet 's dead hand -- and strike -- the mining sector delivered another large and very welcome revenue bonus for the National Treasury . That means for all of us . <p> Company tax delivered 75% of the R82bn in bonus revenue that Treasury received in the past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The bulk of this came from mining companies . And that despite the sector contracting by 7.3% in the six months to end June ( Treasury 's office number ) . <p> All this is a powerful reminder that , despite decades of neglect and political abuse , SA 's mining companies are still able to deliver a decisive swing factor for an embattled nation . Indeed , their resilience against incredible odds reflects so much about the country 's private sector as a whole . <p> This resilience , that ability to cope with massive and often destructive politically-wrought change , is one of many things which keeps me upbeat about my country .

The other major bonuses are also business related , with customs duties lifted R11.5bn ( 19% ) and dividend taxes R5.7bn ( +20% ) . <p> After adjustments , the bottom line is Finmin Enoch Godongwana had the extreme pleasure of deciding how to allocate a juicy R83bn in revenue overruns . The official spin is that this is being allocated to ' critical ' issues like Eskom and roads agency Sanral ( R23bn ) . <p> Any numerate person might have expected him , rather , to use the windfall to pump as much as possible into repaying part of SA 's growing debt mountain .

This will affect fiscal revenues going forward . <p> It is for this reason that the medium-term strategy needs to maintain a prudent approach to fiscal policy . <p> We need to decrease our debt burden and debt-service costs by reducing our annual deficits . This will stabilise the public finances and reduce the fiscal risks . <p> Honourable Members , we are making progress in this regard .

In fact , consolidated government spending will exceed R2.2 trillion this year and will rise to R2.5 trillion in 2025/26 . <p> Turning to revenue , since the 2022 Budget , revenue collection has exceeded projections , and the gross tax revenue estimate for 2022/23 has been revised up , by R83.5 billion , to R1.68 trillion . <p> The higher estimate is largely due to improvements in corporate income tax collections , with strong receipts from the finance and manufacturing sectors . <p> The better-than-expected revenue collection estimates , including over the medium term , have allowed government to narrow the deficit and mitigate lingering and new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restore the baseline budgets of departments key to the delivery of services , without making unaffordable permanent commitments . <p> A portion of higher-than-anticipated revenue will be utilised as follows : <p> Reducing the deficit in the current financial year and over the MTEF ; <p> Making additions for infrastructure projects and critical public services such as education , health , and policing ; <p> Addressing fiscal risks that were previously identified in February . These include higher- than-projected debt service costs , the public service wage bill , and the materialisation of financial risks from some state-owned companies . <p> Should any of the fiscal risks materialise , this could negatively affect the fiscal position and government 's effort to stabilise the public finances . <h> In-year spending adjustments <p> Madam Speaker , we are allocating a net addition of R13 billion in spending adjustments for the 2022/23 financial year in the Adjustments Appropriation Bill . <p> The largest adjustment -- R6.3 billion , or 49 per cent of the total -- -- is allocated towards disaster relief , especially the April flooding in several parts of the country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> R389 million for 24 rural bridges through the Welisizwe Rural Bridges programme ; <p> R500 million is also set aside to kick off the Home Affairs digitisation project , that will employ 10 000 young people over 3 years . <p> R118 million to deal with interim relocation costs and to prepare for the rebuilding of Parliament . <p> Honourable Members , during the current financial year , wage negotiations have been taking place at the Public Service Coordinating Bargaining Council . On 30 August 2022 government made a final offer which emanated from a facilitation process . This offer includes the following : <p> Continuation of a non-pensionable cash allowance for the current financial year . This translates into an average of R1 000 per employee per month until March 2023 . <p> A pensionable salary increase of 3% for public servants . <p> Madam Speaker , the offer on the table is in the best interest of the fiscus and public service workers . Implementing it does not undermine the collective bargaining process . We believe that the facilitation process has helped all parties get to this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ today include this amount . <p> This offer will be implemented through the payroll system , and back dated to April 2022 . <h> Expenditure framework <p> Honourable Members , our budget over the next three years is focused on restoring service delivery and laying the foundation for higher growth . <p> Medium-term changes to spending plans are driven mainly by government 's decision to extend the special COVID-19 Social Relief of Distress grant by one year , until 31 March 2024 . <p> The fiscal framework also includes funding for the carry-through costs of the 2022/23 public service wage increases , as well as for safety and security , infrastructure investment and service delivery . <p> The SRD grant was introduced in May 2020 as a temporary measure to respond to the needs of the most vulnerable who were affected by lockdown measures . It has been extended several times since then . <p> Discussions on the future of the grant are on-going and involve very difficult trade-offs and financing decisions . <p> Despite the provision made in this budget , I want to reiterate that any permanent extension @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in spending elsewhere , or a combination of the two . <p> Madam Speaker , this is what is meant by trade-offs : balancing the need to address one priority over another . <p> Overall , consolidated government spending is projected to increase from R2.21 trillion in 2022/23 to R2.48 trillion in 2025/26 at an average growth rate of 4 per cent . <p> The social wage , totalling R3.56 trillion over the next three years , or 59.2 per cent of the consolidated non-interest spending , will take up the biggest share of the budget in support of poor households and the most vulnerable in our society . <p> The largest allocations are directed to the education , health and social development sectors . <p> Moreover , over the next three years , spending increases will be prioritised to improve investment in infrastructure and boost the budgets for safety , security and fighting corruption . <p> Overall , government 's consolidated capital spending will increase , from R95.1 billion in 2022/23 to R145.4 billion in 2025/26 . This excludes spending on state-owned enterprises . <p> We are working closely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our Parliament . Over the medium term expenditure framework , we have made allowance for approximately R 2 billion for rebuilding our Parliament . <h> Division of Revenue and Changes in Funding at Local Government <p> Madam Speaker , over the next year , we will work with provinces and municipalities to make meaningful progress in achieving our development goals . <p> Municipalities shape the living conditions of our people . They ensure that people have access to clean drinking water , energy , housing and sanitation . <p> Yet several municipalities are dysfunctional , experiencing , either financial or leadership crisis , reflected in a general inability to deliver services . <p> Following a diagnostic review of the local government capacity building system , the National Treasury is coordinating with key stakeholders including the Department of Cooperative <p> Governance , SALGA and provinces in the design of capacity-building systems towards a more integrated and outcome- focused approach . <p> Over the next three years , we propose allocating 48.4 per cent of available non-interest spending to national departments , 41.4 per cent to provinces and 10.1 per cent to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basic education and health services , roads , housing , social development , and agriculture . <p> We are also allocating additional funds to local government to support the delivery of free basic services to poor households , considering the rising cost of the free basic services , as well as rising bulk electricity and water costs . <h> Addressing Risks from State-Owned Enterprises <p> These companies should be self-sufficient and must contribute to economic growth . <p> Unfortunately , we face a situation where financial weakness caused in previous years by bad leadership and corruption still needs to be resolved . <p> Moreover , when unavoidable events such as the recent floods destroy infrastructure and assets , it puts the whole economy at risk . <p> In the meantime , the road network must function , ports must operate and critical technical projects can not be halted . <p> So , as balance sheets are being restored and those who looted and mismanaged then are being held accountable , including through the criminal justice system , we have little choice but to act to keep these key services running @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the current year to reduce risks from specific SOEs . <p> These resources can not be used to fund baseline increases as they are once-off . Using them in this way will also not expand the fiscal deficit compared to our existing medium-term plans . <p> The financial support to SOEs recognises their potential to contribute to our long-run growth prospects . <p> We are thus tabling a Special Appropriation Bill to provide additional funding to Denel , Transnet and SANRAL . These allocations will allow these entities to adjust their business models and restore their long-term financial viability . <p> Fiscal support to state-owned companies remains a challenging balancing act given the many competing priorities and limited resources . Funding to SOEs will now come with strict pre- and post-conditions . Pre-conditions mean that SOEs will need to comply with these conditions before they receive government support , not after . <p> Non-compliance to conditions , means no funding . <p> Transnet is allocated R2.9 billion to ensure the return of out-of-service locomotives . This will be complemented by R2.9 billion from in year spending adjustments to deal with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Denel is allocated R3.4 billion to support recent progress made to stabilise the entity . <p> This allocation will be augmented by R1.8 billion in sale of non-core assets and will unlock a committed order book of R12 billion awaiting execution . <h> SANRAL <p> Honourable members , the uncertainty surrounding the Gauteng Freeway Improvement Project continues to have a major negative implication for road construction in the country . <p> We need to move on from the debates of previous years and find solutions to this challenge . <p> To resolve the funding impasse the Gauteng provincial government has agreed to contribute 30 per cent to settling SANRAL 's debt and interest obligations , while national government covers 70 per cent . <p> Gauteng will also cover the costs of maintaining the 201 kilometres and associated interchanges of the roads and any additional investment in road will be funded through either the existing electronic toll infrastructure or new toll plazas , or any other revenue source within their area of responsibility . <p> Government proposes to make an initial allocation of R23.7 billion from the national fiscus , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Turning to Eskom . For at least a decade , we have spent billions of rands supporting Eskom , with limited improvements in the reliability of the electricity supply or the financial health of the company . <p> To ensure Eskom 's long-term financial viability , government will take over a significant portion of the utility 's R400 billion debt . <p> While the selection of the relevant debt instruments and the method of effecting the relief is still to be determined , the quantum is expected to be between one-third and two-thirds of Eskom 's current debt . <p> The debt takeover , once finalised , together with other reforms will ensure that Eskom is financially sustainable <p> The programme will allow Eskom to focus on plant performance and capital investment and ensure that it no longer relies on government bailouts . <p> Importantly , the programme will include strict conditions required of Eskom and other stakeholders before and during the debt transfer . <p> These conditions will address Eskom 's structural challenges by managing its costs , addressing municipal and household arrears due to the utility , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In addition , the conditions will be informed by a Treasury led independent review of Eskom 's operations , in particular the performance of its generation fleet . <p> Further details of the programme will be finalised following consultations with all relevant stakeholders and lenders and will be announced in the 2023 Budget . <h> Modernising procurement <p> Madam Speaker , we are working to strengthen our procurement and financial accountability system . <p> We are also adopting best-practices in the procurement of goods and services , including the highest standards of transparency in the tendering processes . <p> Such modernisation aims to simplify and speed up the process for public infrastructure projects , whilst reducing the scope for looting and corruption . <p> We are envisaging two changes to procurement governance : <p> We expect to introduce the Public Procurement Bill -- which will enhance transparency , integrity and promote the use of technology for efficiency and effectiveness in public procurement -- to Parliament in March 2023 . <p> The new Preferential Procurement Regulations of 2022 , replacing the now invalid Regulations of 2017 , will be promulgated in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The regulations empower organs of state with the authority to determine their own preferential procurement policies within the ambit of the Preferential Procurement Policy Framework Act . <h> Fighting crime and corruption <p> Earlier this week , President Ramaphosa announced Government 's response to the recommendations of the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture . <p> He committed the government to " a new chapter in our struggle against corruption , to advance the renewal of our society . " <p> He noted the need for the state to be " ethical and free of corruption as it serves the needs and interests of the people . " <p> As noted by the Commission , to enable service delivery we should protect honest accounting officers and authorities who make decisions in good faith from criminal prosecution and civil litigation . <p> In this regard , we will strengthen the auditing and preventative control systems , to enable managers to manage , while putting mechanisms to hold them accountable . <p> The Commission of Inquiry into State Capture made recommendations aimed at strengthening the institutional , governance and accountability mechanisms . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continue to take punitive administrative action against companies and individuals who have actively facilitated corrupt and irregular procurement activities . <p> Madam Speaker , crime is a safety , economic as well as a social issue . A safe environment is important for full participation in economic and social life . This makes fighting crime a key pillar of enhancing economic growth . <p> Many South Africans live in fear in their homes , in their places of work and in places of recreation . <p> In response , we are allocating additional resources to our security forces to take the fight to those that threaten our peace as a nation . <p> We will support the police to recruit an additional15 000 constables over the next 3 years . <h> Avoiding grey-listing by the financial action task force <p> Honourable Members , we are doing everything necessary to prevent grey-listing by the Financial Action Task Force ; the international standard-setting body that oversees global compliance with anti-money laundering rules . <p> Already we have tabled two bills in Parliament , aimed at addressing weaknesses in our legislative framework . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end of this year . <p> This will be a significant step towards meeting the 40 recommendations made by the Financial Action Task Force . <p> We are also required to implement laws on anti-money laundering and corruption more effectively . <p> Investing in building the capacity of our regulatory and enforcement institutions is already bearing positive results . These include : <p> The Investigating Directorate of the National Prosecuting Authority has enrolled 26 cases , declared 89 investigations and 165 accused persons have appeared in court for alleged state capture-related offences . <p> The Asset Forfeiture Unit has frozen or granted preservation orders to the value of R12.9 billion , and returned a total of R2.9 billion to affected entities ; <p> The SIU has instituted four High Court cases in relation to contracts worth R62.1 billion ; and <p> SARS investigations arising from the Commission 's findings and evidence have resulted in collections of R4.8 billion in unpaid taxes . SARS is currently engaged in 18 projects involving 222 cases . 11 of those cases are recommendations explicitly for SARS to execute and 8 have been finalised and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proposes additional resources to the budgets of the National Prosecuting Authority , the Special Investigating Unit , the Financial Intelligence Centre and the South African Revenue Service , to further improve the capability of the state to investigate and prosecute sophisticated financial crimes . <p> In addition , Government will also publish a revised national risk assessment strategy on anti- money laundering and terror financing . <h> CONCLUSION <p> Madam Speaker , let me conclude by reiterating what I said in the beginning : our democratic ideals will be given life and sustained by a growing and inclusive economy . <p> We can not ignore the relationship between democracy and the economy , and the relationship between politics and inequality . <p> We are fortunate to have a legal and policy framework , backed by a political vision , that allows us to transform the economic conditions of our people and deliver on the promise of democracy . <p> This MTBPS reminds us of the urgent need to pursue the reform of our economy in a consistent manner , with the freedom of our people in mind . <p> We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mandela and many other leaders after him , drew between a thriving economy , and a fair and just society . This the golden thread that runs through our Constitution and this Medium-Term Budget Policy Statement . We should keep sight of this goal and the balancing act it entails as we do our work . <p> Madam Speaker , I am grateful to the President and Deputy President for their support and leadership . Thank you to the Deputy Minister of Finance , and the National Treasury team , led by the Acting Director-General . <p> My sincere thanks to the Commissioner of the South African Revenue Service , and the Governor of the South African Reserve Bank . <p> Let me also thank my colleagues in the Ministers ' Committee on the Budget and in the Budget Council who have shared the load of the tough decisions that have to be made . Similarly , the Parliamentary Committees of Finance and Appropriations , I express my sincere appreciation . <p> Lastly , thank you to each and every South African . We serve at your privilege .

Dr Michael Louis , director of OSA , as well as founder of the Independent Candidates Association , told BizNews correspondent Michael Appel that there 's ardent opposition to the recently-passed Bill , with stinging criticism even coming from none other than former presidents Thabo Mbeki and Kgalema Motlanthe . In June 2020 , the Constitutional Court ruled that our Electoral Act was unconstitutional . The Bill of Rights -- which gives any individual the right to stand for public office -- is at odds with current legislation stating anyone contesting elections must belong to a political party . The ConCourt ordered Parliament to remedy the situation within 24 months , but that deadline expired in June 2022 . An extension until 10 December this year was granted . Louis predicts that due to the flawed and defective process by which the Bill in its current form was crafted , it simply wo n't pass constitutional muster . Ramaphosa is likely , he believes , going to have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make changes to the Bill so that it equals out the skewed playing field currently working in favour of political parties . -- Michael Appel <h> Excepts from interview with One South Africa Movement director Dr Michael Louis <p> It 's a fact . Parliament really has such problems because when it comes to process , there was the private member 's motion and bill of honourable Mosiuoa Lekota that was submitted to Parliament in 2019 already because we always knew that the right to vote is really a great problem . So we spent two years draughting that Bill . That was done to help the minister when it comes to a new electoral system that might involve constituencies and that bill was submitted . It was certified by the constitutional lawyers of Parliament and the minister just absolutely ignored that Bill . So when the judgment of the Constitutional Court came on the 11th of June 2020 , there was already a formal Bill in Parliament and they could have just immediately started working on it . But it took him Ramaphosa one year to appoint a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took him another six months to consider that Bill and get opinions . So we 've got the fact that it 's negligence on the part of Parliament . Even in the current ConCourt extension application to 10 December , the court actually said that Parliament was at fault and the minister was at fault and reprimanded them for delaying this Bill . <p> On whether the Bill is defective in its current form <p> The defects are definitely in the public participation process . The public was n't given enough time to consult . Even although the minister sent the standing committee to go to different provinces at different times , they actually split the standing committees into groupings . It was false because the they were n't presented with the options of the ministerial advisory committee . There were two options , the minimalist option and the majority report . Even at the two meetings of the standing committee that I attended I asked if I can see Valli Moosa 's report and I was told no . One member of the committee did n't even know that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't presented to the audience to comment on . That was not in line with public participation . They just came with the one Bill . Then , the ANC bussed in people to give their submissions . What was funny about it is that they read from a script . I even went to one of the ladies and I asked whether she can please explain what option one that she was supporting was all about . She said " Nee meneer , ek weet nie wat hierdie option one is nie , maar ek moes dit so lees " . <p> Image credit : The South African https : **39;1149;TOOLONG ...

This is my 28th year in the political landscape , and I 've never ever experienced the pronouncement by two past presidents of the ANC on a matter like this .

He was in an NEC meeting where he knows that the NEC were talking about how could they design @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the governing party . Now that 's what we 've always been saying . This is the problem constitutionally with this Bill , that it has been designed with intent to work in favour of the bigger parties . When Thabo Mbeki confirmed that it was just so outstanding . What was even better is when he said he ca n't believe the current leaders of the ANC would stifle the process instead of seeing how they can enhance democracy and have a more participatory democracy that would bring more people to the polls . <p> On what Ramaphosa 's next move might be <p> The NCOP has just announced that public comment must come in before the 9th of November . Then it 'll take about two weeks to consider those submissions from not only civil society , but all stakeholders , which will take us to about the 23rd of November .

Now , with such a controversial bill , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opposing this Bill saying it wo n't pass constitutional muster , plus two ex-presidents going against him on this issue , we do n't foresee the president being able to get constitutional legal advice within an ambit of eight days and sign this bill into an act . So we are predicting that the president is going to ask parliament to ask for a condonation of extra time because he believes that this Bill could be unconstitutional and he needs legal advice . This will then leave the gap open for us to try and see if we can come with some form of resolve .

Toxic environments , difficult managers , verbal abuse and sexual harassment . The mental health issues that people face in the workplace are numerous and various . They range from extreme stress to extreme boredom and are punctuated by all of the characteristics listed above and more . <p> What are the ramifications of these issues ? What effect do they have on the individuals concerned and on businesses as a whole ? And , most importantly of all , whose responsibility is it to address them ? <p> Leaders , this mental health awareness month -- and every other month . We 're looking at you . <p> Setting the scene : The worst workplaces today <p> The World Health Organisation has a personality diagnostic checklist that stipulates six factors that indicate psychopathic behaviour . <p> The list includes : callous unconcern for the feelings of others ; incapacity to maintain enduring relationships ; reckless disregard for the safety of others ; deceitfulness , repeated lying and conning others for profit ; incapacity to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with respect to lawful behaviours . <p> Gaze through a business lens and it is n't hard to see how many of these characteristics apply to the world 's major corporates . In some cases , all are relevant . The dangerous combination of global market uncertainty , the relentless pursuit of profit , the pressures to do more with less , and especially unethical leadership all too often create psychopathic workspaces that place wealth over well-being . <p> The result is working environments that are so stressful they can make people physically , mentally and emotionally ill . Environments that break down the human spirit , and lead to depression , burnout , and even hospitalisation . From a business perspective , they drive high turnover , increase recruitment and retention costs , and damage reputations . <p> On the other end of the spectrum , these spaces can lead to apathetic and detached workers . In a recent employee engagement survey , analytics and advisory company Gallup found that , on average , 13% of employees across all levels of businesses are fully engaged , 54% are simply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , and they do what they 're told ) , and 33% are functionally disengaged . <p> This means that roughly 87% of employees sit on the " quiet quitting " spectrum . The term quiet quitting only came into daily use in 2022 ( though the phenomenon has been around for years ) , but it succinctly describes employees who do only what is expected of them at work -- or less . It too is a symptom of toxic environments and has its own effects on mental health . Quiet quitting suffocates creativity , hinders innovation , and deadens morale . Real quitting often follows hot on its heels . <p> Taking responsibility : The role of authentic , vulnerable leadership <p> If you 're a leader in your organisation : addressing these issues starts with you -- particularly if you 're the chief executive , but equally so if you 're in any executive or managerial position . You set the tone for the behaviour that is tolerated and the culture you create , and have to continuously ask yourself : what are you doing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more importantly , who are you being in this process ? <p> Many businesses might have made this a key performance indicator since incentives remain a primary driver of corporate action . And while there are benefits to this approach , it can not be mere lip service or a box-ticking exercise . Measuring and managing the ways in which you keep your people informed , inspired and engaged has to be authentic . <p> And this starts with you . It starts with you being authentically yourself . <p> Authenticity is the bedrock of strong leadership . It demonstrates a heightened level of self-awareness and self-regulation and manifests as granting permission for everyone to be authentically themselves in turn . Its corollary is vulnerability , which allows for strengths and weaknesses , and room for improvement and growth . Being an authentic , vulnerable leader enhances credibility , engenders trust , nurtures relationships , and helps to eradicate detrimental behaviours in the workplace . <p> This filtering down is a gradual process -- but it is also organic , almost contagious . The more authenticity and vulnerability are encouraged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are likely to feel accepted and adequately supported . <p> Leadership is a state of being . It 's not a state of doing . It 's who you are as a human all day every day , and encompasses every interaction you have with your colleagues and employees . And if this state of being is authentic and vulnerable , and if it involves a commitment to eradicating toxicity from your working environment , only then can you hope to nurture an energised , productive and creative workforce in an otherwise complex business world . <p> The first three readers to email Lauren Hills at email protected with the words " Humanity " in the subject line will win a copy of Peter Laburn 's book , Lead with Humanity . <p> Peter Laburn is the founder of the transformational leadership movement , Lead with Humanity , and the author of the pioneering book , Leading with Humanity .

" I know that we may not bring them back but for what is worth I am really really sorry . " Said Mahlangu who appeared before the Life Esidimeni arbitration hearings probing the deaths of at least 143 mentally ill patients . ( Photo by Alet Pretorius/Gallo Images/Getty Images ) <p> Helen Adams* woke up alone in a room of a state psychiatriatric hospital in Gauteng , confused . She had no idea how she got there . <p> It soon became clear that she 'd been admitted to the facility to get treatment for her mental illness . <p> Later , Adams , 68 , found herself in a lounge , which had no furniture . There , she would sit on the cold floor for hours , wearing a tattered tracksuit that the hospital had given her . At suppertime , she ate the bland meal she was served , took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> That was day one of 90 . <p> " It was like a jail sentence , " she said during an interview for my master 's degree , which investigates how people living in community-based mental health facilities view their right to dignity . <p> Adams would have many more episodes of psychiatric distress like the one that got her admitted , but thankfully she would n't be sent to that particular hospital again . <p> When I spoke to her in 2020 , she was living at a community-based mental health facility , run by a nonprofit , in Johannesburg , where she felt much more comfortable . <p> Adams says she could n't bear the thought of being institutionalised again . " I took a knock . My pride and my dignity went for a loop . If you saw this place you 'd agree with me that it 's not fit for anybody to go there . " <h> Fight , flight or freeze : Why is mental healthcare in SA in limbo ? <p> Adams ' problem brings into question an issue that has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effectively . I 's called deinstitutionalisation . <p> It means the steady yet well-managed moving of persons with mental illness from institutional settings to community-based mental healthcare . So , instead of being kept unnecessarily long in a psychiatric hospital ( where people sometimes are overly medicated , physically restrained , sedated against their will or even abused ) , they are moved to well-equipped and resourced community-based mental health services once they 're stable and ready to start their journey to reintegrate into society . <p> Reports indicate this is a more effective method of managing their conditions . <p> The move to community-based mental healthcare is what government officials involved in the Life Esidimeni tragedy in 2015 claimed to have done , but which went horribly wrong because of corruption , political interference and a badly planned rush to save money . The result was a national tragedy that claimed 144 lives and another 44 people have never been found . <p> An inquest is underway in the North Gauteng high court to determine whether government officials can be held criminally liable for those deaths . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mental health patients be moved from Life Esidimeni facilities , which had the contract to care for state patients , to nonprofit providers of community-based mental healthcare services , contravened one of the basic principles of good deinstitutionalisation -- that community-based mental healthcare systems must be properly developed before people are discharged from hospital settings . <p> This was not the case in Gauteng and led to people dying at facilities that former deputy chief justice Dikgang Moseneke described as " places of torture " . <p> Nearly five years after arbitration proceedings ended , the Life Esidimeni disaster seems to have frozen any attempts to make mental healthcare more humane , instead of spurring urgent action . <h> What is community-based mental healthcare ? <p> The idea of community-based care for people with mental illness has become tangled up with the Life Esidimeni tragedy 's heart-wrenching stories of neglect and abuse in South Africa . <p> The people who were moved from Life Esidimeni were never evaluated to see if the new nonprofit organisations would be the right place for them , nor did the new centres get support @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take in new residents who , in many cases , still required clinical care . <p> So what does realcommunity-based mental healthcare look like ? <p> In South Africa , its main focus is to empower people through projects that help them to handle the challenges of daily life on their own and assist them with finding jobs . That could , for instance , include programmes that help them to adhere to prescribed medicine , encourage them to exercise regularly and eat healthy food , and help them to become part of groups that assist them to reintegrate into society . <p> These projects could be run at day centres or at facilities where people live full-time , but it has to be set up in a way that allows people to feel included in their communities . <p> At community-based mental health services , people still take their medicine , but the facilities do n't employ doctors and nurses ( as psychiatric hospitals do ) to provide intensive , 24-hour medical care . <p> So , psychiatric clinics and hospitals still form a vital part of the mental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policies put patients ' rights first . That rules out people being isolated , forced to take medicines , staying in an institution against their will or preventing them from settling back into society , according to the World Health Organisation 's ( WHO ) 2021 policy guidelines . <h> Plans , but little progress <p> In June , the health department published new draft rules that set out how such community-based organisations should operate and what the terms for licencing would be , but at the South African Federation for Mental Health ( SAFMH ) , we believe this document does n't do enough to apply the lessons we learned from the Life Esidimeni tragedy . <p> For one , it must be amended to remove any mention of clinical services linked to community-based facilities . The SAFMH said as much in its submission to the draft regulations , which will be published once the health department has reviewed it . <p> Meanwhile , the country 's finances do n't line up with its plan to deinstitutionalise . <p> The Gauteng Mental Health Marathon Project , the ill-fated plan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example of a worst-case scenario of deinstitutionalisation , and an illustration of how important it is that community-based mental healthcare infrastructure is developed properly before people are transferred from hospital settings . <p> Deinstitutionalisation -- when it 's done right -- is still the proven way to treat people with mental illness while protecting their dignity . <p> And there are projects that work . <h> Sanctuaries , not asylums <p> People I interviewed for my research described their experience at a community-based centre in Johannesburg as " a sanctuary " . Here , they say , they made friends with others and came to feel accepted , which improved their self-worth . <p> " I 've always been a drifter , " one participant said . " But when I came to this facility , I felt like I was at home . " <p> In a United States study , people diagnosed with schizophrenia ( which affects a person 's ability to think , feel and behave clearly ) said that being treated at a facility ( albeit a hospital ) where they had contact with other people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belonging . This , in turn , gave them hope , which is typically described as believing that your situation can change for the better . Research shows that having hope helps people with mental health disorders cope better and recover easier . <h> ' I 'll be close to my friends ' <p> In Brazil , dedicated psychiatric hospitals no longer exist . <p> Instead , people get help for mental health problems through a network of community-based services . Primary health clinics and the Centres for Psychosocial Care ( often called Caps ) are the main port of call and coordinate the service , but they also call on external specialists , outreach programmes and , in some cases , local general hospitals to help . An example would be if someone needs to be admitted for a short while during an emergency . <p> The Caps centres are designed to make residents feel as if they 're at home . They have a dining area where people eat together , individual counselling rooms , a pharmacy and communal areas , which encourage group activities such as going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spaces , such as parks and museums . <p> One client told the WHO : " Caps is a place where we have affection , medicine , food and support . If I happen to be admitted to a psychiatric hospital , they will know and they will bring me here , close to my friends . " <p> This person said that people " recover faster at Caps because they are treated with humanity " . And research backs this up . <p> In a study of more than 1 800 people who used the Caps network , almost a quarter said they did not experience another mental health crisis . For six out of 10 people emergencies happened less often and seven out of 10 reported that these events were less intense . <p> The system also lets a person with mental illness feel more in control of their treatment because they can make their own decisions , do n't have to wait for a crisis to get help and they view themselves as taking part in their recovery rather than receiving treatment passively . <h> It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) <p> Community-based mental healthcare does n't mean shipping someone off to a centre within their community and then forgetting about them . <p> Some people I spoke to , though , mentioned that that 's exactly how they felt . <p> One woman said : " Your family dumps you and they forget you are here at the centre . You do n't know where you 're going . Better hospitalised than sitting in a place like this . " <p> For effective community-based care , a facility should therefore have a system in place that encourages family involvement and also a clear plan to help the person return to society through , for instance , skills or job programmes . <p> This has to be done with a good understanding of a person 's individual circumstances and what care they need as part of their recovery , research shows . <p> Researchers say it could be because a person recovering from mental illness feels that the community they interact with outside the centre are different from them , while their interactions at the facility are mostly with people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they experience a greater sense of belonging . <h> Spend money to save money <p> Deinstitutionalisation should never be used as a cost-cutting measure , which is what the government officials involved in the Life Esidimeni scandal tried to do . <p> It could be seen as more expensive at first , because decision-makers may argue that the existing investment put into setting up hospitals will be lost and that a more individualised treatment approach is too costly . <p> But analyses show that , in the long run , community-based care is a better way to spend mental healthcare budgets . Studies have found that this type of care results in fewer people being readmitted for psychiatric treatment . Less productivity will therefore be lost , people may get back into community and family life easier , and even return to the job market . <p> So , ignoring the cost of not treating mental illness effectively is short sighted .

@@94475235 <p> News of severe flooding in Australia is just one more reminder of the ravages of climate change . The affliction and what to do about it , given that the world is not mitigating or adapting fast enough , will be the subject of heated debate at the Conference of the Parties ( COP27 ) in Cairo in November . <p> The scientific evidence strongly suggests that leaving all remaining fossil fuels in the ground is imperative for limiting warming to manageable levels . <p> But at the close of last week 's Africa Energy Week various African energy ministers vowed to speak against this position . Their message was that African countries should not be hindered from monetising their oil and gas reserves . <p> A 2021 article published by Nigerian Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo in Foreign Af ? fairs provides a thorough articulation of what is fast emerging as the united African position in 2022 . Given the minuscule proportion of greenhouse gas emissions that African countries contribute ( less than 4% of the total ) , divestment from fossil fuels -- gaining traction in capital management circles -- is cast as hypocritical and destructive . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Times Africa Summit in London last week by NJ Ayuk , executive chairperson of the African Energy Chamber . His brief was to support the motion that " Africa should ignore the world 's green agenda and make full use of its fossil fuels " . <p> Wealthy countries , whose production and consumption patterns created the environmental destruction with which we all live , now preach from a posture of comfort and affordability . <p> The onus , therefore , rests on wealthy countries to ensure a just transition if they are to meet the 2015 Paris Agreement targets in a way that avoids pushing African countries deeper into poverty , especially in the wake of the inflationary effects of the Russian war in Ukraine and debt difficulties with the United States Federal Reserve 's interest rate hikes . <p> But it is not entirely true that divestment imperatives consistently fail to consider the vital role some fuels play in powering the growth of developing economies , as Osinbajo put it . Nigeria , by way of example , is rich in natural resources but still energy poor . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emissions must not come at the expense of affordable and reliable energy for people , cities , and industry . <p> Less right , though , is the idea that continued reliance on fossil fuels will help to aid such a transition , even if the preference is predominantly for natural gas rather than oil per se . This position was well articulated by James Mwangi , founder of the Climate Action Platform for Africa , at the Financial Times Africa Summit . Mwangi 's position was compelling . <p> Missing from too many just transition analyses is an acknowledgement of why countries like Nigeria and Angola remain energy poor despite being oil wealthy . Both countries failed to translate their prodigious oil wealth into inclusive and sustained development . <p> Clean energy is central to the Nigerian government 's plan to transition to net-zero emissions . The goal to electrify five-million households through the Solar Naija programme by 2023 is admirable . <p> Osinbajo nonetheless contests that Nigeria 's " citizens can not be forced to wait for battery prices to fall or new technologies to be created in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lives " and that gas-fired power remains preferable to renewables in the short run . <p> We address three factors in the debate . <p> l First , solar and wind projects , strategically positioned , need not rely on centralised grid infrastructure . Microgrids should be a major focus for African countries in the years ahead . <p> Precisely because they do not rely on the establishment of expensive transmission grid infrastructure , these systems are ideal for overcoming energy poverty . Centralised grid networks should largely be abandoned in a world that has to wean itself from fossil fuels . Moreover , trying to distribute electricity over vast distances is subject to significant energy ( and rent ) leakage , rendering the system inefficient . <p> While developing countries have concerns over being locked into expensive arrangements entailed in renewable energy projects , innovative arrangements can be found that are less costly than being locked into dirty alternatives . <p> l Second , the pro-gas argument presupposes that gas is cheap and renewables are prohibitively expensive . But all recent research points to the sheer speed of simultaneous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and batteries . A June 2020 report by the University of California , Berkeley , noted that the US could derive 90% of its power without greenhouse gas emissions at lower electricity tariffs . <p> Gas-fired power stations still take a long time to build , and mega-projects of any kind are subject to unproductive rent-seeking . The idea of natural gas as a bridge towards a green economy sounds plausible in theory , but the practical governance risks are material . By the time a gas-fired power station is built , the costs of renewable energy and battery storage will probably have decreased further . <p> l Third , continued investments into fossil fuels -- the exploration , production and burning of them -- have two destructive economic effects . <p> First , it comes at the opportunity cost of allocating resources towards building local industries that can improve and expand renewables . Foregoing the latter risks leaving African countries even further behind their industrialised counterparts . <p> Second , it locks countries into destructive path-dependence because mega-projects typically exhibit sunk-cost fallacies . South Africa 's two newest coal-fired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operational and have incurred significant cost and time overruns . <p> African countries have an opportunity to leapfrog traditional industrialisation paths by tapping into global value chains associated with the transition to clean energy . <p> On the grounds of justice , it is technically true that African countries should not be denied the opportunity to exploit their natural gas reserves . But there are practical moral barriers to such arguments . Past experience , for instance , strongly suggests that fossil fuels are unlikely to suddenly transform energy poverty into wide ? -scale electrification . <p> Justice is ultimately about ensuring that we entrust a better world to our children and grandchildren . The divestment movement provides an opportunity to truncate the negative historical relationship between environmental degradation and income per capita . <p> African countries have vast quantities of minerals and metals that the world requires for the global transport and energy revolutions , along with other new technologies . African countries ' focus should be on exploiting those in ways that develop our capabilities to optimally tap into the global value chains associated with new products such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wind turbines . <p> The idea of justice in the context of an energy transition places a moral imperative on all countries -- developed and developing -- to be assessed under the same rules . At the core of arguments made by Osinbajo and Ayuk is that the approach of developed countries to the energy transition is hypocritical . For instance , Germany and other European countries returned to the use of fossil fuels after Russia 's invasion of Ukraine having previously led the charge to shift away from fossil fuels . <p> Additionally , clean energy does not address the problem of historical emissions , which will continue to affect everyone . Therefore , carbon capture and storage , carbon sequestration and a carbon tax must form part of plans for a global just energy transition . <p> Ultimately , the key to ameliorating the climate change problem lies in exploiting the opportunities involved in clean energy technologies . There is no silver bullet , but countries stuck in fossil fuel dependency need to break the cycle of rent and energy inefficiency . <p> It will be crucial for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taxonomy for the energy transition to bolster the existing rules defined by the 2015 Paris Agreement . <p> It would be a real shame if the conversation at COP27 was orientated around African countries ' " rights " to use their fossil fuels instead of appropriate mechanisms by which to finance a justly attainable low-carbon transition . <p> After all , one can be right and still lose ; we only have one shared planet . <p> Dr Ross Harvey is the director of research and programmes at Good Governance Africa .

Since 2018 , they have lost their star defender Vincent Kompany , Eden Hazard looks half the player he was , Romelu Lukaku has struggled with form and injuries in the last year and players like Dries Mertens and Axel Witsel have moved on from playing at the highest level in club football . <p> Still , there is no side that will take this Belgian side lightly .

Having finished third in 2018 , their experience could play a part in how far they go this time around . <p> Star player <p> Kevin de Bruyne will be the force that drives Belgium forward in this tournament . They usually play him in his favoured number 10 role behind Hazard and Lukaku , and with those two really needing to hit form , it 's impossible to think of a better player than De Bruyne to be feeding them . <p> He has already served up 10 assists for Manchester City in the Premier League this season and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side a game when it is very cagey . <p> If we get a few masterclasses from the magician , the Belgian team could renew the hype in them . <h> Canada <p> What 's their deal ? <p> Canada has only appeared once before at the World Cup . They did n't win a game in 1986 and could face a similar fate in 2022 . <p> Like most international sides , the Canadians enforce a system with three defenders but do n't use their most destructive weapon as a wingback or even a winger . Bayern Munich left back Alphonso Davies is used as a free roamer in this side . He usually starts in the number 10 position and is asked to do a lot more than he is used to . <p> Davies is good technically and proved in the World Cup qualifiers that he is more than comfortable playing so far up the field . <p> However , Canada does leak goals and it might be a task too tough for them to get out of this group . <p> Star player <p> While Davies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a serial killer in front of goal and can hurt any team with his pace , ability to finish with both feet and aerial presence .

They are also a very exciting team to watch . Actually , in modern-day football , any team that lines up in a 442 formation is exciting to watch . <p> The team is built around unity which could see them mount a challenge in this group .

If these players can establish some chemistry , they can really trouble teams down the flanks . <p> This group will also test their defensive steel . Stopping playmakers like Luka Modric and Kevin de Bruyne will not be easy , but if they do manage to stop them and advance , Morocco could go further than anyone expected . <p> Star player <p> Hakimi and Ziyech will be the key men for Morocco down the right . Hakimi 's ability to get forward from right back , coupled with his outrageous pace , will cause a problem for any side with lazy wingers , while Ziyech will provide more technical play finding passes , pushing pinpoint deliveries into the box for their target man Youssef En-Nesyri to attack . <p> Bounou will also be vital in goal .

Here is the original wording , proposed by South African prime minister Jan Smuts . <h> Preamble . <p> We , the United Nations , assembled in Conference to seek a new way of life for the nations , and to prevent a recurrence of the fratricidal strife which has now twice in our generation brought untold sorrows and losses on mankind , and to establish an international organisation to that end : <p> Do hereby declare , in this Charter of the United Nations , our common faith and objects , and the principles on which we seek to found an Organisation for the peace , progress and welfare of mankind . <p> Chapter I. The Common Faith . <p> 1 .

We believe in the enlargement of freedom and the promotion of social progress , and in raising the standards of life , so that there may be freedom of thought and expression and religion , as well as freedom from want and fear for all . <p> 4 . We believe in nations living in peace and peaceful intercourse with each other as good neighbours , and in renouncing war as an instrument of national policy . <p> The final version went through many revisions but maintains the essence of an idealistic call to principles and respect for human rights . <p> " But wait a minute , " you could well say . " Smuts was a white supremacist . So was Churchill , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leader -- and he was also a staunch imperialist . " <p> You can see the original preamble as a document of both great hope and great hypocrisy . <p> ... We hold these truths to be self-evident , that all men are created equal , that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights , that among these are Life , Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness . That to secure these rights , Governments are instituted among Men , deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed ... <p> Leave aside the 18th-century lapse of referring to all genders as men , the hypocrisy in " all men are created equal " being written by a slave owner , Thomas Jefferson , did not prevent these words from later being interpreted in a more inclusive form . <p> So if we draw on the hope with which the UN was created , and move out of the shadow of the hypocrisy of its creators , where does that take us ? <p> The UN Charter in its present form expands on Smuts 's words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as preventing and ending armed conflict and promotion of human rights . <h> Why is n't it working ? <p> Just as Jefferson is no longer around to keep slaves , Smuts , Churchill and others of their era are no longer with us to interpret human rights in an exclusionary way and surely the original UN aim of preventing conflict is just as relevant now as it was in 1945 . <p> The biggest flaw in the way the UN is structured is that the Security Council is the only body that can make binding decisions and the permanent members , China , France , Russia , the United Kingdom and the US , have veto power . This means that if any of them operate in breach of the Charter , nothing can be done through the UN , which results in measures outside the UN , such as sanctions enforced by one of the stronger members . <p> The Security Council was structured that way to take into account the reality of the post-World War II landscape where the allies who beat Hitler were on the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Western powers . China changed status in 1971 when the UN recognised the mainland communist government despite the de facto defeat of its opposition in 1949 .

Why should India , for example , set to become the most populous country in the world next year , not be a permanent member ? Why is no country in Africa or South America a permanent member ? Why does it make sense that a single permanent member can prevent effective action against a violation of the Charter ? Examples include the US war in Iraq and the Russian invasion of Ukraine . Another example is the trashing of the environment by large corporations that sometimes wield more economic power than a small to medium-sized government . <p> Hope : Winston Churchill and Field Marshal Jan Smuts during World War II . Smuts proposed the original wording of the United Nations Charter , drawn up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One approach would be to submit any disputes between states to the International Court of Justice for a binding resolution .

This would require a considerable expansion of its capability and controls on how it was deployed . But would n't this be better than a superpower appointing itself as the world 's police officer ? <p> The veto right of any member should also be reconsidered . Where consensus is not possible , that should not freeze the possibility of an intervention . Because any decision would be open to judicial ratification , this would ease concerns about arbitrary interventions contrary to the Charter . <p> The problems I raise are hard to solve .

@@95093235 <p> There 's an ever-growing interest in bigger family cars and SUVs , which is ironic because there is also a demand for downsizing engines and creating more economical vehicles .

The charges relate to suspect land deals in Mpumalanga , which allegedly saw a farm outside Ermelo bought for R10.5 million and within the hour sold to the government for R36 million . It is alleged that Bongo used some of the money to build himself a house . <p> At the time of the sale , he was the head of legal services in Mpumalanga 's human settlements department . Bongo has been compelled to step aside as member of the legislature . <p> He is considered to be a member of the ruling party 's so-called radical economic transformation faction opposing president @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sometimes in life , when we face enormous challenges , we fail to see that the solution was right there from the start . It is easy to get stuck in old patterns of thinking , but if we use our emotional intelligence and wisdom , and make space for self-reflection and introspection , we can always find solutions to hard problems . <p> South Africa is facing hard problems at the moment and needs to self-reflect . One of the biggest collective challenges facing us is the unprecedented unemployment crisis . The latest employment figures from Statistics South Africa ( StatsSA ) show that more than a third ( 34.5% ) of working-age people in South Africa are unemployed . <p> Furthermore , from more than 10 million young people aged 15-24 years , only 2.5 million are in the labour force and most of them ( 7.7 million or 75.1 % ) are economically inactive because they feel despondent . <p> Every South African can feel the impact and it is easy to become despondent , but what if there was a new way to look at the problem ? What if there was a brilliant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? <p> We already have a powerful economic solution within our reach . <p> One of the biggest overlooked fixes for our unemployment crisis is to harness the economic power of women . Through the ages and in many cultures , including many local cultures , women have been the economic driving force of their communities . For the best part of our recent history , women have been sidelined , and many women were relegated to the role of an employee at best or economic outsider at worst . However , this narrative is changing . <p> We are finally recognising the many fervent women entrepreneurs among us who can add enormous value to our economy . They just need equal opportunities to break into the ecosystem . They do not need handouts -- just a fair chance to contribute . <p> Every industry in this country has supply chains where women can make their mark , bringing incredible local products and services into the market , injecting valuable skills and knowledge transfer into our local ecosystems and creating millions of good jobs . <p> Two recent initiatives got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to remove the structural barriers that hold back especially black women entrepreneurs in South Africa . The first was the government 's Women 's Economic Assembly ( Wecona ) conference where we joined a few sessions . The second was UN Women South Africa 's flagship programme in the Eastern Cape to stimulate equal opportunities for women entrepreneurs . <p> At Wecona , global research was presented that shows that global value chains account for 50% of global trade , and that in developing countries women make up 33.2% of the workforce . <p> President Cyril Ramaphosa in his keynote speech said that by the second quarter of 2022 , 40.7% of South African women aged between 15 to 60 years were recorded as economically inactive . With men , 36% are economically inactive . Poverty is officially higher among women , and particularly among black women . That is just a shame , because we all know how formidable women can be . <h> Targets to right old wrongs <p> At Wecona , the target was set to count and record all the women-owned businesses in every industry so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ private sector supply chains . To put words into action , the government set a 40% preferential procurement target from women-owned businesses . <p> So , now all our boss women have a chance to make use of preferential procurement in our supply chains and transform the South African economy . If we can bring a lot more women into our economic ecosystems , we can expand the scope of the economy , increase productivity and create millions of rippling economic opportunities across our society . <p> However , to get there , we must create the demand , incentives and skills for both the public and private sectors to meet those targets . Businesses and government departments need to grasp and think about the importance of actively sourcing from women -- whether it be in tech , agriculture , the automotive industry , transport and logistics , tourism , fast-moving consumer goods , food and beverages , renewable energy , engineering or any other industry . And then they need to learn how to actually do it by educating themselves on what preferential procurement entails and how to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conference that the government 's departments can not address all the socio-economic challenges in South Africa by themselves -- they need firm partnerships with the private sector and clear pathways to meet their targets . <p> It is great to see so many windows of opportunity opening up -- but let us get real , many women entrepreneurs are perceived not to have the skills and knowledge on how to grab preferential procurement opportunities , and those that should procure from them also often create unnecessary barriers and excuses on why they should not get opportunities . <p> The broad-based black economic empowerment ( B-BBEE ) codes of good practice provide an incentive , through points , to procure from black women-owned companies , yet most buyers do not prioritise these . They focus more on the B-BBEE level rather than on the diversification of suppliers . <p> There is a huge skills gap when it comes to empowerment practitioners having a clear understanding of how the B-BBEE codes should be implemented , and how to match such opportunities where they are needed . We need to address this issue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ path for women entrepreneurs <p> How can we help women entrepreneurs to access more opportunities ? We have three very practical suggestions to offer . <p> Firstly , we must establish , support and source from companies owned by black women with a particular focus on those from underdeveloped areas . Our 100% black South African women-owned businesses need enterprise development and supplier development support . This allows for more localisation as small businesses have an opportunity to become part of supply chains . This support must be directed to areas that are identified , through a needs analysis , as developmental gaps and need not only be in the form of training , conferences , networking opportunities , mentoring programmes or other shortcut creative endeavours . <p> Secondly , we need to prioritise preferential procurement as an economy and a society . Did you know that globally , one-third of businesses are owned by women but women only get about 1% of the procurement spend of large corporations ? Our corporations need to step up their supplier game in a big way to create more opportunities for women suppliers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to medium size black-owned businesses , which again supports job creation , and then they need to learn how to implement this focus . Preferential procurement can have a fast and lasting impact in helping black businesses and their suppliers and customers to grow . It is a living ecosystem where everyone grows and co-creates together . B-BBEE and inclusive and responsible value chain programmes provide a platform and rationale for inclusive supply chains , especially including women-owned companies and key players . <p> Businesses and beneficiaries need to work together to ensure that value chains can be optimised to benefit the business . By doing so , the business becomes more productive and competitive . <p> The third solution we need to prioritise as a society is strategic partnerships . A few of these strategic partners were speakers at the Wecona breakaway sessions and they provided solutions to some of the challenges being faced within each of their sectors . For instance , we are currently working with the South African Tourism Services Association and women in 3D printing to implement some amazing initiatives . <p> We are also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the automotive industry -- which , we can tell you , is no longer just a man 's world . Estimated to be a R400 billion industry , black women-owned businesses have the potential to take up 30% of the shareholding . Therefore , we are excited to see how the six goals of the South African Automotive Master Plan 2035 come to life in the near future . <p> These are 1 ) to grow South African vehicle production to 1% of global production ( more than 1.4 million vehicles per year ) , 2 ) to increase local content on assembled vehicles to 60% , 3 ) to double employment in the auto value chain , 4 ) to improve competitiveness to match international best practices , 5 ) to transform the value chain and make it more inclusive , and 6 ) to deepen value addition through innovation . These are strategic in including black women which can ultimately help with job creation . <h> An open invitation to change the status quo <p> To address the exclusion of women from value chains , we continue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The goal is to open up opportunities for women under ownership , enterprise and supplier development and even socio-economic development . <p> We invite all industries to join us . Together we can create very real pathways for women across all the industries and value chains of our economy . The collaborative opportunities are endless . <p> We need to get very serious and very practical about creating a society and economy where we do not just pay lip service to women 's economic empowerment . We need to stop limiting procurement from women to corporate social investment initiatives or tick-box exercises . <p> Women are just as serious about business as men , just as good at business as men , and just as capable of delivering the world-class goods , services and jobs that our economy so desperately needs . There is no reason why we can not crack the economy wide open for women before the turn of the decade . <p> Join us , then we will do it together . <h> The views expressed are those of the author and do not reflect the official @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @

It 's great to be able to find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important to limit the time spent in hay triage along the way . <h> As the research paper points out : <p> " Low-quality and misleading information online can hijack people 's attention , often by evoking curiosity , outrage , or anger . Resisting certain types of information and actors online requires people to adopt new mental habits that help them avoid being tempted by attention-grabbing and potentially harmful content . We argue that digital information literacy must include the competence of critical ignoring -- choosing what to ignore and where to invest one 's limited attentional capacities . <p> " We review three types of cognitive strategies for implementing critical ignoring : self-nudging , in which one ignores temptations by removing them from one 's digital environments ; lateral reading , in which one vets information by leaving the source and verifying its credibility elsewhere online ; and the do-not-feed-the-trolls heuristic , which advises one to not reward malicious actors with attention . We argue that these strategies implementing critical ignoring should be part of school curricula on digital information literacy . <p> " Teaching the competence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , from a sole focus on the power and promise of paying close attention to an additional emphasis on the power of ignoring . Encouraging students and other online users to embrace critical ignoring can empower them to shield themselves from the excesses , traps , and information disorders of today 's attention economy . " <p> Rather than seeing it as a pure negative -- a missing drawer in the cabinet of your brain -- more recent work has focused on the benefits , even the necessity of strategic ignorance . There is , after all , too much to know ; the choice to learn X is also a choice to ignore Y and Z. You just have to get good at picking the right X. <h> The paper 's authors continue : <p> " Much effort has been invested in repurposing the notion of critical thinking -- that is , ' thinking that is purposeful , reasoned , and goal-directed ' -- from its origins in education to the online world . For example , Andrew Zucker , addressing the National Science Teachers Association in 2019 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is imperative that science teachers help students use critical thinking to examine claims they see , hear , or read that are not based on science ' . <p> " As important as the ability to think critically continues to be , we argue that it is insufficient to borrow the tools developed for offline environments and apply them to the digital world . When the world comes to people filtered through digital devices , there is no longer a need to decide what information to seek . Instead , the relentless stream of information has turned human attention into a scarce resource to be seized and exploited by advertisers and content providers . <p> " Investing effortful and conscious critical thinking in sources that should have been ignored in the first place means that one 's attention has already been expropriated . Digital literacy and critical thinking should therefore include a focus on the competence of critical ignoring : choosing what to ignore , learning how to resist low-quality and misleading but cognitively attractive information , and deciding where to invest one 's limited attentional capacities . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ academics use to mean " the conscious choice to ignore information even when the costs of obtaining it are negligible . " ( Avoiding spoilers is a kind of deliberate ignorance , you see . ) <p> The paper 's authors define " critical ignoring " more narrowly , as : <p> " ... a type of deliberate ignorance that entails selectively filtering and blocking out information in order to control one 's information environment and reduce one 's exposure to false and low-quality information . This competence complements conventional critical-thinking and information-literacy skills , such as finding reliable information online , by specifying how to avoid information that is misleading , distractive , and potentially harmful . <p> " It is only by ignoring the torrent of low-quality information that people can focus on applying critical search skills to the remaining now-manageable pool of potentially relevant information .

The authors outline this schema of tactics targeting three different genres of mis- , dis- , or malinformation : distracting/low-quality info , false/misleading info , and everyone 's favourite , trolls . <p> The first , " self-nudging " , is basically about impulse control -- the information equivalent of a diet book that tells you not to leave potato chips sitting around on your kitchen counter , lest you be tempted . Think of it as media mindfulness . <h> The paper 's authors explain : <p> " Using extensively studied mechanisms of interventions , such as positional effects ( such as making healthy food options more accessible in a supermarket or a cafeteria ) , defaults ( such as making data privacy a default setting ) , or social norms , the self-nudger redesigns choice architectures to prompt behavioural change .

In a study by Hunt Allcott and others " The Welfare Effects of Social Media " , participants who were incentivized to deactivate their Facebook accounts for 1 month gained on average about 60 min per day for offline activities , a gain that was associated with small increases in subjective well-being . Reduced online activity also modestly decreased factual knowledge of political news ( but not political participation ) , as well as political polarisation ( but not affective polarisation ) . <p> " As this study shows , there are trade-offs between potential gains ( such as time for offline activities ) and losses ( such as potentially becoming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of self-nudging , however , is not to optimise information consumption , but rather to offer a range of measures that can help people regain control of their information environments and align those environments with their goals , including goals regarding how to distribute their time and attention among different competing sources ( for example friends on social media and friends and family offline ) . " <p> Lateral reading is familiar turf to readers of Wineburg 's earlierwork .

South Africa has one of the world 's highest incidences of domestic violence . Every day women are murdered , physically and sexually abused , threatened and humiliated by their partners . It is not only women who are abused , but children and sometimes men as well . Domestic violence is not only limited to heterosexual partners but also occurs in same-sex relationships . <p> Domestic violence is a pattern of abusive behaviour that transgresses one 's right to be free from violence . When one partner in a relationship harms the other to obtain or maintain power and control over them , regardless of whether they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is domestic violence .

An application may also be brought by a person who has a material interest in the well-being of the complainant . When a complainant brings a domestic violence case to court , they are referred to as the Applicant , and the person against whom the protection order is sought is referred to as the Respondent . Such an application is heard in camera ( in private ) , meaning that the parties give their evidence with no public in the court gallery . <p> The court will consider the Applicant 's application for a protection order , and if the court is satisfied that there is sufficient evidence that the Respondent is committing an act of domestic violence , and the Applicant may suffer undue hardship if an interim order is not granted , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grants an interim order , it will direct the Respondent not to commit acts of domestic violence against the Applicant .

If the Respondent breaches or disobeys the terms of the protection order , then Applicant can go to the South African Police Services ( SAPS ) , who can use that arrest warrant to arrest the Respondent . The police have a significant role to play when it comes to domestic violence . They have a duty to protect victims of domestic violence , and the Domestic Violence Act describes their duties .

@@95348230 <p> Freedom Under Law ( FUL ) has raised several concerns about the composition , operation and performance of the Judicial Service Commission ( JSC ) .

The report can be read here . -- Michael Appel <p> So what the South African system does is : we 've developed a body called the Judicial Service Commission , and they represent all the different arms of government , as well as legal practitioners and academics . And it 's designed to be an all-inclusive body that , when functioning properly , is is a better way of involving everyone in the appointment of judges . <p> On the performance of the JSC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things we found in the report is that there seems to be a bit of an imbalance as regards political appointees .

So there does seem to be a little bit of a disjunct between the people who are selecting judges and the kind of experience and background they have . We 've also repeatedly seen recent instances of political interference in the interview process that has been quite highly publicised . <p> On the failure of the JSC to produce annual reports and its lack of transparency <p> As a researcher this is probably the most telling point for me because when we set about to do what I initially thought would be a relatively simple task of compiling a list of who had served on the commission , a list of who they 'd interviewed and where the list of the annual reports was , we realised that this information was just not available . To the extent that it was available , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it on the Department of Justice website , some of it on the office of the Chief Justice 's website . There 's no central repository for any of that information . And I think the fact that they 've failed to file annual reports is symptomatic of kind of a twofold problem . The first is either lack of capacity to prepare and publish , or that there is no appetite to comply with the constitutional obligation of openness . I think it 's a combination of those things . We 've definitely addressed the fact , and the report repeatedly states that there seems to be quite a severe problem of lack of capacity , I think specifically with dealing with complaints against judges and making information available . <p> On 26 nominated candidates withdrawing from JSC interviews <p> I think it 's a huge problem . I think that that 's the primary issue at the moment with the way that the interviews are conducted . People just are n't willing to put themselves through what can sometimes be quite a huge public embarrassment . I mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adverse comments or issues that they 've had no notice of or no warning about and that 's being pressed or completely unfounded allegations that seem to be repeated to them . We have detailed those instances within the report , but I think people just are n't willing to do it . And if we know that there are at least 26 instances of people withdrawing after being nominated and being selected for an interview , we can assume that the real number of people refusing to even put their names forward for consideration for an interview is even higher .

Peron explores how poverty , famine and death deteriorate as global trade rises and exposes how life expectancy , despite the pandemic , continues to increase . The depoliticised market seems to benefit all participants -- not merely a sole champion . Read about his thoughts in the piece below . -- Carmen Mileder <h> Markets are not games where only one can win <p> By James Peron* <p> I once received a rebuttal to a piece I wrote about economics . Much of it was n't precisely clear to me but one obvious point was the author 's view regarding how she thought markets operated . She compared economics to the board game of Monopoly , asserting there can only be one winner when all is said and done . I understood her point but was baffled as to why she thought a global market with billions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ winner and everyone else lost . Perhaps , instead of one person , she meant one group , one nation or some single collective body . Regardless of what she meant , her point was markets limit winners and expand the number of losers . <p> However , given the general rise in income levels , I 'm unsure where she gets her information . As is so typical , she made assertions but cited no sources . The problem is most actual authorities on the topic say both extreme poverty and famine have dramatically declined . There is n't much validity in comparing the intricacies of life to a simplistic board game ; designed so only one person can win . <p> Regularly I see ads for people in my area offering all sorts of items they own for sale . Buyers see an item they want , at a price they think is reasonable , and buy it . If they did n't think it reasonable , they would n't make the exchange . The seller is happy , and the buyer is happy . Both won by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ professor , in a religious ethics class , who was on a rampage about the evils of markets . He even had a mandatory board game designed to prove his point that we students were required to play . Each of us represented a nation and the game was rigged so any one nation winning always came at the expense of everyone else . In the game there were no mutually beneficial trades . When one nation won , the others collapsed into famine and death . <p> One clear refutation to this theory of markets leading to poverty , famine and death is that all three have declined with globalisation , instead of increasing . The more trade in the real world the less poverty , famine and death we find . <p> We should note the Covid virus kills people , which also kills prosperity , but in spite of that , extreme poverty has continued to fall , albeit at a slower pace after a one year rise . The New York Times last December reported : <p> By 2015 , the share of the world 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 36 percent in 1990 , a steep decline in just two and a half decades . During a single generation , more than a billion people around the world climbed out of extreme poverty .... <p> The World Bank said the impact of the virus " led to 97 million more people being in poverty in 2020 than 2019 . " This took severe poverty levels back to what they were in 2015 . But they said that 2021 poverty rates should resume the downward trend again . <p> When it came to life expectancy before Covid we found people globally were living longer lives , not shorter ones . The World Health Organization said , " Globally , life expectancy has increased by more than 6 years between 2000 and 2019 -- from 66.8 years in 2000 to 73.4 years in 2019 . " <p> From the 1950s until recently , much of the world liberalised their economies , relying more on private initiative and less on politically controlled markets . Our World in Data put global life expectancy in 1950 at 45.7 years . By 2019 , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while it liberalised in some ways -- such as the abolition of apartheid era regulations , also stubbornly refused liberalisation in massive swaths of the economy -- Telkom , SAA , Transnet , and Eskom , for example . In 1950 South Africa 's life expectancy was 43.6 years , lagging the world by just 2.1 years , but in 2019 global life expectancy was 72.6 years while in South Africa it was 64.1 years ; the life expectancy gap grew from 2.1 years to 8.5 years . Bad policies resulted in making South Africa less prosperous and with less prosperity life expectancy -- while growing -- grew much more slowly . <p> In the actual world , if a trade is voluntary , it is n't made unless it is mutually beneficial . There can be involuntary trades but those require the use of political coercion to force participants in the exchange to act against their own interests . But that is n't a free , or depoliticized market ; it 's what politicians impose . <p> Games are invented to create a winner , while depoliticized markets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sprint where the first across the line wins . Its purpose is getting as many people across the line as possible and who gets there first is n't as important as getting the other participants to the finish line . <p> *James Peron , president of the Moorfield Storey Institute and author of several books , including Exploding Population Myths and The Liberal Tide , is a contributing author for the Free Market Foundation .

So I 'm a big proponent of going to see for myself . I want to be part of the solution for this . And one of the things I wanted to do was to engage with the officials at Kusile to understand whether the excuses we keep being given about why things are not working there , why the thing 's over budget , why it 's way overdue in terms of the time and why it 's not producing enough electricity . I wanted to find out firsthand from them what was going on .

Well , I think we 're sitting at over R200 billion and we 're still sitting with the thing not working . And , as I said , it is a monument to the failed ideology of the government and of the department . And if we 're looking to Kusile and Medupi as the model to get us out of the crisis , I think we should be very worried if that 's what government 's clinging to , because it 's not going to get us out of the crisis we 're in . <p> On selling electricity back into the grid <p> It was a great plan , but the reality is it 's not being implemented . And the man that he tasked with implementing the plan happens to be on some mysterious trip to Russia yet again .

But the reality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ implemented and we 're running a tracker on our website which looks at just how much of that plan has been implemented and what has n't . The easiest one is allowing people to sell into the grid , but municipalities have to then be empowered to work out price points and to work out a measure to be able to re-compensate people for what they put into the grid or offset it against their current bill . And that remains in place . They are still required to get the permission of the national minister before they can go out and do that , and that is an arduous process . So I think there 's still far too much red tape . And when it comes to government 's restrictions , these things like localisation , preferential procurement , etc. are not helping .

@@95396230 <h> The scandal that looks set to sink Ramaphosa <p> President Cyril Ramaphosa has become embroiled in a scandal almost five years after he took office with a pledge to fight corruption . The bizarre case began in 2020 with the theft of cash that robbers had found stuffed into a sofa at his game farm . A panel headed by the former chief justice found there may be grounds for impeaching Ramaphosa because of the way he handled the matter . The crisis risks scuppering the 70-year-old leader 's political career and adds to the woes of a country that 's contending with unprecedented power outages , rampant unemployment and surging living costs . <h> 1 . What 's Ramaphosa alleged to have done ? <p> The furour erupted in June when Arthur Fraser , the former chief spy , laid criminal charges against Ramaphosa , accusing the president of concealing the theft of more than US$4-million from the farm in northern Limpopo in February 2020 . Fraser said the suspected thieves were illegally detained and interrogated by presidential security staff . Opposition parties questioned why Ramaphosa had so much cash lying around his home and whether he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the graft ombudsman , South African Revenue Service and the Reserve Bank all began investigations . Parliament appointed a three-member advisory panel headed by former chief justice Sandile Ngcobo to determine if MPs should examine whether there were grounds for Ramaphosa 's dismissal . <h> 2 . What did Ngcobo 's panel find ? <p> While it did n't explicitly call for the president to be impeached , it found that he may be guilty of serious misconduct and should be subjected to a parliamentary investigation . It said Ramaphosa had " thrust himself into a situation where there was a conflict of interest between his official responsibilities as the head of state and as a businessperson " . It also concluded that the source of the stolen foreign currency remained unclear , that the crime was n't properly reported to the police and that there was a " deliberate intention " to ensure that it was n't openly investigated . <h> 3 . What does Ramaphosa say ? <p> In a 138-page submission to the panel , he declared that $580 000 he earned from the sale of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in late 2019 while he was in Ethiopia attending an African Union summit . The farm manager initially stored the money in a safe , but later transferred it to a sofa in a spare bedroom in the president 's private house because he thought it was the safest place to keep it , according to Ramaphosa . He said he reported the theft to the head of the Presidential Protection Service . The president denied all the allegations against him , saying he never violated his presidential oath or broke the law . <h> 4 . What happens next ? <p> Ramaphosa may resign of his own accord . If he does n't , the leadership of the ANC is likely to make the next move . It can either reject the panel 's report and instruct its lawmakers to vote against adopting it at a parliamentary sitting scheduled for 6 December , or approve it and give the green light for a parliamentary inquiry . In that case , a panel of MPs would be constituted to reassess the case against the president , a process that could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be presented to the national assembly , which would vote on how to proceed . Impeaching the president would require the backing of two-thirds of MPs . There 's also the possibility that the police could lay criminal charges against Ramaphosa which , under ANC rules , would force him to step down . If he does quit , he 's likely to be replaced by his deputy , David Mabuza , until the national assembly elects a replacement . <h> 5 .

@@95396233 <h> How to build a digital Africa that is more inclusive and accessible <p> The digital divide in Africa has generated considerable controversy . As they should be , access and skills are frequent topics of discussion because digital inclusion will surely have a substantial effect on the economy of Africa . <p> A digital economy provides numerous benefits . A significant one is fostering resilience during difficult times , such as an unanticipated pandemic or global recession . <p> In this article , we speak with industry experts and ask them what they think it means to build a more inclusive digital Africa . <p> Enable everyone to become an entrepreneur <p> " The pandemic has given us a chance to reset and to reimagine a more inclusive digital economy that promotes accessibility , and enables anyone to become an entrepreneur , " says Velma Corcoran , regional lead for the Middle East and Africa at Airbnb . <p> Corcoran says that to drive a genuinely inclusive tourism economy , Airbnb is breaking down the barriers to becoming a tourism entrepreneur , investing in infrastructure that will allow people to connect to Airbnb ' ' s global network @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Johannesburg , and reinvesting in the next generation to ensure anyone , anywhere , can benefit from tourism . <p> Strategic partnerships foster digital inclusion <p> The provision of technology plays a crucial role in upskilling people and improving digital access , says Andrew Bourne , Regional Manager , Zoho Africa . " Digital transformation will enable businesses to provide products and services at the enterprise level . We also need strategic partnerships that encourage tech companies to partner with the government and other businesses to sponsor startups so that they have access to the technology that they need to grow and thrive . " <p> Include consumers into the financial system <p> Ricki Allardice , Head of Product at the cryptocurrency and micro-saving and investing app Upnup , believes that " people are excluded from the financial system for two major reasons : they are not able to get access to credit or their incomes are unable to keep pace with inflation . It thus follows that the poor are largely financially excluded and will remain that way as long as inflation remains high and they are unable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if they are able to save a meagre amount of money , inflation gobbles up their gains and puts them in a worse position than when they started , and as a result , there is an incentive to spend money rather than save it , because saving is futile in an environment where inflation is higher than interest rates . " <p> The belief is that Bitcoin has the ability to turn this on its head . With nobody on earth being able to change the rate at which Bitcoin is mined , the generation of new bitcoin follows a predetermined , predictable path . This means that the poor are able to save small amounts into Bitcoin and , if they hold for long enough , will see their purchasing power increase . This comes without the additional risk of having to invest their savings in a business , fund , or other investment . All they have to do is hold onto their bitcoin . <p> " Upnup sees Bitcoin as paving the way to financial inclusion because politics can be removed from the equation and users @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their time : Bitcoin , " Allardice concludes . <p> Connecting African consumers to the global digital economy <p> The proliferation of technology has been largely dependent on the democratisation of these new and exciting innovations with the aim of achieving access for all . Similarly , the digitisation of payments that would normally cost individuals and organisations time and money has become crucial for financial inclusion . <p> Recognising this , MFS Africa , a leading digital payments hub in Africa , works continuously with trusted global partners across the continent to connect African consumers to each other and to the global digital economy . <p> Whether you 're a young entrepreneur in the merchant marketplace , require access to collect loan repayments from customers , or need to send bulk payments , MFS Africa strives to continuously connect senders , recipients , and service providers across the continent . The organisation 's full-service digital payments network connects over 400 million mobile money wallets and over 200 million bank accounts across Africa , and over 200,000 agents in Nigeria , to enable cross-platform and cross-border payments for remittance companies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and global merchants . <h> Connect <h> Partners <p> We use cookies on our website to give you the most relevant experience by remembering your preferences and repeat visits .
