@@4512231 <h> Lifestyle <h> Donovan ' Does ' Yoga <h> HEALTH &amp; WELL-BEING <p> I recently have become inspired by Donovan Manning , Master Yoga and Pilates Instructor , to begin exploring a practice in Yoga . Last week , I decided to interview him and get a closer look inside the world of a true Yogi . Here 's what he had to share . <p> 1 ) What does teaching Yoga / Pilates bring to you and to your life ? <p> Whenever I teach before a class or a client , it is a great humbling experience to lead and to know that these individuals have trusted me to do so . To lead them into poses that will ease their mind , strengthen their muscles and heal their bodies is a great contribution to their lives and it brings me a sense of reward and peaceful responsibility in knowing how much I bring to them and that they choose me to help them to achieve this . <p> 2 ) What inspired you to get trained and do what you do ? ( give a little background on your training ) <p> Yoga is not an overnight certification process . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't inspired to teach , I only wanted to be taught and was just going through the motions . The saying , ' I came to you , Yoga , to stretch and ended up living ' held fast here . <p> I did n't know back then that being a teacher means always being the student . It was one day Sonita Abrahams , the Director for Afya , saw my practice in class and asked me why I do n't teach . I hesitated at first then Stephen Shawnaar , my best friend , dared me to become certified . And I did it . Within six months I did my Pilates certification and started my yoga training . I am currently mat-certified by American Fitness Professonal Association and Reformer certified by David Brown . Then I had class with Master instructors such as Rod Stryker , Pagan , Amrit Yogi Desai , and other international instructors . I am certified by Yoga Angels , an international yoga certification programme based in Los Angeles that is owned and operated by Subhadra Bowman where I still continue with certification @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How does what you do benefit people ? <p> I use my talent in a therapeutic way to teach people to listen to their bodies through a physical practice . But also on a more spiritual and psychological level , it brings a sense of peace , and literally slows down one 's mind , movements and actions : something that is termed mindfulness through movement meditation . The clarity and peace that comes from this state is invaluable for people 's perspective on living . To provide the space and the discipline that it takes for people to pull themselves from their madness and the pace and weight of their lives , to pull them into this state , is a gift that I give to my students every day . <p> In yoga therapy , it is said that the muscles in the body hold and store tension , negative energy and stress . By mindfully breathing and stretching we focus our attention on breathe and release , in turn , easing the muscles and stress , thereby , leaving the person relaxed , contented and in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you feel you have helped others ? <p> A sense of accomplishment to me is seeing a client/ person before class with brows knitted , limping and wincing and then spending little over an hour with me , to leave smiling , walking upright and literally floating on cloud nine after class to have a great night 's sleep . Or saying to me that they have been in discomfort for the past such and such a time and this is the only time they get relief . <p> I aspire to use my talent to effectively heal , ease and inspire those who need it most . I believe that people should not stop living just because of a physical or emotional uneasiness ! Where this takes me , I do n't know , but I have picked up on a scent , so to speak , and I am following it . <p> 5 ) Draw a picture of what it looks like when you are in a hard pose and what comes out of holding and breathing . What do you get out of the " challenging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is steady and my body is ready to delve into a new pose . A pose that challenges me to not only balance on my arms , but through space and life . Physically , I know the pose strengthens my muscles , promotes equilibrium and stamina and brings freedom to the breath . <p> Having the weight on the arms allows for the bones in the legs , arms and spine to be fully activated . <p> Knowing that balancing brings a steadier mind , as I fall out of the pose , I pick back up and try again even holding it for a few seconds . By learning to stay balanced and focused in the pose I am bringing awareness into my life , on and off the mat . <p> In dwi pada koundianyanasa ( two-legged arm balance ) this is what comes up for me : Being present , aware and I smile . <p> I love back bends , they allow me to open my heart fully to whatever the universe has in store for me while remaining rooted in earth , strong , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back bends when I am upset , hurt or in a space of uncertainty in my life . <p> On a physiological level these poses open up the central nervous system and hence energise the whole body . They help to alleviate headaches , hypertension ( high blood pressure ) and nervous exhaustion , as well as enhancing the functioning of the endocrine system , the kidneys , pancreas and liver . Energetically these poses create opening and space for the breath to move freely and therefore lighten the mind . <p> Sometimes after coming out of dwi pada viparita dandasana ( two-legged inverted staff pose ) , I would cry from the release and opening I get . Knowing that everything is as it should be and that what life gifts me with , with my flexible spine , I can move though the labyrinth of life . <p> When I see students struggle in a pose it tends to mean that they muscle their way through life . I would come by then and say , " Let 's try again , " offering support . It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gentle touch offers a sense of security and it allows the virtue of trust to blossom . As adults we do have the ability to trust , but being hurt so many times , we lock our hearts up and close off to the world of miracles and opportunity out there just ready for us . <p> A challenging concept for me as a professional in my field is the ignorance of other medical professionals who have n't experienced what Yoga and Pilates have to offer . They have the amazing benefits of strengthening the body , by improving precision in muscle control , strength and flexibility , and they enhance circulation , hence accelerating the healing process up to twice as fast . <p> 6 ) Why do you practise on your own ( what do you get ? ) <p> To stop and explore oneself , the body , mind and emotions in a decisive , caring and significant way , which is safe , secure and fun is probably the best gift you can give to yourself . You have to be ready to be brave , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and experience the liberation of you . <p> I practise what I preach ! I get to come face to face with my personal issues and challenges and it takes me on a journey on the mat . For example , I always know when I have emotional issues . My hips literally seize up . In Yoga , it is said that the hip is a storage house for the emotions . So if I move into a pose during my personal practice that requires me to move through the hip joint , and I feel tightness in the joint , I am like , oh yes ! I end up going through my issues , and say to myself , " Let 's explore what 's going on here " . You must be brave and breathe through it . It will ease , it will open up . It always does . And knock on wood , after about two days I am like , " Wow , I have passed through and I am alive . " <p> So to answer your question , I get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I get release and I get a safe , secure place to enjoy me . <p> Yoga and Pilates are techniques that require patience , practice , determination and respect with self , and then it will ripple to others . If I am with a client who is impatient with him or herself , I am charged with the responsibility to reassure him/her that 's it 's okay to be where you are . Be present , I always tell them . Just feel it . Always reassuring them in a calm , loving manner . Then I always finish by saying , " Release and move on ! " Hence in the classes I teach , my style is to keep people moving , " Move through the poses , yes stop , look , listen . Go inside and feel , now move on .

@@4515233 <h> Children in West Kingston 's trauma <p> Children who have been hemmed in - first by gunmen loyal to Christopher Coke and then by the security forces - look out from behind a grille to their home in Tivoli Gardens . - Rudolph Brown/Photographer <p> 1 <p> 2 <p> 3 <p> Peta-Anne Baker , Contributor <p> An unintended and potentially beneficial consequence of the events of the past week could be to build consensus about the need to be more strategic in our approach to early childhood development ( ECD ) . A little over a week ago , the Early Childhood Commission ( ECC ) conducted a review of its five year strategic plan . The plan is a well-researched blueprint that demonstrates an excellent technical grasp of the fact that providing for children in their earliest years requires a multidisciplinary , interagency approach . As our knowledge about the impact of the exposure to violence on the brains of young children has expanded , our valuation of early childhood development has been enhanced . <p> Professor Maureen Samms-Vaughn , chairman of the ECC , did a persuasive presentation showing how central early childhood development was , not just to the future @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a nation . Citing international research , she demonstrated that the highest rate of return on an investment in early childhood development was its impact on reducing crime and violence . <p> Here , however , is the rub . Although the Jamaican government , private sector , churches and community residents have all been working diligently to improve provisions for our youngest children , the events of this past week forcefully demonstrate how readily setbacks can occur and how urgent the task is . <p> Two years ago , the ECC set out to register and ultimately licence the early childhood institutions ( ECIs ) in Jamaica . To date , it has established a relationship with some 1,800 of the more than 2,700 ECIs . I have to say " established a relationship " because , despite all its hard work , the ECC has not yet been able to authorise a single licence ( although several hundred permits have been issued ) . Why ? Because some of the agencies responsible for parts of the certification of these institutions lack the basic means to perform their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ responsibility for the ECC can not be faulted for his commitment to the sector . He talks the perfect talk . However , endemic violence and criminality is only one of the factors influencing the likelihood that he will not be able to walk the walk . Another consideration is the administration 's laudable commitment to reducing the size of the public debt , involving among other things the containment of its recurrent expenditures . Another less obvious but possibly more significant consideration is the almost religious commitment to a model of service delivery that is incapable of achieving much less sustaining the advances set forth in the ECC 's National Strategic Plan . <p> How will the early childhood sector deal with the approximately 2,500 children from one to four years old in the communities of Tivoli Gardens , Denham Town , Fletchers Land and Hannah Town who have seen and heard last week 's events ? Much of what they would have witnessed would not be new . These are communities in which , according to the 2001 census , between one third and a half of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ households where a member had been a victim of some kind of criminal violence . However , the scale of this latest experience is another matter . <p> We can not be sanguine that the West Kingston scenario will not be recreated in other communities in the rest of the Corporate Area and urban centres across this island . The majority of households in these communities are headed by women in low-wage jobs ; in some instances the household head is an older person . In too high a proportion of cases , these young children are already encountering unacceptable levels of exposure to criminal and state violence . <p> ELEPHANTS IN THE ROOM <p> There are no guidance counsellors , social workers or psychologists in the basic schools in West Kingston or anywhere else for that matter . The ECC plan does have a proposal for training and appointing a child development specialist for each parish . This specialist would be the person to whom cases of children with developmental or behavioural disorders would be referred . The Ministry of Health , where they would be employed , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Finance , however , with the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) looking over its shoulder , can not say when the funds needed to implement this plan will actually become available . Early childhood institutions in West Kingston could use three or four of the fourteen proposed specialists immediately . <p> Despite its stated goal of having a " fully resourced early childhood sector " , the ECC 's plan does not rest on an entirely sound footing . This is glaringly apparent with regards to the status of early childhood educators and ECD practitioners . The average basic school teacher , having done as she was encouraged to do and completed the NCTVET Training for Early Childhood workers , will find that she could still be taking home the $16,000 per month she was getting before she did her training . <p> If she has the good fortune to work in an early childhood institution that caters to lower-middle and middle-class children , she may be lucky to get as much as $25,000 per month .

This will mean that we will need more practitioners than who currently work in the sector . The question is , how and what will they be paid ? Despite oft repeated reservations about the assumption that parents and ' communities ' can raise enough money to adequately compensate the professionals who work in the early childhood sector , the ECC has held firmly to this position . We can not be surprised when these workers eventually take their skills into a more lucrative market . <p> The ECD strategy is completely silent on whether and how the majority stakeholders , parents and other primary caregivers will ever come to influence the agenda of the sector . There are the standard proposals for ' parent support ' programmes , to ' help ' parents perform their functions more effectively . There is no proposal for the development of strong , parent-led organisations capable of not just helping to manage individual institutions , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a whole . <p> Get the elephants One of the legislated functions of the ECC is to advise the Cabinet on ECD policy and to analyse the resource needs of the sector and make recommendations for allocations from the budget . The ECC must interpret this role to include mobilising currently excluded actors like parents , teachers and community leaders to aid in shaping its goals and devising the strategies whereby they will be achieved . <p> The ECC and the Ministry of Education need to act now to reduce practitioner-student ratios in the most vulnerable communities . The government must assume responsibility for paying teachers and caregivers in these institutions as part of its portfolio of interventions targeted at the most vulnerable . The ECC needs to make sure that their newly hired development officers know how to mobilise principals , parents and community organisations not just to organise a fund-raising fish fry , but also to develop and advocate for their vision for the sector .

A sustained and integrated process of restoration is going to be needed in West Kingston and other high-risk environments . It will be a process that is going to call for high levels of ingenuity and dedication . <p> Strategic investments in the early childhood sector can help not only to address some of the short-term impacts of recent events , but can also lay down a foundation to reduce , if not prevent , the potential for their recurrence in a few short years .

Yes , there will be some signs , like the ones listed below . <p> How he treats his mother : The way a man treats other women , his sisters and especially his mother will speak volumes about the kind of person that he really is . If he treats his mother with disdain , chances are he does n't know any better . If he does not have the know-how or the finesses to be gentle with a lady , he will not be able to pretend for long .

If a man gets really upset and nasty on the road , even for minor offences and if he is always rude and boisterous to other motorists , how can you overlook this ? The character that one displays when he/she is angry is a good indicator of the type of person you are with . <p> How he solves conflicts : A gentleman should be able to solve conflicts without exhibiting any rude or disrespectful behaviour . He should be able to listen , communicate and understand , even when dealing with disagreeable subjects . If he is going to rant and rave , or get mad and ugly just because he is annoyed , upset or working through a conflict , you tell me , is he a gentleman ? <p> How he speaks : Listen carefully when he is speaking .

Look at how he keeps himself ; it does n't take lots of money to be neat , clean , and well groomed . A gentleman will take pride in his grooming . <p> How courteous he is : Does he say , " Please " , " I am sorry " , and " Thank you " ?

They are also eyeing government ministries as the next frontier . <p> Government departments , Holland notes , could save as much as 50 per cent on associated real-estate costs , plus more from improved efficiencies , by outsourcing paper-information storage . <p> Holland is of British and Jamaican backgrounds . <p> He returned to Jamaica in 2001 to work in the hotel industry where he met Holland-Kennedy , the daughter of former Caribbean Hotel Association president Ken Holland-Kennedy , who is now deceased . <p> Record @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ documents , but he is not willing to bet all of his money on it . <p> With an eye to those in the market who have a yen to store their information digitally , the company is also spending US$100,000 on a secure server location to provide imaging and increased e-storage facilities , plus a backup ' store to tape ' room . <p> " We are trying to provide a one-stop shop for protection and access , " he said . <p> Foreign companies that deal with international clientele tend to appreciate the type of service that Archway provides , according to Holland-Kennedy . " Legislation brought in after the Enron scandal has placed increased pressure on businesses in the US to ensure that proper record-keeping procedures are adhered to , " she said . <p> " This legislation makes the directors and employees of companies legally responsible , so in turn , these companies want to make sure their overseas partners also have proper procedures in place . " <p> The couple is seeking a location for another management facility in Kingston which would house a processing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Kingston clients with active files , as well as data storage . <p> Archway has seen 50 per cent growth in business in the first six months of its second year in business despite having hung out its shingle during the recession , the couple said . <p> " Records-information management - RIM - is one of the few industries that is recession resistant . Being able to find information quickly keeps businesses efficient and offering better customer service , and keeps them ahead of the game when times are even more competitive , " said Holland-Kennedy . <p> " Both PRISM and ARMA , the two main RIM associations in the US , have reported growth in the industry during the recession . " <p> PRISM and ARMA both list Archway as a member . <p> Archway Caribbean opened for business in May 2009 after two years of market research into the viability of a comprehensive records-management company by the couple who has worked with several hotel chains . " The idea of starting a venture to offer complete records-management solutions came about five years ago from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the industry , and encouragement from industry insiders , " said Holland-Kennedy . <p> The Hollands , who have leveraged what they describe as " unique contacts with international RIM experts in both the US and the UK " , own the company , along with undisclosed RIM partners domiciled abroad . <p> The couple says they hold majority stake in the company and that the funds for the start-up were all private equity . <p> Three-quarters of the US$2 million of start-up capital was spent on constructing the storage facility , with the remainder used for staff and operating cash , the Hollands said . <p> Archway offers a range of solutions to information-management problems , working with clients to decide what information needs to be scanned or stored . It sets up retention schedules specifically designed for each industry and whatever legal and tax requirements are applicable to storage of specific documents/information . <p> Each client company is assigned a storage box , secured by bar coding . <p> Boxes have no company identification on the exterior , save for the bar codes which are only accessed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the database . <p> " Walking into the warehouse , no one can tell who our clients are , " said Holland-Kennedy . <p> " We also sign a confidentiality agreement , " she said . <p> Clients are charged for storage and document retrieval , with information delivery time - by scan or hard copy or both-promised within two hours . <p> Archway 's turnaround time , Holland claims , is much better than what currently obtains in some local business where a document search can take days . <p> The company will also destroy unwanted documents , if requested . <p> Holland says clients have shown great interest in having documents scanned and stored digitally , so he expects a 90 per cent take-up of that service once the technology is in place . <p> The push to offer a similar service in Kingston has been hampered by ease of access , security , and weather conditions . <p> " Not being able to find a suitable location in Kingston delayed us starting up earlier , " said Holland-Kennedy . " However , we realised we could start @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is where that part of our operation will always be based due to our unique location in terms of security . " <p> At start-up in 2009 , the main challenge for the Archway team lay in introducing a completely new concept to the Jamaican business market : that of outsourcing their information to be managed and stored . <p> Records-information management has been a standard worldwide for over 60 years , says Holland-Kennedy . <p> " Every First-World government outsources its information to companies such as Iron Mountain . We do n't see why this ca n't be done in Jamaica , " she said . <p> Iron Mountain is said to be the world leader in information-management services , with more than 140,000 organisations in 39 countries on five continents on its client list for storing , protecting , and managing their information . <p> Looking ahead , the Archway director said , the company foresees demand in Jamaica for not just the typical hard copy and data storage and retrieval , but email management , scanning , and disaster-recovery solutions . <p> " Companies , especially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down for even an hour anymore , " said Holland-Kennedy . <p> " So , like international RIM companies , we will be offering clients a complete disaster-recovery centre complete with full redundancy - all in a secure building - so businesses can continue working during times of both civil unrest and adverse weather conditions such as hurricanes.

The catchment traps spring water several miles in dense woodland , which serves the entire community . <p> 1 <p> 2 <p> Louis Marriott , Gleaner Writer <p> TEN YEARS ago , young Carlton Gooden reflected on life in Amity Hall . Some five kilometres from Kensington , where Sam Sharpe torched the great house in 1831 , Amity Hall is a remote village , home to a few hundred people enjoying a simple life of peace and good-neighbourliness . <p> Gooden , a thriving mason , cherished the lifestyle but was dissatisfied with aspects of the environment . The access roads were narrow , bumpy , and pockmarked with potholes . Electricity extended only to part of the village . There were no telephone lines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bee in Gooden 's bonnet was the lack of piped water . Amity Hall residents were obliged to carry the vital fluid in containers on their heads . Water sources were polluted by bathing , laundering , domestic sanitation , and even car-washing . Some contracted water-borne diseases , and local fish had a short lifespan . In times of drought , the village 's breadwinning farmers suffered losses . Work and school attendance declined as bathing became a challenge . <p> Gooden visualised a community solution to the problem requiring community support . He shared his vision with Sherman Thomas , who enjoyed great respect and credibility in the village . He persuaded Thomas that they could " trap a water " on a nearby hill and gravity-feed it into Amity Hall . <p> Thomas formed an Amity Hall development committee . The committee consulted Amity Hall 's golden agers , who identified Bryson Spring , unceasingly flowing a kilometre away on a hill overlooking the village , as the ideal source of piped water . <p> Scepticism amid support <p> There was some scepticism among the general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start . So the believers - men , women and children - on weekend workdays climbed up a steep and sometimes treacherous slope , across two streams bridged by boulders , carrying loads of sand , gravel , steel , and cement to Bryson Spring , where mason Gooden led the team that built a tomb over the spring and diverted water into rusty 20-year-old two-inch galvanised iron pipes scavenged from a previous neighbouring project . <p> The resources of the cooperating residents , who , with contacts of their parish councillor , Horace Lawrence , donated the materials for the project , were not enough to carry the water all the way . The suppliers carried the pipeline as far as their resources allowed , installed a standpipe , and invited the non-believers up the hill for a demonstration . The resistance ended immediately . The pipeline fed water into a large tank , also scavenged from the earlier project , where it was chlorinated and then delivered at phenomenal pressure through a standpipe in each of the community 's 75 yards . <p> As for the genius , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bathroom of his house . <p> In 2004 , the Social Development Commission 's St James parish officers urged the committee to enter the project for the Michael Manley Award for Community Self-Reliance . When the judges for the award paid their site a visit , they trudged up the steep kilometre to the tomb over Bryson Spring , a couple of senior citizens among them helped by able-bodied young men of Amity Hall . As the judges tasted the water , their consensus was that it was too deliciously refreshing to not be sold on the spring-water market . <p> Awards and grants <p> When the video documentary of short-listed projects was screened minutes before the awards presentation at the Little Theatre on Emancipation Day 2004 , audience response was electric as images appeared of ' Miss Patsy ' - an Amity Hall housewife who contributed significantly to the implementation of the project , now filling a container of water in her yard - and small children joyously drinking from a standpipe and dancing around it . <p> It was no contest . Amity Hall Water Supply won not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - a $200,000 cash prize and a beautiful bronze resin trophy sculpted by Kay Sullivan - but also the inaugural Environmental Foundation of Jamaica Award of $100,000 for the project with best credentials in environmental conservation . <p> Soon after , the St James Parish Council made a grant of $150,000 as its contribution to the purchase of new PVC mains to replace the rusty old galvanised iron pipes . Its health department provided technical support , including training in the proper chlorination of the water . <p> Along came Hurricane Ivan to test the system , followed by a drought , and then hurricanes Dennis and Emily . On all such occasions , when almost everywhere in Jamaica residents was discommoded by dirty brown water in rivers and taps , the deserving people of Amity Hall continued enjoying an uninterrupted supply of clean , pellucid water at $100 per month per household . <p> The economic recession has made subscriptions problematic for the growing community , but the committee soldiers on and has diversified its activities with road-patching and drain-cleaning on alternate weekends . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
