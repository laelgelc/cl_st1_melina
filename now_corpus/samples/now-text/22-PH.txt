" The commission en banc has no jurisdiction over administrative complaints against me . " Guanzon said the delay in the resolution was unfair to Marcos Jr . himself because if he loses in the Comelec 's First Division , he could still seek a reconsideration from the commission en banc and bring the case all the way to the Supreme Court . <p> Briones said Guanzon 's " bare suspicions " that politicians intervened in the case were " double hearsay and pure ' tsismis ' ( gossip ) " and her actions should be condemned by the Supreme Court as unworthy of an election commissioner . <p> " Commissioner Guanzon has shown herself to be an incorrigible narcissist and has shown an insatiable craving for posting in social media @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said . <p> Guanzon is the only member of the poll body with a Twitter account . <p> Briones accused Guanzon of partiality for Robredo and that her " true color " was yellow , which is associated with the late Presidents Corazon Aquino and Benigno Aquino III , and the Liberal Party , of which she is the chair . But Robredo 's campaign color this time is pink -- also the color of prodemocracy movements worldwide -- to signify a broader coalition against the continuation of President Duterte 's governance or a Marcos restoration in Malaca ? ang . <p> Briones said Guanzon should have inhibited herself from the Marcos case in the first place , pointing out that the two Aquino presidents appointed her to government posts in 1986 , 2013 and 2015 .

" Hindi paninira ang magsabi ng totoo " ( Telling the truth is not putting down others ) is the program 's slogan . <p> The latest installment of " DidiSerye , " for example , explains the improbability of the 192,000 tons of " Tallano gold " purportedly owned by the Marcos family and supposedly to be distributed to all Filipinos should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the late dictator , win the presidency in the May elections . <p> In the episode before that , Doria dressed as schoolmarm " Nana Didi " presented economic figures detailing the Philippines ' foreign debt , inflation rates , and the evils of crony capitalism to puncture the myth that martial law made up the country 's " golden era . " <p> Doria insists that she is not against a specific presidential candidate . " The vlog is mainly against fake news ; it does not display any political leanings ... It 's a shame that we have developed social media only to use it to spread fake news . We are wasting the gift of technology , " she says in a phone interview . <h> False narratives <p> For some time now , both scholars and ordinary observers have been discussing the prevalence of false narratives on social media , specifically about the Marcos family , that appear to bolster Marcos Jr .

" <p> Gutierrez says that after seeing the video , he is confident that Marcos Jr . will use the so-called gold " to help Filipinos , spend it on the poor ... and to beautify ( " pagpapaganda " ) the Philippines . " <p> Danilo Rala Asilo , a 70-year-old community leader in Barangay BF Homes who has participated in local campaigns , takes the Tallano yarn one step further . <p> He cites a supposed YouTube video claiming that Marcos Jr . ' s mother , Imelda Marcos , offered the gold stash to Congress in 1998 , to be appropriated for projects that would benefit Filipinos . <p> ADVERTISEMENT <p> Per Asilo , the story goes that the " dilawan " ( opposition ) lawmakers in Congress refused the former first lady 's offer because it would seem like the dictator did well ( " lilitaw na magaling at maganda ang ginawa ni Marcos " ) and his stock would be boosted ( " aangat si Marcos " ) . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nowadays . " I hardly read newspapers anymore . There are no more deliveries because of the pandemic , " he says . <h> ' Hypnotized ' <p> Doria agrees with the observation that the reduced circulation of newspapers has made people more dependent on social media . But she says its exploitation as a vehicle of fake news must be stopped . <p> " We want to promote fact-checking . People nowadays are so beholden to social media , they are hypnotized by it . As I said in the episode called ' Confirmation Bias , ' there are those who will only talk to others who hold the same beliefs . There is no effort to fact-check . We do this to discourage fake news , " she says in Filipino . <p> " We " refers to the ragtag production team behind Doria 's three-minute videos .

Why do n't we do something ? " she recalls the team saying . <p> Doria , who recently won two best supporting actress awards for her performance as a mother struggling with the onset of Alzheimer 's disease in " Memories of Forgetting , " was initially skeptical about doing a vlog . She wanted to know : Who holds the camera ? Who takes care of the lights ? <p> She does not go into specifics , only saying that some team members are skilled IT experts : " Magagaling sila , but they would rather remain incognito . " <h> How it was <p> Being vocal about her political opinions is not new to Doria . She was on her last semester in a humanities course at the University of the Philippines Diliman when the First Quarter Storm broke out in January 1970 . <p> She recalls how it was then : " I was not active in the rallies but I knew what was happening . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was involved in the activist group Kabataang Makabayan and my father , the late Romy Taccad , was a former newspaperman who later worked behind the scenes in politics . He worked for Speaker Cornelio Villareal and Manila Mayor Antonio Villegas , so the talk at home touched a lot on politics and current events . " <p> Doria got married in February 1970 but completed her college course eventually . She took odd jobs after school -- " Patalbog-talbog lang ako , not serious about anything " -- even contributing articles to the weekly political magazine Graphic and Sunday Times Variety , until movie director Emmanuel " Maning " Borlaza noticed her doing a bit role in " College Girls . " <p> In 1977 , she starred in " Tisoy " with Christopher de Leon and went on to do character roles that she finds more challenging . <p> " Nobody asked for my political opinions as an actress , " she says . " But during martial law , I was friends with people who knew things that were happening in government . People know I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out publicly because nobody was interested in asking me . I was at Edsa with my friends in 1986 . " <p> The way Doria remembers it , Filipinos were mostly clueless about martial law when Ferdinand Marcos signed the declaration in September 1972 . <p> " What we were told was all propaganda . But what was happening behind that was a different story . That 's why we can not allow martial law to happen again , or for another president to declare it . People trekked to Edsa to put it down , " she says . <h> Something meaningful <p> Doria admits to initially worrying about being bashed or getting threats to her security for doing " DidiSerye . " <p> She is thankful that feedback from netizens is mostly positive . " If ever there are negative comments , those who post positive ones defend me .

There is also no entry fee for all Oscar categories ; the only requirement aside from digital media assets is one film print or digital cinema package for projecting the film in theaters . <p> " The Film Academy 's statement was surprising to me , because during my time , there was n't really a budget allotted for Oscar entries , " filmmaker Hannah Farbova told me over Zoom . When her debut film " Transit " was submitted in 2013 , the Film Academy head at the time told her and her producers about a campaign strategy , but beyond that , she felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was only when American production company Electric Entertainment picked up " Transit " for U.S. distribution -- something that is not guaranteed for all Filipino entries -- that Farbova grasped how a budget could make or break a country 's chance at a nomination . At the time , the category saw 76 submissions , including entries from auteurs Wong Kar-wai ( " The Grandmaster " for Hong Kong ) and Paolo Sorrentino ( " The Great Beauty " for Italy ) , who eventually bagged the prize . Campaigns vied for Academy voters ' attention through festival buzz and hosting screenings in Hollywood ; both of which cost a lot of money that local producers often have to shoulder . " France and Germany are famous for having these screening parties where they invite Academy members and they have a screening and coffee and cocktails afterward , " Farbova shared . " We do n't really have a budget for that . " France has the second-most wins in the International Feature Film category ; Germany is the tenth . <p> The Film Development Council of the Philippines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Di ? o-Seguerra wrote in a Sunday Times column that a country needs at least ? 50 million and a win from an A-list film festival to implement a noticeable Oscars campaign . In 2016 , the FDCP launched the Oscars Assistance Program , allocating ? 1 million to chosen entries . It also has the International Film Festival Assistance Program , which provides airfare and accommodation allowance to filmmakers with entries in major international film festivals . But while Farbova is glad to know there 's now a budget , she noted that it 's not much compared to how much other countries were spending . After all , the Philippines has never been shortlisted , let alone nominated . <p> " The category needs fixing anyway , like in how nominees get selected , " Farbova added . " It 's like the Olympics or Miss Universe ; the only difference is that the judges are able to see all the candidates and judge them accordingly .

Once votes are tallied , a handpicked executive committee discusses the top seven titles and selects three additional films they deem overlooked to complete the shortlist . When in-person meetings became impossible , the committee opted to forgo these three ' saves ' and expanded the shortlist from 10 to 15 films . <p> While this move appears to make the category more inclusive , not much has changed in this year 's International Feature shortlist .

Almost all entries have won in a prestigious festival : Japan 's " Drive My Car , " Austria 's " Great Freedom , " Belgium 's " Playground , " Finland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The Worst Person in the World " all garnered prizes at Cannes , Kosovo 's " Hive " is the first film in Sundance history to win all three main awards , while Germany 's " I 'm Your Man " won at Berlinale .

His film " Heneral Luna " was the Philippines ' Oscar entry in 2015 .

Then the club rivalry between Hiraya FC and Green Archers United FC was settled with the former getting the advantage this season . <h> Cadag double hat-trick leads to UST rout of Tuloy FC <p> Those who followed the league wondered what the season 's dark horse so far in Tuloy FC could do against the might of the University of Santo Tomas . But last season 's runners-up stood their ground and humbled the club team from Alabang , 11-0 . <p> Charisa Lemoran was first on the scoreboard after scoring inside five minutes . The early goal did not deter Tuloy FC who defiantly attacked the Growling Tigresses ' half until a flurry of goals twelve minutes later seemed to have broken their spirit including Lemoran 's second goal in the 21st minute . <p> Shelah Mae Cadag continued to be in perfect form completing a hat-trick in 16 minutes with goals in the 17th , 23rd and 33rd minutes while adding another at the stroke of half-time . She scored two further times in the second half ( 59th and 70th minutes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adding two goals in first half added time and in the 57th minute , while Ronalyn Lagata turned super-sub again after contributing the final goal in the 83rd minute . <p> For coach Aging Rubio , it was the barrage of goals early in the match that mattered the most . <p> Hoping to keep pace with the league leaders are De La Salle University and club team OutKast FC yet both relinquished pursuit after cancelling each other out 1-1 . The club team has also snapped La Salle 's winning streak that extended from last season and left it at 15 games . <p> While the Lady Archers controlled much of the game early on , OutKast were determined to match their intensity . The ladies from Taft had plenty of scoring opportunities which were foiled by the staunch defense of OutKast 's backline . <p> In the second half , national team and La Sallian taliswoman Sara Casta ? eda made the breakthrough after picking the ball off an OutKast midfielder then combined with Rocelle Menda ? o for a 66th minute strike . <p> The advantage to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lady Archers kept missing opportunities to double their lead and this gave the club team all the hope they needed . <p> It was Sharmine Siaotong who punished La Salle 's wastefulness after a timely flick pass by Loreta Ladero led to a last-minute equalizer in stoppage time . <p> OutKast FC Manager Keuts Smith was clearly delighted at what her club team had pulled off against the defending champions . <p> " I 'm very pleased , obviously a win would have been better . But for us a draw against La Salle in the way that it happened was for us , it 's amazing . It 's like everyone was giving up and maybe the other team was tuning out but you know that 's the game , you have to play until the very end and never assume anything until the final whistle , " she said . <p> Coach Alvin Ocampo meanwhile looked the opposite albeit consoled by the fact that it happened at a preseason tournament for La Salle and not the UAAP . <p> " Actually it 's breaks of the game , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , OutKast gave us a good run sa last few minutes . Yun ang football eh , you can not win every game , " he said before revealing that the team is still in experimental mode . <p> " We 're a work in progress until we can see what system will work for us , anong combination will work for us , kung sino yung tama sa position na to , " Ocampo added . <h> Hiraya FC survive late GAU FC surge for first win <p> As the only two club teams to end last season in the top half , Hiraya FC and Green Archers United FC share a kind of rivalry on determining which is the better non-UAAP team . After their only meeting this season , it was advantage Hiraya after prevailing 2-1 . <p> Hiraya led early when a corner taken by Natasha Alquiros after ten minutes of play left the ball bouncing off players in the box before Cecilia Dayrit slammed it home . <p> Two minutes after halftime , Aiza Mondero played a through pass to the front where Camille Rodriguez @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past national teammate Inna Palacios . <p> GAU did not sit idly by and managed to pull a goal back in the last six minutes . Maria Layacan took advantage of the slight confusion on the field after the ball smacked a teammate on the face left a high ball for the taking . Hiraya goalkeeper Gely Tiu may have stopped a penalty earlier in the match but she was helpless against Layacan 's left-footed strike . <p> The 84th minute goal made Hiraya nervous for a while but eventually they held on . <p> Coach Philip Dinglasan was relieved that his side was able to escape with the win . <p> " Siyempre it 's a big win because it 's our first win . Today our objective was really to get the three points , minimum was one point . We 're lucky we had enough substitutes so we were able to finish the game with a win . Towards the end kabado pa nga kami baka mag-draw kasi their striker was really fantastic , " he said . <p> Dinglasan also made it clear what Hiraya were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get more points . Basta sa amin one of our goals is to be top of the club teams , to get ahead of the others . Of course we 're in a competition we want to place well , " he added . <h> Tug-of-war between UP and Ateneo ends in stalemate <p> Both the University of the Philippines and Ateneo de Manila University were seeking their first win and first points going into this match . At the Katipunan derby 's conclusion , however , victory remains elusive with the 2-2 draw yet each have finally gained at least a point . <p> Five minutes into the game , Ateneo already led . A poor clearance led the ball into Daniella Gonzales ' waiting feet and the forward let loose a belter of a goal from the top of the box . <p> Cassandra Alleje responded in kind via free kick from thirty yards out to level both teams in the 48th minute . <p> After 55 minutes , Mary Rose Obra 's inspired curling shot from long range gave the Lady Maroons the advantage . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on their way to their first win in ten or so matches including the UAAP , until a half-volley strike inside the box by Katya Pe with seven minutes left on the clock spoiled the dream and led this season 's Battle of Katipunan to end in a truce . <p> UP coach Andres Gonzales was at a loss at foregoing the full three points . <p> " After we scored our second goal in the second half , we just shut down . I do n't know if it 's mental , if it 's fitness , kasi momentum na yun eh . Dapat after that second goal , all the more that they have to get that full momentum . But they did the opposite thing which is they sat back , and that gave Ateneo a chance , " he said . <p> Gonzales found some silver lining with how his side performed in the first half as well as reaching some objectives , but he reiterated what his team needed to fix . <p> " They have to realize that they need to be consistent . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ physical preparation , both are equally important , " he added . <p> It seemed that his Atenean counterpart is fretting over the same issues with his squad as well . <p> " In the end , I 'm happy because from nag-lead yung UP talagang pinilit nila mag-draw .

@@73928230 <h> Accelerating the integrity agenda <h> Suits The C-Suite <p> By Roderick M. Vega <p> ( First of two parts ) <p> Played out against a landscape of evolving social expectations from businesses under current conditions , corporate integrity is foundational to fostering trust among the various stakeholders in an organization . The importance of corporate integrity has also grown in the immediate aftermath of the pandemic , as revealed by the EY Global Integrity Report 2022 . <p> Conducted between June and September 2021 by global market research agency Ipsos MORI , the EY Global Integrity Report 2022 surveyed 4,762 board members , managers and employees from large organizations in a wide spectrum of industries , including financial services , government and public sector , consumer products , manufacturing , life sciences , professional services and others from 54 countries in North and South America , the Far East , Western and Eastern Europe , and the Middle East , India and Africa . The report shows that 97% of the respondents indicated that they value corporate integrity . Companies are also intensifying their reinforcement of integrity through training and communication ; 37% of respondent companies now have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investing in integrity training , and 53% have a code of conduct in place . <p> While the report did not include respondents from the Philippines , we believe that the insights from the report offer much food for thought for local business leaders who place great emphasis on corporate governance and integrity . <p> Respondents are placing greater responsibilities on their corporate leaders , with as much as 68% expecting CEOs to tackle societal problems unaddressed by government and 65% saying that CEOs should be accountable to both the public and shareholders . These rising expectations have led to organizations being asked to more formally report on the non-financial aspects of their operations . These include not just philanthropic or corporate social responsibility ( CSR ) programs that fall outside their core businesses , but also environmental , social and governance ( ESG ) measures that determine how the core business impacts the community and the planet . <p> The report also shows that organizations are struggling to close the gap between what they say and what they do . As organizations start taking steps to rebuild the economy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where work is performed , an opportunity to close the gap between reality and rhetoric presents itself . Integrity in business does not merely refer to ticking boxes in compliance and risk management ; it is about securing the organization , its reputation , and its assets -- all of which drive sustainable , long-term value . <p> The EY Global Integrity Report 2022 provides insights on accelerating the integrity agenda , and in the first part of this article , we detail how companies must define and embed integrity into their culture . <p> EMBEDDING INTEGRITY INTO THE CULTUREBecause ethical dilemmas are different for various organizations and situations , no two companies will have the same definition of integrity , nor will they utilize the same mechanisms to instill integrity into their organizations . It then becomes imperative for integrity to be a fundamental component of corporate strategy in any organization . <p> The report reveals that only 33% of its respondents believe that integrity means behaving with ethical standards . Meanwhile , 50% define it as complying with codes of conduct , laws and regulations . Somewhat alarmingly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ members , 15% were more likely to falsify financial records as their employees , and 17% were more likely to ignore unethical conduct by third parties . This makes it unsurprising for 58% board members to be fairly or very concerned if their decisions were to come under public scrutiny , compared to only 37% of employees . <p> Though it should be noted that this is only a single snapshot of board behavior , which can vary considerably by country , region and industry , the data showed a significant change in emerging markets : the propensity of board members to act unethically increased from 34% to 41% between 2020 and 2022 . There are also differences in how management and staff see integrity values within their organization : 77% of board members and senior managers are confident that employees within their organizations can report wrongful acts without fearing negative consequences , yet 20% of employees disagree with this . This year 's report even revealed a drop in survey respondents who reported misconduct , from 23% in 2020 to 19% in 2022 . <p> A large majority of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a mix of training and whistleblowing policies in place . However , even though 59% of the respondents say that they do have " training for employees , " 15% of those employees are either unaware that these measures exist or claim that they do not exist . This shows that although organizations are investing in more training and communication programs to instill integrity , the messaging may not be effective . Though 60% of board members say that their organization frequently communicated about the importance of integrity within the past 18 months , only 30% of employees remember these communications . <p> These findings reveal the danger that organizations are relegating their integrity agenda to box-ticking without giving real attention to deepening their integrity culture , which rests on actual behavior and organizational intent . <p> The pandemic has only increased the challenge as well , with 54% of board members saying that the pandemic is making it more difficult to conduct business with integrity . Disruptions have added to the challenge of corporate survival , while increased digitization , which moved more of a company 's operations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The risk landscape itself has become more disrupted , with another report , the EY Global Board Risk Survey 2021 , saying that 87% of more than 500 board directors around the world think that market disruptions are now more frequent , while 83% say they are more impactful . The 2021 EY Global Information Security Survey also found that many businesses have sidestepped cybersecurity processes to facilitate flexible and remote working in the wake of COVID-19 . <p> Because of an increased focus on surviving the disruptions and uncertainty caused by the pandemic , companies have let go of non-essential activities -- possibly including integrity agenda . Leaders will have to rethink of procedures for a post-pandemic era with a pivot to full digitization and a distributed workforce . <p> In the second part of this two-part article , we will discuss how companies can create an optimal environment that encourages integrity , and how the integrity agenda can be innovated and transformed to minimize external threats while protecting value . <p> This article is for general information only and is not a substitute for professional advice where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expressed above are those of the author and do not necessarily represent the views of SGV &amp; Co . <p> Roderick M.

@@73934239 <h> How Insta-auctions made exclusive shopping accessible <h> Tagged products turned Instagram feeds into an online shop window . The photo-sharing app has also become the perfect digital platform for faster and simpler auctions . <p> Instagram was never designed to be a platform to make sales . Created in 2010 , Instagram -- a photo-sharing app at its core -- was born from creator Kevin Systrom 's affinity for photography . <p> 11 years later , Instagram grew out of Systrom 's love for taking photos . The introduction of the app 's new tap-to-buy feature mirrored Systrom 's exit from Instagram in 2018 -- symbolizing Instagram 's official e-commerce takeover . <p> Since then , Instagram has made selling and buying more intentional . Users can switch to business accounts , gaining access to professional features like promoting posts and account insights to grow reach and engagement . In-app website browsing and checkouts are available . Tagged products have turned our Instagram pages into an online shop window . And less intentionally , it became the perfect digital platform for faster and simpler auctions . <p> Instagram auctions are an emerging sales model . They usually start @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the starting price -- signifying that it is officially now on the market -- and end with bidders leaving offers in their comments until a hammer price is reached . The rule often in practice is being the first to comment " mine " on a post determines the winner . And when the supposed buyer backs out , users who comment " next " are often considered next in line . In other instances where the highest price wins , businesses will allow space for other users to comment " steal " if they are willing to outbid the current offer or " grab " if they are willing to place the highest bid possible to secure the item . <p> Through its shareability , visual format , and ease of use , Instagram has introduced a transparent way to both host and participate in an auction . For the majority of users , the idea of the insta-auction dates back to a time when coveted products from international brands were n't readily available on e-commerce markets like Shopee or Lazada . <p> A move toward a more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had bid for a few pink Glossier pouches that a seller wanted to get out of her hands and for some reason -- at the time -- I just had to have it , " said Mike , * a 25 year-old marketing manager . Today , he finds himself still participating in insta-bidding but towards different things , like ceramics . <p> For Mike , insta-auctions are just another way to obtain specialty items available in scarce and limited quantities . They operate on the same system as face-to-face auctions , but are done on a different platform that plays by a different set of rules . <p> " It 's different from regular auction houses , " said Mike , coming from his own experiences . " You 're not relying on any system . You 're relying on the honesty of the person who owns the business . " By employing a third-party platform like Instagram , businesses are able to utilize an approach that is largely driven by transparency . Business owners -- who serve as both the seller and auctioneer -- rely on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made the right bid , within the timeframe they dictate . <p> Through Instagram , specialty items that could be sold through auctions are no longer solely dictated by the price tag . These days , any item whose supply can not meet its demand is often sold through insta-auction . This includes vintage items , limited edition collectibles , one-off items , and anything that is either seasonal or no longer in production . <p> Business owners like Alyssa Kangleon -- the artist behind Manibalang -- find that the decision to sell her one-of-a-kind ceramic pieces on Instagram on a **25;4370;TOOLONG basis comes from a place of trying to be more efficient . " I put out my work , people comment , the first person to get the right code gets it , " said Aly . " This is simply more practical for me ! I get to spend my time actually making ceramics instead of tending to messaging all the interested people which set me up for a lot of stress and mistakes . " The fast-paced nature of Instagram allows her to sell her pieces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lets her both live her life and tend to her work . <p> But this alternative sales format of Instagram auctions is not without its drawbacks . Business owners -- being mistaken as robots for posting too many in-feed posts in a short amount of time -- get blocked by Instagram . Customers end up not paying for the bids they won . Or sometimes , scorned customers take out their loss on the real people behind these Instagram accounts . <p> Kangleon ? shared that the algorithm behind Instagram comments has left many of her unlucky customers angry . Almost always , the first comment you see on a post is your own , regardless of whether you are actually the earliest . " Even though I explain what happened , sometimes they 're still upset and they 'd direct their discontentment at me , which is never fun . " <p> Maximizing revenue <p> Second-hand thrift store owner Ramon implemented a mine-steal-grab structure in order to maximize revenue . With his limited inventory of vintage clothing unable to meet customer demand , bidding has allowed Ramon to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " People see that my items are in-demand so their willingness to spend is increased once they see other people , " he said . <p> Ramon also sets extended bidding timeframes to increase chances of visibility among his store 's followers . " It gives more chances to all buyers , it shows me the prices people are willing to pay for certain items and lastly , and it helps increase profits , " said Ramon . <p> Another byproduct of participating in an insta-auction is developing a pattern of sunk cost trap . In an Instagram auction , everything happens so fast . The competitive desire to be the first to comment " mine " leaves out any time to even examine the product we 're bidding on . Once a photo is uploaded , looking at the product becomes secondary to commenting first . <h> Through this new culture of mine , steal , and grab , Instagram has made auctions -- an activity designed to be exclusive -- more accessible to anyone who has a smartphone , access to the internet , and desire to purchase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Karina , * who often participates in book bidding , shared that the competitiveness of acquiring titles from Instagram bookstores has caused her to make several unnecessary purchases . Even when she spends most of her time refreshing and waiting , being first to comment " mine " is never guaranteed . And to avoid the painful admission of having wasted time when she does n't land her first choice , she 'd settle for the leftovers of the auction . " When I do n't get to buy the book I originally wanted , I 'd buy any title that 's left , " she said . <p> Instagram has inadvertently obliterated any division between people who went to auctions and those who did n't ; what type of item rationalized an auction and what did n't . Pre-dating the age of insta-buy and sell , participating in auctions depended on being part of an inner circle or the willingness to spend on a high-priced entry ticket or registration fee ( sometimes charged at ? 20,000 ) .

@@73951233 <h> Korean wave and the power of ' PM sent ' <p> Surely , you must have heard of at least one of these , or even all of them . You are probably even an OG K-drama or K-pop fan since the Korean wave first hit the Philippines in the early 2000s . However , for many Filipinos , what used to simply be an interest has become a source of alternative income during the pandemic . <p> The Covid-19 pandemic has truly shaken the fabric of our society . It has required institutions to adjust massively to continue operating amid all the uncertainty . However , business cycle fluctuations mean that it is usually smaller players who lose out more than larger corporations due to having less resources . Business closures due to strict lockdowns mean many people losing jobs and experiencing transient poverty . <p> At the peak of the first ECQ implementation in April 2020 , unemployment rate rose to 17.7 percent , with 7.3 million Filipinos unemployed . Because life goes on for these millions of Filipinos , many resorted to online selling , which helped them augment their household income , though it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many items sold in online markets , one category stood out very much in 2020 . Because many people had much time in their hands , they binge-watched K-dramas , resulting in a spike in demand for Korean food products and other related merchandise . <p> What used to be seen mostly in Korean-owned grocery marts are now being offered in the virtual markets . What I notice in social-media groups for these items is how many suppliers do not post the prices of their products , but would instead simply post a photo , a short description , and an occasional " Limited Stocks Only . " Multiple comments would flood such posts asking how much ( " HM ? " ) to which the seller would reply with the classic : " PM sent . " <p> As the consumer , you probably find this annoying . I myself sell Korean goods and still find this cumbersome . After all , the transaction could be made much simpler by posting the product 's price , thereby eliminating the unnecessary conversation that might delay the closing of the transaction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , despite the DTI clearly advising that prices should be posted always ? <p> In my 1.5 years of selling these products , I have observed Korean food items to exhibit characteristics of monopolistic competition . Barriers to entry and exit are minimal . Products are a bit differentiated . There are many market players , and firms have little market power . Given this reality , producers or sellers who belong to this type of market would try to gain leverage by capitalizing on imperfect consumer knowledge , and even deliberately keeping information asymmetry to gain more sales and profit . <p> For instance , among the popular products currently sold in online Korean markets are honey citron and ginger tea . For a 1-kilogram jar , the acceptable retail price ranges between P330 and P400 , with the latter being quite steep already . This already considers a profit margin of about 15 to 20 percent , as well as varying wholesale prices for different brands like Feliz , Cholocwon , and Ottogi . <p> However , many online sellers are aware of the high demand for this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bounded rationality by pegging retail prices much higher ( P475 to P500 ) so they could reap exorbitant profits from each bottle , since most people will not even bother to extensively PM many sellers to ask for the price and compare them , though it is the rational thing to do . It is a hassle , and , afraid of missing out , many consumers do not take the time to screen due to time constraints and scarce supplies . <p> Sure , it is a short-term win , but this is no way to keep customers coming back . Once customers come across postings of the same product at much cheaper prices , they will resent the ones who sold items to them at scalper-like rates . Indeed , keeping a safe but consistent profit margin is a slow game , but revenue is almost always assured because satisfied customers will return with more referrals , and word of mouth is one of the best marketing strategies . <p> At the end of the day , we understand how many people want to make a quick buck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard , after all . Nevertheless , in a market with little power given to sellers , it might be best to be a tad more patient with lower prices that still allow one to maximize profit . This is through finding suppliers who offer competitive prices that are cost-efficient . This way , people will not have to resort to " PM sent " to gain leverage . Instead , they gain market advantage through affordable products . <p> Ms. Ma . Angelica B. America teaches at the Department of Economics of the Ateneo de Manila University .

" He 's a heckuva football player . He does a nice job . He 's a coach 's kid that knows the game and kind of gets it . " <p> Perhaps the biggest health concern on either team is Chiefs safety Tyrann Mathieu . He missed practice on Wednesday and remains in concussion protocol , but Reid said there 's a chance he 'll be on the field Thursday . <p> Bengals head coach Zac Taylor said the Bengals plan to spend " a lot of time " working on protection of Burrow . He was hit 13 times at Tennessee and sacked five times in the first half alone . Taylor said noise at Arrowhead comes with the territory , and the peripheral complications -- silent counts , Burrow calling plays due to headset challenges -- are n't easy to replicate in practice . <p> " Arrowhead is pretty loud , " Mahomes said . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm sure it 'll be pretty loud this weekend . They 're coming in trying to win a big football game . But I 'm glad we 're at Arrowhead and we 're able to use our crowd to our advantage in trying to get a win .

The Jan. 2 win over Kansas City has been a confidence-building rallying cry since the 34-31 win in Ohio . Rookie first-round pick Ja'Marr Chase was fourth in the National Football League ( NFL ) with 1,455 receiving yards and 13 touchdowns . Chase set career bests with 11 receptions for 266 yards and three touchdowns against Kansas City in the Week 17 clash . <p> Chase said he " did n't watch " last week 's game to study how the Chiefs handled Gabriel Davis of the Bills , who exploded for 201 yards and four TDs , while Buffalo 's No. 1 receiver Stefon Diggs had three catches for seven yards plus a two-point conversion pass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're a great secondary , " Chase said on Wednesday . <p> But familiarity is a two-way street .

" Especially that caliber , those guys are always in the postseason , the Super Bowl . That 's what we 're trying to do . " <p> A win would put the Bengals in the Super Bowl for the first time since 1988 ( SB XXIII ) . Kansas City is the first team to host four consecutive NFL conference championship games . A Chiefs ' victory puts the franchise in elite company with three others who have played in three consecutive Super Bowls ( Miami Dolphins , 1971-73 ) , Buffalo Bills ( 1990-93 ) and New England Patriots ( 2016-18 ) . <p> " I 've been in some of these situations before , I 've been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go out there and find a way to win , " Mahomes said .

We are losing track of actual infections , recoveries and deaths . <p> Even the OCTA Research Group , which uses official government data in its consistently accurate projections , may soon find itself flying blind because of the insufficiency of relevant information . <p> People are self-testing , isolating at home and resorting to self-medication , without informing authorities about their health status .

And this wo n't happen when the government says so , but when people stop seeing relatives and friends , and hearing of friends of friends , catching Omicron . <p> * * * <p> Since the start of the month when Omicron put an end to the short-lived freedom of the 2021 holiday season , I have personally known at least 15 people who caught COVID , or who were forced to isolate as the virus raced through their households . <p> Those who got infected had three things in common . One , they were all fully vaccinated ( with different brands ) , with several boosted . Two , all had symptoms that lasted for only about five to seven days and were mild enough to allow them to isolate at home . <p> And three , because the symptoms were mostly just like a bad cold or mild flu @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when they tested positive , to get confirmatory RT-PCR tests . <p> They simply isolated from the other members of the household and took common medications for their cold symptoms , slight fever and body aches , sore throat and cough -- the symptoms generally associated with an Omicron infection . Some did tuob or steam inhalation ; others took the Chinese medication for mild COVID cases , Lianhua Qingwen . <p> The only ones who underwent RT-PCR testing to get a negative result after their isolation were those who needed it to return to onsite work . <p> It 's uncertain if the RT-PCR laboratories reported them as COVID recoveries and were included in the report to the Department of Health . What 's certain is that their antigen test results , some of which were self-administered at home , were not reported to the DOH or to the barangay . <p> The persons I know mostly live in houses that allow home isolation and are responsible enough to remain under quarantine during the period prescribed by the DOH . <p> But what is the situation in cramped low-income @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? <p> * * * <p> Breakthrough infections among the vaccinated tend to be mild , except for the elderly and those with serious comorbidities . If the symptoms are manageable , there is less urgency to be tested , whether through RT-PCR or antigen . <p> Even if the local government unit offers free testing , there are persons who worry about being forced to go on quarantine if they test positive , or to have one 's home placed under granular lockdown . Daily wage earners with no work-from-home arrangements worry about losing income for even one day . Several vaccination holdouts have cited this as their reason for not getting their jabs , along with their inability to register online . <p> Concerns about one 's residence being placed under lockdown deter people from reporting positive antigen test results , even if their houses or condominium units are spacious enough for home isolation . <p> For those who ca n't afford to skip even a day 's work , mild symptoms may be brushed aside .

The person is infectious two days before the Omicron symptoms emerge and three days after . <p> With Omicron now the dominant COVID variant of concern , infected persons can spread the virus before they decide to undergo testing and get the result . Those they have infected but are asymptomatic can continue their routines , taking public transport , going to work or to the wet market or supermarket . <p> By the time the infection is detected in the original patient , an entire household or office may have been been infected and may have to be temporarily shut down . <p> So those low or plateauing infection numbers may be way off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rates tend to bolster the deceleration of the contagion . Most mild and even moderate cases , however , are opting for home isolation , not only because it 's cheaper , but also because hospital confinement for COVID can be extremely distressing for the patient 's mental health . <p> So hospitalization rates may also not accurately reflect COVID prevalence .

Other risks that we are aware @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Chua told reporters on Viber . <p> Chua said efforts to address the impact of inflation are being done on two fronts -- the transportation side and the food side .

The uncertainty , he said , stems from the " fear polarization and instability in the event of a Marcos presidency . " <p> Another monkey wrench that could complicate the recovery and attainment of the UMIC are the disasters that could derail GDP growth .

Incoming administration must have the political will to increase taxes , " he added . <p> De La Salle University economist Maria Ella Oplas told this newspaper that the uncertainty of the times lends doubt to the optimism of the President 's economic team . <p> For one , Oplas said , the government needs to pay debt and PhilHealth has to pay hospital claims to prevent these from closing and continuing the fight against the pandemic . <p> Efforts to improve the labor situation are also crucial and the recent lockdowns may not have helped improve employment generation .

The indictment said he conspired " to oppose by force the lawful transfer of presidential power .

SoRelle says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Latinos for Trump , where she spoke , as did Rhodes , SoRelle and Simmons said . <p> The photographer , Amy Harris , was also with Tarrio at the garage meeting January 5 , two sources said . Harris , who originally specialized in photography of music concerts and festivals , had shifted to protests in 2020 , and had begun focusing on Tarrio and the Proud Boys . The House committee has subpoenaed Harris 's phone records ; she is suing the January 6 committee to block the subpoena . " Harris 's work documenting Tarrio throughout the remainder of 2020 earned her Tarrio 's trust as a journalist and , accordingly , the trust of the members of his group , " her suit said . <p> Harris and her lawyers declined to comment . <p> SoRelle said the garage meeting left her puzzled and she says she is unclear why it was held . She said the meeting was not necessary , as she had already shared information about possible lawyers with Tarrio and others . " There was no reason for him to show up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she said . <p> The documentary film crew was from a company called " Saboteur Media .

But for those who trust in the Lord , there is , and it 's called Divine Providence .

Through those years , she reminisced memorable moments while she first held appointive offices at the Department of Trade and Industry ( DTI ) to being elected , first as a Senator , then vice president , and eventually as the President of the Republic . <p> Next to the 20-year rule of the late dictator , president Ferdinand Marcos , Mrs.Arroyo had the second longest term as president of the Philippines .

Per her account , she started writing her memoir while placed under " hospital detention " during the administration of the late president Benigno Simeon " PNoy " Aquino III . Due to the restrictions of " hospital detention , " she pointed to the difficulties writing the memoirs . When she was acquitted and released from " hospital detention " in 2016 , she became very busy and her memoirs went to the back burner . <p> Half-amusingly , she related her memoirs came under heavy editing .

Even those who just stay at home , they get infected , " Duterte said , speaking in a mix of English and Filipino , addressing his question to Health Secretary Francisco Duque in a taped meeting aired last Jan. 17 . <p> ADVERTISEMENT <p> " There are others -- or there are many of them -- who are vaccinated who still get infected . Is that airborne ? There are so many people who are already wearing masks who still get infected , " Duterte went on . <p> Duterte raised two questions in total -- first was how even people at home who followed health protocols still got infected with the COVID variant .

The coronavirus is mainly transmitted through droplets generated when an infected person coughs or sneezes . " <p> WHO , following this finding , recommended social distancing of more than a meter -- within which these droplets were thought to fall to the ground -- hand washing , and surface disinfection to further prevent the transfer of droplets to the eyes , nose , and mouth . <p> Previous records showed that even before the organization recognized the airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 , it first acknowledged that the virus can be transmitted through droplets . <p> The organization took until Oct. 20 , 2020 , to acknowledge that aerosols , or tiny specks of fluid , can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WHO noted that this can only occur particularly in indoor settings with poor ventilation . <p> It was not until six months when the organization gradually altered its advice and said that aerosols could carry the virus for over a meter and could remain in the air . <p> " The disconnect was there even in the use of scientific terms . Infection-control experts have long drawn a hard line between droplet viruses and airborne ones , seeing only the latter as capable of traveling far and lingering in the air , " Lewis wrote . <p> Here is a timeline showing WHO 's changing views of how SARS-CoV-2 spread among people . <p> Feb. 23 , 2020 : WHO said the virus could spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth .

People can also catch COVID-19 if they breathe in droplets from a person with COVID-19 who coughs out or exhales droplets . This is why it is important to stay more than 1 meter ( 3 feet ) away from a person who is sick . " <p> Mar. 29 , 2020 : WHO announced that the virus is not airborne , despite mounting reports and studies by experts pointing out that it could be . <p> " FACT #COVID19 is NOT airborne .

" Workers and their representatives in the Philippines remained particularly vulnerable to violent attacks , intimidation , and arbitrary arrests .

Then in 2019 , he vetoed the proposed -- but " watered-down " -- security of tenure law over a provision that broadened the scope of labor contracting . He later said that Congress should rectify the vetoed provisions . The challenge is now for the Marcos Jr . administration to take up . <p> While President Marcos Jr . made no mention of his plans for the labor sector in his inaugural address , he committed during the campaign period to give priority to the security of tenure law .

The International Labor Organization calls it " non-standard employment " that covers varied arrangements deviating from the standard full-time employment with benefits .

@@90382230 <h> Long shadow of Germany 's top Putin ally impedes Ukraine aid <p> German Chancellor Olaf Scholz is struggling to escape the shadow of his predecessor Gerhard Schroeder 's ties to Russia and that 's hampering efforts to help Ukraine . <p> Germany 's most-recent Social Democratic leader before Scholz , Schroeder , 78 , has become a touchstone of controversy 17 years after losing power to Angela Merkel , revealing deeper issues at the heart of the left-leaning party . <p> In comments to the New York Times published Saturday , Schroeder defended Vladimir Putin and rejected calls to quit his high-paying jobs for state-owned Russian companies . The SPD , which has a long tradition of seeking rapprochement with Russia , hit back on Monday asking him to leave the party and saying a process was underway to expel him . Another SPD official said sanctions against Schroeder needed to be considered . <p> " His defense of Vladimir Putin against claims of war crimes is simply absurd , " co-leader Saskia Esken said in Berlin , referring to Schroeder 's assertion that he did n't think orders over the atrocities in Bucha could have come from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its stance toward Schroeder . " <p> What the spat highlights is just how weak Scholz is as leader of Europe 's largest economy . Despite his remarkable election victory in September , the 63-year-old has only limited control over his party , which remains conflicted in its response to the war in Ukraine . Some SPD members oppose military action , while others still support engaging with the Kremlin . <p> " The divisions within the SPD act as a constraint on Scholz 's room for maneuver , " said Naz Masraff , director for Europe at consultancy Eurasia Group . These internal party tensions have " paralyzed the government . " <p> Early in the war , Scholz went out on a limb by shipping mainly defensive weapons to Ukraine such as anti-tank and anti-aircraft systems and setting up a 100 billion-euro ( $108 billion ) fund to upgrade aging military equipment . His party may have been pushed about as far as it can go for now , and Scholz is aware of those limits , according to a person familiar with his thinking . <p> His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since stalled , as Scholz walks a fine line between international commitments and not straying too far from his party . He 's come under heavy criticism by balking at delivering tanks and other heavy weapons to Ukraine , citing fears of " nuclear war . " <p> Instead , he 's proposed a complex plan to get eastern European partners to send Soviet-style gear to Ukraine in exchange for more modern replacements paid for by Germany . While it 's unclear to what extent he 's responding to party issues , there is reason for caution if he wants to avoid the same fate as Schroeder . <p> Schroeder 's defeat to Merkel in 2005 was triggered by disgruntled SPD lawmakers . The left-leaning party helped bring about an early national election due to deep divisions over a series of labor reforms , which Scholz helped push through as the SPD 's general secretary until both he and Schroeder stepped down from their party posts in 2004 . <p> The internal conflicts persisted and contributed to Scholz losing his bid to lead the party in 2019 because he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reforms . His candidacy in last year 's election stemmed from a lack of viable alternatives rather than a change of heart . <p> There 's also a division between the government and parliamentary lawmakers . In Scholz 's case , this is even more acute , requiring support from figures such as SPD caucus leader Rolf Muetzenich from the party 's left wing to pass legislation including the defense fund . Scholz 's legislative exposure was evident after his push for a Covid-19 vaccine mandate failed this month . <p> Muetzenich wants a broader discussion on help for Ukraine beyond weapons , saying the international community also needs to push for humanitarian corridors and a cease-fire . <p> " The discussion of the last few days has a massively militaristic bias , " he said Tuesday on ARD television . <p> Despite tensions , Germans largely support Scholz 's cautious line as things stand . A poll by INSA for Bild newspaper shows that 50 percent are against delivering heavy weapons to Ukraine -- with SPD resistance slightly stronger at 55 percent . But it 's a thin margin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opposition conservative bloc is seeking a motion this week on delivering tanks to Ukraine . It 's hoping for support from the Greens and the Free Democrats , Scholz 's coalition partners , who have been more aggressive in calling for support for Ukraine 's defense . <p> For his part , Scholz has tried to distance himself from Schroeder . In early March , he urged the former chancellor to give up posts as chairman of state-owned Russian oil giant Rosneft PJSC and head of the shareholder committee of Nord Stream AG , which built a Russia-to-Germany natural-gas pipeline that Scholz halted . <p> But Schroeder has been a recurring theme of Scholz 's short tenure . In February , with Scholz under pressure for not standing up more robustly to Putin 's aggression , he waved off Schroeder 's allegations that Ukraine was " saber-rattling , " defensively asserting : " There 's only one chancellor and that 's me . " <p> Other senior SPD officials have also been labeled as Kremlin sympathizers including Frank-Walter Steinmeier , Germany 's president and a former foreign minister . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Germany after a spat over his criticism of the party -- insisted there 's a clear stance on the Kremlin , but acknowledged the SPD may have made mistakes about Russia in the past . <p> " The SPD does n't have a Putin problem , " she said in Berlin .

@@90592230 <h> Place your bets <p> A few more days before election day and at this point , most of us have chosen our candidates . I for one ca n't wait to cast my vote after holding my breath for so long and the excitement is through the roof . Seriously speaking , however , I have for a very long time already decided on my top choices . My very first job in government came not only at an opportune time in my life but also at a time when I was in the middle of a personal crisis . <p> In those days , and already having been a school teacher in the private sector , crossing over into government opened my eyes to the real world . Having the one facility I shared with former president Gloria Macapagal Arroyo , that of being able to speak Spanish , I was able to help many public school teachers develop the same facility and , in the end , learners became more equipped as well as competitive in the job market . I learned discipline , fortitude and perseverance in the middle of my own crisis and since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I could become more but most of all , I learned that honor and duty were two very important ingredients in the school of life . <p> While I was fortunate enough to have had opportunities in other agencies of government , what I learned at the time of FPGMA is something I still hold close to my chest to this day , as honor and duty come with your good word . It is not easy to be a tough woman in a man 's world yet , while it is not easy and , in most cases , it has become very empowering to experience that on many occasions , especially the rare and difficult ones , a woman has changed the game many times in this battleground we call politics . I saw this for myself in the leadership of Mayor Inday Sara Duterte of the UniTeam , in all her brave efforts on Peace 911 and how the culture of security must be embraced by all members of society , big or small . <p> I saw the same determination and dedication in my mayor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this pandemic when that fierce driving force to bring services down to her constituents was , and to this day still is , the force that keeps her focused on her job as not only the chief executive officer of our city but also the mother that worked day and night to make sure everyone was included in the city 's rise and development . <p> Not too long ago , I also had the opportunity to participate in a party-list that is by women and for women . Angat Pinoy Partylist , together with Governor Anthony Del Rosario of HNP and his wife Aina , the partylist 's first nominee , paved the way , yet again , for me to take part in an advocacy that showed the strength of women even in a crisis . It 's time we all place our bets and certainly , I am placing my bet on all three women who not only have the potential but also the promise of upholding both honor and duty by keeping their word . <p> When I look back at my life 13 years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every aspect of my life in those days changed for the better because of the example I had learned from a woman who deserved not only the respect but , more so , the gratitude from Filipinos as she kept our country afloat as we resisted a crisis . Indeed , legacies are built by the strong and no one is exempt from adversity . We all have a fighter in us and because things must be done , we must do them bravely . I place my bet on the fearless three . I know they will come through just as they promise .

@@90838232 <h> The Short Corner : Dissecting how the UAAP crown found its way back to UP <p> Multiple times this season , University of the Philippines faced seemingly insurmountable odds -- and each time , the odds proved meaningless as they strung together comeback after comeback against the league 's most talented teams . <p> Game Three against Ateneo last Friday was no exception , as they battled back from a five-point deficit with a minute and 47 seconds left in overtime to wrest the crown away from the former three-time champion and bring glory back to Diliman for the first time since 1986 . <p> Here 's a look at how they got there , and how they eventually pulled it off . <h> Game One <p> UP hacked out an overtime victory to start off the series after finding themselves down by eight with 2:24 to play . This James Spencer trey that tied the game up and provided five extra minutes came off of staggered screens followed by screen-the-screener action , with a Ricci Rivero flare option as a failsafe . Chris Koon and Raffy Verano failed to realize the play as it unfolded and miscommunicated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a clean look from way behind the arc : <p> Beyond this , Ateneo ran their overtime offense through Ange Kouame , letting him try to create his own offense after Malick Diouf fouled out . The idea behind it was that Kouame had the size advantage over Diouf and he was playing well with 14 points at the end of regulation . The problem with this is that it made their offense predictable ; UP keyed in on him and held Ateneo to just four points ( all belonging to Kouame ) . <p> Under Tab Baldwin , the Blue Eagles ' offense was predicated on layers upon layers of options ; in Game One , they seemed to simplify it by hunting a mismatch that was n't really there ( Carl Tamayo and Zavier Lucero were tremendous during their stints guarding Kouame ) . In this crucial stop , Rivero could afford to leave his man and helped out on Kouame : <p> A key point in UP 's defense was their aggressive ball screen coverages . They moved their big man closer to the level of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They hedged , showed , and blitzed Ateneo after showing mostly drop coverage in the elimination rounds . <p> The aggressive coverage forced ball handlers to pick up their dribble and pass . From this point , UP excelled at rotating and tagging , which prevented passing lanes from opening up . In this play , Diouf blitzed SJ Belangel and left Kouame open . Tamayo knew where the pass would go and was ready to intercept the ball , and this led to an easy finish on the other end for Diouf : <p> UP 's offense also waxed and waned depending on which lead guard was on the floor . As per InStat , in 25 minutes of JD Cagulangan , UP had a 98 offensive rating ( ORTG ) . In 11 minutes of Terrence Fortea , UP had a 74 ORTG . In seven minutes of Gerry Abadiano , UP had a 71 ORTG . In four minutes of Brix Ramos , UP had a 63 ORTG . <p> It 's easy to see why Cagulangan is so important for UP 's offense . He led @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might be the best point A to point B ball-handler in the league , allowing him to get in the paint and collapse defenses . Here , he drew Kouame inside , which freed Lucero up for a triple : <p> Speaking of Lucero , he had his best game of the Finals here . He dropped 17 points , but the biggest thing was that he was disruptive on defense , allowing UP to slow down Ateneo 's league-best offense . <p> Watch how active he was on defense . Here , he made multiple positive contributions on defense that did n't show up on the box score -- he stopped Dave Ildefonso , deterred a Verano shot , forced Tyler Tio to pick the ball up , and showed on Gian Mamuyac : <h> Game Two <p> Ateneo has always been a team that adjusts very well . In Game Two , they showcased a few key tweaks that allowed them to beat UP by three . <p> Due to the aggressive coverages in Game One , UP forced a lot of turnovers after an Atenean picked up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . To combat this , the Ateneo bigs slipped the screen to provide a quick and easy passing outlet . The slip let Kouame gain steam , and the Blue Eagles took advantage of late and/or poor tags . This contributed to Ateneo cutting down their turnovers from 26 to 16 : <p> Ildefonso struggled in Game One and was held to just six points with six turnovers as Spencer forced him to his uncomfortable spots on the floor . Ildefonso did n't have the physical edge against the UP forward , so Ateneo set drag screens for him to give him space to work with and to let him gain momentum to go downhill . He had 10 points in the second game and went from being a -14 to a +8 . <p> Ateneo played its best defense of the season , and UP struggled to consistently bend it in a meaningful way . The Blue Eagles threw multiple looks , and their counterparts struggled to find any consistent offense whether they were facing a zone , a man defense , or a junk defense . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Tio and Verano switching here prevented UP from gaining any advantage from pick and rolls . Without an advantage or any clear passing lanes , Fortea tried to swing it to the opposite corner because Alarcon was somewhat open due to Ildefonso preparing to help on Tamayo if Kouame needed to rotate to protect the rim . That was a pretty easy pass to pick off : <p> UP 's best source of offense that game was Carl Tamayo , who finished with 18 points . His combination of size , skill , and shooting was oftentimes the only avenue for UP to bend Ateneo 's defense . He simply required a lot of defensive attention . The panic caused by him touching the ball leads to defensive errors . Here , two Ateneans came as he got the ball while Spencer was unguarded , so he made good on the opening created here and hit Spencer with a pass for a triple . <p> He may not be the best passer , but he 's not selfish by any means : <p> The biggest reason for the Game @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ score on him at the rim , or anywhere for that matter . As per InStat , this is how opponents have shot with Kouame as the primary defender . To be able to hold opponents to just 33 percent at the rim is a luxury that the Ateneo defense has . <p> Kouame had eight blocks on the night to completely shut down UP 's offense . Whenever an Atenean perimeter defender made a rare mistake , it did n't lead to much because more often than not , he was underneath the rim to send the shot back . His defensive impact is truly unmatched : <h> Game Three <p> UP and Ateneo spent most of the season as the two best offenses in the UAAP . In the last game of the series , defense was the name of the game , and every single point had to be earned . In particular , though , Ateneo was the one having a harder time getting good looks as UP continued its strategy of aggressive pick and roll coverages and supplemented it with solid help defense . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the players not involved in the pick and roll were ready to help , preventing Ateneo from finding a decent shot . At the half , Ateneo had a ridiculously bad 69.5 ORTG due to their inability to get any offense going outside of Belangel . <p> Ildefonso was particularly affected by UP 's defense , as James Spencer and Harold Alarcon were thorns in his side for the whole series . After a terrific season with Ateneo , he finished the clincher with just two points on one made shot . Spencer , nearly as tall , heftier , and quick laterally , prevented the Ateneo gunner from using screens , which negated the advantage we saw in the second game . <p> Ildefonso 's physical advantages were n't as visible when Spencer was with him . Watch him try to move Spencer here with his non-dribbling hand to no avail . This play also shows the excellence of UP 's help defense : Tamayo was there to strip the ball , and Diouf was ready in case Ildefonso made it to the rim : <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the game . As per InStat , Belangel 's shooting from inside the arc improved from 42.6 percent in the first three quarters to 68.2 in the fourth quarter . He is a player who plays better with the pressure turned up , and he reiterated that fact yesterday . <p> Belangel scored or assisted on 37 of Ateneo 's 69 points -- that 's more than half of their total . When UP was stifling their offense like they 've never experienced before , Belangel put the whole team on his back . With him on the floor , Ateneo was winning by six points ; with him on the bench , they lost by nine . It felt that no matter what UP did to him , he found a way to will the ball inside the hoop . <p> In this possession , Belangel hit a one-footed floater off of the wrong leg . It was simply just one of those nights : <p> Hopefully , his legendary performance wo n't be lost to time . Ateneo was really just one Belangel lay-up away from their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the previous game , Ateneo keyed in on Tamayo . The defensive attention poured onto him negated most of his scoring , as he was limited to just six points . The good thing though is that he used the defensive attention to help his teammates get easy points . <p> He finished the game with five assists . This was my favorite one : Tamayo got the ball in the post and all eyes were on him , with the five Ateneans inching closer and closer to where he was . With all attention on him , Diouf cut inside , and Tamayo fed for an and-1 layup . He was n't a good passer in high school , but he 's improved massively in that department as the season unfolded : <p> Before we get to what happened in overtime , let 's remember the man who got us there in the first place : CJ Cansino . <p> Cansino has been UP 's spark plug off the bench all season long , and this game was no different . In his first game back after missing every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had 14 points in just 11 minutes , including the big triple to send the game to overtime . He showed no signs of rust and made up for lost time by hitting four triples for a team that had sorely missed his shooting . <p> With Ateneo in a zone , UP opted to swing the ball around in hopes of changing the zone 's shape and creating a gap for an open shot . Cansino passed it to Cagulangan , forcing Gian Mamuyac to leave Cansino momentarily due to the rules of their formation . Cagulangan took advantage of this tiny advantage and quickly passed it back to Cansino . Belangel tried to close out , but he could n't get there on time to bother more . Cansino saw the rim , and that was more than enough : <p> Heading into overtime , everybody saw these teams as they were : Ateneo had the champion 's poise , but UP had the heart forged by multiple battles that went down the wire . Heading into the extra period , it was anyone 's game . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Belangel floaters ( his floater is honestly on par with the best practitioners in the pros ; as soon as he gets five to 10 feet away from the rim , he 's money ) . On this specific possession , UP was improperly set up on defense , giving SJ the breathing room needed to knife in for the shot : <p> This is where Cagulangan 's onslaught began . Spencer put the clamps on Belangel and forced him to throw it away . Tamayo intercepted it , and Cagulangan got the ball in semi-transition . He juked the hell out of Mamuyac , the league 's best perimeter defender , and the threat of him passing to Spencer in the corner confused Belangel and freed him for the shot : <p> It only got better for him from here . After Mamuyac hit a three , the Fighting Maroons found themselves down five with less than a minute and a half to go . On the inbound pass , Diouf crowds an entry probably meant for Rivero and chucked up a long two for reasons unfathomable . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boxout and took the ball back out . He knew the clock was ticking due to the airball and he , who came into this game a 15.4 percent shooter from deep , knocked down a fadeaway triple over Belangel . <p> Somehow things got even better . <p> This one just felt like the universe conspiring to make Ateneo lose . Belangel got a clean look at a layup , but he failed to convert . Kouame , a man who averages multiple putbacks a game , failed to tip it in . No other way to explain it other than Ateneo just not having luck on its side during the end game : <p> With a chance to take the lead or tie the game , Cagulangan waves off Rivero , who was asking for the ball in the corner . He opts for the spread pick and roll with Diouf ; Belangel fails to navigate the screen , and Kouame comes toward Cagulangan to prevent an open look . Ildefonso was too concerned with Rivero in the corner and failed to tag the rolling Diouf . With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the soon-to-be Finals MVP tied the game up with a two-handed finish . <p> Of course , things got much , much better . <p> In Ateneo 's last possession of the season , UP capped off a defensive clinic . Spencer expertly navigated through a Kouame butt screen and a re-screen ; in concert with Spencer , Diouf hedged to prevent a pull-up or a drive . This excellent point of attack defense forced Belangel to pick the ball up . With eight seconds remaining , Ildefonso was left on an island with the rookie , Harold Alarcon , to do the one thing he does best : get a bucket . Alarcon , however , stayed connected and did enough to bother the shot . <p> A lot of credit here goes to the coaching staff led by Goldwin Monteverde . They 've drilled their wards as best as they can , and the hard work bore fruit . And he never plays favorites ; he plays the ideal lineup depending on the situation . In this possession , Tamayo -- his golden boy from back when they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the bench in favor of Lucero because he and Diouf form the strongest defensive frontcourt on the team . <p> Now we get to the exciting part . Cagulangan , the transferee from La Salle , took matters into his own hands . He played 34 minutes and 27 seconds for La Salle in all of his UAAP appearances combined . In this one , he played 37 minutes and 45 seconds . Bawat segundo , sulit . <p> With the clock running down , Cagulangan opted for another spread pick and roll with Diouf . This time , Mamuyac failed to smoothly navigate the Diouf screen and Kouame gave Cagulangan a bit of space due to the possibility of another Diouf roll . Reading the situation , Cagulangan stepped back and hit the biggest shot in UP history , capping off a frenetic endgame flurry where he scored or assisted on 10 of UP 's last 13 points to etch himself in league history forever . <p> It does n't get any better than that . <p> This was a series that either team could have won -- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the players and their mentors . History would have been made either way , but there had to be a winner -- and for this season , the winner was UP . <p> This new-age roster completed the turnaround started by Paul Desiderio and the " Atin ' To " Maroons of Season 81 and did what many thought was improbable , if not unthinkable : beat Ateneo . It took stellar offensive performances from stars like Tamayo and Rivero ; suffocating defense from key players like Lucero , Diouf , and Spencer ; terrific scouting and game-planning complete with adjustments and rotation tinkering from Monteverde and his staff ; and an explosion by a breakout star in Cagulangan just to beat all odds .

Defeated in his bid for the vice presidency , outgoing Senate president Vicente " Tito " Sotto III banged the gavel to signal the resumption of their sessions . Sotto was VP runningmate of another " graduating " Sen. Panfilo Lacson as independent presidential candidate . <p> But Lacson and Sen.Manny Pacquiao lost their presidential bids to ex-Sen.Ferdinand " Bongbong " Marcos Jr .

Gordon suffered from presidential berating for his supposed railroading the Senate Blue Ribbon Committee probe into the alleged shenanigans in the anti-COVID protective equipment procured by the Duterte administration . <p> Of the 12 newly proclaimed Senators , the four re-electionist Senators reported back for duty as incumbents . They are , namely : incumbent Senate majority leader Juan Miguel Zubiri and Senators Sherwin Gatchalian , Joel Villanueva , and Risa Hontiveros .

@@91022231 <h> Marcos must resist going Sri Lanka 's way <p> Many may not realize the severity of Sri Lanka 's situation . The island republic is bankrupt . The Sri Lankan people face a shortage of food , fuel , medicines and electric power . At least 500,000 Sri Lankans have fallen into severe poverty in the last year alone . <p> Civil disobedience is rampant as the Sri Lankans call for the resignation of President Gotabaya Rajapaksa for mismanaging the economy . Under pressure , Rajapaksa re-appointed five-time Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe to pull the country out of its economic imbroglio . <p> Sri Lanka 's problems are in one part due to its flawed economy , another part due to populist policies and another part due to China . <p> At this juncture , let me say that the Philippines carries the same economic flaws as Sri Lanka . Thus , presumptive president Bongbong Marcos must pay close attention to the Sri Lankan experience to prevent the Philippines from going Sri Lanka 's way . <p> What are these economic flaws ? Like Sri Lanka , the Philippines imports substantially more than it exports . Our trade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood at $32 billion last year . Both countries spend more than it earns . The Philippine budget deficit was at $33 billion or 8.6 percent of GDP ( red flags ! ) last year . This is because both countries have weak manufacturing bases and are hopelessly import dependent . <p> Both economies are heavily in debt . While Sri Lanka is drowning with debts amounting to 111 percent of GDP , the Philippine situation is less acute but already at its maximum tolerable level of 63.5 percent of GDP . <p> Instead of focusing on manufacturing and creating the right conditions for businesses to flourish , both Sri Lanka and the Philippines relied on consumer spending to propel growth . Both turned to infrastructure spending to pump-prime their economies , largely financed by debts from China . China fanned the flames of debt as they carry steep repossession clauses in the event of default . The debts also include clauses that allow China to interfere with foreign and domestic policies . China led Sri Lanka and many countries to a debt trap . <p> President Rajapaksa bet on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President Duterte did . The deluge of investments never came and both Rajapaksa and Duterte ended up giving more concessions to China than they received . <p> Already in dire straits , President Rajapaksa adopted several populist policies that pushed his country over the edge . He announced deep tax cuts . Although popular , it eroded the country 's revenue base . He did so despite having debt obligations that the country could no longer meet . He planned on acquiring more debt to keep the country afloat . But credit rating agencies consequently downgraded Sri Lanka 's debts to default levels so access to new money became scarce . The country quickly ran out of cash to import its necessities , let alone meet its debt payments . <p> In April 2021 , Rajapaksa made another blunder . He banned fertilizer imports to save on foreign exchange . This caused farm outputs to plummet . Months after , he banned the importation of luxury goods and supplies , which effectively killed the tourism industry . In one fell swoop , Rajapaksa killed two of the remaining revenue generators @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but to default on its debts and restructure its $50-billion debt load . President Rajapaksa was reduced to begging his neighbors for financial assistance . Bangladesh threw a lifeline with a $200-million loan while India came through with $500 million . Still , it was not enough . Last March , the SL Rupee was devalued by 32 percent , further eroding the spending power of its people . This naturally caused inflation to spike to 30.2 percent . The price of rice increased by 93 percent . <p> Sri Lanka is going through its worse economic crisis since gaining independence in 1948 . Revenues have plummeted , debts are unmanageable , inflation is soaring and foreign reserves are down to barely $2 billion . <p> Although not as severe , Marcos will be inheriting an economy as flawed as that of Sri Lanka . What should he do ? On top of it all is fiscal prudence . Marcos must slash excess spending and corruption leaks , and get savings rates up . He must accrue foreign exchange earnings wherever we can get it . <p> There is no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away from import dependence and pivot from being a consumer-led economy to one that it production-based . He must narrow our deficits by increasing our tax base and exporting more goods and services . <p> This can be done through a manufacturing resurgence . This is a must . But we can not do it alone . We need foreign investment to provide capital and technology . The amendments to the Foreign Investment Act , the Public Service Act and Trade Liberalization Act are a boon ; however , much has yet to be done in terms of ease of doing business and building confidence in the new leadership . <p> I strongly recommend the formation of the Office of Strategic Investment Promotions ( OSIP ) , which is patterned after the highly successful InvestVietnam . <p> Not to be confused with the Board of Investments , the OSIP is proposed to be under the Office of the President . Its core function will be to undertake non-stop outbound investment missions , provide investor concierge services for ease in entry and liaise between government agencies and foreign investors . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aggressively pursue investors to fill supply chain gaps . <p> Of course , agriculture must be given due attention . We can circumvent the limitation of CARP , expensive agricultural inputs , the lack of technology and infrastructure by establishing Agri-Hubs in state universities . I will explain this innovative concept another time . <p> As for debts , Marcos must resist the lure of cheap infrastructure loans from China with strings attached . Public Private Partnerships are a better option . If borrowing is necessary , source domestically whenever possible . <p> We hope that Marcos will be an enlightened leader willing to shun populism and adopt policies towards strengthening the foundations of the economy . We hope he does not fall into China 's debt trap . The consequence is to go Sri Lanka 's way .

While Jayson Tatum serves as the fulcrum of the Celtics ' offense , he 's shooting just 29.4% from 3 . It 's dangerous to try to project Boston 's game plan , but it would seem that Tatum playing aggressive is what makes this offense run , and with 75% of Pritchard 's shots this month coming from deep , he stands to benefit most from a drive-and-kick offense . <p> Rebound Butler : Jimmy Butler is healthy , and as far as we know , a healthy Butler has cashed props consistently in games coming off a loss .

The events that have buffeted the world since then , if I even thought of them , would have seemed to be total fantasy . <p> I certainly did not foresee a deadly global pandemic that would lead to almost 15 million excess deaths in just two short years and the return of trench warfare in Europe . <p> These disruptions have had tragic consequences , not only for those directly affected , but also for those impacted by the knock-on economic effects , such as through the loss of economic opportunities and high prices . No one is spared , but the negative effects are more pronounced for those already living in vulnerable areas , either because of recent conflicts or because of the small size of their economies . <p> In Asia and the Pacific , this includes the significant populations of countries experiencing conflict like Afghanistan and Myanmar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Palau . Alas , some countries are vulnerable because they both conflicted and isolated , such as Solomon Islands and Papua New Guinea . <p> Such crises are likely to persist and lead to greater risk . The climate reports from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change show that greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise and present plans are insufficient to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees centigrade , the threshold scientists believe is the minimum to mitigate catastrophic impacts . <p> In the wake of the political and military conflagration in Ukraine , a recent article warns that the global economy will in the future be severely affected by " little fires everywhere " that could threaten entire societies . <p> The international community has consequently been ramping up its support to address the urgent humanitarian and development needs in fragile and conflict-affected zones . In fact , it has been doing that assistance for some time , with total bilateral official development assistance to fragile contexts amounting to $76 billion in 2018 , or 2.3-times the level of foreign direct investment and two-thirds the value of remittances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In extremely fragile contexts , ODA amounted to 11.5 times the level of foreign direct investment and 2.5 times the amount of remittances . If used properly , every $1 of aid spent on prevention on average leads to up to $16 in savings in terms of the cost of conflicts , according to World Bank estimates . <p> However , when it comes to ensuring aid effectiveness in fragile and conflict-affected states , more is not necessarily better . Aid can go to waste unless it is directed at the right priorities and is spent well , as shown in a new report by the Asian Development Bank 's Independent Evaluation Department ( IED ) . Examining the experience of ADB in providing more than $17 billion of support through over 1,600 projects in about 20 fragile- and conflict-affected states during 2013 to 2021 , the report stresses that such assistance must address capacity and coordination issues . <p> Capacity in government is more limited in fragile and conflict-affected zones than in other areas , making it more difficult to spend money properly .

For example , ADB 's introduction of a reformed project design and monitoring framework ( DMF ) , which identifies the assumptions behind the presumed logical links between what was being financed and the outcomes being promised , is going to be helpful . These assumptions are then monitored closely . <p> Coordination is key if there are many well-meaning entities trying to help . The IED report found that implementation may be hampered by bureaucracy and differences in procedures of governments and development partners . A harmonized approach to fiduciary controls , security rules , monitoring , procurement policy , and anticorruption provisions among development partners ( such as bilateral and multilateral development agencies and humanitarian organizations ) can help ensure the smooth implementation of development and humanitarian work in these contexts . The scope for donor coordination in fragile and conflict-affected areas can also include practical initiatives like joint donor offices , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Where possible , national civil society groups and other domestic actors can be included in diagnostic work to bring forth a shared understanding of constraints and opportunities .

Delivering aid as efficiently and effectively as possible in these contexts is key , not only to providing much needed short-term humanitarian assistance , but also to address the longer-term development challenges faced by fragile and conflict-affected states . <p> This is indeed a tall order that no one organization can achieve .

@@91619231 <h> Audience of One <p> A famous person once said , " Life imitates art far more than art imitates life " . Simply put , author Oscar Wilde wanted to show that art affects the way we look at the world . Whether such art is by way of poetry , film , or song , any composition is the creator 's unique way of interpreting events and circumstances around him . In the hit US T.V. series Prison Break , for example , " The Company , " a group of multinational corporate alliances , is portrayed to wield influence all the way to the White House . <p> Since this coalition funded the campaign and catapulted its candidate to the position of Vice President of the United States . The Company presumably holds control over the government 's voice on the energy bill and consequently , the country 's economy . Ostensibly , such elected official is beholden to her funders , based on that artistic rendition of US politics . Whether said TV series depicts real American political setting is a question for American viewers to answer . After all , reel life is man-made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes of the reel maker . <p> In the Philippine setting , a similar scenario comes with the filing of the statement of contributions and expenditures ( SOCE ) of candidates in the recently concluded national elections . As millions in donations were thrown the aspirants ' way to assist them in taking that coveted government seat , I wonder to what extent , upon winning , of indebtedness these elected officials are to their donors or sponsors . In civil law , donations are given to donees out of sheer liberality , with no strings attached . In election law , recipients of such donated funds are often bound by the Filipino cultural trait of utang na loob , which , in essence , requires repayment in exchange for the favor . Winning candidates , in different degrees , tend to please their donors more than the general public . For a few , such repayment goes beyond the ordinary debt of gratitude or the Western concept of owing one a good turn . In the present fabric of Philippine politics , it is almost always a certainty that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that of a commonplace constituent . To put it bluntly , the campaign funds given are in exchange for access , or worse , undue influence on decision-making and policy crafting . Needless to say , a politician acts to serve the interests of his financial contributors first , public interest second . In one online post , Associate Professor Joo-Cheong Tham said that political donations can " ... create a conflict between private interests and public duty and , therefore , create the possibility that holders of public office will give undue weight to the interests of their financiers rather than deciding matters on their merits and in the public interest . " Part of being human is to be swayed by the interests of those who helped you get such position . <p> In the 2016 elections , then presidential candidate Grace Poe was reported to be backed by taipans Eduardo Cojuangco and Ramon Ang . The same rumor hounded her fellow presidential aspirant Rodrigo Duterte who allegedly received million-dollar bequests apparently from the " elites . " Dismissing said tales , then candidate Duterte promised that should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not the elite . As his six-year presidential term is about to end , his actions in the past will help Filipinos ascertain whether President Duterte indeed relegated to the background the approbation of his " political donors " and concerned himself instead with serving the people . More specifically , since one could surmise that China may have " backed " President Duterte 's campaign in 2016 , Duterte 's seeming timidity in enforcing our country 's rights over the contested maritime waters is predicated on being beholden to China . Any politician who disregards the general welfare of the public to favor a campaign donor , who happens to be a bully , ends up displeasing the one Supreme Authority whose desire is to allow His people to enjoy what is rightfully theirs . <p> President-elect Ferdinand " Bongbong " Marcos , Jr . will inevitably choose between favoring the Filipino citizenry in general or serving the interests of his financial sponsors , in particular . Since his legal team declared that BBM did not spend any personal funds for his campaign , the P623,230,176.68 total expenses , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ donors . All told , these open donations mean that the campaign was fueled by big-money donors in anticipation of currying favors with an entire government , according to Ronald Mendoza , Dean of the Ateneo School of Government in Manila . He opined , and I agree , that " only a few can give such large amounts ... so you 're no longer accountable to people who voted you in . You become more accountable to the person who actually financed you . " Historically speaking , this reality of big donors controlling government " led to monopolies and economic stagnation since reforms were blocked and competition discouraged to enable campaign benefactors to recoup their investment . " Campaign contributions , regardless of source , do really come in handy and helpful . Stripped of the strings that may be attached to them , the donors behind these propellers ought to be grateful in times of victory . The candidates they financially supported win the elections and are given the golden opportunity to serve . Yet , some of these contributors push their politicians against the wall and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in instances when their demands run parallel with that of the public interest , a rarity these days . The more definitive aspect , however , is for these elected leaders to perform and please but one audience , never obliged to conform to the standards of the people , especially their financial contributors . <p> Government officials ought to always have in mind the standards of our Heavenly Father , which , in the matter of public service , cover the virtues of honesty , accountability , love for fellowmen , equality and respect , among others . These values are pleasing to God . When a leader aligns his decisions with what is pleasing to Him , the fruits of his service are enduring . When a public servant chooses to gratify the " people , " whose standards are fleeting and whose appreciation shifts in a flick of a finger , he becomes enslaved by their opinion and is shackled by their variable loyalty . Stated otherwise , when individuals are God-governed and God-pleasers first , then they restrain themselves from exercising power inappropriately . Regardless of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loob " and " pakikisama , " a leader should concern himself with pleasing not a multitude of constituents , or a handful of big-money donors , but of pleasing an audience of One . In the Bible , 1 Thessalonians 2:4 tells us that , " Our purpose is to please God , not people . He alone examines the motives of our hearts . " <p> In the advent of a BBM administration , I hope those BBM-chosen bureaucrats will never allow people , particularly BBM benefactors , to unduly influence their decisions . May these Cabinet members do what God ordains them to do , fulfilling God 's plan for the Filipino and not somebody else 's plan for their biased interests . Public service should never be about satisfying 100 plus million spectators . Genuinely serving the people simply entails pleasing an audience of One -- Our Heavenly Creator . It is God 's way of making the lives of His own creation imitate art . <p> A former infantry and intelligence officer in the Army , Siegfred Mison showcased his servant leadership philosophy in organizations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Law Offices , Infogix Inc. , University of the East , Bureau of Immigration , and Philippine Airlines .

@@91619232 <h> Covid-19 is still in our midst <p> The slight uptick in daily Covid-19 cases last week is a reminder that the pandemic is still much around despite the small victories we achieved in the economic and health fronts . President-elect Ferdinand Marcos Jr . himself has acknowledged after winning the May 9 elections that the pandemic remains a problem that his administration must deal with . <p> I welcome the decision of the Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases to keep Metro Manila and other areas under Alert Level 1 until June 30 , but I see no triggers that warrant a more restrictive classification . <p> As I 've been saying in this column before , we have to stay calm but vigilant in the continuing campaign to eradicate the epidemic . Pushing the panic button at this point will only disrupt our economic momentum and efforts to recover from the impact of the health crisis , which led to high poverty and unemployment rates in the past two years . <p> I agree with the sentiment of Trade Secretary Ramon Lopez that " mild Covid cases and low ICU utilization rate should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full Covid-related hospitalization rate was the main reason the government declared lockdowns in 2020 and 2021 . This is no longer the case this month , when hospital bed occupancy remains below 20 percent . <p> Vaccination and the administration of second booster shots to the wider population are the key to curbing the infection rate . It has been more than five months since the first booster shots were initially made available to adult Filipinos . Borrowing from the experience of other countries such as Israel , we may need the booster shots to keep our population protected . <p> Meanwhile , it will now be up to the incoming administration of President Marcos to decide on whether the Alert Level 1 status will stay or not after the end of the month . Alert Level 1 means indoor establishments and public transport may operate at 100-percent capacity for customers and passengers with full vaccination status . This more lenient status helped many businesses regain their customers and employ more workers and led to a lower unemployment rate in April . <p> The recent employment figures are encouraging . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lowest since the start of the pandemic , as the Philippine economy reopened . The ranks of employed Filipinos increased by 2.36 million from 43.27 million in April 2021 to 45.63 million in April 2022 . More Filipinos would have found jobs , if not for the supply chain disruptions and commodity price surges caused by the Russia-Ukraine conflict . <p> It is the poor and the unemployed that are most vulnerable to high prices of commodities , especially food . It is , thus , important that we sustain our economic recovery to generate more jobs and livelihood opportunities for the majority of our people . <p> With this in mind , the incoming administration and its health experts should perhaps craft an exit strategy from the pandemic that rules out the lockdown option and bolsters the vaccination drive at the same time . We have experienced that lockdowns are unproductive -- health- and economy-wise -- because Filipinos have already learned to live with the virus . <p> The economic rebound should be the guiding factor in any pandemic-related decisions . For one , face-to-face classes must resume @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in hard-hit sectors . <p> The gross domestic product may have expanded 8.3 percent in the first quarter of 2022 , but sustaining the growth level in the long term will require the proper development of our children , who have lost two good years of education amid the pandemic . We are still measuring the impact of such wasted opportunities on our future growth . The last thing we need is to keep our children off the schools for a few more years . <p> Sustaining the growth momentum will further enhance our employment picture , attract more foreign direct investments , reinvigorate the manufacturing sector , and improve domestic demand and support government finances . <p> But as the Philippines sustains its economic recovery amid the lingering pandemic , Filipinos should stay calm and be on their toes . For our incoming policymakers , the economic recovery should be at the heart of the pandemic solutions . 
@@91619233 <h> Treat your maid with respect <p> The International Labour Organization said there are 75.6 million domestic workers worldwide . Despite the enforcement of the International Domestic Workers Convention a decade ago , about 96 percent of them still do not enjoy a full range of social protection , according to the ILO . <p> " Even where they are legally covered , only one-in-five domestic workers are actually covered in practice because the vast majority are employed informally , " the ILO said . Most of those who enjoy the comprehensive social welfare protection are from Europe and Central Asia , while almost all of those employed in Arab States , Asia and the Pacific and Africa do not have such benefits . <p> To address the plight of these workers , ILO urged more countries to adopt the provisions of its convention No. 189 or the Domestic Workers Convention of 2011 or Recommendation 2011 , which stipulate the basic standards for the protection for domestic workers .

In a recent BusinessMirror article -- It 's time to give domestic workers across Asia-Pacific the rights they deserve -- she explained why it 's time for change . <p> " With whole families working and studying from home during lockdowns , domestic workers kept households running smoothly . Many stayed on to do this work , even though their workloads and hours increased , as did their isolation from family , friends and support services .

She said : " Every household that employs a domestic worker must ensure they are paying at least minimum wage and overtime pay ; that they sign workers up to social security and insurance schemes where they exist ; that they work in safety and free from violence and harassment ; and that workers have regular hours and rest days . " <p> In a recent survey conducted by the Department of Labor and Employment and the Philippine Statistics Authority , about 1.4 million Filipinos are working as domestic workers or " kasambahay " in the country . They account for about 3.2 percent of the labor force in the Philippines as of October 2020 . <p> We take pride in the fact that the Philippines is the only country in Asia that ratified the ILO 's Domestic Workers Convention .

@@91667232 <h> Shortcomings of the ' No Contact Traffic Apprehension ' policy <p> It 's been over a month after the May 9 , 2022 national election . With the cessation of my election-related activities and as promised during my campaign for a Senate seat that win or lose , I will continue my crusade for the people 's cause . <p> Therefore , my Make Sense column for this issue is about my questions on the constitutionality and/or legality of the No Contact Traffic Apprehension policy of the Metro Manila Development Authority . Empowered by a resolution that was signed by the mayors of Metro Manila , the MMDA has been implementing NCTA for over two decades , with no legal challenge being raised against the traffic policy yet . <p> I am discussing the NCTA issue because many Filipinos are hurting in silence because of the inefficient , if not absurd , implementation of NCTA by the MMDA .

Then the same thing happened again during the registration renewal of my other car . I could have let the MMDA 's inefficiency -- if not dereliction of duty -- pass when I fell victim to this in my first car . But not with my second car , otherwise I will be condoning the shenanigans at MMDA . Imagine , I only learned of my driver 's traffic violation after three years ! At a time when he was no longer working for me , and only during the third renewal of my car at LTO !

Nebrija said that , unlike the cameras used in the US where they can capture photos of the driver , the MMDA cameras are not technically capable of doing that . Then why should the MMDA implement the NCTA when it is not technically capable of efficiently implementing the program ? And why should the MMDA penalize the vehicle and not the driver who committed the violation ? Is this not an absurd traffic policy ? Lastly , why did it take the MMDA three years to inform the LTO about the violation ? To make it even worse , why was I not informed , as registered owner of the car , by MMDA about the violation ? It is for these reasons that I am seriously contemplating filing a case against MMDA . <p> To my knowledge , certain local government units in the National Capital Region have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of NCTA .

The NU women had last lorded it over the field in 1957 -- so long ago that perhaps only " walking encyclopedias " like my former Sports World editor , Tito Tagle , would remember the details , or the players . <p> Or perhaps that beloved NU matriarch , Leticia " Mommy " Paguia , the doting owner and only daughter of Mariano Jhocson , the original owners of the university and after whom the street was named , would be able to regale us with details of that 1957 title . But both are now playing their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bulldogs were so good this season , they swept the eliminations and also swept the best-of-three Finals , defeating erstwhile women 's volleyball powerhouse and 11-time champion De La Salle University . NU sailed to the UAAP women 's volleyball mountaintop on the wings of its home grown and home-honed core . It is only the third UAAP school to achieve a sweep of the elims after La Salle accomplished same in 2004 and Ateneo in 2015 . <p> All but two of the individual volleyball awards were won by NU . Skipper Princess Robles was Finals Most Valuable Player . Alyssa Solomon was Best Opposite Spiker ; Jennifer Nierva , Best Libero ; Camilla Lamina , Best Setter ; Sheena Toring Second Best Middle Blocker and Michaela Belen was both Rookie of the Year and league MVP . <p> The Lady Bulldogs ' win is reminiscent of how the NU Bulldogs also claimed the UAAP men 's basketball crown back in 2014 . Led by import Alfred Aroga and Gelo Alolino and expertly coached by Eric Altamirano , the Bulldogs also gave their University " the best gift ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made waves in UAAP basketball 60 years prior in 1954 . Just to give you an idea of how long ago that was , the Top Dog of that Season 17 campaign was basketball legend and Olympian , Narciso Bernardo -- a name that today 's Gen Z or even Millennials would surely not be familiar with . <p> Come to think of it , the length of time that NU had to wait for another championship in men 's basketball and women 's volleyball makes the University of the Philippines ' 36-year title drought pale by comparison . And do n't forget that the University of the East last won a basketball crown in 1985 ( Season 48 ) which makes its title drought even longer than University of the Philippines . <p> Of course , when it comes to hoping and waiting for a championship to come , very few would beat the undying patience of Boston Red Sox fans who waited 86 years -- from 1918 to 2004 -- to shake off the so-called Curse of the Bambino ( Babe Ruth ) to win another World Series @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose drought lasted from 1909 to 2015 . <p> In the National Basketball Association , there are teams and their fans whose faith and patience are also still being severely tested . The Philadelphia 76ers last won an NBA title in 1983 . The Atlanta Hawks last took home the Larry O'Brien Trophy in 1958 . The Sacramento Kings last had bragging rights in 1951 . And the Phoenix Suns -- who came so close in Season 74 , and also showed a lot of promise this year -- have yet to win their first National Basketball Association title . <p> The Suns are fifth-best in the NBA for all-time winning percentage and won three Western Conference titles in 1976 , 1993 and 2021 . It 's the Larry O'Brien Trophy that has been frustratingly elusive . <p> Well , they all can take inspiration from the Bulldogs , the Lady Bulldogs and the Fighting Maroons . Good things come to those who wait . But Destiny decides when the goodies will arrive .

This represents more backlog for projects like these that should have been implemented and completed so many years ago , " Regidor said . <p> He added : " Since the costs for implementing these projects are always increasing , even escalating considering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war in Ukraine , it becomes more difficult to finance these projects , especially through foreign funding . " <p> China has already signified its intention to renegotiate the deals , with its Embassy in the Philippines saying that it is open for " technical discussions . " Former Finance Secretary Carlos G. Dominguez III had said the Beijing-based Export-Import Bank of China ( Ceximbank ) would have imposed at least a 3-percent interest rate on the three railway projects . <p> " Major infrastructure projects like these take time to develop and costs need to be updated and justified by the benefits . While the benefits are established , the costs are ever increasing , thereby somewhat diminishing the attractiveness of the project . That said , the impacts of these projects will not be felt in the immediate , short , or even medium term , " Regidor explained . <p> Transport officials were sought for updates as to how the new administration intends to move forward with the projects , but they have yet to reply to the BusinessMirror 's queries . <p> Some lawmakers have already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sources such as official development assistance ( ODA ) deals from jurisdictions other than China . <p> They have also urged the government to consider placing the deals under the Public-Private Partnership ( PPP ) Program , the main infrastructure thrust of the administration of former president Benigno Aquino III . <p> Immediate solutions <p> For now , Regidor suggested that DOTr focus on developing other modes of public transport to immediately address the increasing demand for mobility and the current transport crisis . <p> " The new administration would be better off looking for solutions to transport problems that can be implemented immediately or over a shorter period . These include reforms in public transport regulations and operations that focus on increasing the supply side of public transport while also attempting to improve quality of service particularly on improving travel times for commuters , " he said . <p> Regidor noted that the previous administration 's Libreng Sakay ( Free Ride ) Program , an initiative that was adopted by the current administration , should not be part of the solutions list that the government should look into . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same poor quality of service and there are limited funds to cover most cities in the country . Perhaps exclusive lanes for public transport along most corridors -- not just Edsa -- can be considered , showing priority for public transport over private vehicles ? Motorcycle taxis and bicycles can also help reduce dependence on private cars but safety concerns need to be addressed to encourage people to bike or use two-wheeler taxis for their regular commutes , " he explained . <p> In the longer term , however , he still recommends the development of mass transit modes such as train systems . <p> False hopes <p> For his part , commuter group Komyut representative Toix Cerna lamented that the shelving of the three railway projects reflects how the previous administration deceived the public and gave them false hopes for better public transport systems . <p> " As commuters , the most painful part of the cancellations is the feeling of being given false hopes through press releases that swayed the attention of the public from their daily crisis to grandiose projects that the Duterte government promised , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> He appealed to the new administration to " focus on the transportation crisis , especially the lack of public utility vehicles on the road .

The public transport needs of today should have been addressed yesterday , " Cerna said .

" It made us reflect on the life we 're living . Do you live a life that 's defined by how you dress , or do you wear clothes to reflect the life you 're living ? " <p> The fashion world post-pandemic also saw an acceleration of trends that were already underway , from sustainability ( " What designers like Stella McCartney are doing with sustainable materials is really interesting , " says Arashan ) to a more laid-back approach to dressing and more vibrant colours , or what Arashan calls " a celebration of life " . <p> " Pre-Covid , colours were not so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bright pinks and yellows .

" Previously , I had this fear that wearing bright colours would be too loud , too attention-seeking , too out there . In Singapore , unfortunately , people tend not to experiment with fashion as much , so the chances of people stopping and looking are high . I 'm happy that I put my fears about colour aside .

@@93625232 <h> For a greener Philippines : Welcome , Euro 4 <p> With the horrendous traffic Filipino motorists face every day , switching to Euro 4 could just be the best consolation they can ever get . <p> As more cars traverse roads for longer periods of time , it 's inevitable that emissions will increase . And it 's not a particularly impossible scenario either ! Just think about the dreaded EDSA rush hour and you 'll have a clear picture of how bad traffic can get in the country . <p> Still , it is undeniable that more and more individuals and families rely on private cars to accomplish daily tasks and travels . Hence , several companies and institutions have shifted their focus on making sure that cars are greener . This is where Euro 4 engines and fuels come in . <h> What is Euro 4 ? <p> Euro 4 is a globally accepted European emission standard for vehicles that require the use of fuel with significantly low sulfur ( 0.005 percent , or 50 ppm ) and benzene ( maximum of 1 percent by volume ) contents . Euro 4 fuels are , therefore , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ levels of sulfur and benzene . Cleaner fuel means cleaner emissions and less pollution in the environment . <p> The Department of Environment and Natural Resources ( DENR ) has pressed for the implementation of the Euro 4 emission standards starting June 2016 . Euro 4 diesel and petroleum were originally scheduled for implementation in 2010 . <p> The DENR said the country lags behind in implementing the Euro 4 standards , as North America and Europe have had the Euro 3 standards upgraded in 2005 . And so starting January 1 this year , light-duty vehicles and passenger cars in the Philippines are expected to have met Euro 4 emission standards . <h> Why shift to Euro 4 ? <p> Upgrading to Euro 4 is said to be more than just saving mankind . Euro 4 , which lessens toxic sulfur content by 450 ppm from the present Euro 2 standards , also improves fuel economy and reduces emissions of free radicals . Euro 4 fuels improve power by enhancing engine lubrication and restores maximum engine performance by reducing and cleaning internal-engine deposits . They also minimize the effects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 4 fuels are expensive , as they require more refinery processing to lower the toxic sulfur content . But this will not greatly affect average prices of gasoline and diesel , as some independent petrol companies are now selling Euro 4-compliant fuels competitively . Euro 4-compliant cars also run greener and are more efficient due to the technological advances , especially in diesel engines . <h> PHL 2nd Euro 4 compliant in Asean region <p> While there was resistance for the newest global standard on fuels , the Philippines is second to Thailand in the entire Asean region in terms of compliance to the Euro 4 emission standards paved by the readiness of the local oil companies to produce the fuel products required for Euro 4 standards . <p> Some local automakers earlier said the DENR order was " too stringent , " and would cause them to incur additional costs , as they would be forced to immediately roll out new models with engines that are Euro-4 compliant . This can be seen in older models , such as the Pajero which is now Euro 4 compliant . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attributed to the readiness of the privately owned oil companies in the country . Because these oil firms are private , their approval processes are faster than the government-owned fuel firms . For instance , Indonesia and Malaysia 's oil firms are owned by the government . The two countries have postponed their Euro 4 compliance to 2020 . <h> Petron first to roll out Euro 4 diesel fuel products in the Philippines <p> Independent oil company Unioil was the first to make Euro 4-compliant fuels available in the Philippines . Unioil launched the first Euro 4 standard diesel fuel in the Philippines in 2012 . On the other hand , Petron Corp . introduced Petron Blaze 100 Euro 4 in 2014 , which was especially formulated to meet the Euro 4 standard . <p> But in the third quarter of 2015 , as the country 's largest oil refiner , Petron started the local production of Euro 4-compliant diesel products , offering a full-range of premium fuels to the market , in line with global standards ahead of the 2016 government mandatory deadline . <p> Last October Petron announced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ met global Euro 4 fuel standards . This makes the oil firm the first and only company in the country to locally produce a full range of premium fuels that meet the cleaner and more efficient Euro 4 global benchmark . <p> " We are proud that all of Petron 's Euro 4 fuels are made in the Philippines , and are especially formulated to meet the unique needs of our customers . We can guarantee the quality and properties of our fuels , since we produce them here , formulate them here and test them here , " Petron President and CEO Ramon S. Ang said . <p> Petron fuels are locally produced at its refinery in Bataan and formulated for Philippine driving conditions . <p> Petron invested $2 billion to further upgrade its Bataan refinery and make it on a par with the most advanced refineries in the region . Dubbed the Refinery Master Plan-2 , Petron can now produce more higher-value products , such as gasoline and petrochemicals , while eliminating negative margin fuel oil . <p> In the third week of January 2016 , PTT Philippines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Performa 97 , Superb 95 and Eco 93 ) and diesel ( Dynamic ) products were rolled out at all its retail stations .

To date , Hino has shifted to Euro 4 , while other providers are set to follow suit . <p> " Market inspection has to be looked into closely along with strengthened information , education and communication IEC campaigns , especially that the government is already implementing Euro 4 standards on all petroleum products sold in the market , as well as the nearing implementation of higher biofuel blends , " Energy Secretary Zenaida Monsada said . <p> The DOE circular states that " starting January 1 , 2016 , only gasoline and diesel fuels complying with the standard specifications for Euro 4 shall be allowed for sale at the bulk and retail levels in the country . " <p> The agency , according to the circular , will conduct " random quality sampling and testing of gasoline and diesel obtained from the facilities of the oil companies to ensure compliance .

For secondhand vehicles , which are not covered by the order , Environment Secretary Ramon J.P . Paje said he will coordinate with concerned government agencies to make sure that all secondhand vehicles entering the country are equipped with Euro 4-compliant engines . <p> In 2010 the government mandated that all new passenger and light-duty motor vehicles to be introduced in the market should comply with Euro 4 emission limits , subject to Euro 4 fuel availability , beginning January 1 , 2016 . <p> Clean-fuel advocates wanted the new vehicle-emission standards implemented earlier than 2016 , saying that it would take about 15 years to completely replace all the vehicles currently in use with cleaner ones . <p> Around 70 percent to 80 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vehicle emissions , while the rest came from stationary sources , such as industrial emissions , and area sources , like open burning , the DENR said . <p> As a measure of air pollution , the average recorded level of total suspended particulates ( TSP ) in Metro Manila in 2014 was at 118 micrograms per cubic meter , which was higher than the acceptable or national annual guideline value of 90 micrograms per cubic meter . <p> " Clearly , the key to improving Metro Manila 's air quality is by addressing the biggest source of pollution , which is motor vehicles , " Paje said . <p> Paje also urged the Department of Transportation and Communications ( DOTC ) to phase out 15-year-old vehicles , saying older vehicles have been known to consume more fuel and produce more emissions . <p> As a compromise to such a phase-out , Paje suggested that older vehicles be barred from major thoroughfares already prone to heavy traffic . <p> " Heavier traffic means more idling time for vehicles on the road . This leads to more emissions , and older @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> In line with this , the government will also require car manufacturers to produce Euro 4-compliant vehicles beginning this year . <p> As early as September , some car companies are already selling Euro 4-compliant units , which produce lower emission . <p> Honda Cars Philippines Inc .

This is second in terms of weight to food and non-alcoholic beverages in terms of weight . <p> Apart from protecting the purchasing power of families , the eight-point agenda also aims to reduce vulnerability and mitigate scarring from the Covid-19 pandemic . <p> This includes ensuring the capacity of healthcare in case there are Covid-19 surges ; addressing learning losses ; and strengthening social protection . <p> Further , ensuring sound macroeconomic fundamentals and government processes is essential in the near and medium term .

The government said the rest of the eight-point agenda will be dedicated to addressing the medium-term constraints to the country 's economic transformation . <p> This includes efforts to create more jobs through an increase in investments ; improving infrastructure ; and ensuring energy security .

It articulated the long-term aspirations of Filipinos , and will serve to frame future development plans . <p> Based on the results of the long-term vision , AmBisyon2040 , data showed Filipinos want a simple and comfortable life .

" We will focus on creating a vibrant innovation system that can generate new ideas , products and processes in order for the country to undergo economic transformation , " Daway-Ducanes said . <p> The PDP 2023-2028 will , according to Neda Undersecretary for Policy and Planning Rosemarie G.

The Plan will also be drafted with short-term issues in mind . <p> Edillon said that the game-changing reforms and policies passed or initiated in the previous administration shall serve as a strong foundation for these strategies . <p> These include the National Competition Policy , the Corporate Recovery and Tax Incentives for Enterprises ( CREATE Law ) , and the amendments to the Public Service Act , Foreign Investments Act , and the Retail Trade Liberalization Act . <p> More than these lofty goals and ideals , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think should be prioritized and what should be done to achieve not only the administration 's goals for the next six years but also of Filipinos who want a better life . <p> Based on surveys done during PDP consultations , Neda said the objectives of the plan that resonated the most among the private sector were transforming production sectors to generate more quality jobs . <p> The private sector also identified with the goals of having competitive products followed by developing and protecting capabilities of individuals and families , as well as practicing good governance and improving bureaucratic efficiency . <p> " For a nation of over 110 million people , a unified and cohesive development plan enables all of us in the public sector to work collaboratively so that our efforts are concerted and geared towards common goals .

As for employment , the number of full-time employees ( FTEs ) in the country increased by 120,000 in 2021 , bringing the sector 's total headcount to 1.44 million and recording a growth of 9.1 percent compared to 2020 . <p> Madrid described such robust growth in both employment and revenues as " beyond recovery , " noting that this " marks a resurgence for the Philippine IT-BPM sector . " <p> IBPAP , the flagship organization of the IT-BPM sector , attributed the growth to pent-up demand from global customers ; higher confidence in work-from-home ( WFH ) setups by clients in contact centers and business process services ; and growth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ technology . <h> Global perspective <p> MEANWHILE , on a global scale , the executive summary of Philippine IT-BPM Sector Roadmap 2022 shows that India and the Philippines share the same spot as global leaders in the IT-BPM sector and remain at the forefront of voice and non-voice BPM as well as IT services . <p> The executive summary noted that India has Good IT infrastructure and service capabilities and a large talent pool while the Philippines has high adaptability to Western culture and has language and service orientation as its competitive advantage . <p> As for the economic headwinds , Madrid stressed that " at the base level , " the depreciation of the local currency would appear to be in favor of the cost optimization of the Philippine IT-BPM players . However , he emphasized that the strength of the US dollar also affected other currencies , including those of the emerging IT-BPM locations . <h> " It 's a volatile situation and we 've seen the recent strength of the US dollar affect other currencies as well ; and many of those currencies are also the currencies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ analyze it in that light . So at an immediate level , it would appear that this would favor the cost competitiveness of Philippine IT-BPM players but it 's not the only factor , " the IBPAP head said in a virtual press conference last week . <p> With this , he shifted to the more " critical " component in driving investments into the local IT-BPM industry . <p> " I think the experience of the past two years has really highlighted the more critical , in my opinion , component of talent and the quality of talent and the employability of talent as an investment consideration , " Madrid noted . <p> Madrid said cost optimization from investors and employers in the industry and its customers is " always an important consideration in growing the offshoring business . " <p> The head of IBPAP also noted that over the past decade , a lion 's share of the industry 's global customer and the unceasing demand for Filipino talent has come from North America . <p> In fact , Madrid said , " our estimate is that 70 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I believe that share will continue to be maintained . " <p> However , he added , the fastest-growing percentage of business has come from the Asia-Pacific region . " It will remain North America but we have seen demand for Filipino talent from our APAC neighbors . " <p> " I believe our Filipino employees will continue to be our main competitive edge . We have a proven history of resolving customer queries , " Madrid said . <p> Notably , according to an article by Outsource Accelerator , the global BPO market is projected to reach $513 billion by 2030 at a compound annual growth rate ( CAGR ) of 8.5 percent . <p> " The rise and growth of the BPO industry will also be fueled by innovation , global rivalry , and new technologies as outsourcing gives companies the ability to enhance earnings while reducing costs , " read the article which was published on July 15 . <p> Meanwhile , region-wise , the article stated , " Asia Pacific will remain the fastest-growing with an estimated value of $148 billion by 2030 at a CAGR @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ltd. , Infosys Ltd. , Accenture and Wipro are driving market expansion by increasing demand for talented workers , lowering labor costs , and making significant digital investments . " <h> Work-from-home <p> ALONGSIDE the criticality of the Filipino talent is the preferred work arrangement that has been the talk of the town as Filipino employees continue to transition from the pandemic to the " new normal . " <p> Prior to ironing out the issue on the work-from-home arrangement of IT-BPM firms , these enterprises had to go through regulatory adjustments such as complying with the work-from-home threshold set by the Fiscal Incentives Review Board ( FIRB ) . <p> In March , the Bureau of Internal Revenue ( BIR ) warned that income tax incentives granted to registered business enterprises ( RBEs ) in the IT-BPM sector will be suspended if they violated the said threshold . The IBPAP stood firm in its position on the WFH/hybrid work and the legal basis of the letters of authority ( LOAs ) granted by the Philippine Economic Zone Authority ( PEZA ) to allow 30 percent WFH arrangement until September @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a week before the WFH threshold expired , the IBPAP disputed the FIRB 's claim that the extension of the work-from-home ( WFH ) set-up has no legal basis . Madrid earlier stressed that this is " inconsistent " with the objective of attracting and retaining investors in the country 's " biggest job-generating industry and contributor of foreign exchange revenue . " <p> The IBPAP chief asserted that the flagship organization of the IT-BPM industry 's push to have WFH/hybrid work set-up goes beyond business continuity plans ( BCP ) . Madrid pointed out that this is more to adapt to global work trends for business flexibility that investors look for and to strengthen Philippines 's competitiveness in retaining existing and attracting new IT-BPM investors . <p> For its part , the Employers Confederation of the Philippines ( ECOP ) also earlier called on the government to encourage productivity improvement by supporting flexible work arrangements . <h> " To create an environment that will encourage more inflows of investments , remove red tape , allow ease and flexibility of doing business , protect employers ' rights to manage their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supporting alternative and flexible work arrangements , " read the Conference resolutions document that the business group released in August . <p> Just last month , a week after the much-awaited decision on the WFH arrangement , the FIRB put an end to the rift by allowing the transfer of registration of IT-BPM enterprises from PEZA to the Board of Investments ( BOI ) , since BOI is the only investment promotion agency ( IPA ) not affected by the boundary constraints or zone limits . <p> The DTI noted that with the transfer , IT-BPM firms can become eligible for increased WFH setup . <p> With this transfer , these firms can continue accessing fiscal incentives without violating Section 309 of the National Internal Revenue Code of 1997 , as amended by the Corporate Recovery and Tax Incentives for Enterprises ( CREATE ) law . <p> The IBPAP chief hailed this decision , noting that the WFH/hybrid setup is a " game-changer " for the Philippines and the sustainability of the IT-BPM sector . Further , Madrid said this will be a contributing factor to the industry 's ability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generate billions more in annual investment revenues and foreign exchange , and increase the sector 's countryside footprint by 2028 . Of the 1.1 million direct jobs it is expected to create , the IBPAP said 54 percent of these will be in the countryside . A good indicator that , beyond simply boosting aggregate growth , the sector can help disperse development and create jobs more evenly . <h> Navigating ' new normal ' means facing pre-pandemic transportation woes <h> Related Posts <p> IT was sheer serendipity that on the day BusinessMirror released its anniversary folio marking its 17th anniversary , a 108-year-old maritime icon from Norway would sail into Manila 's port as part of a global navigation .

Both short-term and long-term measures were proposed . Then , it was just a warning . Now , it is a real volcano waiting to explode -- the health care system will collapse and we will declare a code red in the very health sector in the middle of a pandemic that is not over yet . <p> Few years back , Philippine nursing envisioned itself as the best for the Filipinos and the choice of the world . Filipino nurses are now the choice of the world . But they can only be best for the Filipinos if they choose to stay . But why will Filipino nurses close their eyes on the amazing offers of foreign employers when they remain as contractual employees with status as job orders in higher paying government hospitals ? On one end , the private hospitals hardly can compete with government hospitals , which by law is mandated to give salary Grade 15 . And the biggest issue of positive practice environment remains unsolved in many health care settings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of tenure , working condition , career progression , and benefits , among others . <p> Before the pandemic , the WHO declared the global shortfall of 5.9 million nurses . This is surely exacerbated by the increase in demand brought about by the pandemic . The nursing schools are having good enrolment these days but schools can not accept beyond what their faculty members and resources can handle . And there is scarcity in the supply of qualified faculty , which the nursing law has spelled clearly in terms of educational and clinical qualifications . Many of them have left for greener pasture . <p> The regulatory authorities of nursing education along with advocates of quality nursing education have every reason to protect the quality of graduates in the light of recently remembered oversupply and poor quality of nursing graduates . They have valid anxiety about the commoditization of nursing education anew . The moratorium on the opening up of nursing schools was lifted recently . The Technical Panel for Nursing Education of the Commission on Higher Education is even presenting the regions with scarcity in the supply of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CARAGA , BARMM , CAR and SOCCSKSARGEN regions as code red for their need for more nursing higher education institutions . <p> Private hospitals through the Private Hospitals Association of the Philippines ( PHAPI ) have expressed alarming concern over the scarcity of nurses for their staffing requirements . Some hospitals have offered comparable attractions with their global competition only to keep their nursing human resource . Big medical centers may be able to compete while the others are desperately praying for PhilHealth efficiency so that their financial mess can be addressed and be able to cope somehow . Some have closed units just to survive the pandemic disruptions . Increasing nurses ' salary in the private sector may prompt other health workers to demand corresponding increase as well . This may cause a more expensive health care . <p> The solution <p> Necessity breeds innovation . Through my consultancy for the Skills International Company Inc . ( SICI ) for a couple of years , a pioneering idea was born . This is supposed to be a secret ingredient . But with its President Marivic Daas and son Robi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help in solving the crisis , in the short-term and long-term . In a casual conversation , I am glad that nursing luminary Dr. Carmelita Divinagracia shared a similar concept , which Board of Nursing Chair Elsie Tee also commended as a probable solution . <p> Here are some doable solutions , which SICI and I have pioneered . <p> First , there has to be scholarships not for traditional beneficiaries from basic education but for the graduating nursing classes . This will arrest the decline in population towards the last two years in nursing due to the increasing financial cost of nursing education approaching the final years . The government funds may be funneled to this for immediate results and shortened return-on-investment . <p> Graduates of government universities and colleges of nursing and the other scholars of government in nursing must be required by law ( hopefully , the New Nursing Law ) for a return of service for a specified duration , as employees with usual salary and benefits , to ensure a return on taxpayer 's investment for their education and other social services , and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This may also give them an opportunity to experience the sense of fulfillment in caring for Filipinos , especially the underserved . This may awaken the deeper sense of nationalism that may mitigate the temptation to work overseas . <p> One out-of-the-box idea is for foreign employers to begin their headhunting during the final years in college . They may invest on this early to build an inspiring relationship towards a career development strategy . Does this investment end in a scholarship ? No . It continues . <p> Upon graduation , the scholars of these prospective foreign employers may engage the partner private hospitals in the country for a special engagement to deploy their nursing scholars in clinical areas to gain competencies that they prefer . The prospective nursing staffs are therefore trained and experienced for clinical competencies they need . This may commence immediately upon graduation and even while preparing for licensure and other qualifications and certifications . <p> And here is where the foreign employers may help further -- subsidize nurses ' salaries as they gain the required years of experience and train for the particular competencies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attract nurses . This will help nurses train with an end-in-mind of attaining proficiency towards an assured foreign employment that they wished from the beginning of their nursing journey . This will also help the prospective foreign employers to ensure the required competencies for their prospective staff . This strategy proposes a triple win scenario for aspiring nurses who will be preparing for future employment , the private hospitals in the Philippines availing of a subsidized salary for their human resource for a year or two , and the prospective overseas employers who , in time , will gain the adequately trained and experienced nursing staff . For as long as the supply-chain continues , no one loses . The cycle will continue . <p> This solution should not be mis-interpreted as commoditization of nursing professionals but as a strategic alliance to address the nursing crisis . <p> Are we pushing the nurses away ? No ! We shall engage them as solution to our current crisis . After all , there is no way we can prevent our nurses from choosing to work overseas as this is their right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " evil " only during the pandemic but would not have acceptable value for long and in the post-pandemic times . We have to give our nurses more reasons to stay , for a few years or even forever . But nurses should be given reasons , which in fact many , including this writer , have found . <p> As the Philippines values the overseas Filipinos as heroes because of their sacrifices and contribution to the economy , the case of nurses is different . While it is true that there is no place like home , home is what other countries are offering our nurses by allowing them to bring their families and establish a new home through migration . We take pride in our nurses who are so in demand overseas . But we are afraid that the supplier of nurses to the world runs out of supply of nurses for itself . <p> Filipino nurses are highly in demand all over the world , especially in developed nations .

@@94423235 <p> NEW YORK -- The New York Yankees ' season was crumbling again , like it had every year since Aaron Judge first arrived in the Bronx , bounding too fast toward another failure . From April through September , Judge had lived what looked like the idealized baseball life , full of acclaim and records , so prolific that his name and a special number in baseball lore became intertwined to the point of indistinguishability . Judge , all the while , never paid it any attention . While the world trained its collective eye on him , on his achievements , he was looking at this moment , October in Yankee Stadium . And it was playing out so much differently in reality than it did in his mind 's eye . <p> Nothing about his behavior changed , not as the outs left in the season whittled away , as the truth of his disappointing postseason contributed to the funereal atmosphere of the ballpark , as the specter of his future and whether he 'd ever again wear a Yankees uniform sharpened into focus . Judge could have pirouetted in the outfield to catch glances of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to acknowledge the emotion , the pure sort of love that only the most super of stars feels with the city that deifies his rise . But no . That would have been a betrayal of himself . <p> Judge ascended to the top of his sport through rigor and exactitude , convinced in his belief that a blinkered , perfectly straightforward existence , as crisp as the pinstripes on his jersey , would deliver him the championship that mattered to him far more than the obsession of others . The ninth inning arrived , just as 170 other ninth innings had this year , and the context of it , the urgency , did nothing to alter his ingrained habits . He jogged to right field . Warmed up his arm . Threw the ball into the bleachers for a fan to cherish . Watched the Yankees record three outs . Loped back into the dugout . Stepped into the on-deck circle . Took a few swings . Moved into the batter 's box . Inhaled a deep breath . Swung and missed . Stared at strike two . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the final out of the Yankees ' 2022 season , the year that was his until it was n't . <p> Before Judge made it back to the dugout , " New York , New York " had started to play on the stadium 's loudspeakers . If he could make it here , he could make it anywhere , and no longer was that a hypothetical . His season was over . Free agency beckons . Judge is the best homegrown Yankee since Derek Jeter -- " He 's the planet , " said CC Sabathia , a mentor and former Yankees teammate , " around which everything orbits " -- and this offseason , he will choose where he plays next . For someone as disciplined as Judge , someone who says the same prayer of thankfulness and grace every time he goes to right field to start a game , who venerates stability and sameness , this winter , and the manifold unknowns it holds , will tilt that planet off-axis more than anything to this point in his career . <p> Judge has spent his entire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his rookie year , the famously traditional guardians of Yankee Stadium built a special section , the Judge 's Chambers , replete with wood paneling , in the right-field stands . This season , his pursuit of the American League home run record that had stood for six decades -- and before that was held by Babe Ruth -- earned the attention of millions and a multiplicative number of dollars . In six years , Judge and the Yankees have become a pairing that feels as perfectly suited as any in baseball . <p> " He exemplifies what being a New York Yankee is all about , " Yankees first baseman Anthony Rizzo said . " His demeanor , the way he handles himself on the field , the way he handles himself off the field . " <h> The best of Aaron Judge <p> Check out all our latest coverage and favorite stories from the slugger 's historic season . <p> Until Judge 's successful chase of a record-setting 62nd home run , the Yankees ' brand had not been so closely associated with present-day excellence since their 2009 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a matter of when rather than if . And yet there is nothing linear about the winter ahead . Los Angeles offers sunshine and winning , San Francisco an easy car ride for his dutiful parents to make from the small central California town where he grew up , a borough-hop to Queens to play for the Mets an option if Judge enjoys the trappings of New York without the traps of being a Yankee . It is a mess of curves and twists , of sales pitches and posturing , of fantastical amounts of money and the duties that dollars connote . Judge , the son of two educators , already is a richer man than he could ever have imagined . He was making $19 million this year and , over the course of the season , played himself into a deal that should exceed $300 million . <p> That 's still true , even after Judge went 5-for-36 in seven postseason games . That final out capped a 1-for-16 showing in a humiliating American League Championship Series sweep by Houston . Two dreadful weeks wo n't stop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get the Yankees there in the first place . In the second-unfriendliest hitting environment of the past 30 years by OPS -- only 2014 's .700 was lower than this season 's .706 , and it has been a half-century since a worse batting average and on-base percentage -- Judge was as head and shoulders above his peers in hitting as he is in stature . <p> But as scattered boos rained down from Yankee Stadium , as they did once on Jeter , they were a stark reminder that being a Yankee is byzantine , obtuse -- antithetical to Judge 's simple , Point A-to-Point B approach . It 's what complicates his return , which across the industry is seen -- perhaps fallaciously -- as a fait accompli : Even if he is built for New York , is New York built for him ? <p> Amid the chase this fall , the 30-year-old Judge made it clear , whenever he spoke , that wins mattered more to him than home runs , that he 'd happily eschew the aesthetics for something more substantive . He operated on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the team . The better the team , the likelier to end a World Series drought that had reached a dozen years . However much the home runs captivated and enthralled , they were only a means to an end that goes beyond 62 and centers on 28 , the number of the next championship for the Yankees . <p> As the home runs piled up , excellence metamorphosed into a quest and history became actuality , Judge addressed individual achievement in plural -- us , we , our . His allergy to speaking in the first person endured as he led baseball with 131 RBIs , 133 runs , a .425 on-base percentage , a .686 slugging percentage , 391 total bases and 11.5 FanGraphs wins above replacement . All the while , as he built this monolith of a season , he harkened back to his days in college , where his coach fined players $1 every time they said " I " or " me " or " my . " <p> Vincent Carchietta-USA TODAY Sports <p> It 's one reason the Yankees are perfect for Judge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a cog that had might as well go nameless , fit for the only team whose jerseys identify players only by number . Throughout ballparks this summer and fall , jerseys with his No. 99 on the back filled the stands . <p> But this winter , Judge faces a decision he 'll have to own . There is no " we " in free agency . It is him , alone , in complete control of his own actions , which is n't necessarily an unfamiliar position . He authored one of the most remarkable regular seasons in the history of a century-and-a-half-old game against the backdrop of rejecting the Yankees ' seven-year , $213.5 million contract extension offer during spring training . Even then , Judge revealed a glimpse of the self-assuredness that will have to carry him through this winter . <p> On that April day , Yankees general manager Brian Cashman went public with details of the offer , peeving Judge .

@@94423237 <p> The 2022 World Series begins Friday night with the Philadelphia Phillies taking on the host Houston Astros . The Phillies are coming off a dramatic NLCS win over the Padres , while the Astros are fresh off a shocking sweep of the Yankees in the ALCS . So what should we expect from this edition of the Fall Classic ? <p> Our experts have tackled some of the most important questions surrounding how bettors should approach World Series betting and futures . Here 's what they have to say . <h> The World Series is set , with the Houston Astros ( -190 ) having swept their way into the affair , ready to face the underdog ( and loving it ) Philadelphia Phillies ( +170 ) . Let 's start simple : Who do you like to win and why ? Do you want to call your shot with the number of games it takes the winner to wrap it all up ? <h> NFL London : Broncos vs . Jaguars <p> The Broncos take on the Jaguars across the pond at London 's iconic Wembley Stadium on Sunday at 9:30 a.m . ( ET ) exclusively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ live NFL games , highlights , originals , analysis and more all season long . <p> Eric Karabell : As much as I would love for my hometown team to continue stunning the baseball world and completing a magical playoff run , even I can not logically bet against these Astros . So much pitching . Enough offense to match the Phillies . Better defense for sure and a better , more reliable bullpen . Lots of playoff experience and a team motivated to get a Hall of Fame manager his first title . Phillies take two games and Houston wins in Game 6 at home , though . <p> Todd Zola : I mirror Eric , but without a hometown rooting interest . From a fan 's point of view , I very much enjoy watching Aaron Nola and Zack Wheeler pitch , but asking at least one , perhaps both , to defeat the Astros twice is a reach . Houston is too balanced , without a major weakness anywhere . Astros in six feels right . <p> Tristan H. Cockcroft : I 'd love to pick the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fiery bunch in their own right , but ca n't imagine picking against an Astros team this balanced , especially on the pitching side . I 'm with Eric and Todd in that I think it 's a six-game series , with the Astros taking their three at home . Home-field advantage seems a huge deal in this particular World Series . But what 's interesting from the betting angle is that an Astros sweep does n't have longer odds , since I expect most people to predict a six- or seven-game series and some even going for the Phillies upset . I 'd have figured those odds would be closer to those for a Phillies five-game victory , but I 'm admittedly tempted , nevertheless . Hear me out : No team has ever swept a three-or-more-series postseason , the regular-season wins disparity between these teams is the widest in 116 years , and Dusty Baker has never managed a team to a title ( he won a ring as a player in 1981 ) . I 'm latching onto the prospective storyline , but there 's also something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or close , six- or seven-gamer where the Phillies battle them to the end , and nothing in between .

I was n't in on him last round because at the time he had n't found his hitting stroke , but he certainly did during the NLCS . <h> Who do you like to take home the series MVP hardware ? The current favorites are Yordan Alvarez ( +600 ) and Bryce Harper ( +650 ) , with Justin Verlander ( +900 ) and Kyle Tucker ( +1000 ) close behind . <p> Karabell : I picked Verlander to win MVP against the Yankees , but he only got to pitch once ! I think he gets two starts this time around and wins them both , something like 13 ? excellent innings with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He 's a motivated player at the top of his game . <p> Zola : Let 's double down with Alvarez and say his power will manifest in a World Series MVP . <p> Cockcroft : Series MVP is one prop I 'm not eager to play , since both rosters bring too many solid options , but Verlander would be my favorite for the honor . I do think those going for the Phillies in this series would get good value out of Wheeler ( +1700 ) or Schwarber ( +1300 ) , however . <h> On to Game 1 ! The Astros are -170 to the Phillies +140 for the first game of the Fall Classic . The total is 6.5 . Who do you like in Game 1 ? <p> Karabell : Verlander is going to pitch well , allowing a Harper solo home run and little else . Do n't expect the Astros to score much off Zach Wheeler , either , but he allows two runs and a 3-1 Astros win sounds about right . <p> Cockcroft : I 'm with Eric in that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think the Astros ' bullpen provides the edge , probably something like a 3-2 victory . @ @ @ management 's reassurance fuels ' NSD-like ' run for Phoenix <p> PHOENIX Super LPG closed n roller-coaster October on a high note in the 2022-23 PBA Commissioner 's Cup . <p> The Fuel Masters were shrouded in uncertainty to begin the campaign when news leaked that a garnishment notice was issued to the bank accounts of Phoenix Petroleum , including a bond that the company paid when in entered the league in 2016 . <p> Predictably , Phoenix played like a team with an uncertain future , losing its first three games . <p> Since then , however , Phoenix has n't lost a game , winning five in a row to match the longest winning streak of the conference set by Magnolia to start the conference , capping the month with a 91-88 victory over TNT . <p> It was revealed that Phoenix team governor Raymond Zorilla spoke to the team in the middle of the slump to assure the players that the Fuel Masters will not be sold as feared .

@@95088237 <h> The Philippine economy : Moving ahead in a rough and tough road <p> Last week , Dr. Alvin P. Ang , Senior Research Fellow at the Ateneo Center for Economic Research and Development , gave a briefing on the current state and outlook of the Philippine economy . Today 's column summarizes his presentation , which he organized as follows : 1 ) the latest picture of income , jobs , and prices ; 2 ) other indicators ; and 3 ) expectations . <p> Regarding income , the Philippine economy needs to grow by just 4.5 percent this year to get back to its 2019 level . Thus far , economic growth has been faster than expected . However , had there been no massive economic shock , the economy could have grown by 6.1 percent annually since 2019 , which implies a significant opportunity loss . With the reopening of the economy , though , consumer expectations are almost back to pre-pandemic levels . In fact , both consumption and investment spending have driven the recent brisk growth of 7.6 percent . <p> Revenge spending to relieve pandemic-related stress is evident , as consumption is mostly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 2 ) restaurants and hotels , and 3 ) transportation . Data from the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas ( BSP ) show that , from 2019 to 2021 , savings increased across the board , regardless of demographics . The recent decrease in savings implies that people have been unloading their savings to finance their revenge spending . How long this can be sustained , however , remains to be seen . <p> Industry sector growth has been weak , but services sector growth has shown a remarkable uptick driven by the following : 1 ) wholesale and retail trade ; repair of motor vehicles and motorcycles ; 2 ) transportation and storage ; 3 ) financial and insurance services ; 4 ) professional and business services ; and 5 ) accommodation and food service activities . <p> Regarding jobs , employment growth in manufacturing and retail appears to match income growth . Both the number of unemployed persons and the unemployment rate have declined , although they are still higher than they were before the pandemic . The latest number of employed persons is higher by about five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . <p> Despite significant growth spurts , the structure of income remains skewed . In fact , the disposable income of the top decile is about 14 times that of the bottom decile . Poverty incidence , whether across families or across population , remains elevated . Indeed , a dramatic reduction in poverty and a significant improvement in employability can be achieved if the productivity of the agricultural sector increases , since agriculture is the predominant occupation in areas where it is safest to reopen . <p> Regarding prices , today 's inflation is still largely cost-push in nature ( i.e. , externally driven and due to the supply side ) . In the US , contractionary monetary policy to curb its demand-pull inflation has led to peso depreciation . Food and transportation , which are linked to commodity imports , are fueling inflation in the Philippines . <p> Initially , the BSP saw no need to match US interest rate hikes point by point because Philippine inflation was not as high and was more due to supply disruptions ( especially in meat and fish ) . However @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prices of fuel , fertilizer , and wheat . Further peso depreciation can worsen inflation itself , so the BSP is now compelled to tighten money supply to arrest both inflation and depreciation . Of course , raising interest rates runs the risk of dampening economic growth , but Philippine economic managers see that there is still room to absorb rate hikes . <p> Regarding other indicators , fortunately , there appears to be enough import cover to sustain the economy in the short term . Remittances are back to pre-pandemic levels . Business process outsourcing industries are still contributing a significant amount of revenues . Nevertheless , tourism arrivals are still way below pre-pandemic levels . <p> The Philippines has the lowest level of foreign direct investment in Southeast Asia , but it does not have the worst debt-to-GDP ratio . Philippine debt is more domestically sourced and long-term , so income growth can outpace debt growth . However , the most productive sectors are also the ones that employ the least , so there is a need to stimulate other economic activities that create the most benefits for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Agriculture , manufacturing , and housing are seen as promising sectors . <p> Lastly , regarding expectations , OFW remittances will remain high , especially with higher exchange rate , for unfinished pre-pandemic plans like housing , education , small businesses , and leisure . BPOs will likely offer more flexibility due to expanded work-from-home arrangements . Tight labor markets in Western countries are seen increasing BPO activities . Middle-class earners will likely forego vehicles , but their credit purchases will increase . SMEs will likely recover , but not yet back to their pre-pandemic levels . <p> Growth will likely be brisk in Q4-2022 such that the government target for the whole year can be exceeded . <p> Dr. Ser Percival K.

@@95088238 <h> The Manunuri honors RoxLee : Pioneering saboteur of film forms <p> It was merely a few days before the world went on lockdown -- we never knew a phenomenon like that would come in our lifetime -- when independent filmmakers , mostly regional and unheralded , gathered in Naga City for the 12th Cinema Rehiyon . <p> Coming mostly from the peripheries , the filmmakers , curators and programmers were used to the non-mainstream kind of cinemas . Experimental , abstract , self-conscious sometimes , ponderous even , intellectual , subversive . Amid this interesting cast of characters was one glorified by many for being all that in his works -- experimental and favoring abstractions and images over straight narrative , egregiously self-conscious sometimes , politically ponderous , intellectual ( to critics but not to him ) , subversive . <p> RoxLee -- can we call it a portmanteau of Roque Lee , or an attempt at cuteness ( which I as a friend believe he desires as a trait and , to a degree , he achieves as only he in his capacity as a raconteur can achieve ) ? Roque Federizon Lee is RoxLee 's best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ produced animations in the period when the term meant " cartoons " and Donald Duck and Mickey Mouse . He got immersed in the making of short films when films then were meant to be long -- an hour or more , and had stories and actors that looked good and mighty , and actresses who were willowy , sensual , or dumb but alluring . <p> But , as stories have beginnings , storytellers have provenance . <p> It all began in a small school in a small city , Ateneo de Naga in Naga City . In high school , RoxLee was a storyteller . His stories came out in the student magazine , called An Maogmang Lugar , a phrase which literally meant " The Happy Place . " It was a term coined by Fr . James O'Brien , SJ , a Jesuit English teacher who also developed a course on Bikol Culture in Ateneo de Naga High School , a rare pedagogical experimentation in the country 's secondary education in the ' 60s . <p> In Ateneo de Naga , he became popular as an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 60s and ' 70s . His works came in the form of rough-and-tough doodles , the lines going on and on like a madman 's idea of a picture . When Martial Law was declared , the literary magazine was banned . But student life continued and there , RoxLee 's life as an artist continued . Then he moved to Manila . <p> In the 1980s , RoxLee would do more animations mostly done in super-8 . Despite being not a formal part of the animation industry , he would be credited as being one of the founding members of the Animagination , which evolved into Animahenasyon , a competition in Philippine animation . For this , RoxLee was honored with a lifetime achievement award by the group . <p> It was in 1984 when the world of experimental films noticed RoxLee . The piece was called The Great Smoke . The reference was to the A-Bomb and the aim was to call attention to disarmament and driving away the American bases from the Philippines . Collage , photos , stop motion and humanoids whose only signs of anthropomorphism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with skin connecting them in a network of bizarre kinship . <p> My introduction to RoxLee was via a film he wrote , Tronong Puti ( The White Throne ) . Onscreen , a ritual is taking place . Men carry what looks like a small palanquin . Then bombs start falling . The trono turns out to be a toilet bowl . Imagine human waste inside the toilet bowl . Offensive . Dirty . But an incense is waved over it and bombs appear . Recognizable are clips from journalists documenting the Vietnam War and more wars . On the street , people are covering their faces with handkerchiefs . The world is polluted . Voices float over the scene . The chant reminds us of Gregorian music but the eeriness is gothic . Then words clearly say : the toilet bowl is a human invention that brings release and contentment . <p> In 1986 , RoxLee did Juan Gapang . Historicised as happening in the period of the so-called Edsa Revolution , the film takes on the heavy politics of an advocacy film . Viewed in itself , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how a man can spend all his days walking on all fours , a vestigial organ of a humankind that has already stood up . And yet , Juan Gapang is also the forgotten person , the ignored , the downtrodden , the regular beggar , the suffering of the quotidian . The cars whizz by . This is filmmaking at its edgiest : the actor 's weight teeters on the brink of tight sidewalk . The dangers of falling and being hit by cars are there but the camera is also there , confrontational , reckless , bold but not even heroic , a documentary of how we are as a population -- uncaring , observing but also observed . <p> Juan Gapang would win the Gawad Urian in 1987 for Best Short Film . <p> Suffice it to say that there is more to cinema in RoxLee . There is more to him than the arts . The simplest thing that comes close to the obscurity of this artist is the fact that in what appears to be an organically nihilistic attitude to life is his love of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all kinds and their inversion -- lies . <p> To appreciate the films of Rox Lee is to see him in his other personas as painter , actor and performance artist . In the said domains , RoxLee is uncaring about traditions ; he celebrates noise both of the invasive and abrasive kind ; he is par excellence a saboteur of everything pleasant and acceptable . His short films are about memories of disaster , of identities in crisis . <p> RoxLee , who is considered by many filmmakers as their " godfather , " has inspired young artists to pursue narratives that question harmony and regularities , inducing a movement in cinema that urges experimentations which produce shapes that are absurd but closer to the realities around us . <p> Last week , Dr. Alvin P.

( Commercially-branded sausages use artificial casings . ) The sausages can be dry , like Hong Kong-style pork sausages or salami , or smoked like the Polish kielbasas , and can be served fresh and boiled , or boiled then grilled , or boiled then pan-fried . <p> Most people , like the British and Filipinos , like our sausages served at breakfast , while the Spaniards usually have them as part of a tapas plate .

On those days when I 'm too tired to think of what to eat ( or when the budget is tight and there 's nothing in the ref ) , slices of Chinese pork sausage ( locally dubbed chorizong macau ) gifted to me is the easiest to prepare . Drowned in a dipping saucer of vinegar and chopped red onions , and eaten with rice topped with the oil used to pan-fry the sausage , the meal is simple but pure heaven . <p> I also have them for lunch or dinner , often with potato salad or slices of baguette slathered in garlic butter , as I did when I recently had delicious sausages from One World Butchers .

Think of it as a sisig in a sausage . The Green Mexican is also a flavorful variant because it is only ever-so-slightly spicy , and does n't overwhelm the tastebuds . It merely teases the palate , making it most agreeable to the taste . <p> For sides , I had creamy Virgin Mashed Potatoes and charred vegetables which lent a sweet touch to the meal .

NLP uses the thoughts , language , and patterns of behavior learned through experience to achieve a specific outcome . <p> Whether it be competence for higher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leadership , motivation , agility or innovation , Trainstation equips people to make better choices and be empowered towards better contribution and to become amazing in the process -- by choice . <p> NLP is a tool that understands how the outputs we receive affect the way we think , speak and act . NLP shows participants that they have a choice : to either be the cause of things or the effect of things . This is done through expanding awareness , providing tools in calibration , mirroring , matching , leading , and many more exercises . It involves understanding the brain behind the human factor and what affects beliefs and behavior . The brain is the seat of all motivation , emotion , and decision that drives perception , communication and action . <p> " We equip people with mindsets , heart-sets and skillsets to change worlds , " says Carelle . " We help create transformations in individuals and organizations , with people in mind . We enable people towards the greater good . We believe that people build families , communities , organizations , nations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ humanity .

It is that belief -- the ability of people help themselves -- that has led them to results . It is a belief that anyone can be empowered and equipped to make better choices if given the proper resources . <p> Carelle and RR believe that they help people move forward through stories and laughter -- these are some of the tools that help people get on their feet . Through Enter-TRAIN-ment and physical stretch exercises the couple have been helping their clients to see that their lives can be amazing . <p> The couple shared that most organizations address the behaviors and what habits they should change to get the results they want . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told what to do , the change is usually temporary and unsustainable . <p> " We understand that for any real change to last , it should start from within , " says Carelle . " That is why we address the belief systems first . People can not change through a scientific approach alone . We have to create experiences for them . So what we do is provide that space for people to experience what good resides in them . " <p> It can be quite impossible to ask a depressed person to find hope in what seems like a hopeless situation . Trainstation provides an experience where they let clients play or have dialogues , which lead them to a space where hope resides -- and it is there that people discover that hope exists in them . <p> " This leads me to why we started Trainstation -- well , it is really because we want to lessen the pain the world experiences , " quips Carelle .

" <p> Staying on track : Finding a track that will help you on your journey to the next destination <h> Scientific approach <p> Carelle says it 's when she started studying NLP that she began to see that helping other people goes beyond skill and tools , " because I realize that you can not tell someone what to do if they are not okay , " she says . " So , it is important to take care of a person 's mental health before they are given any tool to handle a work or life situation . " <p> Trainstation facilitates experiential learning through multi-sensory activities that are both enjoyable and relevant . It 's psychology mixed in with the fun , facts , and fundamentals for an altogether amazing , inspirational , and easy learning experience . <p> A leader 's effectiveness is determined through a holistic development of their role , relationships , relevance , and results .

" <h> 360 leadership <p> There is a science , model , and pattern for great presentations . Communication can be deemed effective if the transfer of information is seamless and fluid .

Chinese health authorities on Monday announced two additional Covid-19 deaths , both in the capital Beijing , that were the first reported in weeks and come during an expected surge of illnesses after the nation eased its strict " zero-Covid " approach . <p> More than a month after China started seeing an exponential surge in Covid cases , the country has only reported two virus deaths , defying the experience of other , more vaccinated and better resourced places as they reopened and fueling suspicion the true scale of fatalities is being hidden . <p> The swift abandonment of Covid Zero has seen infections explode , especially in Beijing , which has seen shortages of medicine , overwhelmed hospital staff and deserted streets as residents stay home sick or to avoid the virus . That aligns with what other places experienced as they shifted from eliminating Covid to living with it -- except for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weekend , China reported its first fatalities since Covid Zero was dismantled earlier this month . In total , the country has declared just 11 Covid deaths among its 1.4 billion people since Nov. 19 , which was more than a week after the government 's first tentative steps toward loosening virus policy . <p> " The very few Covid deaths reported so far are suspiciously low , " said William Schaffner , an infectious disease expert at Vanderbilt University 's medical school in Tennessee . He said a rapid increase in infections is typically followed by a rise in Covid-related deaths a week or two later . <p> " China has under-vaccinated its population , particularly older persons , " Schaffner said . " Thus , we continue to interpret data on Covid from China with a grain of salt . " <p> Reports on the ground suggest Beijing is seeing a wave of fatalities , with crematorium workers and relatives suggesting at least tens of people have died infected with Covid . The news of the two most recent deaths were among the top trending topics on China @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Monday , and social media users questioned whether there were more fatalities that had n't been reported . <p> That 's stoked speculation officials and hospitals may be attributing deaths from the virus to other ailments as outbreaks mushroom , with Caixin reporting that China had narrowed guidelines for what counts as a Covid death . New guidance was issued on Dec. 6 that notes that some patients who were Covid-positive died from underlying illness , and medical facilities have 24 hours to ascertain a person 's cause of death , it said , without saying where it got the information . Previously , anyone who died while Covid-positive was considered a Covid death . <p> China 's death toll is far lower than more vaccinated countries that went through reopening waves . <p> When Omicron hit South Korea , the country swiftly reported fatalities and daily deaths climbed to more than six per 1 million people as infections swelled . Meanwhile , Australia and New Zealand saw deaths pass three per-million a day at the peak of outbreaks after they left elimination behind . Even Singapore , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cases , saw a bit more than a month between its first Omicron case and fatality and ultimately experienced an increase in deaths to about two per-million daily . <p> Hong Kong -- where Omicron rampaged though the city 's under-vaccinated elderly , recording the deadliest outbreak in the world at one point -- reported its first fatalities in early February . That was about three weeks from when the city said the virus was spreading locally . More than 10,800 people in the financial hub have died of Covid this year , versus China 's official death tally for the whole pandemic of a little over 5,000 . <p> The low fatality rate so far also flies in the face of China 's own experience . Shanghai reported its first Covid deaths in mid-April , less than three weeks into a brutal two-month citywide lockdown and with fewer than 30,000 cases a day . By late-May , when the outbreak had largely abated , more than 580 people had died . <p> It 's in China 's interests to obscure or downplay the death toll , given the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The government has spent most of the past three years casting China 's containment of Covid and low death toll as proof of the superiority of the Communist system . Now , amid the whipsaw pivot , officials are playing down the virus , with one top health adviser saying it could even just be called a " cold " . Covid policy is inextricably tied to President Xi Jinping , who is looking to cement his power after securing a third term in October and installing a cabal of new leaders . <p> All the evidence suggests China is headed for a more severe pandemic exit than other ex-Covid Zero countries . <p> The elderly are a particular concern . Unlike other countries that prioritized vaccinating residents of aged-care facilities , China 's elderly have proved difficult to persuade and the group remains extremely under-vaccinated . Just 40 percent of people older than 80 had received a booster by late-November and -- while there 's been a recent push to inoculate older people -- the figure likely remains low given the lack of mandates , as other countries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BAGHDAD -- Baghdad-mediated diplomatic talks between regional rivals Iran and Saudi Arabia have come to a halt , largely because of Tehran 's claims that the Sunni kingdom has played a role in alleged foreign incitement of mass anti-government protests underway in Iran , multiple Iraqi officials said . <p> SEOUL , South Korea -- North Korea said Monday it fired a test satellite in an important final-stage test for the development of its first spy satellite , a key military capability coveted by its leader Kim Jong Un along with other high-tech weapons systems .

My observation was met with a mixture of skepticism and condescending silence . The economists were especially vocal in their assertion that there is no substitute for economic growth .

However , they fail to acknowledge that countries like Thailand , Malaysia and South Korea have higher labor costs and are more prosperous . There was a time when the cost of hiring laborers in China was much lower than other countries . This was said to be the reason why China became prosperous and became the center for manufacturing .

These same businessmen and economists praise our overseas workers as heroes and find ways of continuing to export our skilled labor to other countries . <p> I have yet to hear or read about countries that have become rich and prosperous through the process of having a brain drain . In fact , most countries take steps to prevent a brain drain . I read about countries like South Korea and now India that have instituted programs to lure their talented and skilled people to come back to their homelands . <p> I find it so sad to read that when a Filipino security guard died in Qatar during the World Cup , Western media outlets like CNN broadcasted it as tragic story .

From then through the mid-1980s , government agencies established economic and policy offices . These offices began shaping major policy decisions using such techniques as cost effectiveness analysis , which searches for the cheapest way to achieve a goal , and cost benefit analysis which asked whether the goal is worth pursuing in the first place . These events have made economics much more prestigious and influential than history , sociology and other disciplines . There was definitely focus on the end goal rather than the process . <p> For example , in this coming year , one major economic issue is that of inflation . Almost all economies , including the Philippines , are willing to undergo a recession in order to resolve the issue of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rates , which makes the cost of borrowing much higher . <p> Governments are also willing to resolve the increasing taxes except for personal income taxes . Some of these tax proposals are value-added tax and sales taxes . All of these measures -- higher interest rates and higher sales taxes -- place the major economic burden on the poor and the middle class rather than the wealthy . <p> In all these discussions , the main topic is whether these measures will be effective in reducing inflation . The effect on the poor and middle class will be less assistance for them in the areas of education , health care , livelihood and transportation . In fact , I read recently some of the car-riding wealthy who have not suffered waiting for public transportation for several hours on the streets are objecting to the planned subway as an unnecessary luxurious expenditure . <p> One of the most serious if not the most serious distorted way of thinking about economic policies by economists and business leaders is that the issue of morality is not considered as part of the framework @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on statistics of economic growth , there should be more value in terms of the effect on the dignity of the individual human being , especially the marginalized . As I said once many years ago , why are there more space for the golf courses for the very few and very little space for public parks for the use of the many millions ? 
@@96000235 <h> Petitioning a parent charged with fraud <p> Many US citizens want to petition their parents to join them in the US . They are grateful to their parents for giving them life on this planet , and they hope to repay them in some small way by giving their parents life in the US . Or they may have recently had a baby , and the parents would be the perfect nannies while they went to work . <p> But what happens if one of the parents committed fraud or was charged with it in the past ? They may have applied for a visitor visa and lied on the application , or they may have submitted manufactured documents and been caught . Now , that fraud is on their record . <p> When the parent eventually goes to the embassy for their immigrant visa interview , the old fraud comes up and the immigrant visa is refused because of that fraud . The whole family is devastated , because now dreams are crushed and the future is uncertain for that parent . <p> Is there hope ? Is there anything that can be done ? I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am not guaranteeing results or success , there are several things that can be done . Basically , what can be done is to have the other parent immigrate first and then file a fraud or hardship waiver for the remaining parent . <p> By way of background , if a person commits fraud , they are considered " inadmissible " or ineligible to receive a visa . Before 1996 , the fraud would be erased from their record after 10 years . But in 1996 , President Clinton signed a law stating that the fraud stays on the person 's record forever . <p> Now , the person would need to file a fraud or hardship waiver , basically asking USCIS ( US Citizenship and Immigration Services ) for " forgiveness " by demonstrating that a " qualifying relative " would suffer " extreme hardship " if the person is not allowed to immigrate . <p> " Qualifying relative " for purposes of fraud waivers includes a spouse or parent who is either a US citizen ( USC ) or a lawful permanent resident ( LPR ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complex concept and is difficult to document and prove . In fact , there is a whole chapter in the USCIS policy manual discussing extreme hardship , what factors are taken into consideration and the type of proof necessary . One of the main factors is demonstrating how the qualifying relative would suffer extreme hardship if they had to " relocate " from the US or the hardship of " separation . " <p> In the situation we are discussing , where a US citizen child is petitioning a parent who was charged with fraud , the parent may not have a " qualifying relative " to enable them to file a hardship waiver . They may not have parents who are citizens or immigrants , and they were intending to immigrate along with their spouse . <p> However , in order for there to be any kind of hope or chance of success , they must have a qualifying relative , or they can not file a fraud waiver . That is why I suggest in these situations that their spouse ( the other parent of the US citizen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As soon as they have their green card , they now become a " qualifying relative , " enabling the other parent ( who was charged with fraud ) to file a hardship waiver . While they may be temporarily separated , that brief period of separation , I think , is well worth the sacrifice to enable both parents to finally immigrate to the US . <p> If this situation applies to you , your family or even someone you know , I would suggest you consult with an attorney who can evaluate the situation and recommend the best course of action , including helping you gather documents , prepare declarations , and file a hardship waiver .
