Getting the right mix between spending , savings and investing is one of the major challenge to many of us -- except for those who are " lucky " . <p> Even for these few , figuring out what to do with whatever the amount of money earned and could be spend , saved or invested is not easy . <p> Among the three ( spending , saving and investing ) , investing is the hardest -- whether investing for your life goals , investing for children 's education , investing in preparation for bad times , investing for retirement and financial freedom , etc . <p> In this article , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shares . Before I get into that -- there are many forms of investment and many asset classes that an investor could choose from . One may decide to invest in bonds , term deposits , REITs and CIS units , bonds , etc . <p> In the process of investing , directly or indirectly , there are risks to be managed , that 's why there are other financial products traded in stock markets that assist investors in managing investment risks -- products such financial derivatives , exchanges traded funds , indices , etc . <p> Narrowing whatever I have just allured into above , let 's focus into some of the factors one would consider when investing : <p> The point to start with is to determine where you are financially and what is your personal investment goals -- as a matter of fact , before embarking on any investment decision , it is recommended that you consult yourself honestly as you can , taking into consideration your financial situation , i.e. you need to figure out your net worth -- and how is this achieved ? First @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subtracting all your debt obligations ; second , develop a budget by listing all your monthly income and all your monthly expenses . These two steps will tell you how much money you have available for investing . <p> It is important that you determine how you relate to money and how much risk you feel comfortable taking . <p> This means , one of the things to consider is figuring out your investment goals versus your level of risk tolerance -- sometimes it is n't easy for one to self-consult , in such cases it is advisable that you consider accessing the advice of professionals . Always remember , there is no guarantee whatsoever that you will surely make profits in your investment process . <p> What is true though is , if you get rights your facts about investing and with an intelligent investment plan , you can surely gain some financial security and can enjoy the benefits of managing your money in a smarter way . <p> Once you have a clearly informed personal investment plan , follow on it by evaluating your risk tolerance level : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ degree of risk . <p> The degree of risk varies from one asset class ( or securities within the asset class ) to another . For example , shares are traditionally investments that have high degree of risk compared to bonds or bank deposits . But , it is important to also note a principle of investment that says : the higher the risk , the higher the return . <p> So , the key is for one to be able to establish the maximum level of investment that s/he is willing to lose in case the investment outcome goes against expectations . In this process , it is good to also determine at which point in time you will need cash for spending , not for investment . <p> The point of cash need requires careful consideration because under normal circumstances investment in listed shares should be looked into a medium to long-term horizon . Speculative motives and " quick money " mentality should be discouraged . The quick-money strategy is as good a strategy until it is not good for you . <p> If you are pursuing a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you are likely to make more money by carefully investing in asset categories with greater risk , such as shares rather than restricting your investments to assets with less risk , like cash equivalents e.g. opening a savings account or a bank deposit . <p> The other element is for one to determine where you want to end up financially -- this can be achieved by asking yourself specific questions , with related answers . <p> Questions such as at what age you want to retire , how much money you need in order to retire comfortably , how much time you have between now and then , how much money you need to work with and how much risks are you comfortable and willing to take . <p> Once you know the answers to these questions you will have a good idea of how much you need to invest to reach your goal . Do not choose to take any road , be specific , i.e. if you are 45 years old and you intend to retire at age 55 and your earning is Sh1 million a month . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freedom during your retirement period , assuming you have not started investing already , you will need to apply this financial model : Take your Sh1 million multiply by 12 months then multiply by the different of years between now and the time you retire i.e. 10 years . <p> This way your Financial Freedom Target should be to accumulate about Sh120 million by year 2028 .

But access to clean cooking ( access to cooking fuels and technologies ) that affect millions continues to lag behind due to financing gaps , low consumer awareness , slow technological progress , and lack of infrastructure for fuel production and distribution ( IRENA , Energy Progress Report - tracking SDG7 , 2018 ) . <p> On the occasion of the International Day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particularly Tanzania Traditional Energy Development organisation , Uganda Coalition for Sustainable Development , SusWatch Kenya , INFORSE East Africa and EA SusWatch Network feel that the EAC budget 2018 /19 ought to have focused more on SDG7 , with particular focus on access to universal access by 2030 to affordable , reliable , and modern energy services , including clean fuels and technologies ( access to clean cooking ) . This is because 117 million out of the 145.5 million in East Africa still lack access to electricity . Moreover , clean fuels and technologies are critical for achieving the goals set by other SDGs that pertain to poverty alleviation , food security , good health , gender equality , and climate action . <p> In addition , the World Health Organisation Report ( 2016 ) notes that Tanzania , Kenya and Uganda are amongst the top 20 access deficit countries that account for about 4 percent share of the global population without access to clean cooking .

Faithfulness , trust and other values that have huge impact on business and economy , from the family levels , often miss . We also complain of lack of adequate skills from our graduates . <p> Then when we come to those who are less educated ( with primary and secondary school education ) , the working culture sometimes is wanting . Assume , someone working in Dar es Salaam , buys two motorbikes for business or open a small shop . He hires two guys including a relative to run the business . They eat up the capital and everything else . Then the small business runs down within no time . The story repeats itself over and over again .

It is the key for our nations to develop , and for our people to own the biggest part of the national cake . <p> Look for example in the world of the internet-- it is those companies from the west , and now also from China that are taking the lion 's share .

It is those who are endowed with resources that can do so , and it would be helpful if TFF and ministerial bodies started thinking of ways to elicit interest in the matter from stakeholders in all urban areas . <p> The feedback will be positive and policy could accommodate it , particularly if the entire TFF leadership demonstrated as much love for the game as the federation 's president has been showing he can do
