Much of its progress in improving gender equality over the years is owed to the inclusive model of social development that has seen NGOs working side by side with the state for four decades . This has facilitated social innovations in the field of women 's empowerment and gender development . NGOs like Grameen are invaluable in environments where conventional solutions to gender issues ( such as poverty reduction and economic growth ) alone have failed to deliver . Further progress is possible if the government-NGO partnership is nurtured and left outside politics . <p> Bangladesh is a global poster child within the Muslim world for women 's development . When it comes to gender equality , Bangladesh ranks above all other South Asian countries and Muslim-majority nations in Asia .

Now , a large number of Bangladeshi women are going to work every day as factory workers , primary school teachers , and healthcare providers . This has not happened because of any large-scale public investment project . <p> Instead , the foundation for women 's development was laid by non-state actors . Bangladesh 's microfinance pioneer Professor Muhammad Yunus saw women as the key agent of social change nearly four decades ago , before gender development was recognised in the national agenda . More recently , NGOs like Grameen Bank and BRAC have not only championed development schemes that target women , they also employ hundreds of thousands of women at the community level to deliver health , family planning , and education services . <p> Bangladeshi NGOs have further promoted the status of women by increasing their participation within the organisation . Seven out of twenty directors at BRAC are women . Grameen Bank has gone further by employing female @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the government built on these transformative measures by adopting a gender-sensitive budget and further promoting women in leadership positions in the public sector . <p> Previously , the Bank 's more than 8 million rural female borrowers would directly select board members from among their ranks . Officials from another bank will now oversee elections , following the new government directive . The government will form a three-member committee to elect nine members of the twelve-member board . According to Bangladesh 's largest English newspaper the Daily Star , the three-member body will comprise two deputy managing directors : one from a state-owned commercial bank and another from the Palli Karma-Sahayak Foundation . <p> What does this mean for the future of microfinance and women 's empowerment in Bangladesh ? <p> NGOs in Bangladesh ensure that poverty and patriarchy do not stand in the way of expanding women 's agency in the country .

Zaki Wahhaj is Senior Lecturer in Economics at the University of Kent . <h> One Response to " Bangladeshi politicians should keep hands off Grameen Bank " <h> Golam Azom Died <p> Mr Niaz Are You a Friend of Yunus and BNP 's ? I guess You seem to be an Agent of BNP and Jamaat Propaganda !

Is microcredit a flawed idea that does more harm than good , with high interest rates and lack of proper regulation ? <p> A few years ago , microcredit and microfinance were seen as world-changing endeavors that could drastically alleviate poverty by enabling those without the ability to get a traditional bank loan to receiving funding for their business or household . Muhammad Yunus won a Nobel Prize in 2006 for his work founding Grameen Bank , and services such as Kiva have brought the concept to the masses . Oprah even featured Kiva on her show , and the service could n't find enough loans for interested lenders . <p> It makes sense : enable millions to make small loans , which can reach remote communities all while creating a sense of helping people without asking individuals to give their money away to charity -- simply lend it . And once the money is paid back , those lenders will be more likely to continue to lend . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of organizations like Grameen , because microcredit is seen as far more effective at reaching those in need than traditional foreign aid . <p> But perceptions are starting to change . Muhammad Yunus was asked to step down from Grameen by the Prime Minister of Bangladesh who claims the poor are being taken advantage of . There are also allegations of Grameen Bank funds being diverted illegally , but that 's another issue . The biggest criticism seems to stem from the extremely high interest rates microcredit loans have . While it may seem like you give $25 via Kiva and $25 is repaid , the actual repayment number could be 40% higher , or more . That money is pocketed by the microfinance institution ( MFI ) that is handling the transaction and repayments . Clearly there are costs involved , and higher risks when dealing with loans to low-income individuals ( which is why they could n't get bank loans in the first place ) . But poor families are now being burdened by high-interest debt many ca n't pay off . <p> Is microcredit simply going through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the very idea flawed despite its noble intentions ?

The International Food Policy Research Institute ( IFPRI ) research shows that growth failure in early childhood is likely passed to the next generation . Productivity losses and direct healthcare costs caused by hunger and malnutrition also have adverse economy-wide effects . For example , hunger and undernutrition cost the global economy USD$1.4 to $2.1 trillion per year-the equivalent of 2.0 to 3.0 per cent of global GDP ( gross domestic product ) , according to the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations . As a result of being overweight or obese , the World Health Organisation estimates that about 3.4 million adults die each year , accounting for 3.9 per cent of years of life lost . <p> Bangladesh is a home of around 6.3 million stunted children as of 2010 , according to UNICEF . Globally , malnutrition is responsible for 45 per cent of all child deaths and leaves 161 million children stunted in 2013 , a joint survey of UNICEF , WHO and World Bank found . <p> Causes of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awareness , and rising inflation are behind the malnutrition problem in Bangladesh . Under-nutrition puts children at greater risk of dying from common infections and increases the frequency and severity of such infections . It is irreversible once it is occurred . Malnutrition has far-reaching human , social and economic consequences that last for generations . Malnutrition costs Bangladesh more than Tk70 billion ( $1bn ) in economic productivity each year , according to a joint survey of the Bangladesh government and the United States Agency for International Development ( USAID ) . <p> An effective intervention with providing sufficient quality foods costs around $97 or Tk776 per child with much of the expense coming from the provision of fortified supplementary foods , according to the findings of the world 's leading experts on nutrition and economics Professor Susan Horton at the University of Waterloo and Professor John Hoddinott at Cornell . On an average , implementing the effective direct nutrition interventions raises incomes by 11.3 per cent , the findings said . <p> If a Bangladeshi child is born in 2015 , benefiting from effective intervention during conception and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over his lifetime , he will earn the average per capita income of a Bangladeshi . If this person works until they are 50 years old and uses a conservative 5.0 per cent rate , switching this child from stunted to not stunted increases the present value of their lifetime by more than Tk 1,84,000 . These income calculations are for different numbers of working years and different discount rates . If individuals work together , the present value of these monetary benefits gets larger . <p> There are other benefits of reductions in stunting . Nutrition interventions would reduce deaths by children under five by 15 per cent . Over the last decade , Bangladesh has made remarkable progress in fighting malnutrition . In 1997 , the stunting rate was 58 per cent , which declined to 38 per cent in 2014 , according to the Bangladesh Demographic Health Survey and other studies . The number of stunting cases among children below five years of age also came down to 31 per cent from 45 per cent in 2015 , according to Food Security and Nutritional Surveillance Project . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young children , aged between 6 and 23 months , receive the minimum acceptable diet . Rice dominates and its low nutrient density likely contributes to the high rates of zinc deficiency . <p> The good news is that investments in eliminating hunger and malnutrition have high economic benefits . For instance , in India and Bangladesh , research shows that every dollar spent on interventions to reduce stunting is estimated to generate about USD$34.1 and 18.4 in economic returns respectively . <p> According to under-nutrition map ( The Under-nutrition Maps are developed jointly by the UN World Food Programme and the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics ) unveiled in December last year , children under five suffered most from hunger in Sylhet division where 51.3 per cent of children suffered from stunting and 39.5 per cent were underweight . <p> Stunting rates are the highest in Bandarban district of Chittagong division , a hilly area , followed by Cox 's Bazar district in the coastal belt of Chittagong division and Sunamganj district of Sylhet division which largely consists of haor ( wetland ) areas , the maps showed . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ critical threshold level for underweight which is 30 per cent . At the upazila level , 300 out of 544 upazilas have a stunting rate above 40 per cent while 440 upazilas have an underweight rate above 30 per cent . <p> Malnutrition costs the country over $1.0 billion in lost productivity a year . Ending it would not only improve the lives of millions but help break the cycles which perpetuate poverty into future generations . The annual costs of effective intervention to ensure a sufficient variety of quality foods to children in need have been shown to be perfectly manageable and to more than pay for themselves by reducing illness and raising future incomes . <p> Poverty is not the only problem , as rising rates of obesity among wealthier children are showing . It is ensuring awareness of good nutrition and access to a proper variety of foods which is key to preventing malnutrition . Better co-ordination is needed to improve the effectiveness of providing fortified supplementary foods and raising awareness among young mothers about the importance of ensuring balanced diets to both boys and girls . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , civil society , philanthropy organisations and the private sector , play a critical role in ensuring food security and nutrition . However , inefficient policies and practices that add to the burden of hunger and **28;518;TOOLONG in food security and nutrition , lack of social safety nets to protect the poorest , unsustainable use of natural resources in food production , trade restrictions and gender inequality in agriculture-must be eliminated . <p> We have the tools to decrease the number of malnourished children in Bangladesh .

Key nutrition interventions should ensure : <p> n Mothers and children have access to-and are consuming-essential vitamins and minerals . <p> n Mothers and children have access to the right variety of foods and the right amount of foods . <p> n Parents and caregivers have access to the information and support they need to feed their children in the best ways possible . <p> These proven interventions can save the lives of thousands of children worldwide and help children reach their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lifetime earnings , and increased productivity in the labour force . <p> We must become better at fighting malnutrition to give all children the proper start in life they deserve .

@@4681236 <h> Why Admiral Group is my top rated stock <p> I must confess that one of my cars is currently insured with Admiral Group , but that 's not the reason why the company 's shares sit at the top of my stock screen . <p> The real reason is that Admiral and its shares have all the features I look for in an investment to a greater extent than any other ( or at least any other from the FTSE All-Share ) . <h> Admiral is a very successful but somewhat unusual insurance company <p> What do I mean by successful ? In simple terms I 'm looking for a combination of outstanding profitability and consistent , profitable dividend growth . On the growth front , here are Admiral 's results for the last few years : <p> In terms of the various financial ratios and other metrics I 'm most interested in , the company also looks extremely good : <p> 10-year unbroken record of profitable dividends <p> 10-year average ROE = 53.6% ( FTSE 100 approx. 10% ) <p> 10-year Growth Rate = 13.3% ( FTSE 100 = 1% ) <p> 10-year Growth Quality ( i.e. consistency ) = 91.7% ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ = 89.6% ( market average over 100% according to Admiral ) <p> Operational debts to 5-year average earnings ratio = zero ( I think anything below 4 is reasonable for a cyclical company like Admiral ) <p> The ROE figure is incredibly high . In fact it 's suspiciously high and the reason is that Admiral is a very unusual insurance company . It 's unusual because over the last 10 years most of Admiral 's profits have come not from insurance , but from something which the income statement calls " other " profits . <h> Most of Admiral 's profits come from non-insurance income <p> These " other " profits are made up primarily from " additional products and fees " , which includes breakdown insurance , car hire , personal injury insurance , instalment charges and fees for things like cancelling mid-term or sending out replacement documents . All of those are sold to or charged to its car insurance customers , boosting income per car by something like ? 70 a year . <p> On top of that there are profits from Confused.com and other international @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the future there will be profits from the sale of BRIAN the Robot toys as well . <p> These " other " profits are an area that Admiral focuses on to a much greater extent than other direct insurance companies . <p> One way to look at Admiral then is as a lean , low-cost insurer with the primary aim of gathering as many ( profitable ) insurance customers as possible in order to charge them for " additional products and fees " . <p> When I insured my car through Admiral a couple of years ago I remember being bombarded by questions asking if I wanted this or that add-on product or service . Now I know why . <h> It uses coinsurance and reinsurance to boost non-insurance income <p> But Admiral takes it a step further . 40% of the business it writes is effectively written for another insurance company through a co-insurance agreement . Admiral effectively passes the policy straight to this other company so that none of the premium or claim obligations show up in its accounts . <p> What 's the point of writing business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? So that it can sell that customer breakdown insurance , hire them a car or charge them some administrative fees , all of which stay as a profit for Admiral rather than the coinsurance company . <p> Another 35% of Admiral 's business is reinsured , which is similar to coinsurance but in this case the figures do show up in the accounts . <p> So for every policy that Admiral underwrites fully ( 25% of the total ) , there are effectively another three policies ( 75% of the total ) that if feeds to other insurers , and three additional customers to whom it can sell additional products and charge additional fees . <p> The result is massive profits relative to the amount of capital ( i.e. equity ) that Admiral needs for its own underwriting operations and therefore a massively high return on equity . <p> Because Admiral only needs a small amount of capital on its balance sheet relative to its earnings , it can pay out most of those earnings as a dividend . <p> In fact Admiral pays out almost 100% of its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to grow . <p> This unusual business model certainly appears to have worked over the years . More recently Admiral has started to see profitability coming through in some of its newer international operations , which is where most of its future growth is expected to come from . <p> If the same model works in other countries anything like as successfully as it has worked in the UK then the future may be very bright indeed for Admiral . <h> Admiral 's dividend yield may be bigger than you think <p> Another unusual feature of Admiral is its dividend policy . First of all it does n't have a progressive dividend policy . In its most recent set of results it cut the dividend by 1% even though those results were by no means bad . <p> Most income investors instinctively see a dividend cut as a sign of weakness , but with Admiral the dividend cut is best explained by a quote from the annual report : <p> We believe it is for our investors rather than Admiral to determine how they wish to invest funds surplus to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distribute each year the available surplus over and above what we retain to meet regulatory requirements , the future development of our business and appropriate buffers , in particular , the buffer required during a period of transition between two different capital regimes . We also believe that the year on year progression of our dividend should largely mirror the movement in after tax profits , subject to any abnormal demands on our capital resources . <p> This is a sentiment that Buffett and Munger would very likely approve of . Capital which can not be deployed at attractive rates should be returned to shareholders . <p> The second unusual thing about Admiral 's dividend policy is that it pays a " special " dividend every year . The " normal " dividend is set at 45% of post-tax profits and historically the special dividend has ended up at more or less the same size . <p> The result of this setup is that many stock market data sources only quote the normal dividend . If you look at some prominent websites ( I wo n't name them ) you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which gives the company a dividend yield of 2.9% with the share price at 1,600p . For a company with market-beating growth over many years a 2.9% dividend sounds about right . <p> But the reality is that Admiral 's dividend last year , including the special dividend , was 98.4p , which gives the company a much more interesting yield of 6.1% . <p> Obviously the professional investors who drive the market would n't miss something like that , but it does make me wonder . <h> High growth and high yield , so what 's not to like ? <p> Of course I do n't have a crystal ball , and in reality neither I nor anybody else knows what Admiral can or can not do in the future . But from its past record , and its current price , I think Admiral offers an attractive combination of high profitability and low price . <p> Note : This post was inspired by a question from a subscriber on an earlier post about ROCE .

@@4702234 <p> There is no binding rule or law that a university must have professors . But there is also no arguing the fact that a university without professors is like a ship without a captain . <p> An analysis of available data on the 37 public universities in the country has revealed an alarming picture that several such state-owned autonomous tertiary education providers -- mostly newly established and located in the peripheral districts -- are running without any professors at all . <p> There are also other universities where the vice-chancellor is the only professor ; and there are still others where the number is less than 10 . <p> For example , the Pabna University of Science and Technology , established seven years ago , does not have any professors for taking classes ; the only professor here is the VC , Prof Al-Nakib Chowdhury , who quite understandably can not take classes because of his administrative duties . <p> The case is same for the Barisal University , established four years ago , where VC Prof SM Imamul Huq is the only professor . <p> The Jatiya Kabi Kazi Nazrul Islam University in Mymensingh has seven professors ; Begum Rokeya University in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the Mawlana Bhashani Science and Technology University in Tangail have three each ; Comilla University and the Noakhali Science and Technology University have two each . <p> The Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman Science and Technology in Gopalganj has one full-time professor and seven part-timers . <p> Science universities <p> The clear pattern that emerges from this data is that the situation is particularly grim in the new science and technology universities . <p> Seeking anonymity , a teacher of computer science at a public university , told the Dhaka Tribune : " It is a good thing that the government is living up to its ' digital Bangladesh ' promise by setting up science and technology universities in the remote districts . <p> " But the reality is that we do not have enough teachers skilled in the information technology field . So , quite understandably , these specialised universities are not getting professors . " <p> Al-Nakib Chowdhury , VC of the university in Pabna , said : " We are providing standard education . But if there were some senior teachers , we could have ensured even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They are competing with Buet students in the job market and going abroad with scholarships . " <p> Former Buet VC Prof Jamilur Reza Chowhdury said : " Engineering subjects require a lot of laboratory work . So , if there is a lack of teachers , then how can the quality of education be ensured ? " <p> City-town comparison <p> These figures stand in stark contrast with those from some of the leading public universities located in the major cities . <p> At Jahangirnagar University located in Savar near Dhaka , the total number of teachers is 657 ; of them , 209 or 33% are professors . At Dhaka University , around 35% of the total number of teachers are professors . <p> When compared regionally , the Delhi University in neighbouring India has around 47% professors . Nearly half of the teachers at Calcutta University are professors . <p> What these figures suggest is that there is a clear unwillingness among experienced teachers to go and teach in the faraway districts particularly because of the lack of facilities and shortage of scopes to earn . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the big metropolitan cities is that they have the opportunity to teach or give consultancy to the private universities for handsome payments . <p> Moreover , the best schools and colleges of the country are all located in the big cities , and so if they decide to join one of these peripheral public universities , they fear that the education of their children may get hampered . <p> Lack of infrastructural facilities -- such as laboratory , accommodation and library -- in some of these new universities also act as repellent for professors . <p> According to Prof Dil Afroza Begum , member of the University Grants Commission ( UGC ) : " Why would the bright students go to these universities ? They stay in the cities , do research , go abroad for PhD degrees . They come back and join the public or private universities or become consultants .

Moreover , experienced professors can give valuable guidance in academic coordination and research activities as well , " he added . <p> UGC member Prof Mohammad Mohabbat Khan said there is a serious lack of foresight on the part of the policymakers . <p> " For establishing any educational institutions , there must be a long term human resource planning . But in Bangladesh , we establish a university in the face of local demand . " <p> He also said the senior teachers must also change their mindsets -- instead of thinking about their personal gains , they must concentrate on the welfare aspect of their professional responsibilities towards building the state . <p> Remedy <p> Prof Jamilur Reza Chowdhury , also an adviser to a former caretaker government , said : " There is no doubt that presence of senior teachers is essential for ensuring quality education .

@@4718234 <h> Through Thick and Thin -- or Dealing with Downturns <p> We all know it 's easy to conceptualise a strategy over a long period but that it 's another thing all together to see it through in reality . We investors tend to turn tail at the first sign of trouble and count ourselves lucky to escape with just our capital . It 's only looking back later we realise the gains that may have been had we stuck to the plan . Markets , after all , are said to transfer wealth from the impatient to the patient ... so what can we do to help ourselves get on the right side of that old adage ? <p> He means that , in the long run , a true value strategy is more or less certain to make you money . Buying dollars for 50 cents simply makes sense as a way to profit and if you are truly diligent in doing this , you ca n't help but win ... eventually . Yet there are times when the madness of markets overpowers rationality and , despite your efforts to uncover discounted dollars , other investors just wo n't pay up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times when value investing does n't work , when people give in to consensus and take a hit just to get out of the game . However , it is this very action that leaves those discounted dollars even cheaper than before , providing opportunity for the truly patient to make their profits . And so the cycle continues . <p> Just how hard is it do this though ? It 's one thing to look at a chart in retrospect and think ' ah , if I had spotted this stock 10 years ago , and held on through thick and thin , I 'd have made 10 times my money ! ' It is something else to recognise the opportunity in the first place , and something further still to recognise a continuing opportunity through the turbulent ride that any given decade brings in the markets . <p> An example ... <p> How about an example to demonstrate this ? I have chosen A class Berkshire Hathaway shares as they have often been a classic buy-and-hold value/quality investors stock with a wonderful cumulative return chart looking like this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bias kicks in -- ' All I had to do was buy the stock in 1980 and do nothing and I 'd be rich ! ' We all know , of course , that it is n't as easy as that but just how difficult is it ? At least part of the answer lies , I think , in analysing the drawdowns on the chart . Just to be clear on the definition , a drawdown is in effect any time where the cumulative return falls below the maximum cumulative return to date . You might realise from this that the stock is technically in drawdown most of the time , and I 'm interested in exploring the psychological impact of this on someone attempting to buy and hold the stock for the full 35 years charted above . <p> To help I 've created a graph showing the depth and frequency of drawdowns in the stock as follows : <p> This visually confirms our expectation that the stock is in drawdown for the majority of the time . It makes sense after all -- new highs do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not just how much time is spent in drawdown , but the severity of said drawdowns . The stock spends a huge amount of time down over 10% from recent highs and a fair bit down over 20% or more too . Just to highlight that point , I 've prepared a table of the worst 5 drawdowns to try and make them a little more tangible : <p> From <p> Trough <p> To <p> Depth <p> 1 <p> 11/12/2007 <p> 05/03/2009 <p> 14/02/2013 <p> -51.47% <p> 2 <p> 22/06/1998 <p> 10/03/2000 <p> 14/11/2003 <p> -48.95% <p> 3 <p> 11/10/1989 <p> 11/10/1990 <p> 12/08/1991 <p> -37.46% <p> 4 <p> 05/10/1987 <p> 27/10/1987 <p> 11/07/1988 <p> -37.06% <p> 5 <p> 07/12/1981 <p> 13/08/1982 <p> 08/10/1982 <p> -27.12% <p> You can see that not only are there a number of severe drawdowns but that some of them really persist . From December 2007 it took just over 5 years to return to a new high and in the meantime you saw the value of your holding cut in half . So , how do these drawdowns impact us psychologically on the long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ availability bias combined with loss aversion tendencies play a significant role here . The availability bias means we tend to place weight on recent information over old due to its availability , translating in this case to make us think of recent prices and recent highs as our level of wealth . This makes sense -- in 2006 we are hardly going to remember the initial investment we made 25 years ago , and will instead view our wealth ( quite rightly ) as the recent value of our holding . <p> This also means , however , that when 2007 comes around and we start to see prices fall , we will frame the fall in price as losses . It does n't matter that we are still hugely in profit , all we see is our wealth falling . Just a year and a half later in early 2009 , when we see half the wealth of 25 years of patience wiped out , it is quite likely that we are experiencing something akin to despair . Loss aversion kicks in and the mere thought of losing any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slow climb back to the top . <p> In the 25 years since inception a lot has happened -- perhaps you are getting close to retirement and all of your plans that hinged around your success in Berkshire Hathaway look at risk of coming undone . Perhaps you had plans to buy a property with the proceeds but suddenly your budget is half of what you expected . It takes a very special kind of person indeed to hold on tight through all of this . <p> It 's not just traditional value investing ! <p> Before you think I am having a go at traditional long term buy-and-hold approaches , allow me to criticise factor investing too ! Here is a table from a recent Alpha Architect blog on combining momentum and value strategies ( you can find the original blog here ) : <p> It shows a couple of variations on value/momentum strategies and their CAGRs and drawdowns etc . You will see straight away that the drawdowns are just as bad as or worse than those in Berkshire Hathaway ! On occasion these strategies will see you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strategies are known for suffering even more severe drawdowns of over 60% or 70% . <p> It seems that whatever technique we turn to , when we invest in equity we just have to deal with drawdowns . They are an inevitable consequence of the business cycle and human psychology . Even if we ca n't avoid them though , perhaps we can do something to ease the suffering a little . <p> Making life easy for yourself ... <p> There is a critical difference between these systematic strategies and the long term buy and hold at Berkshire ( or any comparable stock ) . That difference is the level of judgement involved in each of the two processes . <p> Traditional buy and hold investing not only requires a huge amount of accurate judgement and research to accurately identify these companies in the first place , but simply holding on and doing nothing actually requires a lot of work too ! There is no way the precise conditions that lead to an accurate decision in 1980 still hold in 2015 or even in 1990 , so to successfully hold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be continually ( and accurately ) re-analysing the company or be a little lucky ... <p> When it comes to your 50% drawdown ( or one of the many 10% or 20% ones ) , and you are trying to juggle different ideas and analyses to determine if things really are still ok , you are far more likely to fall victim to the above biases and others because you are so much more actively exposed to them . Now multiply this effort across all the stocks in your portfolio and you have both a full time job and a lot of opportunities to go wrong on your hands ... not ideal . <p> Alternatively , if we take our systematic approach , things start to look a little easier . While there will still be rough times , the fact that all you have to do is blindly follow a simple system is going to leave you far less prone to errors due to the questions being so much simpler . The internal dialogue will be more along the lines of ' does the value premium still exist ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' If yes , then press on ! <p> Yes , you will still need to be patient . Yes , you will still need an excellent temperament and no , I 'm not saying it will be easy , especially over so long a period as we are discussing . There is still plenty of opportunity to get nervous , to pull the plug and mess up . But there are fewer opportunities to do so than with the traditional approach and there is far less subjectivity in the process as a whole . <p> If we concern ourselves with only answering questions like ' does the value premium still exist ? ' , then it is very easy to ascertain this by reading new research as it comes out and looking at the t-statistics and conclusions of the authors . There is no room for opinion on whether a certain result is statistically significant -- it either is or it is n't and that is a huge advantage ... and a big time saver . <p> In conclusion ... <p> In short , I think that both traditional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be because they seek to exploit the same discrepancies in markets . That said , the skill and effort required to successfully execute the old fashioned way is just so much higher than with a systematic approach . <p> Being systematic and outsourcing a lot of our decision making process facilitates objectivity , providing that extra little nudge we need to stay on track over our investing careers . When the inevitable drawdowns come , we will be better positioned to accurately identify whether or not we should continue with the plan . <p> Ideally , we might take this even further by automating our portfolio to a large degree , removing ourselves even further from the chance to interfere and freeing us up to only focus on keeping track of the few market discrepancies we are trying to take advantage of . Making it easy for yourself to do the right thing is very likely to have a positive impact on your returns over the long run . <p> Whatever your approach to equity investing may be , you can be sure you 're in for a rough ride @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bear that in mind through the twists and turns the market place has in store for us ahead .

As I mention in the piece I 've quite some way to go and so it 's important to think about what is going to work for me , given that I am doing this over 40+ years and not just for a few . <p> So I might hope that a beginner ( I 'm not at all far off one myself ! ) , especially one in the mid 20 's age bracket like me , might read it and just give a little more thought to their long term plan than usual . For some people this may be second nature already but my experience of talking to younger investors is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what they may be trying to do . <p> A tired but fitting analogy might be an Antarctic expedition . If I were to just set out and try to tackle each leg head on with no preparation I would likely not do so well , given the size and difficulty of the task . By planning ahead and trying to foresee potential problems I have a better chance of overcoming them ... etc . <p> It 's nothing more than that really . When I think about trying to execute a long term , fundamentals research based approach over my investing life , these are some problems I envisage - and I think I might be able to solve them to some degree through systematising my process . I do of course caveat that because whatever you do , getting to the Antarctic is hard and I do n't think there 's any benefit in kidding myself it 's going to be easy ... <p> I think what I 've taken from this article is one more welcome reassurance that I 'm not crazy to keep holding onto shares @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drawdown . Because we are gambling in the hope of better returns than placing our free cash anywhere else we have to absorb the potential stress of the inherent risk . If we wanted certainty , we 'd not be here . i have a friend who has given himself sleepless nights trying to second guess the wilder swings of sentiment and , for a while , his entire investing philosophy centred on looking for companies whose prices fluctuated wildly . He did n't even care what the company did to make money ; he was playing a constant game of " whack-a-mole " and it made him sick and , in the end , he lost money and quit investing . When thinking about differing philosophies of investors , Henry Ford apparently said , when asked what to invest in , " Land , they 're not making any more of it " ! I believe that its that sort of philosophy that keeps me happy to hold oil , gas and even the miners for the long term and ignore the current drawdown . Indeed , I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as " tangibles " whatever Mr Market thinks , day to day . If only the recent talk of doom , gloom and climate change would make a difference to our descendants ' future ! I 'm pretty sure nothing serious will happen while self-interest powers all governments . We will continue to waste fossil fuels , jetting about the world , floodlighting our streets and , apparently the human race is addicted to warfare , especially close to oil wells . Greed and neurosis has made it impossible for us to solve our energy problems by nuclear energy or renewables . Ultimately , he who owns the land , the fuel , the minerals and the water becomes the king . I can wait . <p> Hi Tom . Nice article . Would it be fair to summarise it as follows : If there is a significant and widespread market drop , but no bad news relating to my particular shares , and I do not have any pressing need for cash , then I should sit tight and continue to hold everything ? If that is what you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indeed the most profitable approach in the long term ? ( The alternative being that I sell some or all of my holdings so as to avoid further losses ) <p> I definitely agree with you that it 's important to keep a level head during downturns if you own quality assets or have a good system and your example of land is interesting . The logic is that land will always be valuable and , assuming population growth , should become more valuable over time so a blind buy-and-hold is probably going to be a good strategy over an individual 's investing career ... makes sense . <p> I think the game changes a little when we start to talk about companies though . There is a lot more going on with companies than just the business they are in and so they become a little less predictable ! Land may be a good bet for 50 years but an investment in a property company can still go to 0 over the same period . <p> You make the point in your first sentence that " I think what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reassurance that I 'm not crazy to keep holding onto shares that I feel no reason to sell . " I think those last few words get at the point I 'm really thinking about - what process are using to determine if you feel no reasons to sell that company ? <p> If you rely on a manual research process then either you have to do substantial work to accurately answer this question , or trust your initial analysis was correct . If you just leave it to fate , then you will eventually miss a changing situation . Not all companies rebound out of drawdowns after all - just take a look at any number of financials after 2007 ! <p> My solution instead is to find a robust system and to then simply stick with that through the down turns . Sure you will still have periods of poor performance , but the system will pick up on deteriorating fundamentals that the buy-and-forget investor will miss and involves much less judgement than the research process . It is hard enough just to stick with a plan but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chance of major errors increases and with it the chance of permanent losses . <p> To be honest with you , that 's not quite what I was getting at although I do think that there is some evidence to suggest blind buy-and-hold works . There was this story from Fidelity for example that was mentioned on the forums here a while ago : <p> In short , Fidelity found their best performing retail accounts belonged to those who forgot they had Fidelity accounts ! For most people , the endless cycling in and out of positions just led them to buy high and sell low , incurring a whole load of transaction costs along the way . I 've not got any more serious reviews of that hypothesis to hand I 'm afraid but will have a look at some point . <p> The strategy I was arguing for was a much more systematic approach that removed , as far as possible , room for biases and bad thinking in the decision making process , i.e. the StockRanks . <p> My reasoning is not that it 's impossible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many decades ( which has been done and we know is very profitable ) , just that it is exceptionally hard to do so . Even to get it right on one stock requires near constant research and judgement , leaving you with many opportunities to get it wrong over the lifetime of the investment . <p> Instead , by using a simple systematic decision making process , we reduce enormously the number of judgements we have to make and it is this that I think increases our chance of success . <p> Tom currently works in financial services assurance for a large international accountancy firm , but pursues his long term goal of a career in investing in his spare time.Though writing primarily on individual companies and ideas , he considers the investment process itself to be of equal importance and will write on this from time to time.Tom is a CFA level III candidate and while he is currently a member of the Association of Accounting Technicians , is also undertaking studies to qualify as a chartered accountant . more ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @

In his address to the meeting Mr Tang reiterated strongly of his personal , as well as the company 's , commitment to work with the Bangladesh Government and the local community to develop the Phulbari Coal Project including associated power plants . GCM Resources , held its Annual General Meeting ( AGM ) in London on Friday last 18th December . <p> Mr Tang said GCM through its subsidiary Asia Energy wants to be a part of the Government of Bangladesh 's initiative to generate 19,000MW ( Megawatts ) of power from coal by 2030 . The Government 's decision to move quickly with large scale coal-fired power is supported by the UN 's Human Development Report 2015 released last week . This report positions Bangladesh at 142 out of 188 countries in terms of Human Development despite the very good work by the Government .

He gave the example of Chinese state enterprises to develop over 92 coal-fired power plants in 27 countries for a combined capacity of 107GW(Gigawatts) . These projects are largely assisted by the China Export-Import Bank . South Korea and Japan are also expanding their coal-fired power generation capacities and India has recently announced that it is on track to open one new coal mine per month and double its coal output by 2020 . It was recently reported that China , India , and Indonesia now burn 71% of the world 's newly-mined coal , and countries like Pakistan , the Philippines , and Vietnam could soon push the Asia-Pacific 's share of the total to 80% .

He said although Bangladesh is vulnerable to the effects of climate change , it is not itself a significant emitter of greenhouse gases including carbon dioxide . Per capita carbon dioxide emissions are substantially below other countries in the region . Even with the addition of the 4,000MW of electricity capacity which Phulbari coal could support , Bangladesh would still be one of the lowest emitters of carbon dioxide in the world , even substantially less per capita than its neighbouring countries . . <h> 2 Comments on " Datuk Michael Tang New GCM 's Chairman " <p> Its about time Phulbari was given the go ahead before the gas runs out .
