Suntai Under House Arrest ' <p> A group , the Taraba Peoples Vanguard , yesterday , in Kaduna , alleged that the Deputy Governor of Taraba State , Alhaji Umar Garba , has issued instructions curtailing the movements of Governor Danbaba Suntai and his aides , including restriction of visitors to the recuperating Suntai . <p> The group , in a statement by Chief Lidua Bako and Shawalu Garba , National Coordinator and Secretary of the group respectively , also dismissed media reports that Suntai had visited Abuja to confer with President Goodluck Jonathan on his bid to return to power , saying he actually went to see his medical consultants and to meet with Gen. Theopheluos Danjuma ( rtd ) and other important indigenes of Taraba State . <p> The statement , in part , read : " We , the Taraba People 's Vanguard across the 35 states of the federation , have followed with very keen interest political developments in our state from the time governor , Danbaba Danfulani Suntai , was involved in that unfortunate air crash which the Almighty God , in His infinite mercies , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state since that time has been very shameful and especially the recent moves to hijack the free mandate given Governor Danbaba Suntai by the overwhelming majority of Tarabans . <p> " It is quite disturbing that on 14th January while Muslims were busy celebrating the Ed -- Maulud holiday , Deputy Governor Garba Umar of Taraba State convened a State Security Council meeting where he read out the following riot acts : That all the security aides of Governor Danbaba Suntai be transferred out of Government House , Jalingo . " That henceforth all visitors to Governor Danbaba Suntai must be approved by the Deputy Governor , the Commissioner of Police or the governor 's younger brother , Babangida . <p> " That henceforth , apart from Sunday Church services , he must approve the governor 's movement within and outside the state .

" Already a letter to implement this directive has been written and forwarded to the Airport Controller by Garvey Yawe , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Chief of Staff appointed by Governor Suntai on his return from America have been banned from entering the Government House Jalingo . <p> " Our informant who is also a member of the State Security Council disclosed that the Deputy Governor severely warned everybody in the State Security Council meeting not to be caught amongst those who would attempt to contravene any of the above acts as he emphatically threatened that such a person would be summarily dealt with because , according to him , he has the blessing of Mr. President to read out the riot act . <p> " Despite numerous media propaganda sponsored by Umar that the governor went to Aso Rock and was rebuffed , unknown to the Deputy Governor , Governor Suntai never went to the Aso Rock or even sought to meet the president but went on a private medical visit to his consultants and to consult with prominent Taraba indigenes on the current developments in the state . <p> " This Vanguard was reliably informed that the frustration of Alhaji Garba Umar with Lieutenant General TY Danjuma is over the General 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Deputy Governor of Taraba State . <p> " In another swift move to send Governor Suntai completely out of the state so as to pave way for Alhaji Garba Umar was the suggestion by the Attorney General and Commissioner for Justice appointed by Umar that Suntai be moved out of Nigeria back to hospital in America . This was vehemently opposed as it did not receive the blessing of most members of the Security Council . " <p> But a close aide of Umar , who spoke to our men , said it was a lie that such a development ever happened . " The acting governor is still loyal and respectful to the ailing Governor . He would never give such instruction . He has stabilised the state and is waiting for his boss to get well enough and come back to his office " , he stated on phone .

@@1861238 <h> In Nigeria , pastors make us eat grass too ! <p> PM NEWS LAGOS -- Pastor Lesego Daniel of Rabboni Centre Ministries , in Garankuwa , north of Pretoria , South Africa , early this month , turned his church members to herbivores by asking them to eat grass for them to be " closer to God " . The report , entitled " Lawn Again Christians " ( a twist of Born Again Christians ) , was published by the Mail on 11 January 2014 . While this act was widely condemned in the media ( it even went viral in the social media ) , analysts want Nigerian church goers to look at themselves because they too have been made to eat grass one way or the other by their own pastors , because of their belief that the liturgical approach of their religious leaders can not be questioned . In other words , pastors must be obeyed implicitly ! <p> According to the Mail , the Pastor Daniel 's controversial methods have drawn criticism from thousands of people " although members of his congregation swear by his methods -- he is said to have claimed that humans can eat anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to eat . " <p> Another medium , Times Live , quoted a 21-year old law student , Rosemary Phetha , justifying her pastor 's order : " Yes , we eat grass and we 're proud of it because it demonstrates that , with God 's power , we can do anything , " adding that she had been battling a sore throat for more than a year , but it " was healed after she ate the grass . " <p> Another church member , Doreen Kgatle , 27 , of Ga-rankuwa , claimed that she suffered a stroke two years ago and could not walk " but soon after eating the grass , as the pastor had ordered , I started gaining strength and an hour later I could walk again . " <p> GRASS ROOTS : Members of the Rabboni Centre Ministries , under ' miracle man ' pastor Lesego Daniel , eat grass as part of a ritual to show that humans can be controlled by the spirit of GodImage by : SUPPLIEDIt was a re-enactment of how King Nebuchadnezzar walked on all fours and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ate grass for seven years before he was restored on his throne . <p> Notwithstanding the defensive testimonies of some of the faithful , not a few members started vomiting after the exercise . <p> However , Daniel has not made any comment in his own defence , but he posted on his Facebook wall : " God is at work and His people are testifying right now at the ... TO GOD BE THE GLORY . " <p> In Nigeria , analysts say that there are many way pastors have asked their church members to eat grass . One of these is the expensive universities built with the contributions of the members . But church members soon realised that they laboured for nothing : the universities were not built for them , as they can not afford the fees when the institutions open for use . It is like an embrace with poverty and ignorance for the present and future generations of members , said a commentator . <p> A member of Winners Chapel who did not want his name in print narrated : " My wife and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on . It was an alternative given by the church for those who did not have cash . But when the university opened , I could not send my son and my nephew there because I could not afford the fees . " <p> The same thing goes for Redeemed members . A pastor had to resign and set up his own church after he was transferred out of Lagos . In his new location in Ondo State , he had to send text messages to people to help him pay his son 's school fees at the Federal University of Technology , Akure . " If I could not afford FUTA fees , how could I , a pastor , pay for my children 's education at Redeemers ' University ? , " he lamented to P.M. News . <p> One thing that analysts point out is the danger in obeying pastors ' instructions that fly against common sense . " Look at what happened to the followers of Jim Jones " , a member of Winners Chapel in Lagos told P.M. News . <p> On 18 November 1978 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his church , the People 's Temple religious cult to commit mass suicide in Jonestown , Guyana , South America . <p> According to Wikipedia , The leader of the cult , James Warren Jones , was born on 13 May 1931 , the son of a Ku Klux Klansman in Lynn , Indiana . After establishing his church in 1953 , and believing a nuclear Armageddon was coming , he moved his congregation to the San Francisco Bay Area in 1965 . <p> Trouble started in 1977 when a New West magazine article charged Jones with " faith-healing fakery , physical abuse of his parishioners and questionable finances . " He moved to his jungle land in Guyana which he bought for a " People 's Temple Agricultural Project , " with about a select thousand members . <p> Pastor Daniel : commanded church members to eat grassHowever when , in June 1978 , the San Francisco Chronicle published People 's Temple defector Deborah Layton 's account and affidavit on the cult ( weekly drills for mass suicide ) , this prompted the visit , on 17 November 1978 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself . Initially , Jones received the parliamentarian warmly , but when some members who were fed up with life on the camp wanted to leave with Ryan , they were murdered at the airstrip on orders from Jim Jones . When he knew that more trouble was in the air for him , Jones ordered his people to commit suicide by drinking cyanide-laced juice , which he called a " revolutionary suicide . " <p> This and worse may happen if church members do not develop a critical mind . <p> If critical thinking was absent in the church , Christianity which went through a lot of evil and heresy in the middle ages would have been long dead . A member of the Redeemed Church pointed at what Martin Luther did in Europe " without which there would have been no Evangelical and Pentecostal Christianity . " <p> Tired of the bad practices in the Catholic Church when pastors would collect money from church members before " forgiving them their sins " ( the indulgences ) , Martin Luther , a reverend father and a professor of Theology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Disputation of Martin Luther on the Power and Efficacy of Indulgences , " ) to his bishop , Albert of Mainz , protesting the sale of indulgences . <p> According to a historian , he nailed a copy of his document publicly on the door of his church . He wrote that , since forgiveness was God 's alone to grant , " Those who claimed that indulgences absolved buyers from all punishments and granted them salvation were in error . " <p> What analysts said essentially is that for the preservation of Christianity for the present and future generations , Nigerian church goers need to point out what is wrong in the church . Keeping quiet in the name of " touch not my anointed and do my prophet no harm " will do more injury than good to the Body of Christ

@@1862234 <h> Alaere Alaibe , Five Years Of Unfading Memories <p> Two weeks before she passed on , my father had been kidnapped and killed by his captors . Both deaths had rudely shocked me , essentially because of the suddenness that defined them . Perhaps it was worse with my dad 's , because there was no inkling whatsoever that danger was so near to the old man . <p> But for Augustina Alaere Alaibe , the beautiful wife of Timi Alaibe , the news of her death was like a chilly winter storm : nobody likes it . Yes , she had been ill , but nobody reckoned it was terminal . <p> It is five years now that the Niger Delta amazon passed on . Five years that ring like yesterday . Perhaps it is true that those we love never really die . We assume they merely sojourned to a far country , hoping , somehow , that there will yet be a reconnect . That , in a way , has always robbed me of the courage to delete her telephone number from my mobile phone , even after changing the device too many times since then . The thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blame me . <p> And for five years , that has powered my memory of our dear humble and brilliant " madam " . Next Friday , January 31 , will be the fifth anniversary of her passage . <p> Some of us refuse to forget . How can we forget ? She was a quintessential woman imbued with everything needful . She was a complete and perfect package . How she ended up having so short a shelf life remains a mystery decodable only be God . <p> We have long taken consolation in her short but wonderful timelines on earth . Hers was a life filled with sunshine and fun , garnished with goodwill for others . That was the motivation for her pet project : Family Reorientation Education and Empowerment ( FREE ) , essentially aimed at mobilising the Niger Delta womenfolk ( including even men ) to rediscover their unharnessed potential . <p> For the eight years or so that she ran FREE , the echoes of her efforts were already reverberating in several corners of the world so much that the United Nations , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing among the innocent but illiterate womenfolk in the Niger Delta . The UN gave her an award . It opened the flood gates of applauses , endorsements and laurels for Alaere . But she was just begun , she said . But death , said she was already done . Sad ! <p> Gradually but steadily , Niger Delta was beginning to collocate with the " second chance " phenomenon which FREE was offering the womenfolk . Old and even young women who had missed their chance of appropriate education were already being mobilised for literacy programmes . It is was not only in Alaere 's home state of Bayelsa . It was in the entire Niger Delta region . The women were enthusiastic and burned with passion to regain a lost chance . They already knew things about timetable , as they went to farm in the mornings and to school in the evenings . Old women strapped school bags to their backs with kindergarten kicks . The thought of learning ABC ... and 123 ... in the then 28 learning centres thrilled them with electrifying effect . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reading simple sentences and expressing their thoughts in short and simple sentences . The sensation that followed was triggering a kind of academic renaissance in the region . Today , the number of the learning centres has however reduced . <p> Alaere , beside her self , had employed several teachers who helped in the teaching and learning process , keeping strongly to the basest of simple pedagogy . <p> In the years that followed , she introduced her teeming pupils to entrepreneurship . They had formed co-operative societies , especially in Kaiama and Olobiri in Kolokuma Opokuma Local Government Area of Bayelsa State . They had jointly owned large cassava farms . They were already trying their hands on several ventures . And soon they confessed ( in their theme song ) that " Wealth is not far away ( 2ice ) Wealth is within our reach We hitherto thought wealth was really far off in Overseas , abroad ( 2ice ) But now and behold <p> Alaere has taught us that wealth is just in the bush behind us ... " Five years after her demise , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hospital she established in Opokuma has not ceased to attend to patients .

And this is essentially because her husband , Timi , has ensured that the light does not go out on the flame of self-discovery she lit among the Niger Delta people . <p> FREE has continued to wax stronger . The activities of the body have remained as enchanting , if nothing else , to sustain the inspiration Alaere had . It has proven to be her greatest legacy : the investment on human capital . <p> During the week , I drove through Toyin Street in Lagos , to Ibis Hotel on the same street . I drove past what used to be Pretty Woman , Alaere 's signature business outfit . The place was hollow . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rebirth , expectedly for another venture by another man/woman .

But there they are in the Niger Delta , the human beings she impacted their lives are still singing and marching in her praise . They hope that someday , the ultimate breakthrough Alaere planned for them will come . Hope springs eternal ! <p> They have refused to despair . And that is why , even in the absence of Alaere , the dream has not died . Today , there is the good news of the 15 hectares cassava farm in Kaiama , which has received generous grants and assistance from FADAMA , the Bayelsa State Agriculture ministry and the Niger Delta Development Commission ( NDDC ) , as well . The Co-operative Society now has a garri processing factory ; and has added vegetable farming and a plantain plantation in their quest to keep the flag flying . <p> And every year , they hold what approximates to Annual General Meeting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ un-waning spirit , but also celebrate the memory of their mentor .

@@1862237 <h> KENNY OKOLUGBO : In the Service of Ndokwa Nation <p> By Omon-Julius Onabu A lazy carpenter blames his tools , is a well known adage in this part of the world used to connote some people 's penchant for giving excuses . Perhaps , it finds expression in the practice among many persons occupying positions in public service to blame their poor performance on the short term in office . Against this backdrop , the people of Ndokwa ethnic nationality expressed appreciation for the exemplary leadership style and demonstrable commitment of Sir Kenny Okolugbo as a grassroot and forward-looking leader . <p> It is noteworthy that the open acknowledgement of Okolugbo 's giant strides in community development is coming just one year in the saddle as the commissioner representing them on the board of the Delta State Oil Producing Areas Development Commission ( DESOPADEC ) . <p> Okolugbo explained the drive for his landmark achievement thus : " I consider it a rare privilege and honour to be appointed as Commissioner representing the great Ndokwa Nation in DESOPADEC . His Excellency , Dr Emmanuel Uduaghan reposed so much confidence in me ; and , I can not but work hard to live up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the three-point development agenda of His Excellency , Dr Uduaghan , who has been working tirelessly to deliver the dividends of democracy to our people through widespread infrastructural and people-oriented projects across the state . " He also expressed appreciation to Speaker Victor Ochei and the Delta State House of Assembly for its support especially in the area of funding . <p> During the recent thanksgiving to mark the remarkable year , the presiding minister and Bishop of Ukwani Diocese of the Anglican Communion , Rt Rev David Obiosa , asked the congregation to confirm if indeed the numerous projects enumerated as having be initiated and executed by DESOPADEC within Sir Kenny Okolugbo 's one year in office existed In reality , the bishop said that he had to get the people 's confirmation because of the ugly incidence of unfulfilled promises by many leaders vis- ? -vis that of abandoned projects across the country . He then blessed Okolugbo and family asked God to continue to guide him so that he would not deviate from path of conscientious service to his people in whatever capacity he found himself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ numerous projects across communities making up the Ndokwa Nation . Among the DESOPADEC projects spread across the area are constructed and renovated classroom blocks , constructed and fully equipped ICT centre and libraries , roads , antenatal clinic , cottage hospital and health centres , and market stalls . <p> Completed street light projects include those of Okuzu Quarters and Obiaroku Market Road in Obiaruku as well as Umutu ; while major road projects include the construction of Second Phase of Hospital Road , Umutu , and the Oguna Obi-Ogene Road Project . <p> Moreover , Okolugbo has also given some attention to transportation by empowering several youths with the donation of tricycles . He has also provided step-down transformers and purchased Hilux vans to boost the police in their crime-fighting efforts . <p> At Ebedei Grammar School , located in the first oil host community in Ukwuani , where an eight classroom block has been completed and is ready for use by the students , the staff , parents and community leaders could not disguise their excitement and sense of gratitude .

Nonetheless , Okolugbo promised to ensure that a " modern science laboratory and library are built and commissioned " by the end of the first quarter of 2014 , in response to the principal , Mr John Ogbebo 's litany of requests . He stressed that the school " was totally dilapidated and in a sorry state when I assumed here in 2012 " , but noted that the school has benefited greatly from the three-point agenda of the Uduaghan administration . <p> One feature of the recent tour and inauguration of most of the projects initiated and executed within the first twelve months of Sir Okolugbo as DESOPADEC Commissioner was the fact that in practically every community where a project is sited , the people rolled out the drums to receive Okolugbo and his entourage . Indeed , in some places like Ebedei , Ugbeleme , Umutu , Oguna Obi-Ogene and Owah-Abbi , the commissioning practically assumed the atmosphere of a carnival .

You have to HAVE this product . <p> MAKEUP : PRIMER <p> For makeup , primers as we all know are important . They reduce the oil and shine while giving your foundation something to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trick to primers is , buy a matching primer . If you are using a water based foundation , use a water based primer ... imagine using a water based primer and using an oil based foundation ... water and oil .... you know they do n't mix , hence making your face an atlas with orisirsi maps . The best thing to do is , if you use a Mary Kay foundation , use a Mary Kay primer , you ca n't go wrong that way , because it could be hectic deciding which is water based and which is oil or silicone based . <p> Secret weapon for primer would have to be Milk of Magnesia . <p> This is a drug , Magnesium hydroxide that treats constipation , upset stomach , or heartburn . This medicine is a laxative and an antacid and is widely used as a face primer . Milk of Magnesia ( MOM ) is a great cleanser and toner . It can be used to help minimize pore size and to eliminate blackheads . Using it as a base under you makeup can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so matte and fresh . MOM could be a headache to get in Nigeria so a great substitute is MISMAG ! You know that sticky white liquid we did n't like to use when we were younger , yeah it is a good primer . As with everything in this life , moderation is key as some experts say excessive use of magnesium on the face can cause skin to sag if it 's too dry . Use with a cotton ball all over your face , allow to dry then apply your foundation . <p> When it comes to foundation and powders , you see , even the most expensive OIL FREE FOUNDATIONS still contain oil , no matter how small . So having that in mind , I 'd recommend Revlon Colorstay , Iman perfect response , Fashion Fair Oil free creme to powder ( My Favourite Foundation ) , MaryKay TIMEWISE foundation ( pink and black tube ) . Zaron oil free creme to powder , has been stripped to the lowest degree of oil . It is really dry , it is even a bother to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ try it out ! If you can get your hands on the Makeup Atelier Gel Foundation , it is a really great product . Black Opal Invisible Oil Blocking Powder is also a steal , it is colourless and can be used as a finishing powder , I never go on set w/o this product . <p> MAKEUP : SETTING SPRAYS <p> Setting sprays are also a good investment if you want to go all the way . They are like hairsprays for makeup , that keep makeup in place for a long time . Now the ONLY setting spray that I have used that does exactly what it says is SKINDANAVIA MAKEUP SETTING SPRAY . <p> They come in Bridal , No more shine and original , 10 years younger and moisture lock . I do have 3 out of these , and they are not so different from each other , it would n't matter which one you got . ELF does these too , MAC , Urban Decay but to me they are a total waste of money especially MAC 's fix+ which does nothing but " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blotting sheets if you have that type of unforgiving oily skin . When the oil starts rearing its ugly head , all you have to do is take a sheet and blot out the oil without tampering with your makeup . <p> EXTRA TIPS <p> After applying your foundation , just before you use your powder , use a tissue to blot out the oil . The tissue will suck out the oil while leaving the pigments on your face . Learned this from my favourite beauty guru in the whole wide world , " Goss The Makeup Artist " and it goes a long way in keeping the face matte . <p> Then , use a Powder Puff instead of a powder brush . Press in your powder puff into your skin instead of just dusting your face with a powder brush . Press Press and Press . The powder puff will absorb the oil and seal in the powder . Infact just try this step w/o powder when you are all oily , press the powder puff to your face and see how it will absorb the oil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> If you do not have a seriously blemished face , stay away from pancaking your face all the time . Pick where you have blemishes , cover with some foundation or concealer as the case may be and finish with your powder ! <p> That 's all I 've got for now ladies !

The dividend per share reduced from N10 in 2011 to N8 in 2012 and further to N7 in 2013 . <p> Although the company has been adopting various strategies to it deliver improved results and declare higher dividends to shareholders , the challenging operating environment has been affecting the performance of the company . <p> Going by the half year unaudited results of the Guinness Nigeria released last week , which saw profit after tax decline by 32 per cent , shareholders are likely to see a further cut in dividend pay-out for the year ending June 30 , 2014 . <p> Corporate Profile Guinness Nigeria , is a subsidiary of Diageo ( the world 's leading premium drinks business with an outstanding collection of beverage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was established in 1950 . <p> It became listed on the Nigerian Stock Exchange NSE ) in 1965 . After is first brewery in Ikeja , Lagos , Guinness had to build three more major breweries in Nigeria during the next 30 years following the a steady growth in markets for Guinness Stout and Harp lager . <p> The company built a second brewery in Benin , Edo State in 1974 , where it produced Harp lager beer . In 1982 , a fourth Guinness brewery was built in Lagos to brew Harp Premium Lager beer . In 2004 , Guinness Nigeria inaugurated a new brewery at Aba , Abia State . <p> The shares of Guinness Nigeria are held 46 per cent by Guinness Overseas Limited ( a subsidiary of Diageo Plc ) ; eight per cent by Atalantaf Limited , another company owned by Diageo ; bringing total shareholding of Diageo Plc to 54 per cent . The remaining 46 per cent is held by Nigerians and institutional investors . <p> The board of directors of Guinness Nigeria is led by Mr. Tunde Salvage , who is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Seni Adetu is the managing director/chief executive officer . <p> Half-year Financial Results Guinness Nigeria Plc 's half year result ended December 31 , 2013 showed a decline of 32 per cent in profit before tax ( PBT ) . The company posted a turnover of N52.7 billion , which was 13 per cent below the N61 billion recorded in the corresponding period of 2012 . Gross profit fell 10.6 per cent from N28.2 billion to N25.2 billion , while PBT declined by 32 per cent from N9.4 billion to N6.4 billion.However , efforts by the brewing firm to reduce operating expenses and operating costs led to an improvement in the profit after tax which fell by 22 per cent from N6.4 billion to N5.0 billion . <p> Guinness made efforts to manage its costs by reducing cost of sale , and financing cost . Cost of sale fell by 16 per cent from N32.6 billion to N27.5 billion . Operating expense ( Opex ) recorded a marginal decline of one per cent from 17.45 billion to N17.63 billion , while financing cost depreciated by five per cent from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Explaining the half year performance , Adetu attributed it to three major factors . The first thing , he said , is down trading in the company 's value brand due to the discretionary income of consumers that was affected especially in the first quarter of that half year . <p> " That segment is a segment that Guinness Nigeria , historically has not played in because we are a premium brands company and we are better positioned between the premium and mainstream - premium through Guinness and mainstream through Harp . <p> But we have seen that the market is going the direction of value segment for brands that are typically priced at N150 . Now , we have only just launched a brand in that segment and the brand is yet to gain traction in distribution that would enable us to play competitively with others . So that impacted our performance , " the CEO said . <p> The second thing , according to Adetu is the aggressiveness with which the company priced its products . He added , however , those prices had been reversed to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he said is the inability of the company to convert some of the opportunities they have around our retail consumers to real outcome . <p> " So , much as we are displeased with the performance , much as we know we could have done better , we are encouraged by the fact that we are clear on the issues that slowed us down and they are issues that we can address and we have addressed them and therefore we expect that going forward we expect to see improved performance from Guinness Nigeria , " Adetu said . <p> Analysts ' Assessment Looking at the results , analysts at Dunn Loren Merrifield , a banking investment services firm , said Guinness Nigeria reported sales revenue of N52.76billion , which is below the N60.88 billion posted in the corresponding period of 2012 by 13.3 per cent . According to them , the sales revenue recorded in the period is below their estimate of N65.61billion by 13.9 per cent . <p> " In our view , the decline in the revenue was a result of a change in the consumption pattern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ market brands . The decline in the second quarter sales revenue is a reversal of established trend of growth in 2Q sales numbers , " they said . <p> The analysts added that in the six months the company recorded operating expenses ( opex ) of N16.63billion , showing an increase of increase of 1.0 per cent ompared with N17.45 billion in 2012/13 . <p> The marginal increase in the opex , according to them , was a result of 8.4 per cent increase in administrative expenses to N5.09billion , while marketing &amp; distribution expenses declined by 1.7 per cent to N12.54billion . <p> " Therefore , operating profit dropped by 28.3 per cent to N8.05billion compared with N11.23billion in the previous year . Similarly , opex/revenue ratio moved up to 33.4 per cent relative to 28.7 per cent in the corresponding period of 2012/13 , hence operating profit margin declined to 15.2 per cent against 18.4 per cent in the previous period , " they said . <p> They noted that overall , total cost dropped by 9.8 per cent to N45.10billion against N50.02billion recorded in the same period @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 85.5 per cent relative to 82.2 per cent recorded in the previous period .

@@1865233 <h> Transfer Pricing Policy : Paving the way for the journey ahead <p> You must have heard about transfer pricing by now and possibly have an idea of what it means . In case you have n't then you have a longer road to travel than many others , but the good news is you can start now and still make it to the finish line in time . You may also have received a letter from the Federal Inland Revenue Service ( FIRS ) requesting for your organisation 's transfer pricing policy . If so , congratulations -- at least it shows that you have records with the taxman and you have not been forgotten even if you wish so . If not , then your guess is as good as mine . <p> Transfer Pricing ( TP ) deals with the interaction between related parties , both corporate and natural persons , in terms of commercial transactions from one to another and ask the question " what is the basis of the price agreed for your related party transactions ? " Make no mistakes ; this is not just about having a written agreement in place -- it is about being able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( or fee ) being paid is not arbitrary , and has not been manipulated to confer on you or your related party an undue advantage to the detriment of the taxman . <p> For instance , when dealing with unrelated persons , you do not just hire anyone and pay just any amount as salaries , and you do not just set the price of your goods or services based on impulse , but rather based on carefully considered parameters and market conditions . You must deal with your related parties in the same way and must be seen to be doing so by providing the basis and documented evidence . Now this is where your TP policy comes into play . <p> A policy is a framework , a statement of intent , a set of principles and procedures to guide decision making in order to achieve desired results or rational outcomes in a consistent manner . Therefore , for TP purposes , there should be a policy to address dealings among group members and other related parties including key shareholders , technical partners and directors . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be set for related party transactions such as management and technical services , secondment of staff , shared costs , intercompany loans and guarantees , royalty , sale of goods or transfer of assets and so on . The first step in establishing a TP policy is to gain an in-depth understanding of the business , the organisation structure , the market and economic circumstances , the industry where the group operates and so on . The next step is identifying all related parties and the relevant transactions between them . Then the core of the exercise is to gather all the relevant facts and circumstances surrounding each transaction . These facts can be summarised in three categories -- functions , risks and assets . <p> ( 1 ) functions -- that is , the activities that each of the entities engaged in a particular transaction perform as a normal part of its operations ; <p> ( 2 ) risks -- that is , a significant portion of the rate of return earned by any business should reflect the fact that the business is bearing risks of various kinds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , product liability risk and warranty . <p> ( 3 ) assets -- that is , both tangible and intangible assets that are used in performing the transaction must be considered in setting the price . <p> Once the policy has been developed , it must be approved by the Board of Directors or other equivalent body within the organisation . Of course things can change and they often do , but in terms of policies , changes are expected to be less frequent so you should consider your TP policy a fairly static document that will last for some time , usually not less than three years before an update or a review becomes necessary . Because of the enduring nature , it is conventional wisdom that a TP policy should be meticulously done and diligently implemented . <p> The evidence of the TP policy implementation to achieve market driven prices when dealing with related parties together with the policy itself will makeup the TP documentation . <p> Based on the TP Regulations issued by the FIRS in August 2012 , affected companies are required to comply from their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taxpayers must submit , with their tax returns , appropriate TP declaration and disclosure forms . For businesses liable to tax under the Companies Income Tax Act , the due date is six months after the financial year end date , while for companies liable to tax under the Petroleum Profits Tax Act , it is five months . <p> Upon examination or desk review of the returns and disclosure forms , the FIRS may request for detailed TP documentation which must be provided within 21 days . Given that it is not practicable to prepare any meaningful TP documentation within 21 days , affected companies should prepare their documentation before filing their tax returns regardless of a request from the FIRS . All taxpayers may be asked to submit a TP declaration form whether they have related party transactions or not in order to enable the FIRS determine more easily non-compliant taxpayers . <p> Taiwo Oyedele <p> The request for TP policies by the FIRS ahead of tax returns filing deadlines is a clear indication that they are keen to start the review of compliance with the TP regulations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to their compliance in this regard and ensure all relevant documentation is ready before the due date . <p> Suffice to say that any organisation involved in related party transactions without a TP policy will be considered as being arbitrary in their pricing decisions . This also means such organisations will be regarded as high risk taxpayers in terms of potential tax avoidance or even evasion and should be prepared to entertain the taxman for TP audits more frequently than others . If you do not have a policy in place , you should request for more time from the FIRS within which to prepare and submit the TP policy .

@@1865237 <h> Nigeria : Marginal Field Bid Round 2013 <h> Introduction <p> The oil and gas industry is buzzing with excitement following the recent announcement by the Federal Government of the 2nd Marginal Field Licensing Round . This is understandable given the various delays and postponements that have characterised the commencement of a subsequent marginal field licensing round . <p> This Marginal Field Licensing Round which comes 12 years after the 2001 Marginal Field Licensing Round is consistent in the objective to boost indigenous exploration and production activities . <p> The announcement is coming at a time when new investments in the oil and gas industry have been stalled due to the non-passage of the Petroleum Industry Bill ( PIB ) . The non-passage has essentially restricted the Federal Government from increasing itS revenue base and has stifled activities in the upstream sector . <p> The Guidelines for Farm-out and Operation of Marginal Fields 2013 ( the 2013 Guidelines ) issued by the Department of Petroleum Resources ( DPR ) sets out the procedure to be followed in the bidding for 31 ( thirty-one ) marginal fields in the 2nd Marginal Field Licensing Round . <p> Key items contained in the 2013 Guidelines are set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The 2013 Guidelines retained the definition of a Marginal Field contained in the Petroleum Act 1969 ( as amended ) as well as the ( 2001 Guidelines ) . Some of the features of a Marginal Field include ( i ) fields not considered for development based on fiscal and market conditions ( ii ) fields in which only one exploratory well has been drilled for having high gas and low oil reserves ( iii ) fields that have been abandoned by leaseholders for more than 3 years for economic or operational reasons etc . <h> What 's on Offer ? <p> 31 Marginal Fields consisting of 16 onshore and 15 offshore fields are available under the 2013 Marginal Field Licensing Round . <h> Who can Apply ? <p> An Applicant Company must be indigenous and must be substantially Nigerian.1Each Applicant Company is required to demonstrate capabilities , both technical and managerial to operate any Marginal Field awarded . The constitution of an Applicant Company must clearly state that its object would be oil and gas exploration and production . Each shareholder of an Applicant Company can only hold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or no track record or experience must show their capability to attract a credible technical partner . One of the shareholders/member of the Applicant Company must be the Operator of the field . <h> Pre-qualification Requirement <p> Each prospective pre-qualification applicant can only bid for a maximum of 3 Marginal Fields . The DPR is to ensure that each field does not have more than 5 ( five ) pre-qualified bidders . <h> Financial Implication <p> Prospective applicants are required to remit the following : <p> I. Application Fees N200,000.00 per field <p> II . Processing Fees N300,000,00 per field <p> Upon pre-qualification , a pre-qualified applicant can undertake data prying upon payment of the sum of USD3,000.00 per field . The sum of USD15,000.00 would also be payable per field for leasing of data by prequalified bidders . The 2013 Guideline also introduces the option for pre-qualified bidders requiring technical assistance with leased data to obtain such services from a Technical Adviser.2 <h> Evaluation of the Bids <p> The evaluation criterion includes information on shareholding of Applicant Company , Technical and Managerial Skill , ability to pay the Signature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and experience in holding and operating fields . <h> Award of Field <p> A Marginal Field Awardee ( MF Awardee ) is to be announced following the recommendation of a Selection Committee4 to the Minister of Petroleum Resources and the President . Upon the award to an Applicant Company , a Farmout Agreement is expected to be entered into between the Farmor and the Applicant ( Farmee ) . A Joint Operating Agreement would be negotiated prior to the signing of a Farm-Out Agreement with the Farmor where 2 or more Applicants are jointly awarded a MF . <p> A Signature Bonus of USD300,000.00 is to be paid per field . Payment of the Signature Bonus expected is to be effected within 90 days from the date of award of the field to a MF Awardee . <h> Marginal Field Farm-Out Agreement <p> Key provisions/clauses to be contained in the Marginal Field Farm-out Agreement are as follows : <p> i.Straddle Fields Reservoirs : Any Marginal Field which straddles anotherblock shall be operated as a unit with the first leaseholder . A Unitizatio Agreement will be required to be executed prior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fields . <p> ii . Abandonment : An agreed percentage of the MF Awardee 's budgetmust be set aside to provide security for abandonment costs . <p> iii . Community Development Relationship : An MF Awardee will beresponsible for community development activities in the Farm-out Area . <p> iv . Insolvency of Farmee : Where an MF Awardee becomes insolvent , theMarginal Field shall be returned to the Farmor with all obligations andliabilities remaining with the MF Awardee . <p> v. Encumbrance : The MF can not be encumbered by Marginal FieldHolder . <p> vi . Assignment and Termination : Any assignment of a Marginal Field must be with the prior written consent of the Minister of Petroleum Resources5 in accordance with the Petroleum Act and the Nigerian Oiland Gas Industry Content Development Act . <h> Variation on the 2001 Guidelines <p> i . Timeline : The 2013 Guidelines stipulates a timeline of 6 months for the bid process . ( i.e from bidding to announcement and execution of the Farm-Out Agreement ) . The 2001 Guidelines did not provide a timeline for completion of the transaction and in actual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aggressive and may not be feasible in practical terms.6 <p> ii . Selection Committee : Under the 2013 Guidelines , External FinancialAdvisers have been co-opted into the Selection Committee , which wasnot contained in the 2001 edition . The exact membership drawn fromother Agencies such as DPR , NNPC and the operators of the lease hasnot been made public . It would appear that the Financial Advisers wereincluded in the Selection Committee in order to assess the financialstrength of applicants . <p> iii . Signature Bonus : The required Signature Bonus represents a 100%increase from the last licensing round ( which was USD150,000.00 ) . <p> iv . Transparency : The method of selection and evaluation of proposedawardees on the 2013 Guidelines is stated to be based on the highestscores . This position appears to run contrary to another provision in the2013 Guidelines which stipulates that following the completion of bidevaluation process , a recommendation will be made to the Honorable Minister , and subsequently to the President . This recommendation tothe Honourable Minister is a new development ( 2001 Guidelines did notinclude the Minister 's recommendation ) . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recommendations to be made - this may likely affect the perception of transparency . <p> v. 25% Maximum Equity : This provision was revealed at the Lagos RoadShow organized by the DPR . It provides specifically that a shareholder in an Applicant Company should not own more than 25% equity in the bidding entity . It appears that the DPR must have adopted this approach based on past experience with some holders of Marginal Fields who failed to carry out the development of the fields and have been reluctant to introduce new investors in the companies.7Essentially , based on DPR 's announcement , each Applicant Company must have at least 4 shareholders/members . The 25% stipulation may also have been meant to address the issues ( e.g. dispute on ownership and non alignment of interest ) which arose as a result of the regulator induced partnership arrangements that pervaded the 2001 Awards . <h> Conclusion <p> The announcement of the 2013 Marginal Field Licensing Round is indeed welcome at this time going by the stalemate generated in the passage of the PIB .

@@1867233 <p> This is a momentous period in the political evolution of our country ; and as a people we are at a historic crossroads with regard to the kind of society we are running vis-a-vis the sort of society we should be running . This is particularly more important for those of us in leadership positions in the country . Therefore , I am as sober as I am optimistic about the present situation and the future of our dear country . May I express my profound gratitude to the Board of the Independent Corrupt Practices and other Related Offences Commission ( ICPC ) for inviting me to deliver the 2014 first quarter ICPC Good Governance Forum Lecture . In addition to its primary and popular brief as an institution established to investigate , apprehend and prosecute people who indulge in corrupt practices in the country , this is a most welcome platform provided by the ICPC for addressing the hydra-headed problems confronting our country , especially those relating to the issue of crisis of governance . It is a widely acknowledged fact that corruption has become a national albatross that has made government irrelevant to the existence of the people and therefore defeated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very establishment of the ICPC itself is an eloquent statement on the entrenchment of corrupt practices in the nation 's public and private life.This makes the topic of this lecture -- ' Governance , Accountability and Transformation ' -- most germane to our socio-political situation . A very good point of take-off is for us to further enlighten one another on the meaning and the purpose of governance in order to better appreciate the need for accountability in governance and how this would enhance the process of societal transformation for the betterment of all . We may therefore ask ourselves why humans found it necessary to establish society and institute government . A persuasive reason for establishing society and instituting government is put forward by the Social Contract theorists ; and it is to escape from the State of Nature . This is because the State of Nature was fraught with certain realities that were less than desirable for and conducive to human existence , progress and development.According to one of its powerful proponents , English philosopher , Thomas Hobbes , human nature is essentially self-centred , self-interested and self-focused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in such a manner that power was used only to advance the appetitive interests of one individual at the expense of all other individuals . In such a situation that was devoid of social cooperation and organisation , human existence was defined by constant strife , insecurity and uncertainty . Thus , for Hobbes , the life of man in that state was ' solitary , brutish , poor , nasty and short ' . This was so because power was unorganised and its use unchecked by any form of restraint be it moral or physical . But since humans are rational and have aversion for death , especially avoidable death , they found a way out of the State of Nature by creating a civil society , which effectively is a product of social contract to organise power and vest it in a person or body of persons . Therefore , in Hobbes ' view , a paramount aim of government and governance is the security of limb and arm from harm , the protection of property from theft and destruction , and the enforcement of the rules of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Social Contract theorist , human existence was a transition from the State of Nature to civil society . In Rousseau 's State of Nature , there was peace and bliss and people lived simple and solitary lives . The needs of man were minimal and easily met in the relative abundance of nature . Hence , the State of Nature was devoid of the negative values such as greed and competition . In any case , people lived in relative isolation of one another . But with population growth and human progress , people began to live in small families and communities . This condition of existence witnessed the introduction of division of labour ; and along with inventions and discoveries came easier life which facilitated comparison and the development of negative values such as jealousy and pride . For Rousseau , the introduction of private property was a defining moment in the evolution of human existence , which brought in its wake serious value crises involving competition , greed , inequality , inequity and numerous other vices . Perceiving threat to their acquisition , private property owners sought the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the have-nots . In other words , government was established to sustain the inequity of social inequality . Thus , the freedom and equality that man enjoyed in the State of Nature became compromised . This must have informed the opening line of Rousseau 's The Social Contract , that ' Man was born free , and he is everywhere in chains ' . The way out of this situation was the General Will , which is a contract of all by all . From this covenant is born a new sovereign whose sole objective is the service of the common interests of the people . That is , Rousseau is of the view that the purpose of government is to be directed towards the good of all . John Locke 's version of the contract theory has had the most influence on modern democratic society and its institutions . In his opinion , the State of Nature was far from being a state of war . Rather , it was a condition that offered the freedom to conduct one 's affairs without interference from others . Even though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government , it was a peaceful condition that was governed by the law of nature which stipulated that no man shall harm another or deprive him of his possessions . This was the governing moral code in that condition . However , for Locke , the State of Nature degenerates into a state of war when there was a breach of the moral code by an attempt to dispossess someone of their lives or deprive them of their property or freedom . Consequently , once a war ensues , there is hardly any way to stop it because there is no government . Thus , as rational beings , it only makes sense to opt for a contract to create a civil government . This is a collective agreement to leave the State of Nature to form a political society under a common government with powers to make laws , to adjudicate and to enforce them . In effect , the resulting commonwealth is aimed at protecting lives , property , liberty ; and promoting the general well-being of all its members . For Locke , therefore , the only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the interests of the people , failure of which the people have a right , and in fact a duty , to dissolve such government and create a new one . This is the fundamental basis upon which a democratic society was founded -- the right to vote a government into power and vote out a non-performing one . It is also the basis of the American Revolution of 1776 that removed the British colonial government and replaced it with a democratically elected government which has endured till today and is the paradigm of democratic government for all nations . If there are purposes for which government was established , it then means these purposes are to be the object of governance . It is therefore in order for us to inform ourselves on the notion of governance . In his 2013 Working Paper 314 for Centre for Global Development , titled , What is Governance ? The Japanese-American scholar , Francis Fukuyama , defines ' governance as a government 's ability to make and enforce rules , and to deliver services , regardless of whether that government is democratic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of governance which means governance may be used to serve the purpose of government ; and it may not . This is particularly instructive in that it holds any government accountable , irrespective of its democratic credentials . In this case , it also means that the goodness of governance is not a ' given ' . However , as a committed democrat , I would rather prefer to impute democratic value to the notion of governance . This is because I believe that the instrumentalities of governance should necessarily be used to serve the interests of the people and this can best be realised within democracy . This brings to the fore the related concept of good governance . And in this usage I would not be alone . Therefore , if , according to Fukuyama in the same piece , ' governance is about the performance of agents ' in this case those who govern ' in carrying out the wishes of principals ' in this case the governed , then democracy becomes a key element in assessing the purpose of governance and how this purpose is fulfilled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the benefactors . In other words , democracy connects the fulfilment of the purpose of governance to the rendering of account to the people who are supposedly the targets and the paramount consideration in the determination and the execution of this purpose . This is accountability and it empowers the people in the governance of their own affairs . This is one of the strongest points of the democratic form of government . In this regard , The Social Science Encyclopedia ( 1996 , Second Edition by Routledge ) has an interesting notion of governance in its democratic manifestation . According to the encyclopaedia , political scientists use the concept of governance to refer ' to the process of political management which embraces the normative basis of political authority , the style in which public affairs are conducted , and the management of public resources ' . To underscore the intricate relation of the concept with democracy , it explains further that , ' Three terms are central to most definitions of governance : accountability , which denotes the effectiveness with which the governed can exercise influence over their governors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the state to exercise power over its citizens , and the extent to which those powers are perceived to be rightly exercised ; and transparency , which is founded on the existence of mechanisms for ensuring public access to decision making ' . The United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific in the small pamphlet , What is Good Governance ? informs us that good governance has the following major characteristics . ' It is participatory , consensus oriented , accountable , transparent , responsive , effective and efficient , equitable and inclusive and follows the rule of law . It assures that corruption is minimized , the views of minorities are taken into account and that the voices of the most vulnerable in society are heard in decision-making . It is also responsive to the present and future needs of society ' . The point must be made very clear that democracy only guarantees the people choice -- in determining their rulers and in policy making . It , however , does not guarantee good governance . It is a system to be operated by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is like a weapon which can be used for defence or offence . Democracy has the inherent risk of the tyranny of the majority or a tiny few manipulating the majority to pursue particularistic interests , instead of the general will of the majority . However , the people will make a choice and live with the consequences of their choice , at least for a period , after which they can correct whatever mistake of choice they have made . The point must also be made that of all forms of government , in spite of its imperfection , democracy offers the highest assurance of a very high probability of good governance . This is because it is only in a democracy that the rulers can be most accountable to the people . It therefore follows that when governance is accountable and transparent , it would bring about positive transformation in the lives of the people , which ultimately is the end of government and governance . This is why in human social evolution , democracy has displaced other forms of government -- theocracy , monarchism , feudalism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bride . It is why I am also optimistic that in spite of the problems of nationhood we are facing as a nation , we will come out triumphant in the end if we remain steadfast on the democratic path . We have had the democracy-governance nexus practically demonstrated in the State of Osun where I preside as governor and several other states where progressives are in control . Indeed , while the governance situation in the country generally fills me with a sense of sobriety ; what we have achieved in Osun gives me a sense of optimism that , with accountability and transparency in leadership , the machinery of governance can be used effectively to overcome our national malaise ; to cage the monster of corruption ; and to transform the fortunes of our nation and our people . Mr Chairman , to make the nexus between democracy and governance to be stronger , I would wish that the socio-economic development of the people be made a constitutional imperative . Their provision should not just be an inspirational reference in the constitution ; they should be made compulsory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , education , healthcare services , public infrastructure and so on should be made compulsory in the constitution . This will not only put the leaders under the burden of governance delivery , it will also minimise corruption since there can never be enough money to deliver on all requirements . I will draw still from my state . I have ongoing projects worth at least N60 billion and yet my allocation from the Federation Account fell by 40 per cent . We have had to commit the last kobo in our coffers into paying salaries and fulfilling our obligations to our contractors such that we can not even afford frivolities and indulgence of corruption . When we came in a little more than three years ago , we knew we had to provide jobs immediately for our teeming youths . We had to discard the neo-orthodoxy economics that frowns on public sector employment and adopt the position of Lord John Maynard Keynes , the influential 20th Century British economist , who advocated for the creation of public sector jobs as the panacea for the great depression and the unemployment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saved Europe and America from economic collapse at the period . We immediately employed 20,000 youths in less than 100 days of our administration on the platform of Osun Youth Empowerment Scheme ( OYES ) . After two years , we gave then soft landing into formal employment and self employment in different vocations . This programme to a large extent informed the conceptualization of the ( Youth Empowerment Social Support Operation ( YESSO ) by the World Bank , which is now replicated in 18 States in Nigeria . We have since employed another set of 20,000 , driving unemployment to its nadir and giving Osun the status of the state with the lowest unemployment figure , according to the National Bureau of Statistics and other credible agencies . Our other area of high impact is in education . Education , for us , is not just a social gathering after which a bland certificate will be issued . We were indeed alarmed after our inauguration that less than five per cent of secondary school leavers in Osun had the requisite pass for matriculation into tertiary institutions . Teachers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the pupils and students were growing wild . We immediately held a summit on education under the chairmanship of Prof Wole Soyinka . We are not just redefining the learning environment , we are now redefining education as the development of the total man , spiritually , morally and intellectually ; a man whose development must cohere with the development of his environment and fellow men . Therefore , we are building brand new 13 elementary schools , 14 middle schools and 12 high schools to which we have so far committed N14.4 billion . We are also feeding our pupils in elementary schools ( Primary 1-4 ) , giving them nutritious meals every school day . We also pioneered the e-learning tablet , Opon Imo , that contains all the textbooks for secondary school , tutorials , as well as past questions of WAEC , JAMB and NECO . This has never been done before anywhere in the whole world . To properly indigenise it , a factory has been setup in Ilesa for its manufacture . Our investment in education is already yielding good results . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ candidates that passed in the last SSSCE conducted in Osun . We are not deterred by the antics of our detractors , who being mortally afraid of our success in this area , are raising storm in a tea-cup by shifting the focus of our reform , imputing religious motives and fictively inventing a religious crisis when they could not rouse one . We are constructing roads , but not just for its sake . Roads are an integral part of our transportation infrastructure development . We target roads that impact more on the economic and social lives of the people . We have at the last count constructed over 600 kilometres of inter-city , intra-city and local government roads in three years , almost five times what the previous administration did in nearly eight years . Our empowerment programme is not for the youth alone . We also have support and empowerment programmes for the weak and vulnerable like the handicapped , the aged , widows and single mothers . We have not left out lunatics and the vagrant . One important area in which we have been outstanding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constitutes an integral part of national security . A government that can not feed its people has failed to provide an important aspect of their security . Through the agency of Osun Rural Enterprise and Agriculture Programme ( OREAP ) , the Ministry of Agriculture and Food Security and other agencies , we have been able to redirect the focus of our people to agriculture , especially food crop production . Mr Chairman , one important aspect of governance that has been troublesome is finance . There can be no governance without financial capability . If the slogan of the American Revolution , as penned by James Otis is ' Taxation without representation is tyranny ' then permit me to invert this into ' Representation without taxation is administrative emasculation ' . When our administration came in , our internally generated revenue was a paltry N300 million . In less than one year , we doubled it to N600 million ; by the grace of God today , it is N1.6 billion . Our target is to be able to earn N5 billion on our own every month . Many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and zeal . We all wait for the monthly federal allocation which in most cases is barely sufficient to pay salaries . Also , because the federation account allocation is more of an unearned rent , it is spent as freebies and this is one of the impetuses of corruption . Every state , including the Federal Government , should strive for financial autonomy and self sufficiency . The federal allocation should not be used for paying salaries and running government . It should be tied to specific development projects . Mr Chairman , distinguished guests , governance is not a mystery . There is a science and art to it and it can be mastered and we should begin to demystify it by rejecting the notion that we can only have good and qualitative governance in the next millennium . We can have it now and we should demand for it . We have heard of the successes of the Asian Tigers and the newly industrialised countries of South America . We do n't have to reinvent the wheel . There is never a time when there will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that it periodically provides opportunity for us to kick out a government that offers excuses all the time and blames others for its failure . If we can take the science of governance and public administration , we can follow the path they took and have even more resounding success . It has become a clich ? that we need quality leadership . I am afraid that this is a necessary but not a sufficient condition . The corollary of it is that we also need good followership -- a followership that consciously put the right leadership in place ; that will make extraordinary demands from the leaders ; and will hold leadership to account . It is the combination of the two factors of good leadership and quality followership that will bring about the transformation that we so desire . I am therefore confident that given our trajectory as a nation and the progress we have made since 1999 , we are going to arrive at the long desired destination . Of course , democracy anywhere is an unfinished business . Let me once more thank the Board @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lecture and to be in the company of these decent people .

@@1867234 <h> Buoyant transfer system simplifies LNG distribution <p> Norwegian researchers have developed a new , fully mobile solution for offloading natural gas from ships to land . The new buoyant transfer system simplifies LNG distribution , which may lead to increased distribution to new global markets . <h> Simpler LNG terminals <p> Managing Director of Connect LNG , Morten Christophersen , explains : " Currently , a port requires specially constructed facilities for offloading LNG from carriers . We are developing an alternative solution for transferring the gas from ships to onshore bunkers that makes it possible to utilise simpler LNG terminals . This would help to increase distribution and use of natural gas , in more sparsely populated corners of the world as well . " <p> " The core of our system is a buoy loading system that is used to connect a flexible transfer line between ship and land . The LNG is transferred through this line , " Christophersen added . <p> A small-scale LNG carrier featuring prismatic tanks designed and developed by LNG New Technologies . <h> Universal Buoyancy System <p> The solution has been named the Universal Buoyancy System .

In 2015 the company will launch full-scale testing . <h> Small scale LNG <p> " The only good way to transport natural gas locally is to use small ships or lorries , known as small-scale LNG .

The US shale gas boom also changed the market when the US quickly became an exporter rather than importer of natural gas . <h> Conclusion <p> In conclusion , Christophersen commented : " Even though natural gas prices have generally been relatively stable and low around the world , we have seen major and sudden geographic changes in demand . This is a disincentive to investment and slows down the growth in LNG terminals .

Where are the security challenges coming from ? Where and how ? What are the courses of this rancour ? Governance in Nigeria is structured in a way that it only accommodates the interest of the elites . When you come to Abuja , all the structure are for the elites , if you visit any state government of the 36 states of the federation , it is the arrangement of the elites ; where the larger population of Nigerians resides is the villages and hamlets . What a typical village man considers a leader is his own councillor , chairman or traditional ruler within his domain . Unfortunately because of the encroachment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be constitutional preserved area of local government , it has made it very impossible for people at the grassroots level to have the feelings or touch of government or to even understand the kind of democracy that we are practicing . <p> So you are advocating for a system that will ensure that state governors are stopped from having absolute control over local governments ? <p> Yes ! We have a system of local government where a governor of the state decides when to have election into the local government or when not to have election and even where some of the states decided to have election into the local government , you will find out that all the seats of the councillors , no matter the number of the wards , the number of the local governments , they must come from the governor 's party . This is very unhealthy and undemocratic and should be unacceptable by all Nigerians . And for you to have inclusiveness in governing this country you must guarantee the democracy of all the local governments in Nigeria , you must not create any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ responsibility of the citizenry of this country . It is unfortunate if you go round especially in the northern part of this country , you will realise that majority of the governors do not allow elections in the local governments and that is why the rancour , the insecurity and the absence of governance in all nooks and crannies of this country because the governors of the region hijack the entire system of the local government for their own political selfishness .

It was also learnt that there was no correspondence from the corporation to explain its absence . <p> The committee is demanding detailed record of volumes and sales of all crude oil and products ; detailed record of the volumes of crude oil received as part of the crude swap arrangement by local refineries including the quantity used locally and quantity swapped ; details of kerosene importation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well as details of the number and management of aircraft in the corporation 's fleet - both chartered and purchased . <p> Other demands are details of funds expended on aircraft purchases , hiring and maintenance in the last two years ; contract papers on the lease or purchase of aircraft ; issues surrounding the Turn Around Maintenance and or rehabilitation of refineries and supply and distribution of petroleum products and ancillary issues . <p> On April 4 , the committee addressed a letter , signed by the Committee Clerk , Mr. Anthony Ikem , to the Group Managing Director of NNPC , Mr. Andrew Yakubu , reminding him of the demands it made since October 2013 . <p> The letter read : " I am directed to refer you to the committee 's several letters of invitation to meet with the committee and requests to furnish the committee with information relating to the activities of your corporation since October 2013 . <p> " I am to draw your attention to the fact that the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria , 1999 , as amended , statutorily empowers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extension , its Committee on Petroleum Resources ( Downstream ) to oversight the activities of the NNPC and its subsidiary refinery companies . <p> " I am to further express the committee 's dissatisfaction with the conduct of the management of the NNPC , especially its seeming disrespect and disregard of the committee 's invitations and requests for information and data relating to the activities of the corporation and its refinery companies . <p> " Also , in view of the inability and or unpreparedness of your officials to adequately respond to questions at the committee 's meeting of Tuesday and Wednesday , first and second April , 2014 , the committee resolved to further invite the Group Managing Director ( PPMC ) , the Group Executive Director ( R&amp;P ) and the Managing Directors of all the nation 's refineries to a meeting on Tuesday , April 8 .

@@1870237 <h> Edo North 2015 : Aspirants and their chances <p> Even though the Independent National Electoral Commission ( INEC ) says it has not yet lifted the lid placed on campaigns for next year 's general elections , it is normal practice in politics for aspirants to commence sensitisation and mobilisation well ahead in the hope of gaining advantage in influence over the electorate . <p> This is why we have been inundated with campaigns disguised as town hall and village square meetings as well as visitations by political contenders who wish and pray that we , the people , consider them to represent us , not only at the National Assembly , but also at the Edo State House of Assembly . This piece will , therefore , seek to examine the chances of those who are presently running around us in Edo North Senatorial District begging to be allowed to ' ' serve ' ' our interest in Abuja . Since all of them can not achieve their aim at the same time , it is imperative that we separate the chaff from the seed so , they know their chances just before we go for the primaries . <p> Senator Domingo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was elected in 2011 on the platform of the Action Congress of Nigeria ( ACN ) now All Progressives Congress ( APC ) . He holds the record of being the first senator from the Akoko-Edo leg of the tripod arrangement that is Edo North . The other two legs are Etsako and Owan . Three years on , Senator Obende is in the field campaigning for a return to the Senate for a second term of four years armed with a score card which , as can be expected , speaks glowingly of his achievements . These , he says , include the attraction of projects such as hand pump boreholes , sponsoring of Christians and Muslims on pilgrimage to Jerusalem and Mecca respectively and organising skill acquisition training for some constituents . In particular , Senator Domingo beats his chest as being the sponsor of the bill , now an Act , which criminalised same sex marriage in Nigeria as his major contribution to the development and wellbeing of Edo North and its people . <p> It is , however , curious that the people may not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a meeting of Akoko-Edo political leaders and stakeholders he called at his residence recently . The people of his local government , Akoko-Edo , claimed the senator is inaccessible and are , therefore unwilling to support him for second term . While some agree Senator Obende has attracted some projects to the district , they also quickly point out that more than 60 per cent of those projects were sited in his area to the disappointment of the five other local government areas which make up the senatorial district . <p> Stakeholders in Edo North politics have pooh-poohed the argument of the Obende group that the Owan ( East and West ) and Etsako ( Central , East and West ) axis have at been elected to the Senate , describing it as pedestrian and inapplicable in a situation such as this where a clear squandering of goodwill has become evident . The Etsakos have produced senators in the past with Senator Kassim Oyofo , serving two terms from 1999 to 2007 , while the Owans had Senator Yisa Braimoh who served just a term from 2007 to 2011 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Obende across the six local government areas of the district reveals a very poor support base in Akoko-Edo and waning in the other five local government areas . Senator Obende has been tested , but may have not passed the test . <p> Abubakar Momoh : <p> Abubakar Momoh , an engineer , is presently in the House of Representatives on for Etsako made up of Etsako Central , Etsako East and Etsako West . The story of Momoh is very well known to stakeholders in Edo North and are , therefore , not surprised that he is seeking promotion from the House of Representatives to the Senate . His political profile has risen steadily from being a Supervisory Councillor to Councillor and then Chairman of his local government , Etsako East . Thereafter , he served two terms of eight years at the state House of Assembly and then proceeded to the National Assembly as member of the House of Representatives in 2003 . He returned to the House of Representatives in 2011 for a second term . Stakeholders are united that what Momoh has had going for him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out that his performance at the National Assembly may have fallen short of expectations . <p> Stakeholders , including top party leaders in his Etsako East , have condemned any attempt to play ethnic agenda which they say wo n't work . Critics accused the lawmaker of putting up a few school blocks which they said have either been built or renovated in the last three years by Momoh in the three local government areas he represents . He , too , has been tested . But has he passed the test ? <p> Francis Alimhikhena : <p> A retired Army officer and lawyer , Francis Alimhikhena is in the race for the Edo North senatorial seat for the third time having contested primaries for the position under the Peoples Democratic Party ( PDP ) in the past . This time , as in the past , Francis Alimhikhena is bringing to the race his wealth of experience gathered over the years while holding command and leadership positions in the military . He has built political structures which he can rely on even now that he is in All Progressives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ credited with control of a greater part of Etsako East but no more . In terms of testing a new hand on the job , Alimhikhena may enjoy the sympathy of some critical stakeholders . <p> Julius Ihonvbere : <p> An economist and political scientist , Prof. Julius Ihonvbere is the Secretary to the Government of Edo State ( SSG ) . He was also the Special Adviser , Project Monitoring and Evaluation to President Olusegun Obasanjo from 2003 to 2007 when he developed a wide network of contacts locally and internationally . An accomplished and erudite scholar , Ihonvbere was a student union leader and has remained a life member of the student union government ( SUG ) , teacher and researcher , human rights and pro-democracy activist . All of these are breeding grounds for leadership which the Prof. is known for . <p> The professor changed platform in 2012 after he was short-changed by the PDP in his quest for the governorship ticket of the party . He was indeed the frontrunner in the race for the ticket . Coming over to the APC , Prof. Ihonvbere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the party . His ability to communicate , integrity , accessibility , selfless disposition and political ability have become assets not only for the prosecution of his ambition but also to the party . <p> Prof. Ihonvbere , through his Julius Ihonvbere Foundation , has given a helping hand to the needy in Edo North . Several youths and women have benefitted by way of education and empowerment . Stakeholders say Ihonvbere is a tested and trusted politician who is prepared for the task of adequately representing the senatorial district . This is why he has secured the full support of at least four local government areas in his bid to secure the senatorial ticket . Already fully in the bag are Akoko-Edo , Owan East and Owan West . He can also boast of at least fifty percent support in Etsako Central , East and West . His credentials place him above all other aspirants to the senatorial seat .

@@1872232 <h> " She Asked For It " : A Case For The Rapist <p> We all know that rape incidents have increased massively in Nigeria . And we also know that when it comes to reported cases , we 're talking only about a little fraction . A lot of these horrific incidents go unreported because many sufferers are afraid to speak out . Most of them get blamed and sometimes do n't even get justice . Therefore , it is safe to say but rather uneasily , that Nigeria is beginning to adopt a nasty rape culture . There are a lot of factors responsible for this but I 'm mainly going to be focusing on the victims and the potential victims today . <p> I hate rape and hate rapists even more . I 'm one of those people who believe that convicted rapists should get a life sentence ; such people should not be allowed to live freely again . That is how strongly I feel about them . <p> I also believe that it does n't matter what a woman does , a man should at all times be able to control his urges . If he can not , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so that the world would be free of one more criminal . Forcing a woman to have sex is evil . Period ! I understand that there is a silent fascination over rape these days , particularly amongst young guys . It is utterly disgusting and horrifically terrifying ! Pardon my emphasis , but if the world of young people like you and I begin to share a general liking to rape , then we are in deep trouble . I am also appalled at the way our society reacts to rape incidents . Victims are afraid to speak out and when they do , they are treated unfairly and most often than not , left to suffer the psychological trauma all their life . <p> But today , I 'd like to go a little further and look at it from a different angle . Very often , advocates against rape and sexual abuse put all the blame on the rapist and I feel that when it comes to the law and prosecution of such maggots , it should rightly be so . No victim should be blamed for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at it from one angle . <p> Now , let 's take it from the eyes of the potential victim . Mind you , every female and male is a potential victim of rape but I will be concentrating on the females based on the statistics of reported rape cases , being mostly females . Feel free to apply this discussion to the males . <p> There is a thin line between potential victim and actual victim but some people have learned to stretch that line into a big chasm and rape will not be part of their history as long as they can help it . Cases exist , naturally , that the victim could n't do anything to help themselves ; they did not see the attack coming . Incidences where a woman is raped by a trusted male like a husband , a brother , a father , a cousin , a friend , a colleague , an uncle , a pastor , a doctor and a policeman . Other instances occur during armed robberies , abductions and being in the wrong place at the wrong time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that there was nothing they could have done to stop themselves from being raped . In most situations , that is the truth . And it is very wrong to make someone going through hell feel bad over someone else 's crime against them . <p> But are we going to state that some rape cases could n't have been avoided by the victims ? And that being in the wrong place at the wrong time intentionally was n't the reason why they got raped ? Or that dressing indecently and provocatively was the best thing to have done at that time and in a place where they were not secure ? <p> When I was fifteen , my mom , like some mothers , told me that every man was a potential rapist and in my head , I added that it means then , that every woman was a potential victim . That sure left a mark on me . I did n't go around looking at men as rapists but to some extent I was alert , knowing that just around the corner or in the arms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> But how many girls today have that mindset ? <p> We must first understand that the minds of most rapists have been distorted and that it does n't matter if a female was covered from head to toe , they would still do what they set their hearts to . They get joy from seeing people in pain and would , most times , plan ahead of time . Also there is the other category of rapists that would claim they were pushed to the wall like in the case where a girl teases a guy sexually on a regular basis and refuses him to go all the way . These types of rapists usually get remorseful after they commit that one act while some of them go on to become serial rapists . But whatever the classification , are we saying that there is no way either of the circumstances could be avoided ? <p> This is always a sensitive topic to handle and I have watched as people , especially on social media get crucified when they try to look at it from a different angle . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accept it or not , some rape cases can be avoided . How often have I seen girls jump at the first sound of the word ' party ' without knowing who is organizing it , what type of people are in attendance or what sort of drinks are going to be served there . In other occasions , I see females get lifts from men they have never met before , totally trusting that those men would be gentlemanly enough to take them to their destinations . How about those that walk about dangerous streets , either night or day , scantily clad ? What of the ones that visit the homes of guys they know little of ? Another occasion , as mentioned above , is when a female keeps teasing a guy sexually and yet keeps telling him she is not ready for sex . And let 's not forget cases where females hook up with total strangers online to meet at some private place where no one else knows about . Then lastly , the old time classic -- the one night stands . <p> Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occurs , do we blame the rapists alone ? <p> A good number of advocates against rape do not feel there is any need to drum on the importance of a girl planning to protect herself from any type of rape . They pretend as if all the time , these things just happen without a sign . But if we look at some of the cases we read on the net today , we 'll see a pattern , growing where females are being really careless . A good example is the Obesere case and another of a woman who met some guys on Baddoo , just to mention a few . <p> Advocates against rape keep saying that no matter how a woman dresses , it is no excuse for a man to rape her . That statement is very right but it is half-done . Now , let 's flip it . Would these same advocates say , " since dressing is not a precedent to rape , all females would be free dressing indecently on the streets " ? I doubt that they would speak that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truth . I have witnessed with my two eyes were a girl was sexually harassed in a marketplace because of what she wore . I do n't want to imagine what would have happened to her if it was dark . But she was n't the only female there . I was present and so were other ladies . Why were n't we harassed ? <p> To help understand this better , a person does not rely on the law alone to safeguard his valuables ; he protects them himself and keeps them away from thieves . Even in safe places of worship , you would not see that person display his money in a transparent polythene bag for all to see . Now , if thieves do n't see that money , they wo n't desire to steal it . Although they may desire to steal something , that money may not be an option on their list . Same way in some rape cases ; if the rapists do n't spot a potential victim , they wo n't rape . This may come off as a weak argument @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simple : do not give a criminal reason to commit his crimes . <p> I believe it is time for these advocates to add a ' prevent rape ' to their campaigns because ' stop rape ' is not enough to end the menace . And for the rest of us who would n't listen to any other argument on the issue , it 's time we clear the cobwebs in our ears and see that everything in this life comes with a manual and there is a manual to help prevent rape . The world is a dangerous place these days and I can not overemphasize the need for us to be alert . We should be aware of the defensive measures one can follow to stop an on-going rape incident . But before this there are certain actions these predators reveal and a sensitization of the mind is needed for every woman to understand the signs and unspoken language of a potential rapist . When a woman trains herself to know these traits , she will always spot them out . There are likewise red flags to watch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begins to want more than friendship and goes about it aggressively . Furthermore , there are things females should not even do or encourage at all . If a lady knows she will not sleep with a man , why allow him spend his money on her and visit his home regularly and yet expect him to be a monk when it comes to her body ? The mindless pursuit of money has led so many girls into the wrong hands and even to their deaths . Foolishness always attracts danger and a loose woman will eventually find her doom . If all advocates against rape would start teaching these things , I think these horrific incidences will reduce considerably . <p> No one wants to be a victim , to have to suffer deep inside knowing they could have prevented their attack but they did n't . No one wants to live in guilt , hearing people say ' it 's not your fault ' but knowing deep inside that they are partly to blame ; that they could have taken measures to guard themselves but ignored them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a stranger , why entrust her body in his hands ? <p> Can our anti-rape advocates start teaching these things ? I commend their efforts but more needs to be done . Telling the government to make stricter laws can only go so far . Concentrating only on the rapists and potential rapists is not enough . What is the message we have for people who have n't yet crossed the line to become victims ? What can be done to make sure they stay behind that line and stretch it so far that it becomes a gulf that any rapist would find hard to go over ? <p> My last line here is this simple question : if the rapist plans in his mind what he would do when he gets hold of his victim , should n't that potential victim also have a plan as to what to do never cross to his path ? <p> As usual , I 'd like to hear your opinion on this issue . Are there cases like the one Basketmouth got into trouble for , that the victim can also be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the rapist ? Or do you have a different view entirely ? <p> Sally is the author of the Fish Brain series and Boys With Toys . She has written other online series like The Immortals ' Code , No heart Feelings , Novocaine Knights , To Tame a Virgin and In Pursuit of Kyenpia . She lives in Lagos with her husband and kids and loves the occasional bar lounging with friends . She blogs on www.moskedapages.com or you can follow her on Twitter @NovocainKnights <p> Sally , you are on point with your write up . My opinion is that rape is not justified for any reason . I think one major issue is the society in which we live in where rape is not taken as seriously as it should and the victims are more or less made to feel worse if they report it . This can never happen in the US , where rape is a very serious offence . On the other hand however , like you rightly said , it can be avoided by minding the places you go to , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out with . At the end , even if the criminal is given the maximum punishment you still live with the pain of it . Growing up I was very cautious to the extent that I had a very boring life . My belief was and still is better safe than sorry and that 's my advice to young ladies out there . <p> I have one question for the writer . How many rape victims have you met ? The TRUTH is 95% of victims that get raped are raped by people they knew before the incident . How would it occur to you that that male or female relative you grew up with would do such ? Or that your sister 's husband you 've known for 7 years would do that ? Please when we decide to come up with such write ups , get statistics and then draw conclusion from there . I did n't even finish reading the write up because I would have been more upset . Is it the 5% of victims from strangers they should be advocating for or the 95% of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not that they should n't talk about the 5% and teach girls and boys alike what to do , but that 's the not basis of most rape cases . Its easy for people to say , you can prevent it , but trust me , when its done by a relative you did n't see coming , how do you prevent it ? Its this mentality that 's why rape victims do n't report cases . When people can say it can be prevented , you could have faught , done something . So fellow humans , let 's not justify why people get raped please . <p> My dear , just like you would want the writer to do justice to a post when writing , you should also do justice as a reader . You should have read it first and then picked out the points , as I balanced them and understood where i was coming from . 1 . I stated the cases of victims being raped by close relatives and did justice to that issue . 2 . Unless you 're not a Nigerian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have noticed a sickening trend of females being careless with their social lives as regards to strangers and paying the ultimate price for it . Some , even unto death . The statistics is out there on the tabloids. 3 . Yes , rape can be avoided and prevented especially in the hands of strangers . It never kills anyone to be smarter , wiser or protect themselves from harm . 4 . I stated , if you had read , that you do not tell the victim it is their fault . 5 . Of course I did my research before writing . 6 . I have had a personal experience with sexual abuse so I speak from an angle I have knowledge of and this sounds as an advice to other females out there . <p> Hi Mene , No doubt when people close commit such acts it is heinous more so when they were supposed to be protectors and there is almost nothing you could have done to prevent such . If you had read the article well , Sally has acknowledged that as well stating that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no way it could have been prevented ' . There is no place where she stated any statistics of the most likely perpetrators , if anything she acknowledged a large percentage of rape is carried out by trusted people.What she is more focused on are the few cases where it COULD have been avoided such as going to an unknown party , accepting a ride from a stranger , going to a male friends house alone , and other such instances . For instance the case of a lady about two years ago who met friends on facebook , was lured to Lagos by them and was raped and killed by them . While people blamed her stating she was a prostitute and deserved what she got , more level headed people felt while it COULD have been prevented by her being more careful with meeting strangers on the net , it is no excuse for her to be cold-bloodedly raped and murdered . Same with another lady from a University in Enugu or Anambra that was raped by four guys , the incident recorded and shown online . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did to them , why did she follow them ... ' etc . That is what Sally is focusing on more when she states there are SOME cases where rape could have been avoided but it is still no excuse for rape .

It is also a day where workers express their views on the various policies of government and employers and how it has affected their lives and general well being . <p> The year 's May Day came at a time when the socio-economic development of the nation is been threatened by infrastructural decay , insecurity and wanton destruction of lives and properties . <p> This , observers in the labour industry blamed on wealth distribution system in the country , corruption and bad leadership . <p> According to them , while the Nigerian economy is said to be growing at an impressive rate of over 7 percent in the last one decade , and the recent rebasing of the nation 's Gross Domestic Product ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Africa , the country 's social statistics has remained very grim . <p> To stakeholders in the labour industry , Nigerian poverty profile remains one of the highest in the world at over 69 percent percent according to the NBS , higher than the 54 per cent recorded in 2004 . <p> Income inequality , consequent on the humongous , almost institutionalised corruption in the country is said to becoming one of the highest in the world . <p> This terrible situation , they observed is compounded by increasing spates of insecurity , kidnappings , unprovoked killings and wanton waste of human life and property especially , by a shadowy organization with an undefined mission , called Boko Haram . <p> " Given the parlous state of infrastructures , the shrinking environment of opportunities for most people especially young people , the frightening gap between the rich and the poor , the absence of social protection for over 80 percent of Nigerians and the daily exposure of grand corruption while state law enforcement institutions seem incapable of dealing with the problem , it should not be a surprise though very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terrorism directed against the Nigerian state and people , are escalating , " spokesman of the Federation of Informal Workers of Nigeria ( FIWON ) , Gbenga Komolafe lamented . <p> The theme of this year 's May Day " Building Enduring Peace and Unity : Panacea for Sustainable National Development " is therefore apt in view of the security challenges that have continued to threaten peace and unity of the nation 's economy . <p> Moreso , labour leaders believe that the occasion of the May Day provides a unique opportunity for reflections , meditation , stock-taking and forging new resolutions . <p> They explained that the relationship between peace and sustainable national development is two way stressing that there can not be any sustainable national development without peace ; and ' peace ' without sustainable national development is a time bomb ticking to explode . <p> They equally stressed the need for every Nigerians to rise in union to confront the various challenges facing the nation 's socio-economic development which can only be achieved through an atmosphere of tolerance , peace and love . <p> They argued that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to change the operations and mandates of existing political , social , security , cultural and development institutions and mind sets . <p> They expressed hope that the on-going National Conference will engender genuine dialogue that will usher in a new Nigeria . <p> Insecurity There is a growing concern not only from the labour movement but from the entire citizens on the security situations in the country particularly at this critical period of economic transformation . <p> The insurgence of terrorism and kidnappings has led to wanton destruction of lives and properties across the country . <p> The continuous and seemingly unchecked bombings constitute grave danger to the unity and development of the country . The numerous attacks by the Boko Haram on public and private institutions , places of worship amongst others had resulted in wanton loss of lives and properties . <p> The failure by government to address the challenges of insecurity in the country has continued to threaten meaningful development and hinder foreign investment- a situation that is adversely affecting wellbeing of the Nigerian workers . <p> It is against this background that the labour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ May Day to draw attention to government and leaders that peace , not just in the form of absence of ' war ' , but as an atmosphere of tolerance , harmonious co-existence and social justice is necessary for sustainable national development . <p> In his speech , Preisident of the Nigeria Labour Congress ( NLC ) , Abdulwaheed Omar observed that the nation has witnessed unprecedented security challenges that have adversely affected its economic development and threatened the peace and security of the nation . <p> Omar , who expressed concern over the state of the nation 's security infrastructure , lamented that despite the huge security votes in the past few years , the security system has remained weak and inadequate . <p> He listed conflicting political interests , ambiguous operational order and primordial sentiments as some of the factors undermining the counter terror war in the country . The NLC president appealed to government confront the root causes of violence stressing the need for leaders to as a matter of necessity and urgency deal with issues of functional education , unemployment and poverty . <p> " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a serious situation on our hands . The war on terror does not seem to be going on well at the moment . Our security forces despite gallant efforts have suffered reversals , taking direct hits in their critical asset areas , raising concerns about their capacity or willingness to win this war . We are not unaware of the complexities of a war of this nature , but we demand better initiative and more commitment . <p> " In spite of government 's effort , the situation , particularly in the North East , is deteriorating . The initial gains of emergency rule , clearly have been lost and the momentum squandered . <p> The Boko Haram elements have matured into a full-blown terror group striking at high-profile targets with devastating effect , " Omar said . <p> Speaking also , President of Trade Union Congress of Nigeria ( TUC ) , Bobboi Kaigama decried what he described as the near-breakdown of security and the recent spate of killings and destruction of property in the North-East and some other parts of the country . <p> According to him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opportunity to let the president know that indeed this is not the best of times in our dear country . He warned that the likely consequences of disintegration would simply be too great " if we renege on our duty to continue to pursue the actualisation of these basic ideals and oppose the anti-people and neo-liberalism policies . " <p> " I can assure you that the challenges we face today are real , grave and many . They will not be met easily or in a short span of time with the lackadaisical attitude put up by " ogas at the top " . Our nation is endowed with enormous natural resources yet gropes in the darkness of poverty ; But know this , fellow Nigerians , that our dream and aspiration for our country will be met because we have chosen hope over fear , peace and unity of purpose over conflict and discord , " he said . <p> In his May Day speech , Chairman , TUC , Rivers State Council , Mr. Chika Onuegbu said it was important for government to address the violence , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ becoming a way of life . <p> He appealed to government at all levels to go beyond the issuance of condolence messages each time there is violent attacks and genuinely put an end to the incessant attacks on innocent Nigerians . <p> Speaking further , Onuegbu lamented that the general insecurity has seriously increased the cost of doing business in Nigeria , diverted investments from Nigeria and negatively impacted on the already bad unemployment and poverty situation . <p> He warned that the violent conflicts and senseless killings will continue to deny the country of the highly needed foreign direct investments and developments adding that it will also worsen the original conditions that led to their emergence . <p> " We are however disappointed at the politicisation of these killings and insecurity by the political class . We believe that the situation in Nigeria requires the active collaboration of all Nigerians irrespective of religious , political and ideological inclination . <p> However the Federal Government must lead the way and show strength and unwavering determination to end these senseless and mindless attacks before it degenerates into full-scale war . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must remember that the main reason why government exist is , first and foremost , for the security of lives and property .

How was it possible , less than two months after , for 300 girls of the Government Girls Secondary School , Chibok , to be abducted from their beds and their school razed to the ground , and for them , save the lucky few who escaped , to remain in captivity 20 days after ? How did we get to the point of assassinating individuals ; bombing buildings , churches , mosques and motor parks ; burning down whole towns and villages while looting and raping , yet doing so in the name of God ? <p> The answer , to borrow a refrain from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wind . " It is also to be found in a little but trenchant book written 27 years ago by the late DrYusufuBala Usman : the manipulation of religion in Nigeria . His focus was the decade of 1977-87 , spanning the bitter Shari'a law debates at the Constituent Assembly and the first Maitatsine riots but his observations are as valid today . <p> Our power elite , he found , use false piety as a cover for morbid self-interest , a cheap means of gaining political leverage over opponents in the fierce struggle for power . As he put it , they do so to " cover themselves with religious and ethnic disguises in order to further entrench division among our people ( and ) slow down their awakening at any cost . " <p> Because thereligious manipulator can not afford to " appear as what he really is in the political economy of Nigeria , " he must " find a cover . He can not claim political leadership openly on the grounds that he is , or wants to be , an exporter-importer , a contractor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cover as a Muslim or Christian . " <p> And once false piety has been turned into a political tool , the public space ceases to be the arena of persuasion , of civilised discourse . <p> Colonialism offers us the prime example : the coloniser had to impose his god as the only God so he could gain undue political advantage by first conquering the heart and mind of the colonised . Which then extends the political battle to the cultural terrain , making a retreat to sanity very difficult . <p> The one safeguard is the separation of state ( politics ) and religion , as in Section 10 of the 1999 constitution , its countless faults notwithstanding . But our so-called leaders destroy its true intent and meaning by a noisome display of sanctimoniousness while giving dailyproof of their dubiousness through the yawning gulf between their words and their actions . <p> They steal , and lie , and rig elections , and pervert justice , and indulge in all manner of debauchery without remorse . Why , a governor even went as far as claiming that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once we have made God in our image , turned him into an election-rigger , treasury-looter , murderer , arsonist , rapist , etc. , we give a licence forany fraudster to proclaim himself God 's anointed prophet or avenging angel . Ironically enough , thiscan even servea perversely plausible cause-democratising the religio-political playing field ! <p> Take for instance the recent news report about aSatanist group in the United States getting ready to install on the lawn of the Oklahoma State Capitola bronze statue of Baphomet being adored by two exultant children . Theywant it " directly next to a highly controversial monument of the ten commandments that was donated by a state legislator and subsequently placed on the grounds of the Capitol . " <p> According to their spokesman , one Lucian Greaves , the statue is meant as a symbol to " celebrate our progress as a pluralistic nation founded on secular law . " But his group , he says , would not " petition to have the statue installed should the ten commandments monument be removed , " adding that there is no " shortage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a contrasting voice . " ( See " Satanic group reveals crowdfunded monument for Oklahoma State Capitol , The Verge , 3 May 2014 , http : **105;163;TOOLONG ) . <p> Evidently , this is a protest action , whatever the actual belief of the group might be . Still , it points to the slippery slope of religious anarchy that non-strict adherence to secularity in a plural society presents . That is how we got to our current troubling state of pre-Armageddon . We must beat a quick retreat to the fortress of sanity : secularity in word and deed . <p> And so I propose to the 492 wise men and women at Jonathan 's National Conference who will save Nigeria the addition of a subsection to Section 10 so the whole reads as follows : ( 1 ) " The Government of the Federation or of a State shall not adopt any religion as State Religion .

What is to be done ? Should it maintain an armed unit ? Should a National Guard emerge from the Armed Unit ? Should be under the Ministry of Interior ( under the federal government or national government ? ) <p> Federal Road Safety Corps ( FRSC ) : It is to regulate , enforce and coordinate all road traffic and safety management activities through : sustained public enlightenment ; effective patrol operations ; improved motor vehicle administration and stakeholder 's cooperation .

The ONSA should facilitate the introduction of more modern methods to replace current road blocks . <p> Agitations through insurgency in whatever guise should never be rewarded in the Federal Republic of Nigeria by any level of government . While victims of insurgencies could be adequately compensated , the perpetrators should be sufficiently punished . Amnesty as a mechanism for appeasing insurgents or militancy should be stopped henceforth .

Continuous feedback on the degree of success of on ? going COIN efforts is also critical . At the tactical level , understanding is required of the identity of active insurgents , their networks , logistics , capabilities and intent . <p> A special border patrol outfit ( with similar role as coast guards ) may be formed ; a combined operation of military , immigration and customs may be trained to start operations immediately to curtail the influx of dangerous weapons and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ northern states .

Traditional rulers should be accorded specific responsibilities with commensurate delegated authority for security management , among other things , in their domains . <p> Intelligencegathering <p> The traditional and religious institutions should be integrated into the security system , particularly in the business of intelligence gathering .

Federal Government should contribute more significantly to the maintenance and equipping of the security agencies in the north so that state government funds , which are meant for infrastructural , social and human capital development in the states , are used solely for that purpose <p> Social and humancapital <p> .

Nigeria , especially the northern states need a leadership that is nationally accepted regardless of ethnicity , region , religion , and where he/she comes from . Nigeria needs a leader that could promote good governance , forge national integration through deliberate and articulated policies . <p> Government should ensure that each State should define its own cattle grazing routes which will then be harmonized with those of adjacent states . Governments should secure existing grazing reserves and also consider cattle ranches with a view to making the herdsmen less nomadic . State governments with capacity and who have need should create new grazing reserves and cattle ranches . The FGN should come up with a long term research-driven framework of settling nomadic Fulani pastoralists and changing the methods of raising their livestock . <p> In order to stem the tide of threats to national security , Nigeria must take the challenge of youth unemployment seriously by generating employment and creating multiple access @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a fixed or reserved fund for youth empowerment activities on a larger scale . <p> States creation and geo-political zones : While one can not doubt the contributions which the creation of states have done to the Nigerian project , it is also true that twoo many states have tended to convert them into mere cost or effort centres at the expense of socio economic development . It is against this backdrop that ACF believes that the creation of any additional states at this point in time is counter productive and , therefore , should be kept on hold until the need can be justified in future . The argument that creation of states should be on the basis of equality irrespective of population and land mass is inconsistent with elementary concept of justice , since injustice is jot only when equals are treated unequally but also when unequals are treated equally . <p> Factual data on States : On the basis of population and landmass , the 36 states structure of Nigeria brings up the following fact : Population Average Per State = 140,003,542 = 3,888,987 <p> 36 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 36 <p> How the geo-political zones stand : The South East has a population of 16,381,729 and total Land mass of 33,664km2 . Meaning each of the five states on average has a population and land mass 3,276,345 and 6733km2 respectively . <p> Population Average per State in the South East is far less than the national average of 612,642 people and , indeed the average Landmass per state in the South East is not up to 25 per cent of the National Average . That is to say the total land mass of all states of the South East is just a little above the National Average per State . <p> On the Contrary , the North West has seven States , a population of 35,786,944 and landmass of 221,120km2 . Average population per state in the Northwest = 5,112,421 which is 1,223,434 higher than National Average . Average landmass pe state in the Northwest =31,589km2 meaning each state in the Northwest is almost equal to the entire landmass of the South eastern states landmass . <p> For the Southwest : Six states with population of 27,581,994 , averaging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ average . By land mass , the South west has 78,774 , which is 13,129km2 or twice the South east average . <p> Implication of factual data : For additional state to be created in the South east , the South west must have up to nine states first , if population is the deciding factor . Also if land mass is the deciding factor , South west must have as much as 12 states before any additional state is created in South east . <p> Geo-political zones as so-called federating units : This proposition , which formed the cardinal position of the South East since the 1994 constitutional conference , has been crafted to whittle down any political advantage the North could exercise in Nigeria 's body politics despite its huge territorial size and large population . Yet the concept of geo-political zones in our constitution and it should remain so . <p> Federalism , fiscal federalism and revenue sharing <p> Federalism : Prepositions being made in the name of operating " true federalism " , " fiscal federalism " and the like , are borne either out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the case , now , the Northern delegates to the conference have a duty to expose this crude misunderstanding of the political history of Nigerian federalism , and therefore , they need to be well armed with knowledgeable position to counteract the flow of political mischief and propaganda directed against the North . <p> It should be clear to all that the Nigerian federal system was not a classical example of a federating system such as the case of the United States of American where hitherto independent sovereign states decided to come together to form a united country . Rather , in the case of Nigeria , the 36 states are merely political ' provinces ' as recommended by Selborne Report of 1896 which were later created by the Nigerian State at different historical times , and agitations for additional States are still ongoing . <p> Therefore , the 36 states of the Nigerian federal system are and have always been mere administrative units and not federating units as erroneously called by people who wish to re-write history . In other words , the 36 states do not have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state . Any attempt by a part of the Nigerian federation to enforce the notion of states as federating unit is disingenious and is certainly unconstitutional and the rest of the country should ignore or fight it to its logical end . <p> Change ofnomenclature <p> Indeed , we suggest that Northern delegates should pursue a change of nomenclature of the second tier of government from ' State ' to ' Province ' so as to unambiguously avoid the misconceptions that the states are ' Sovereign ' entitities . <p> Fiscal federalism : Regrettably , fiscal federalism is one of the most bastardised terminologies in Nigerian public discourse today , to the extend that its mention by many -- including those in authority -- is taken to mean ' a universally acclaimed structure of resource control and revenue sharing manual . ' To many others , these terms are ( politically ) synonymous with " true federalism " -whatever this means . What , really is the meaning of fiscal federalism ? Fiscal federalism is a theory originally propounded by Richard A Musgrave ad Wallace E. Oates that concern itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ multiple layers of governments . <p> The theory aims at Improving the performance of the public sectors and the provision of their services by ensuring a proper alignment of responsibilities and fiscal instruments to carry out these responsibilities for economic efficiency and welfare maximization . The theory itself lays out a general normative framework , and its precepts only provided general guidelines with no firm principles . <p> Generally , the theory of fiscal federalism was developed on the historical experiences of nations that emerged or unified by the coming together of independent territories to form larger political polities , such as the cases of Switzerland , Germany , Canada , or the United States of America . In its classical theory , thus , central government of such a federal system is a creation of the regional provincial governments . But even among nations founded on such classical structure of federal system there is no universal structure of operating fiscal federalism . <p> At any rate , there are no two federal systems that are exactly the same . Rather , federal systems evolved and operate within the context @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A number of the countries operating federal system are non-classical federations , which adopted the system as an appropriate mechanism to manage political and cultural plurality . It is now being estimated that there are more than 25 countries , with 40 per cent of the world 's population practicing federal systems of government . There are also countries , such as Iraq , that are now regarded as on transition to federalism . <p> There is no universal definition of federalism or essential principles but there are key features of federalism , which are the existence of a central government sharing power/functions with **50;96;TOOLONG governments over the same citizens and each tier of government derives its own legitimacy from citizens under its jurisdiction . <p> As a result , therefore , scholars categorize different modes of federalism , from co-operate federalism to co-ordinate feieralism to organic federalism as a means to distinguish the variety of systems being practiced by different nations . Thus , federalism in reality is a continuum running from alliances and associated states through to centralized government with federal system lying at some point in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ State was born in October 1914 . Nigeria 's mode offiscal federalism dates back to 1914 through colonial taxation policy and financial arrangement pioneered by the British Colonial Administration , which subsequently financed the development of all national institutions and assets that the nation holds today . After the splitting of Southern Nigeria into the Western Region and Eastern Region , the ensuring political developments necessitated new constitutional development that provided the Richard Constitution of 1946 . <p> Fiscalarrangement <p> Six months before this new Constitution took effect in January 1947 an elaborate study and planning for structure of fiscal arrangement for the Nigerian State was commissioned under Sir Sydney Phillipson with the following terms of reference : <p> *To study comprehensively and make appropriate recommendations regarding the problems of the administrative and financial procedure to be adopted under the new constitution ; and , *To examine , in the light of its historical antecedents , the problem of financial relations between the Nigerian Government and the Native Administration with a view to making recommendations as to the policy and procedure which should determine those relations in the future . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ support to the on-going clamour for the abrogation of the Constitutional provision for the existence of the state/local government joint account . In undertaking his assignment , Phillipson made a detailed study of the revenue and expenditure profile of the Regions and their Native Administrations , which clearly show the contributions of the Regional Governments to the Central Fund as well as to the general government services that created and financed the developments of common national institutions and assets . Government had the power to enact taxation law but the responsibility for collecting the proceeds of direct tax from individuals residing with the jurisdiction of Native Administrations had been assigned to the individual Native Administrations . <p> The Native Administrations were allowed retaining 50 per cent of what they had collected and passing on the remaining 50 per cent to Government . While individual Native Administration expended the retained portion of the tax for various financial services including payment of salaries of their staff , the Government was responsible for executing some essentials services in the provinces . The Table below gives the actual annual revenue contribution from the Native @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well as the expenditure incurred by the Central Government on the provincial service in the Northern and Southern Provinces : <p> While one can not doubt the contributions which the creation of states have done to the Nigerian project , it is also true , that too many states have tended to convert them into mere cost or effort centres at the expense of socio economic development . It is against this backdrop that ACF believes that the creation of any additional states at this point in time is counterproductive and , therefore , should be kept on hold until the need can be justified in future . <p> The argument that creation of states should be on the basis of equality irrespective of population and land mass is inconsistent with elementary concept of justice , since injustice is not only when equals are treated unequally but also when unequals are treated equally . On the basis of population and landmass , the 36 states structure of Nigeria brings up the following fact : <p> Population Average Per State = 140,003,542= 3,888,987 <p> 36 <p> LandmassAverage per State =983,776km2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on average has a population and land mass 3,276,345 and 6733km2 respectively . <p> Population Average per State in the South East is far less than the national average of 612,642 people and indeed the average landmass per state in the South East is not up to 25 per cent of the National Average that is to say the total land mass of all states of the South East is just little above the National Average per State . <p> On the Contrary , the North West has seven States , a population of 35,786,944 ar landmass of 221,120km2 <p> Average Population per State in the North West = 5,112,421 which is 1,223,434 higher than National Average . <p> Average Landmass per state in the North West = 31,589km2 meaning each state in the North West is almost equal to the entire landmass of the South Eastern states in landmass . <p> Six states with population of 27,581,994 , averaging 4,596,999 which is 1,320,654 far higher than the South East Average <p> By Landmass , the South West has 78,774 , which is 13,129km2 or twice the South East average @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ East1 the South West must have up to 9 states first , if population is the deciding factor . Also if land mass is the deciding factor South West must have as much as 12 states before any additional State is created in South East . <p> This proposition , which formed the cardinal position of the South East since the 1994 Constitutional Conference , has been crafted to whittle down any political advantage the North could exercise in Nigeria 's body politics despite its huge territorial size and large population . <p> Yet , the concept of geo-political zones has no place in our Constitution and it should remain so . <p> Prepositions being made in the name of operating ' true federalism ' , ' fiscal federalism ' and the like , are borne either out of political manoeuvres or political ignorance , or both . Whatever is the case , now , the Northern delegates to the Conference have a duty to expose this crude misunderstanding of the political history of Nigerian federalism , and therefore they need to be well armed with knowledgeable position to counteract @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ North . <p> Federating system : It should be clearto all that , the Nigerian Federal System was not a classical example of a federating system such as the case of the United States of America where hitherto independent sovereign States decided to come together to form a united country . Rather , in the case of Nigeria , the 36 States are merely political ' provinces ' as recommended by Selborne Report of 1896 which were later created by the Nigerian State at different historical times , and agitations for additional States are still on going . <p> Therefore , the 36 States of the Nigerian Federal System are and have always been mere administrative units ' and not federating units as erroneously . called by people who wish to re-write history . In other words , the 36 States do not have any pre ? defined rights over any national resources of the Nigerian State . Any attempt by a part of the Nigerian Federation to enforce the notion of states as federating unit is disingenuous and is certainly unconstitutional and the rest of the country should ignore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggest that Northern delegates should pursue a change of nomenclature of the second tier of government from ' State ' to ' Province ' so as to unambiguously avoid the misconceptions that the states are ' Sovereign ' entities ' . <p> Regrettably , fiscal federalism is one of the most bastardized terminologies in Nigerian public discourse today , to the extent that its mention by many -- includtng those in authority -- is taken to mean ' a universally acclaimed structure of resource control and revenue sharing manual ' . To many others , these terms are ( politically ) synonymous with " true federalism " -whatever this means . What , really , is the meaning offiscal federalism ? Fiscal federalism is a theory originally propounded by Richard A Musgrave and Wallace E. Oates that concern itself with the division of public sector functions and finances among multiple layers of governments . <p> The theory aims at improving the performance of the public sectors and the provision of their services by ensuring a proper alignment of responsibilities and fiscal instruments to carry out these responsibilities for economic effiCiency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general normative framework , and its precepts only provided general guidelines with no firm principles . <p> Generally , the theory of fiscal federalism was developed on the historical experiences of nations that emerged or unified by the coming together of independent territories to form larger political polities , such as the cases of Switzerland , Germany , Canada , or the United States of America . In its classical theory , thus , central government of such a federal system is a creation of the regional/provincial governments . But even among nations founded on such classical structure of federal system there is no universal structure of operating fiscal federalism .

That is the big opportunity they see . Nigeria will reform its oil sector and make it contribute much more to inclusive growth , delivery of infrastructure , better education and healthcare . But we realise that non-oil sectors including manufacturing , real estate , mining and others , will deliver more in terms of jobs and even economic growth .

It is also attracting a lot of side meetings , some not related to WEF- that is , companies and organisations are hosting meetings on power , finance and other themes to take advantage of the congregation of such a large number of international investors in Nigeria for the World Economic Forum on Africa .

He said that since business is all about rendering service and filling gaps for a fee or reward , the environment where one lives should be one of the factors to be considered before deciding on the kind of business to go into . <p> According to him , that was one of the things he took into consideration before he chose to go into the importation of marble and the laying of tiles as his line of business , going by the fact that Nigeria is still a developing country , and as such , there is bound to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ required to start a business is not money as people would think but honesty , adding that that was why Niger Glaze which he started 14 years ago with only N45 is now one of the biggest marble and granite companies in the country and being patronised by multinationals . <p> In this interview , he also spoke about his humble beginning , his partnership with Italian and Canadian governments to start manufacturing marbles in Nigeria and the challenges affecting manufacturing business in Nigeria . Excerpts : ... <p> In the beginning <p> My name is Owelle Philips Anyakudo , a prince from Ekwe ancient kingdom , formerly in Orlu region but now in Isu Local Government Area of Imo State . I attended St Ephraim 's Secondary School , Owerrenta and later University of Maiduguri . I also attended the International Detective School in California , United States where I obtained a post graduate diploma . All my life , I have been in business . I began by hawking cosmetics around motor parks in Aba and Port Harcourt at a very tender age . I was working for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was combining hawking with my secondary school education between the ages of 11 and 14 , even though my father was the king of Ekwe Kingdom then . When I came to Lagos after my graduation from higher institutions here in Nigeria and the United States , I established Royal Class Boutique in Surulere . I was dealing mainly in designer perfumes , shoes and bags . Then , there was a lot of pilfering and armed robbery . It was a superstore , as at that time , a business of five million naira was a very big business and robbers and pilferers were constantly coming to disturb us . As a result , I withdrew from the business and opted for one that does not involve moving cash up and down . <p> What influenced my choice of business <p> When I graduated from the university , I looked at Nigeria and saw that it is a developing country and I asked myself , what was really needed here . You know that when a young graduate from university starts to work , if he is lucky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the back of his mind are to have a good car , to marry and to have a home of his own . I told myself that I can not go into car business because it is not steady . Car manufacturers come out with new models of cars every three months and before you know it , you would be selling old model cars . When I looked at marble and tiles business , I found peace because housing is one of the basic needs of man . Everybody , whether old or young needs a house . Somebody who is building a house would always need wall and floor tiles . He would use posilyn , vitrify tiles or marble . Whoever has made a little money and wants to build a house , must ask for tiles even if it is the cheapest , that is wall tiles . The same goes with toilet systems . So , I decided to settle for the construction industry because that is the stage Nigeria is in as a developing country . I told myself that I would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go into construction in Nigeria , be it for residential , commercial , churches , mosques or industries . <p> Starting Niger Glaze <p> I went into marble business as a novice . Before then I had joined a company known as Njaba Ventures . I started as Personal Assistant to the owner of the company and later as General Manager.The owner of the company also did not know anything about marble business . We were doing trial and error and we really burnt our fingers due to ignorance . We fell into the hands of the traders at the Odun-Ade building materials market , along Orile Road in Lagos and they defrauded us . They cleaned out all the money that I brought into the business and left me high and dry . But I thank God for that experience because that was what led to the incorporation of Niger Glaze . When I wanted to incorporate Niger Glaze as a business venture in April , 2000 , I had only N45 . Of course , you do n't need money to go into business . What you need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I learnt the differences in all the tiles , be it ceramic , vitrified , granite and marble and people were happy that I was telling them the truth . So , if you want to succeed in business , tell people the truth . The truth that I told them brought a lot of success in my business and in my life because I was telling them that they can not use ceramic in their sitting rooms , that they can not use ceramics where there would be traffic or constant movements . This tile or that tile is what you would use . Most people do n't know the difference between marble and granite or ceramic and porcelain or vitrified tiles . I was telling them this and proving it with chemicals . They were happy . So , in business , first of all , get the hearts of your would-be customers and money will start to roll in . I never advertised . The jobs that I was doing was giving me a lot of references . I had no office or showroom . I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you would come to my showroom , I would tell you do n't worry that I would bring the samples to your construction site and early in the morning , before you get to your site , I was already there waiting for you with my samples beautifully displayed . So , as I said earlier , in business , trust , honesty and integrity are the key words and then hard work . Get the hearts first and money will start flowing endlessly . <p> How we make money in the business <p> I am not a non governmental organisation ( NGO ) or a charity organisation . I make my money through volume sales . I do n't top more than a hundred or hundred and fifty naira on a square metre of tile that I sold . I make sure that for a square metre of tile , I do n't look for more than hundred and fifty naira and with that , I always sell cheaper than my competitors , but the secret there is that people come to buy in large quantity so the little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amounts to something substantial . So , I make money through volumes . People come here and buy more than 20 containers of tiles at a go . We do n't use prices to chase our customers away . But my joy is to go into production and help to reduce the number of unemployed in the society . We believe in telling the customers the truth and giving them our products at reasonable prices . <p> Beating competition <p> Beating competitors is very easy because right now we are about the only company that is importing Italian tiles . Some people who are living in Italy but when they get to the port and meet the difficulties of Customs and clearing agents , they would be discouraged . There are other people that try to import what we call stock . Stock means in a container , you would have about 20 different colours . Those people can not make much because a client can come here and demand six containers of the same colour . We also can not compete with the Chinese because their products are inferior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to buy tiles when they are building their own houses . <p> Why we are unique <p> We are unique because of the quality of our tiles.Everything about tiles started in ancient Rome.They have been in tiles from creation . All the Basilicas were built with tiles.They started with Mosaic tiles and from there to peoples homes . There is no house that was built in Rome from the ancient days till now that does not have tiles . They do n't even bother with paints . Today , they have equipment that changes the temperature of your rooms . When the weather is too cold , it changes your room temperature to warm and when the weather is too hot , it changes the room temperature to cold . For all the years that we have been in business , nobody has bought tiles here and returned it , be it church , mosque or individuals . We do n't only sell to you , we also educate you on how to use it so that there will be evenness of tone . There is no need to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sell.Here , we are integrity conscious and anything you buy , we follow you to your house to make sure that the right thing is done . We do n't go about advertising . Our workers are trained people in the field and their duty is to give the best in terms of finishing . <p> Challenges in the business <p> Faking and selling substandard products is the biggest headache in the business . A particular country I would not like to mention here is very good at designing the counterfeit of any good product you can think of . I deal in Italian and Spanish tiles but for each Italian or Spanish tile , some other countries have what looks more fanciful and more good looking but the quality is almost zero . The worst of it all is that the price goes for two for a penny and being a Nigerian doing this business it is always difficult to convince somebody to leave something that is flashy and cheap to buy something that is costlier . So you have to talk from now till tomorrow . Some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commercial house and as such they do n't need quality tiles.But they forget that the house belongs to them and if they use cheap materials in its construction , a tenant would only live there for two years and after that you would use all the rent that was paid to you for reconstruction which is penny wise pound foolish . I continue to tell people that education is not only going to school . Education means knowledge and when you have knowledge you have the weapon against ignorance , poverty and disease . Education would make you to know that most times the cheapest is the most expensive . Some people would use wall tiles on the floor and tell you that tiles are tiles . If you use quality tiles in your house , you would spend less on maintenance . Another challenge that we have in this business is epileptic power supply . I told myself that after ten years , I should start manufacturing but the Italians that I brought to Nigeria for feasibility studies after going round , they told me that there is abundant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problem is lack of stability in power supply.When I suggested generator , they said that the cost of maintenance would be very high . You know it is cheaper to import than to manufacture here in Nigeria . <p> Going into manufacturing <p> Right now I have got a partner and we are working towards opening up a granite company in Nigeria . We have already procured equipment worth six million euros . Some Canadians also want to come into the project but they are asking for 25 years licence from the federal government but government said it can only grant five years which could be renewed . So , I am pleading with them to accept the five years so we can go into granite production because we have a lot of deposits in the country . <p> The site is in Edo State . I am to anchor the distributorship as well as secure the machinery while they do the production . In the area of machinery , I had initially wanted to source the machines from Spain but when it did not work out , I went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So we are about to start and for the unstable power supply , we hope to overcome it by using gas turbines , just to make sure that we start the project because my dream is to give at least 2000 people jobs . When you create jobs , crime would reduce and prostitution would also reduce.Even Boko Haram would go into extinction because Nigerians love life . Suicide bombing is not part of us.

@@1875237 <h> Checking noise pollution in Lagos <p> Lagos State government is set to move against noise pollution in the state . To this effect , it has directed its environmental policeman , the Lagos State Environmental Protection Agency ( LASEPA ) , to check the proliferation of churches and mosques within residential quarters , with no regard at all for the peace , comfort and rights of others . According to the Commissioner for the Environment , Mr. Tunji Bello , while there is no plan to clamp down on places of worship , checking their proliferation has become inevitable as a result of their violation of other people 's rights through the unbearable noise they unleash on those living within their neighbourhood . <p> We welcome the decision of the state government to regulate the noise from churches and mosques . It is a bold step that is long overdue . However , it is heart-warming that the government is not going to be bullish about it , but has rather chosen to explore the dialogue option . As Bello explained , " we do n't want to clamp down on religious organisations because we understand that they render one of the vital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tone of the Lagos authorities on this problem is well considered . Issues bordering on religion in Nigeria are very delicate , highly inflammable and prone to misinterpretation . It is , therefore , apposite that the state government is also approaching the matter by dialoguing with the Nigerian Inter-Religious Council and other relevant bodies to work out rules and guidelines for places of worship . A situation in which there can be as many as six churches and mosques , each with its own loudspeakers mounted outside its premises and blaring all manner of messages , on one short street in a residential quarters , is unhealthy and quite unfair to the people in the neighbourhood . <p> Such noise pollution during vigils and other noisy religious observances disturb the peace of entire neighbourhoods , rubbing off negatively on the productivity of residents the next day . It is impossible to quantify the social and economic losses that noise pollution visits on both the Nigerian economy and the individuals that are subjected to it . <p> So , after many years of religious houses disturbing people living in residential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dare to complain in bad light , it is comforting that the government now wants to arrest the situation . However , we believe that halting the menace requires strict adherence to existing building and town planning guidelines . The Ministry of Urban and Town Planning should monitor the structures that people are erecting in different parts of the state and enforce building plans . <p> Secondly , the Lagos State government sometime ago issued a directive on the volume of noise allowed at different times of the day . It is doubtful that any efforts were made to enforce this regulation . Some churches and mosques have since that time continued to mount loudspeakers outside their premises , emitting noise that is far above the decibel allowed in the government directive . <p> Of course , this attempt to check noise pollution will raise the issue of call to prayer , which is an integral part of worship in Islam . It might be necessary for worship houses to consider the deployment of modern technology , such as use of bulk SMS , for this purpose . Surely , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loudspeakers outside their buildings . There should be no need for them to blare loudspeakers into every home in the neighbourhood to communicate with God . <p> Religious groups must be made to understand that there is a permissible level of noise , beyond which it becomes a public nuisance and noise pollution . There is a permissible decibel of noise for the afternoon , and that level drastically reduces as night approaches . Worship houses can not , therefore , continue to carry on as though no one else matters . <p> But , as the government seeks to control noise pollution from religious bodies , care must be taken to ensure that the enforcement does not offend the provision of Section 38 of the Constitution , which guarantees freedom of worship . Worshippers , however , must be made to realise that they can only enjoy this freedom in a way that does not impinge on the rights and freedoms of others . <p> Government officials who are sent out to assess noise levels when complaints are made should also be sincere and eschew the propensity to cover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continue like this . Noise pollution in our residential areas have not only crossed the limits of legality , it has become both inhuman . The time has come to check it . <p> Beyond the noise from churches and mosques , however , government should also look at other sources of noise pollution . The other range of inconveniences which worshippers regularly visit on their neighbourhoods , such as obstruction of free flow of traffic , should also be addressed .

Hence , any man aspiring to an office of honour such as that of governor of a state should command respect among the governed and have untainted and impeccable character certification , eye on the ball of mutual growth , fingers on the pie of creativity , and a sound mind that fuses imagination with achievable innovations . Without doubt he should be a Midas ; a man with value added touch , VAT . <p> And since political grapevine , and commonsense too , has it that a technocrat of repute , from Lagos East , should step into the big shoes that BRF will be leaving behind come 2015 ; then it behoves the good people of Ikorodu , Ibeju-Lekki , and Epe that constitute Lagos East , to put their best feet forward in the APC governorship election . <p> Stunningly , the revered royal father of Lagos , Oba Rilwan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a particular candidate for the top job from the ' assigned ' senatorial district . And this ' anointed ' candidate , who retired about a year ago from the State Civil Service , is believed to be a technocrat and public servant of high pedigree . Of course , he is . But there 's a hitch . The referred candidate may be a better candidate than others currently on display ; except that he is not the best from this zone of attention . How can he equal , let alone beat , the record of an exemplary Head of Service and an illustrious son of Lagos East , who also bowed out of public stewardship , recently , after decades of meritorious service to Lagosians . <p> Now let 's have a sneak-peek of the staggering profile of Prince Adesegun Olusola Ogunlewe , Head of Service , Lagos State Civil Service ( May 2010 -- October 2013 ) . Born 16th October 1953 into the Fadugba-Ogunlewe royal family of Igbogbo-Baiyeku Local Council Area of Ikorodu in Lagos East , young Ogunlewe had his elementary and secondary education @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both in Ikorodu . <p> Prince Ogunlewe later joined the public service on 7th August 1979 as an administrative officer grade level 08 ; shortly after bagging a degree in Sociology from the famous University of Ife ( now Obafemi Awolowo University , OAU ) in 1978 . He soon learned the bureaucratic ropes and rose steadily through the ranks , became a permanent secretary ( 2nd February 2001 ) and served in five agencies and other capacities before getting to his career 's zenith as the Head of Service of Lagos State Civil Service on 21st May 2010 . <p> With an impeccable credential of integrity , honesty , modesty , humility and simplicity ; a well-organised Ogunlewe soon attained the enviable height of a thorough-bred technocrat , unassailable administrative disciplinarian and a public mentor . Aside his great leadership trait , Ogunlewe was a submissive and articulate subordinate . Between1987-1992 , he was a private secretary to many state governors such as : late Navy Captain Okhai Mike Akhigbe , Col. Raji Rasaki ( rtd ) and Sir Michael Agbolade Otedola , of blessed memory . <p> It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , introduced the computerisation of records of land allocation on scheme-by-scheme basis in Lagos State . He also facilitated the preparation of an omnibus seniority list at the then Post-Primary Teaching Service Commission to avert supersession in appointment to duty posts and initiated the processes that resulted in the setting up of the Lagos State Records and Archives Bureau . <p> Besides , Ogunlewe ensured the completion of backlog for eligible staff while at the Civil Service Commission and sustained a healthy relationship between government and labour groups , throughout his four-year stay at the Ministry of Establishments and Training . <p> This adept administrator and negotiator also successfully did following as the Chairman of the Public Service Joint Negotiating Council in the State . ( a ) Review of Staff Salaries and Allowances ( b ) Career progression through review of Schemes of Service for over twenty cadres ( c ) Engendered cordial relations within and among the various Trade Unions and Government . <p> Furthermore , Prince Ogunlewe championed the Public Service Management Reforms under the State Partnership for Accountability Responsiveness and Capability ( SPARC ) via the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kingdom-sponsored programme in Lagos State . His tenure also saw an increment to 48 buses in the fleet of the State Government Centralised Staff Bus Scheme . The ultra-modern facelift at the Adeyemi Bero Auditorium was an additional shining example of Ogunlewe 's Midas ' touch of class . <p> For these laudable achievements and others , Prince Ogunlewe earned many laurels and honours to his royal name . He 's a fellow of the Institute of Public Administration of Nigeria ( IPAN ) , the Nigerian Institute of Training and Development ( NITAD ) and the Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply Management of Nigeria ( CIPSMAN ) . He is also a Patron of the Association for the Eradication of Corruption in Nigeria ( ASSERCORN ) . <p> And , last but not the least ; Prince Adesegun Olusola Ogunlewe is an embodiment of intellectualism and rich culture . He 's humane and urbane , grass-root oriented and people-focussed . And his portfolio of excellence , transparency , selflessness , altruism and team-play spirit could be attested to by many credible indigenes of Lagos State . The royal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and even Kabiyesi Oba Akiolu ) could vouch for this great man of purpose and emulative accomplishments . <p> Hence , if merit is the name of the political game in Lagos State 's search for a technocrat to be at the helms of affairs come 2015 , the best candidate from Lagos East , can not but be a man who deeply understands the inner workings of government . He 's seen it all and can consolidate the good works of outgoing governor Babatunde Fashola . <p> That choice is in Prince Adesegun Olusola Ogunlewe , 61 . He 's literarily and realistically the word best that makes the term better an utter misnomer . Let the man who can serve best be the head that wears Lagos gubernatorial crown in 2015 . Long live the good people of Lagos State and their heritage of perfection and excellent disposition never quakes ?

@@1878230 <h> Refund of illegal bank charges <p> THE directive , by the Central Bank of Nigeria ( CBN ) , that commercial banks should refund all illegal and excess charges on customers ' accounts in the last one year is commendable . It is a welcome respite for bank customers who have in recent years been subjected to spurious and excessive charges by their bankers . The decision of the CBN to intervene in this matter by ordering a refund of the illegal charges is a laudable step that should be strictly enforced . <p> The charges , which emanate mainly from the Deposit Money Banks ' Automated Teller Machines ( ATMs ) , were described as either partial or deliberate errors by the banks . The move by the apex bank to enforce the refunds is sequel to the deluge of complaints by customers that they are being cheated by their banks . The refund order , according to the CBN , is in compliance with Section 9.1 of the Guidelines for Card Issuance and Usage in Nigeria . <p> In a June 12 circular entitled : " Non-refund of Monies to Customers Shortchanged by ATMs ' Non-dispense or Partial Error " , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Policy and Regulation Department , the CBN said it had observed that many commercial banks have , indeed , overcharged their customers with regard to Commissio on Turnover . It also said others were found to have arbitrarily imposed illegal maintenance fees on CoT-free accounts . The commercial banks were given a July 31 deadline to refund all the excess charges to their customers or face severe penalties . <p> Although the penalty for banks which fail to make the due refunds was not stated , we consider the CBN order a salutary one that should bring home to the banks the importance of dealing honestly with their customers . Hopefully , it will help to bring the affected banks back on track , and properly focused on their primary role as financial intermediaries supplying financial services to their customers . <p> In recent years , many commercial banks in the country have sadly deviated from their core mandates . Some of them deal with their customers in an unfair manner , making frivolous and illegal charges on their accounts , possibly as a result of the increasingly intense competition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Protection Department and the Committees of Heads of e-Banking and Heads of Operations of the CBN for investigating the complaints lodged by customers . The investigation is in line with the mandate of the Central Bank to regulate the banking sector and protect customers from exploitation . The fact that N14.6 billion had been recovered from the affected banks as at last month ( May ) vindicates customers ' complaints about excess charges by the commercial banks . <p> It is heartening that bank customers are becoming more aware of their rights and obligations , and are bringing such illegal charges to the attention of the CBN , which is the appropriate authority to deal with the matter . The regulatory bank confirmed that it had intervened and treated no fewer than 3,000 complaints from bank customers across the country in the past one month alone . <p> Last year , the CBN had said that it recovered over N9 billion excess charges that were arbitrarily taken from customers ' deposits . This is a worrisome trend that should not be tolerated in the banking industry . Such excess charges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ financial intermediaries dedicated to serving their customers . <p> It is rather sad that some Nigerian banks are no longer concerned about legitimate means of growing their profits . They are not bothered about improving their financial fortunes through better service and product offerings . It has become quite common these days to hear customers complaining about how their banks shortchange them through inexplicable " hidden charges " . These , oftentimes , are charges imposed on customers ' accounts without any prior notification . Such illegal charges negate the essence of banker/customer relationship . Trust is the cutting-edge in banking , and it must be anchored on transparency of transactions . <p> Undoubtedly , commercial banking has become increasingly challenging , with competition getting more intense . But , that should not by any means lead to excessive or hidden charges that cast doubts on the integrity of the banking industry . <p> Customers are the reason banks exist , and the institutions could go under if customers withdraw their patronage . Banks ' financial results ought to come from legitimate sale of services and products , and not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ profitable even when they play by the rules , provided that they study economic trends and design winning products and workable strategies . Profitability should not come from overcharging customers . <p> Therefore , the disingenuous levying of excessive charges on bank customers is unacceptable , and it is good that the CBN has risen sharply against it . It is high time banks began to place more premium on trust , integrity and their public image , than just posting high profits at the expense of their customers . <p> Looking forward , the Inspectorate Department as well as the Consumer Protection Division of the CBN should be more diligent in their inspection and supervision of commercial banks . This is necessary to ensure that the banks do not indulge in unethical practices . Stiff sanctions should be imposed on banks that fail to make due refunds to their customers within the time limit set by the CBN.

@@1878234 <h> Modelling risk and returns <p> Today 's LNG projects are facing complex investment decisions due to the large upfront infrastructure costs , shipping options and shifting global markets . Many of these challenges faced early in the project lifecycle , from pre-FEED and FEED studies to full final investment decision ( FID ) , are decisions that must take account of real world uncertainty such as market volatility , fluctuating supply chains , equipment reliability , evolving operational policies and weather disruptions . <p> Those currently planning to enter the LNG market require large capital investment in order to build the necessary infrastructure . With such high costs at stake , investors need to be clear that facilities and shipping capacity are able to perform as expected in the face of such a volatile market and shifting supply chain . <p> From initial scoping studies to the FID , once feasibility has been established , designs for any new LNG facility need to be validated against both short and medium-term operational objectives as well as longer term strategic plans to ensure success . <h> Predicting success <p> Predictive simulation is a powerful technology that has been used to achieve this for many years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LNG capacity and shipping operations have been studied , designed and validated using Lanner 's LNG Logistics Simulation software . <p> Predictive simulation allows project owners to experience visually how potential operational scenarios will play out across their infrastructure designs . This insight delivers a quantifiable , statistically accurate and unbiased projection of how proposed value chain facilities will function both in a steady state but also crucially how it will react under the stress of real world conditions . Predictive simulation offers the following advantages : <p> Rapidly experiments and evaluates scenarios to understand feasibility and robustness . <p> Quickly and cost-effectively alters the modelled operation as the project matures so that analysis is future proofed . <p> Understands trade-offs and identifies the factors that impact key objectives so that unnecessary cost can be avoided . <p> The many elements of the LNG value chain each have subtle intricacies , performance variables and operating characteristics that present a variety of challenges when it comes to predicting performance . Lanner 's LNG Logistics Simulator contains a suite of modules , each specifically created to represent different elements of the value @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ specific needs of individual projects , delivering an end-to-end analysis tool tailored to the project 's needs . <h> A case in point <p> One of Lanner 's customers recently proposed the addition of export facilities to its regasification terminal in Louisiana , US ; a move that reflects shale gas viability across the continent . <p> The project proposes supplementing existing infrastructure with liquefaction trains and additional marine berths , storage tanks and complex marine traffic scheduling in order to begin exporting LNG from the facility to markets in East Asia and Europe . <p> The project team were tasked with using analytics to better understand future operating options , quantify risks and validate investment milestones to secure commitment and financing from the three commercial partners involved . They needed a model that would allow them to test , refine and validate key decisions during the planning stage , enabling them to balance the requirements from each partner and create a solid business case for investment . <p> With investment levels around the US$ 7 billion mark , accurate foresight was required into the operational capacity of the terminal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while export operations were ramped up . In order to gain accurate projections of throughput and assess the storage capacity required to manage the import and export operations , predictive simulation was deployed . <p> Lanner was selected because of its depth of experience and expertise in the LNG industry , as well as the configurable modular design of its simulator , built upon its core WITNESS simulation platform . A key requirement was that models developed in the simulator could be re-configured and rapidly re-used by the project team to evaluate new conditions as the project itself evolved . <p> Predictive simulation was used to prove that the terminal could operate effectively , with sufficient berthing capacity to avoid undue delay to shipping . One of the main considerations when looking at capacity was that the channel leading to the terminal was particularly congested and susceptible to tides and storms , limiting the number of vessels that could enter and leave at any one time . <p> The model mimicked the constraints in a ' real world ' environment so that the project team could accurately test shipping schedules @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be sufficient for all the partners involved . <p> Analysis of the projected scenarios confirmed that the terminal could comfortably cope with the planned requirements , but it also demonstrated that the company would require specific maintenance regimes and strategies to manage characteristics that would affect the steady state operation . Increased channel traffic , channel closures owing to bad weather , variable tanker ship sizes and arrival schedule disruptions , and the impact of an increased number of cargoes on train production would each have a significant impact on performance . <p> The analyses generated by Lanner 's LNG Logistics Simulator were fed into the business case confirming the viability of the new terminal and the predicted operational profitably as set out in the proposal . Through projecting future performance , risk was effectively removed from the project prior to the FID stage . <h> Real-world behaviour without real-world risk <p> As the above example demonstrates , predictive simulation mimics events to provide foresight into how a value chain would behave in the real-world against a spectrum of conditions and variables . It is unique in its ability to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , interdependencies and real-world uncertainties in order to visualise and predict future performance . Because scenarios can be tested and optimised before decisions are made , risks to performance are better understood and mitigated . <p> Both the demand and supply of LNG is on the rise driven by the diversification of its use , improvements in technology and lowering costs of extraction . It is difficult to predict exactly how the global LNG market will evolve but it is certain that the challenge of getting the risk/reward balance right is not going to get any easier . The foresight provided by simulators can help LNG value chain players predict how they can capitalise on this opportunity , minimising risk and maximising returns , gaining a clear advantage in this lucrative market . 
@@1878235 <h> ICAN should have been part of talks on missing oil money -- Ajaegbu <p> Mr. Chidi Onyeukwu Ajaegbu , was recently elected the 50th President of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Nigeria ( ICAN ) . In an interview with journalists , he articulated his agenda for the accountancy profession and the Institute . He also commented on recent developments in the nation 's economy . Excerpts : <p> What is your vision for the institute ? <p> The thrust of my presidency is protecting public interest and enhancing professionalism . <p> Public interest is basically about advocacy and advocacy is basically about public interest and making aggressive input into policy making processes of the government and also challenging them if necessary and making independent opinion . So , essentially that is what is going to drive this year . <p> When you say protecting public interest , what do you really mean ? <p> Let me just say that our institute , because of our conservatism over the years , we have been running away from getting involved in conversations in the society . <p> So , what we want to do in the next one year is to come up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out to talk about them , send representatives to government and if we need to use the media to achieve that , we may do so . <p> For example , all through the issue of the missing money at the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation ( NNPC ) , we were not involved in the debate . I think the institute , as a protector of public interest , ought to have gotten involved in the discussion and probably set a template , process to ascertain what the position is . We intend to do more of that this year . <p> In recent times , there have been reported cases of chartered accountants allegedly being involved in fraud and it seems like ICAN does not do anything about that ? <p> Let me say that there is this misconception that we are not doing anything . We have disciplinary processes . <p> You need to report a Chartered Accountant of having committed some form of infraction before we can set up what we call an investigative panel . If for example the accountant in your office commits fraud and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ register will direct the investigative panel to investigate the allegations . <p> When the allegations are investigated and there is a report and the committee finds that person ' culpable , ' the next level is to take that investigation and the accountant to the tribunal . <p> The tribunal is an equivalent of a high court meaning that whatever decision we take at the tribunal level can only be challenged at the court of appeal . <p> But is it a deliberate attempt not to allow members of the public know the outcome of the disciplinary panel ? <p> The point is that we do n't publicise in the sense that we do n't go to the print media . If you go to our websites , journals , financial statements , they are all there . You will get the names , what they were tried for , what happened and the outcome of the cases . <p> They are all there . But what we do n't do is to go to the media and advertise it . There have been a lot of discussions and arguments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conclusion that , that is the best way . <p> At one point , during one of the past presidents , our proceedings were being televised . But we did a policy impact assessment and the feedback we got did n't add much to the brand and we needed to rethink it and to find other ways of doing it . But do n't forget , as I said at the beginning that we are very conservative . <p> We have an enabling Act and what it says is that there must be a petition . In fact , what it says is that the petition must be under oath to serve as a deterrent for people lying . So , if your petition is under oath , you ca n't come up with allegations that are not true . <p> A lot of professional bodies , including ICAN , seem not to be comfortable with the Financial Reporting Council ( FRC ) . What is the view of ICAN on the status of the FRC ? <p> First of all , that is the law . You see , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are public hearings and so on , you do n't fold your arms and the law is made and when it is now being implemented you start complaining . <p> I think that is very typical of our people . If you had any misgivings about the law , the point you should have challenged it should have been during the public hearing . Now , the law has come to stay . What we can now do is to go into discussions with the FRC and then those complaining should come up with the specific areas they want us to deal with . But our law is our law , whether they are bad or good . <p> So , for it to become something else might be as a result of implementation or some part of the law that you want to be amended . But it is about dialogue because it is our law . When you say members are complaining , of course we have about 39,000 members and some people might have some misgivings . On paper the way it looked , it was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ implementation of the Act . <p> How are your members taking the aspect of the FRC Act that states that ICAN should no longer grant licence to individual members ? <p> At ICAN , we have changed the way we sign our financial statements and that was as a result of the direct ruling of the FRC . There was a court ruling which actually was in tandem with what is obtainable in a sane environment and aligns with the FRC law . So you now sign your name with your membership number , put your firm 's name and your FRCN number . It is all about trying to let people understand the seriousness of that signature because what it is talking about is to make the individual liable . For you to put your name and signature on a financial statement , it means you are taking responsibility for that financial statement as the engagement partner . <p> Has ICAN given up on the fight against the multiplicity of accounting bodies in the country ? <p> Taking you back , I will want you to understand that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was signed by the military government and we have been in court , from the court of first instance to the Supreme Court . But as time went by , there have been some form of relationship between both organisations that we had to lend support to ANAN for associate membership of some associations .

My opinions , thoughts and biases have been expressed variedly in publications and discourses over time . <p> I shall not address the 24 demands of the NMA specifically , but give an overview of why Medicine remains first among equals , primus inter pares , and preeminent in the sector and indeed in the larger society.If Nigeria were a knowledge based society as it should be , most anomalies that are seen will not be seen ; a place where princes walk , and slaves ride on horsebacks ! It is because of such anomalies that these issues arise at all , and must be discussed . <p> Why really are differing admission criteria set for different undergraduate university programs ? Why are certain choice courses like Medicine , law , engineering , accountancy not open to all comers ? Why , inspite of interests expressed is everyone not able to study medicine and are instead given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> 1 . One reason is because these are professional courses that are held in very high esteem in and by all societies . An admission into any of these confers a lifetime of respect , rights , privileges and responsibilities on the individual so lucky in the eyes of society . In particular , Medicine is an occupation of benevolence , and is only second to the clergy in influence , at least historically.Very great value is thus placed on these occupations , and such professionals occupy social class One of every society ( of course , except maybe Nigeria ) . It is this value that translates to premium renumeration , rewards and salaries , headship and leadership in the hospital , sector and society , and the fiduciary relationship with clients . <p> A natural barrier to entry is consequently placed , to limited the number and quality of persons who gain admission . The barriers to entry are reflected in the choice of subject combinations , credit requirements , JAMB cutoff points , financial requirements , demonstrated leadership potential , motivation or drive inter Alia.Pharmacy remains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ healthcare industry in terms of these requirements . <p> 2 . Entry level requirements for each discipline differs equally ; because of the value of each ones ' contributions , roles and responsibilities . Whilst a three year associate degree is sufficient to become a registered nurse ( even though bachelors programs exist ) , a Bsc program for Medical laboratory science , ditto for optometry and pharmacy ( 5 years ) the minimum for Medicine is a professional or doctoral degree ( minimum of six years ) . While a case may be made for a professional or doctoral degree for pharmacy ( Not yet available in Nigeria ) the same can not be said for other allied medical disciplines . It is pertinent to underscore the fact that , unlike the other programs , a semester system is not the norm in medical schools because of the sheer demands of the program , and to be able to accommodate completion in the six years duration for training . Thus , while other undergraduates relish the inter semester breaks , the average medic slaves away to survive the brutal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , hematology , morbid anatomy , public health , pharmacology , surgery , Medicine , clinical clerkship etc cutting across all areas and providing a panoramic view of every area , something necessary for proper leadership.Yours truly spent eight years , inclusive of a one year ASUU strike ! <p> 3 . " Necessity " or need for on-the-job training . Please take note of the " necessity " . Besides the initial doctoral or professional degree obtained , further residential training is necessary in all fields of medicine , ranging from public health , obstetrics and gynecology to Laboratory Medicine . A minimum of 4 years is required at the earliest , and up to 8 years depending on the specialty , with further differentiations and super specializations being necessary occasionally . These are the minimum mandatory requirements for practice of medicine . How then can the laboratory scientist , no matter his pedigee now lord it over the Laboratory doctor ?

Because the public sector @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on this , employing the game of numbers and raw brawn to place increasingly outrageous demands on government . A private sector driven health industry will put sanity into our heads , and water will find its level ! <p> 4 . Demand , supply and rarity of skills . Because of all the aforementioned reasons , the supply of specialists , otherwise referred to as " consultants " is very limited , whilst the demand continues to be heavy . A world Health organization recommended ratio of doctor to clients is about 1 : 500 . But for instance , in Nigeria , the ratio of psychiatrists to the population is about 1 : 1.2 million Nigerians ( less than 200 psychiatrists to 167million Nigerians ) A similar abysmal picture is seen in in most specialities of Medicine in Nigeria , not least of which reason is the low renumeration compared to work load , poor work conditions etc . <p> 5 .

This includes a fiduciary relationship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's best interest at all times , and bears full responsibility for clinical and ethical judgments , and takes responsibility for litigations.It is he who statutorily confers the sick role on an individual in any society among other things . <p> Without prejudice to the rights of others to self determine and aspire , " relativity " between medical doctors and the other disciplines must be preserved . A situation where brigandry becomes the deciding factor on who gets what , rather than appropriate job evaluations , enlightened assessment and international best practice is not and can not be acceptable . The choice of doctors as head of the health team is a result of their conceptual understanding and panoramic view bestowed not by choice , but necessarily of training.For the same reason a non accountant will never be the accountant general , and a non lawyer never the state attorney or chief justice , should a non medical doctors become the head of hospitals , particularly the tertiary hospitals . <p> Post script <p> The points above are what is used in job evaluations , not some wanton and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doctors slightly lower than physiotherapists and laboratory scientists " .

A PhD in any of these has no place or use in the general hospital setting . Maybe so in the universities . <p> I do agree that doctors need to place greater emphasis on interpersonal and interdisciplinary relationships , communication , and generally view themselves as privileged custodians of a sacred duty , not as taskmasters and overlords . Our approach and manners towards others go a long way in eroding or enhancing this respect already conferred on us.We need to reemphasize communication skills already embedded in the curriculum . <p> I also do agree that doctors who wish to head the hospitals must possess something other than the medical degrees .

Our youths will be supported to go into mechanised farming , and to pursue agriculture as a business . <p> " I am very pleased to see that Olam 's rice farm is inclusive of the rural communities , especially women and youths . As we encourage large commercial farms , we will ensure that their development empowers subject communities and protects their land rights , while boosting their shared participation in wealth creation , within their communities . <p> " We must not just stop at farming , but progressively add value to all our agricultural produce , building agricultural value chains , from the farm to the table . The current and planned investment of over $100 million by Olam , is a very good example of how to build integrated rice value chains , combining commercial rice farms , out-grower schemes of small farmers , and modern rice mills . More of such rice business investments will be promoted with the various incentives under the new rice policy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nigeria will become a net exporter of high quality finished rice within the next five years .

@@1881231 <h> Role of Pension Funds in Infrastructure Development <p> Pension stakeholders want accumulated pension assets deployed for housing and infrastructure development . They also want contributors to be allowed to borrow from the fund to meet specific needs while operators should introduce a top-up regime to attract informal sector workers into the contributory pension scheme , writes Nnamdi Duru <p> With over N4 trillion under their management , pension fund administrators ( PFAs ) are targets of big corporations , government , infrastructure developers and operators in capital intensive sectors . <p> Corporations want to access the fund to grow their businesses , while states and the federal government desperately want to use the funds to develop infrastructure . On the other hand , contributors want the pension money used to finance housing programmes on their behalf . <p> In the same vein , most Nigerians want the saved contributions used to fix roads , electricity and other infrastructure . However , pension operators have insisted on government guarantee before investing in infrastructure . <p> To harmonise these interests , stakeholders during the World Pension Summit ( WPS ) , ' Africa Special ' in Abuja recently brainstormed on how to make these happen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acting Director-General of the National Pension Commission ( PenCom ) , Mrs. Chinelo Anohu-Amazu , harped on the need for stakeholders to develop pension fund into a veritable instrument for social change . <p> " Infrastructure development remains a key driver and a critical enabler of sustainable growth in Africa and the current favorable economic landscape on the continent provides a unique opportunity for the public and private sectors to collectively address the infrastructure gaps , " she said . <p> Stakeholders discussed pertinent issues about pension in Africa and explored how to channel pension fund into infrastructure and real estate , and how to leverage technology to add value to pensioners and contributors . <p> They also deliberated on issues concerning risk management and how to improve corporate governance in the pension sector to enthrone a regime of best practices and ensure that the continental pension sector champions the needed growth and development in Africa . <p> They reviewed the challenges before pension operators and regulators with a view to establishing a befitting retirement benefit scheme and creating systems that are relevant to the fundamental needs of Africans . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the need to allow contributors to borrow from their accumulated savings for specific purpose and how to lure informal sector workers into the contributory pension scheme ( CPS ) among other things . <p> Housing development Housing deficit is a major problem facing Africans and in Nigerians this cuts across all the states in the federation . Many people live on the streets while most workers can not afford a decent home . <p> Some resorted to borrowing from banks at very high interest rate to build their homes only to lose these houses to banks being unable to repay the loan an accumulated interests in full . <p> It is obvious that Nigerian workers represented by the Nigeria Labour Congress ( NLC ) favour using pension fund to provide houses for them . They say this is the best way to deploy pension funds to benefit contributors directly . <p> Lending to contributors Underscoring the need for pension fund managers to channel pension asset to finance housing for workers , the Chief Executive Officer of the Kenyan Retirement Benefits Authority and Chairman of the International Organisation of Pension Supervisors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ houses are expensive when mortgage institutions and other intermediaries build for sale to workers . <p> For this reason , Kenyan workers are allow to borrow from their retirement savings to build houses at friendly interest rates , using accumulated savings as collateral . <p> To this end , it is being argued that pension stakeholders in Nigeria should make it possible for retirement savings account ( RSA ) holders to borrow from the scheme to meet specific infrastructure needs . <p> For example a contributor who has N10 million in his RSA and needs N5 million to build a house should be allowed to borrow from his accumulated savings instead of going to the bank to borrow N5 million to build a house at 30 per cent interest rate , or buy a house worth N5 million at N8 million from mortgage institutions . <p> Health insurance as top-up For over two years , PenCom and pension operators in the country have been looking for ways to attract informal sector workers into the contributory pension scheme . Clues were given on how to do this during the summit . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their product offerings . One of such top-ups is the deferred medical cover for retirees . This is because pension schemes generally seek to ensure that retirees are comfortable and the biggest challenge for retirees is health problems . <p> Pension schemes should think of introducing medical and health insurance for contributors when they retire . In Kenya , pension schemes offer deferred medical cover for retirees as top-up , Odundo said . <p> Also , tying provision of community health services for citizens to participation in the contributory pension scheme would go a long way to attract workers in the informal sector into the scheme such that when they contribute , part of their retirement savings is used to pay the premium for the community health insurance . <p> Regulation , ICT and mobile money Stakeholders also made a case for the making of different regulations to address the peculiar needs of workers in various sectors . People who do more of brain work and those who do more of physical and muscular works have different needs in retirement . So designing products along this line would go a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Information and Communications Technology ( ICT ) and the mobile money facility could be deployed in regulating the pension sector , particularly in the area of ensuring that operators create platforms for reaching pensioners wherever they may be resident in retirement . <p> Also digitalised payment of pension and resolving the crisis in the defined benefits schemes could also be done using the ICT . This is also very useful in biometrics too . <p> Related to this is mobile money which has been proved to be useful in transferring money from different individuals across the country for various reasons . This could also be deployed for the collection of pension contributions from people living in remote areas and workers in the informal sector . <p> Pension operators should also collaborate with mobile telephone operators to create a convenient mode for piecemeal contribution for workers in the informal sector . Operators could send their messages across to them using mobile phones and their contributions could be drawn from credits loaded onto their phones . <p> Investment of pension assets in the capital market Contrary to the belief that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of pension assets , workers and retirees for whose sake the scheme was created and some other stakeholders are opposed to the investment of a sizeable portion of accumulated retirement savings in stocks and shares . <p> This position was highlighted by the Governor of Edo State , Mr. Adams Oshiomhole , who likened investment of pension funds in the capital market to pooling the resources of the poor for the benefit of the rich . <p> " It was n't the poverty of government that informed the scheme but poverty of retirees . <p> " There is massive unemployment and serious housing deficit . Why do n't we pull from the system to build houses to avoid a situation where one has to die for his children to reap his sufferings and why has the over N4 trillion not brought down interest rates ? Pension funds need to intervene so that the objectives of the social scheme are not lost , " the governor stressed . <p> Venture capital and private equity Nigerian Workers and retirees are not keen to have their over N4 trillion pension fund invested in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ managers have been toying with this idea in the last three years or so . <p> The lessons from Kenya is that pension funds there do n't look the way of venture capital and private equity funds , they rather lend the fund to workers for housing purposes , using their accumulated savings as collateral for such loans . This could also be replicated in Nigeria ; since it is an initiative the NLC would be very much interested in . <p> Infrastructure tax Many businesses are weighed down by heavy taxes across Africa . This is worsened by multiplicity of taxes in Nigeria . The current tax regime may not work in favour of channeling accumulated pension assets to grow infrastructure as such pension stakeholders would like government to tinker with it to make investment in infrastructure attractive , particularly to pension operators . <p> Governments at all levels should create a distinct tax structure for infrastructure investors and providers . Tax holidays and minimal taxes devoid of double taxation should be created for this critical sector , stakeholders advised . <p> Lacuna in pension law The National Assembly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 2014 that was endorsed by President Goodluck Jonathan about two weeks ago . <p> The Chairman of the National Assembly Joint Committee on Pensions , Senator Aloysius Etok pointed out that the reference to informal sector in the law is abusive and derogatory and suggested that subsequently , it should be addressed as other sectors . <p> He also confessed that lawmakers realised , though belatedly , that the pension law excluded employers , political office holders and political and government appointees from the scheme . <p> These classes of Nigerians should also be part of the contributory pension scheme and contribute from their salaries and wages and even make voluntary contributions into their Retirement Savings Accounts ( RSAs ) to enable them set aside money to fall back on when their tenures expire . <p> Etok advised pension stakeholders to law propose relevant amendments to the new pension law with a view to capturing both employers and public office holders under the contributory pension scheme after months and assured them of the cooperation of the lawmakers in this regard . <p> There is an urgent need for stakeholders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operators , investment and infrastructure providers as well as workers and retirees to continue brainstorming on how best to deploy the ever accumulating pension assets in the country and the Africa in general to provide infrastructure for the people . <p> The challenge of deploying pension assets to infrastructure lies heavily on capacity building . The regulator and operators should build the necessary capacity to enable them develop new products and platforms to make the deployment of pension assets for infrastructural development possible . <p> There is also need to get ideas from various stakeholders and interest groups , raise questions and determine whether the existing scheme is adequate or a combination of pension schemes would be necessary among other things . <p> Please leave your comment below .

@@1881232 <h> Prostitutes take over 1004 , Lekki , Oniru Estates <p> Some highbrow residential areas of Lagos especially estates reserved for the high net worth individuals have all virtually lost their prestige and serenity . This is certainly not just due to the conversion of buildings to business premises but the rate at which homes are being converted to brothels where young ladies are camped to meet the sexual needs of the rich and noble in such neighbourhood . <p> Worst hit by this social malady are the prestigious 1004 estate in Victoria Island , Lekki 1 and 11 as well as Oniru estate also in Lekki area . Investigations by Saturday Sun reveal that several apartments and buildings in these areas have now been taken by pimps and ' investors ' who sublet them to female undergraduates , jobless graduates and even the gainfully employed ladies who pay high rents weekly from monies made from sexual services provided VIPs who live in Ikoyi , VI , VGC and Lekki areas . <p> Findings reveal that pimps or investors , as they would want to be regarded , begin by renting a room self-contained apartment in 1004 , Lekki or Oniru estate , furnish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ensure comfort and then network with some sex racket cartels in the area to supply young ladies who will live there and pay rents to the ' investor ' weekly . <p> In a room apartment , an average of 10 to 15 ladies are usually accommodated depending on the space . Each lady will pay a rent of between N10,000 and N20,000 weekly usually on Sundays depending on the amenities provided in such an apartment . <p> While a room apartment costs the ' investor ' between N1.8 million and N2 million to rent per annum , a two-bedroom apartment costs about N3 million and three-bed room N3.5 million and above . <p> One of the leaders of the sex cartels identified as Deola lives in a three-bedroom apartment in the estate where she has about 10 other ladies living with her . Findings show that the young lady was until recently a student of a private university in Ibadan , Oyo State and presently travels across Europe to ply her trade and also import clothes and jewellery as a cover or official business . <p> Another leader of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room apartment in Oniru estate where she also has about 12 ladies with a live-in young man who serves as the manager of the ' business . ' Beside Oniru estate , Queen also has another apartment in Lekki phase 1 and a three-bedroom flat in Abuja where she lives with about 20 other ladies . She , however , comes to Lagos on special request or as business demands . <p> On how the ladies camped in these apartments are sourced , Queen told Saturday Sun that they come from different sources . " Most of them are undergraduates who want to live big or make quick and easy money . Some are graduates who have no jobs but they have to maintain themselves or raise money for a business . <p> " They come to Lagos or Abuja everyday from the South-East and other parts of the country in their hundreds looking for something to do and where to stay . So , ours is just to provide them shelter and take them to VIPs ' parties or clubs where if they are lucky they can get picked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now run shows on their own while some others have been able to raise enough money to start a business " , she stated . <p> While dismissing any insinuation that what she and others do amount to operating brothels or prostitution , Queen said : " I wo n't agree that it is prostitution because people still stay in their homes and do worse things . For instance , I once lived in such an apartment paying someone rent until God opened the way for me and I was able to rent my own place and today I have more than three apartments in Lagos and Abuja bringing money for me and by the grace of God , I will soon buy my own house because it is a clean business . " <p> Saturday Sun further gathered that while some ' heavy investors ' now take a full house in Lekki and Oniru to run the business , some landlords in the area , who have got wind of the lucrative nature of the business , are now ejecting their regular tenants who pay rents only once a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Funmi , who leads a cartel from her rented apartment located off Admiralty way in Lekki phase 1 , told Saturday Sun that " to convince you that it is a legitimate business , the landlord of the building where my friend lives about two streets from here has ejected all other tenants in the compound and everyone you find in that house now are ladies who pay him weekly . What it means is that he now takes his whole annual rent before in just a month now , which is better . " <p> On how they avoid falling into the hands of law enforcement agents , she said : " The ladies are usually well behaved because most of them are either graduates or undergraduates and they would n't want to do anything that will expose them to ridicule . To show you that there is nothing illegal , we invite the police in Lekki division to throw out anyone making troubles or who refuses to pay rent after the Sunday pay day . " <p> She added : " Apart from young ladies who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the working class because some live on the mainland and work on the island , so to cut cost of transportation , they prefer staying with us while some whose parents do n't allow men to visit them or go out also seize the opportunity to free themselves and do what they want to do . " <p> How do the sex hawkers gather enough money to pay between N10,000 and N20,000 weekly in addition to feeding and maintaining themselves ? Funmi explained that all that money could be made in a day because " their targets or dates are VIPs who can afford to give them as much as N50,000 or N100,000 for a night . In fact , when we attend VIPs parties , some get paid in dollars to the tune of $2000 or $5000 while others who have no men to pick them sometimes get $500 as ' thanks for coming ' <p> " Which work will someone do to get such remuneration in Nigeria today even in a month ? " <p> To cover their tracks and protect their family name , Saturday Sun gathered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cards identifying them as CEO of Interior Decoration companies or owners of non-existing boutiques . Those that are not undergraduates are also presented by pimps to their VIP clients as London or US-based . <p> " The reason we introduce some of the girls as people who just came from London , US or South Africa is that the VIPs love paying them more or with foreign currency " , Funmi explained . <p> It was also learnt that while some landlords in the area have bought into the business , others have no knowledge of what their premises are used for . " Some landlords are strict and would n't want more than one or two persons in their apartment but we manage to avoid the trouble of such landlords because the ladies we take in are decent people who will not attract any negative attention . Those who are students go to school during the day , while the jobless ones sleep indoor all day " , Queen explained . <p> She added that weekends are usually the busiest for the sex hawkers , some of who may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes , weekends are better for them because that 's when most of the VIPs come for functions in Lagos and for those around here , that 's also the time they hang out and will need a different treatment from what they get at home " , she added laughing . <p> Further findings by Saturday Sun reveal that the sex hawkers chose to set up their business in 1004 estate , Lekki and Oniru because of their status as some of the most expensive estates on the Island which can only be afforded by the rich and high net worth individuals . <p> " You know staying in 1004 or Lekki is a status symbol and any man who picks or drops you off in front of your apartment there will know that you 're not a poor or cheap girl . Big men value big babes too and pay more to keep or maintain relationships with them . That is why babes are running away from Ikeja or mainland generally towards this side because a guy will want to give an ikeja babe N20,000 after a date @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be finer will be going home with N50,000 or more for a date . It is all about packaging " , Amaka who is a student of a state owned university in South West and leader of a cartel in 1004 where her VIP man friend maintains a two bed apartment for her explained . <p> Beside this , the proximity of 1004 estate and the others to where their VIP customers live is another factor that determines where the ladies get accommodation . It was gathered that virtually every of the ladies or their camps have reliable drivers who drive unpainted cabs on their payroll and as such can call them up any time in the night where there is a need to provide service . <p> " Most babes prefer this axis because it is central and our cab men will access you within minutes of calling them any time of the night .

The rabid consumption of codeine has not only driven the cost of the drug high on the counter , it is hardly available because of the demand for doctors prescription by some pharmacy stores . <p> A quick way out of the scarcity of codeine is their resort to Indian hemp which is not only available in large quantity but far cheaper . Investigations reveal that suppliers of the weed also called marijuana now package them in the small dispensing envelopes sold at N500 per sachet .

@@1884231 <h> 2015 : The challenges of Jonathan <p> By CHIOMA GABRIEL WHen the Chairman , PDP Board of Trustees ( BOT ) , Chief Tony Anenih last week announced in Calabar that President Goodluck Jonathan would contest the presidential election in 2015 on the platform of his party , many were not surprised . It was an open secret . <p> But others wondered if Anenih considered the many issues that could cause obstruction to Jonathan 's re-election bid . From Boko Haram , to the kidnap of Chibok girls , molehill of alleged corruption , some of the issues surrounding the Jonathan administration are as strong as death . <p> President Jonathan <p> At every point since he enthronement even as acting president , President Jonathan seems to have had one challenge or controversy almost always around him . <p> Remarkably , his administration has now been adjudged in some quarters as the weakest and the most challenged in the history of the country . <p> It is thus not surprising that the opposition has since its advent played up the negatives of the administration focusing on major sore points of the administration as insecurity , poor infrastructure and unemployment . The last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explode in no distant time as more graduates are being churned out of tertiary institutions annually without any hope of profitable engagement . <p> Meddlesome opposition <p> The APC has persistently painted the administration as one that swam in corruption and lacked self-respect noting that its foot soldiers were people who had been shown to have been indicted for corruption . <p> For instance , when Dr. Okupe claimed government will generate 780,000 jobs through the ' Young Graduate Employment Scheme ' and 5,000 jobs in each of the 36 states through SURE-P , opposition advised the teeming young graduates who have no jobs not to allow themselves to be hoodwinked by this promise , advising them to remember that this same administration promised to create 10,000 jobs in each of the 36 states through SURE-P in the past but could n't do so . <p> Jonathan severally got knocks on every issue ranging from security , conflicts , politics , governance , infrastructure and the opposition which threatened to make Nigeria ungovernable and made good their threat recently threatened to form a parallel government should Jonathan win 2015 presidential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that has affected the Jonathan administration more , it is the insecurity situation in the country . Since 2010 , the Nigerian nation has almost on a daily basis experienced violations to life and property in the hands of the Islamic Boko Haram sect . <p> While some people believe that the insurgency is a result of social , religious , economic , and political imbroglio , the agenda of the insurgency in Nigeria is turning into a mystery . It had claimed to be anti-west and focused on the establishment of Islamic rule . <p> Nigerians , especially majority of Christians and even some Muslims who were of the view that Boko Haram represented an Islamic agenda had challenged devout Muslims to find means of curbing the nefarious activities of the sect that that has portrayed Islam in bad light . <p> But it is increasingly becoming clearer to Nigerians and the international community that Boko Haram was just a criminal gang using the name of Islam to perpetuate evil . <p> The bombings and killings in the north have degenerated over the years to the point of kidnapping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gwoza by the terrorists . Nigerians are waiting to see how government translates its promises to secure their lives , meet its promises of increased power supply , implement its job creation strategies , reconstruct the nation 's landscape for better transportation , and boosts agricultural production for a better nourished populace . <p> Thousands of people have been killed in terror attacks in the North since the insurgents came on board . <p> Kidnap of Chibok girls <p> This is perhaps , the greatest tragedy of the Jonathan administration . The abduction of about 300 Chibok school girls and the subsequent inability to rescue them have continued to generate outrage both at home and abroad . This is distasteful news to a country where , already , 10.5 million children of school age are out of school , and where no more than four per cent of girls in the North-East of Nigeria ever manage to complete secondary school . <p> Protests have come and died but the problem is beyond what money can buy . There is no alternative to life and compensating the parents of the girls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are still alive and can be rescued . <p> The worst part of the story is that despite assistance by the international community , nothing has come out of it . <p> Recently , the Northern Elders Forum ( NEF ) advised President Jonathan to forget his re-election in 2015 if the abducted schoolgirls are not released before the end of October . <p> The forum alleged that the frequent communal clashes in the north were engineered to weaken the region politically and economically as a way to exploit such weaknesses for electoral benefits in 2015 . <p> The NEF in a statement signed by two members of the forum , Mr. Solomon Dalung and Dr. Hakeem Baba Ahmed , had accused the presidency of lacking the will to fight insurgency even as it decried the deep-seated corruption and incompetence in the country , which it said has " allowed a band of terrorists to take and hold vast parts of our land and population hostage , while every citizen lives in fear that they will be its next victim . The security situation in our nation today represents the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our entire history . <p> Consistent identity <p> " The reality is that the threat posed by what appears to be an insurgency that has many manifestations and defies a clear and consistent identity is growing due to the absence of a clear national consensus over its nature and its solutions . <p> " In the light of our firm conviction that the insurgency and related security challenges pose a threat to the 2015 elections and the survival of our nation , we strongly advise President Goodluck Ebele Jonathan to bring an end to the insurgency in all its manifestations and produce the Chibok girls before the end of October , 2014 . The circumstances under which our fellow citizens in and around Gwoza in Borno State in particular live and die will not be tolerated by any people who have a government and a leader who swore to defend them , and they must be reversed immediately . <p> " If President Jonathan fails to do this , Nigerians will be left with the only conclusion that he has forfeited his right to ask for our mandate beyond 2015 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free and fair . This means that any threat which may provide a cover for militarising the electoral process must be eliminated before the elections . Every part of Nigeria must participate in these elections , and no citizen should be deprived of his or her right to vote under any excuse , " the forum said . <p> Rotation of power <p> As 2015 general elections draw closer , the fact that the " North " is strongly opposed to Jonathan 's 2015 presidential ambition is becoming more vehement . The actions and inaction of those who claim to represent and speak for the north have become more glaring to political observers . So many voices are rising from the north in the bid to stop Jonathan 's ambition for 2015 . <p> To these northerners , Jonathan by the doctrine of necessity has served Yar ' Adua 's two-term in office and contesting another term would be a third . For the North the strident opposition to Jonathan 's re-election could backfire and garner more support for Jonathan from the south . <p> His Patience <p> Behind every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man encounters in his life time , a woman somewhere must have played a major role . Anywhere Jonathan 's success story is told , Dame Patience will be featured prominently . She is part of his success story and part of his problems . She is his asset as well as his problem . There is nothing Nigerians have not used Dame Patience Jonathan , the beautiful wife of the president 's name to do . Cartoonists , comedians , political critics have found in her a viable weapon both for their jokes and against her husband 's government . The issue is , Dame Jonathan does not appear to understand when to lend a hand to her husband and when to stand aside . But what she did well or should n't have done was with good intent . Unfortunately , Dame Patience Jonathan has not learnt lessons from some of her careless outbursts . And her assistants perhaps contributed to the problem by not advising her that sometimes , silence is golden . @ @ @ @ @ @

@@1884235 <h> Regular Washing Of Hands Can Save You From Ebola Virus <p> Since the outbreak of the deadly Ebola Virus Disease ( EVD ) in some West African countries , particularly the death of its first Nigerian victim last week , the need for everyone to exercise utmost care to avoid contacting the disease should not be over stressed . WINIFRED OGBEBO , in this piece , talks about how simple hand washing can save people from contacting the virus . <p> We are no doubt in a season of the deadly Ebola virus , which has taken out almost 1000 lives since its outbreak in the three West African nations of Guinea , Sierra Leone and Liberia a couple of weeks ago . It claimed its first Nigerian victim last week . As the world braces up to the reality of this disease , do you know that there are simple , easy , cost effective measures that could save one from it and indeed a number of other infectious diseases ? <p> There is an abundance of evidence showing the critical importance of hygiene behaviour in reducing sanitation-related sicknesses and death . <p> The call for regular hand washing has re-echoed following @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the main medical purpose of washing hands is to cleanse them of pathogens ( including bacteria or viruses ) and chemicals which can cause personal harm or diseases . This is especially important for people who handle food or work in the medical field and indeed everybody . <p> A medical doctor , Nelvin Eze , said , " people can become infected with respiratory illnesses such as influenza or the common cold , for example , if they do n't wash their hands before touching their eyes , nose or mouth . " <p> The Centre for Disease Control and Prevention said " one of the most important measures for preventing the spread of pathogens is effective hand washing . This hygienic behaviour has been shown to significantly reduce the incidence of child deaths from diarrhoea ( the second leading cause of child deaths ) by almost half and from pneumonia ( the leading cause of child deaths ) by one-quarter which together are responsible for approximately 3.5 million child deaths every year . " <p> By washing hands with soap , families and communities can help reduce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cent . " <p> The chief medical director of University of Uyo Teaching Hospital ( UUTH ) and an expert in Internal Medicine , Prof. Etete Peters , said people could live healthy by adopting the universal protective method , so as to prevent contacting the deadly disease . <p> He said hand washing with soap , particularly after using the toilet and before eating , could significantly impact health , survival , child mortality , and help reduce poverty . <p> To ensure that the hand wash campaign reaches the grassroots across the country , the federal government , two years , ago flagged off the crusade in six tertiary hospitals selected from each geo-political zones of the federation . <p> Speaking at the one-day international event campaign on the need for habitual hand washing in Abuja , with the theme ' Promoting hand hygiene , protecting national health and improving productivity , ' the Health Minister , Prof. Onyebuchi Chukwu , said over 50 per cent of deaths in Africa and 31 percent of death in South-East Asia were caused by infections . <p> According to him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caused in Europe means that the Europeans are used to hygiene while the developing nations are battling to reduce their rate of infections . <p> " We live in a challenging era of numerous emerging communicable diseases with the potentials of causing high morbidity and mortality in human . The prevalence of these deadly diseases which results from poor hygiene can be drastically minimized through proper hygiene , " the minister added . <p> Speaking at the event , an American physician , Joyce Hightower , noted that dirty hands are as harmful as any disease anyone might be infected with . <p> According to her , failure by many people to wash their hands moments after they had contact with substances , use lavatory , or expose such hands to intangible things often lead to avoidable infections , which she said , could also be compounded at clinics when health providers too do not imbibe the habit of keeping their hands clean before administering medics on their patients .

@@1884236 <p> The essence of good governance is to effectively lead and guide the instruments of the State to meet the needs of citizens , effectively balancing present needs while anticipating future trends . The ability to optimally achieve these balances is what defines good governance . <p> by Mohammed Dasuki SamboAug 10 , 2014 <p> The essence of good governance is to effectively lead and guide the instruments of the State to meet the needs of citizens , effectively balancing present needs while anticipating future trends . The ability to optimally achieve these balances is what defines good governance . <p> If good governance is difficult to achieve under normal conditions , it is even more difficult today in Africa with the advent of global terrorism and insurgency . In this paper , I intend to show how much more complex it has become in the post-modern era of instability to deliver good governance . I will also offer some examples of how we in Nigeria are trying to accelerate our effectiveness under highly complex circumstances . <p> Basic Challenge in Governance <p> It is important first to understand the very basic challenge of governance in a developing country . The needs and aspirations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needed to balance various interests while focusing on the key goal of accelerating prosperity . Today , Africa is fast approaching a situation where coups and dictatorships will be things of the past . This means that leaders must now earn their legitimacies by delivering on the complex and often competing needs of citizens . The subtleties of this complex situation need to be clearly understood by scholars whose insights and knowledge are critical in shaping our understanding of good governance . This is one of the reasons why I am excited to be here at this conference being organized by Huhu Group and the Radcliffe Institute at Harvard University , which has a reputation for being at the forefront of science and knowledge on good governance . <p> Governance in the Post-Modern Era <p> Let me expansiate on some of the new challenges in governance in the post-modern age . The post-modern age , brought about by rapid advances in the development and use of information and telecommunication technology , has dramatically changed the notion of effective leadership and the implications of ineffective governance . On one hand , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the well-educated and talented knowledge workers , but this leaves a large and growing proportion of the population with unmet aspirations impatient for change . <p> This has not only increased the pressure on governments to provide better services to their citizens , it has also increased the need for accountability and transparency . Global , regional and national imbalances in access to healthcare , job opportunities , education , housing and justice are now more readily perceived , creating dissonance and heightening feelings of personal insecurity . Leaders can no longer easily get away with ignoring the needs of the masses , although those needs have become a lot more difficult to balance . Again , this is particularly important in Africa where many feel insecure ; where past neglect of the people is providing spaces where discontent flourishes ; which insurgents exploit to challenge constituted authority . <p> The absence of good governance is regarded by the World Bank as the most important , if not the sole cause of Africa 's under development . One of the lessons from the Middle-East and North African countries ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ governance can easily lead to regime change . A key challenge is therefore how to govern in ways that ensure the masses feel secure and committed in order to maintain peace and stability . Leaders today must utilize resources and structures within and outside their governance domain to ensure a solid foundation for society 's advancement . <p> Let me use Nigeria as a case study to further support my point . In Nigeria , decades of truncated democracy following serial Military coups led to deficits in multiple areas of governance . The return to long-term democracy , beginning in 1999 , afforded us the opportunity to begin rebuilding our governance institutions and institute long needed reforms in the areas of education , health , science , technology , infrastructure , conduct of elections , justice sector reforms , human rights , socio-economic development and national security . President Jonathan 's Transformation agenda was founded on the need to address long-standing grievances related to governance , as well as the recognition of the role of economic advancement in national security . <p> While the government races to meet huge demands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sustainable and uninterrupted electricity supply , potable water for all , motorable roads , and modern rail transport systems , it must fight corruption , build a cadre of committed civil servants , legitimately reward such servants and institutionalize new values and cultures . Government must also build the generational capacity of experts to design and maintain the structures being built . Systems must be strengthened , in federal states such as the one Nigeria operates , and the states and local government authorities must be empowered to effectively take on responsibilities that are constitutionally theirs . My point here is that the challenge , especially of national governance , has become more complex , but leaders must find ways of handling these complexities . <p> To meet the demands of a population in excess of 160 million , the majority of whom are under the age of thirty-five , the government must be able to generate and expend huge resources that transcend our historic reliance on a single source of national revenue , namely oil . We have begun to accelerate our support for entrepreneurship to create the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ schemes to retool the skillset of citizens to allow them to benefit from economic opportunities created by new entrepreneurs . Recognizing the potential of the telecommunications sector to create new enterprise opportunities for the masses , we are accelerating its connectivity to real sectors , while exploring ways to improve market efficiency in the oil and gas sector . Another example is the textile sector whose viability has been challenged by the dynamics of the global economy . To revitalize this sector , we must not only revive its global competitiveness , but do so while enhancing its ability to employ people . <p> The government is also laying down policies that would allow us to internalize some of the economic opportunities that we previously outsourced . Recent reforms in industrial policy have been implemented in the automobile industry where Nigeria 's demand is large and growing but where domestic capacity to produce has been limited . In agriculture , through changes in the tariff structure , investments in modern inputs such as fertilizer and improved seed varieties , and the introduction of strategies to build the rice value chain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , despite cries by powerful importers for a return to an environment of low tariffs and high foreign import reliance . I highlight the above to support my earlier argument that in the post-modern world , tough choices must be made , but the public , in its balance , must understand and support those changes . <p> It is important to highlight the fact that real accomplishments must continually be pursued and achieved while leadership must drive effective institutional change to secure and backstop such accomplishments . This is akin to the challenge of remaining in the driver 's seat to drive real progress while ensuring that the institutional and other frameworks that are needed are being put in place . The phrase , " changing the wheels on a moving car " correctly depicts the challenge of governance , especially in an environment where there is no alternative but to drive ahead . <p> Ladies and gentlemen , all the efforts of government can only be achieved if there is peace . The ongoing antics of the Jamaatu Ahlis Sunna Liddaawati Wal Jihad commonly known as Boko Haram @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not only to dismantle democratic structures , but to prevent the provision of state services , such as health , education , commerce and security . Their activities have forced thousands to flee their homes , jobs and communities , pushing them into poverty . It is therefore important to understand the effects of insurgency on governance and the additional challenges that leaders face in striving to deliver on their promises to citizens . I will highlight this issue next . <p> Effects of Insurgency on Governance <p> Before I go into what we have done in Nigeria to counter the Boko Haram insurgency , we need to take a quick look at the effects of insurgency on governance in the last few years . One very glaring consequence of insurgency was that all other governance issues became subordinate to security considerations . This consumed both time and energy on the part of the general public and the government in particular . A central casualty of the insurgency was that government had to divert scarce resources that could better support development needs to security issues . <p> Prior to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were mainly interested in governance issues , as it relates to corruption , followed by concern about the conduct of free , fair and credible elections . However , currently , the pressure on Nigeria and the main focus of foreign intervention , especially from foreign governments is how to tackle insurgency . Assistance from donor countries is slowly shifting from economic issues to security issues which necessitates that the relationship between Nigeria and many countries , including her neighbors , which used to be dominated by trade and technical cooperation have been replaced by security considerations . The changes I just described are non-trivial . The ability to adapt to this new environment while staying focused on real gains will be key to government 's success . <p> The insurgency has re-shaped and redefined the classification of Nigeria in many peoples ' minds all over the world . The country 's name is now being mentioned along with those of other countries that have had long standing terrorism challenges . Ordinary Nigerians have also redefined their views of the security situation in the country . Issues that used to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past , such as armed robbery and kidnapping have been downgraded given the scale of destruction and devastation caused by Boko Haram 's indiscriminate targeting of civilians . <p> Government Efforts at Tackling Insurgency <p> I wish to catalogue here efforts made so far to deal with the insurgency . Terrorism has come with both challenges and opportunities . It has enabled us to change our laws , rebuild our institutions , and create platforms for greater coordination and cooperation within and across agencies tasked with security . Additionally we have developed avenues that allow us to synergize our efforts and work more collaboratively with the civil society . In short we have devised a national security model that is inclusive , premised on the provision , of peace , security and development , through a whole of society approach . It is important to remember that all these changes have happened in the span of a few years since the start of Boko Haram 's virile attacks , but they often go unnoticed . <p> When we started to deal with the Boko Haram threat , our laws were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Terrorism Prevention ( Amendment ) Act 2013 , significant progress has been made . It has allowed us to not only define terrorism , but block avenues of financing for their activities while putting in place structures to deal with our current threats . This has included the establishment of a Counter terrorism Centre and , working with key stakeholders , we have developed a National Counter Terrorism Strategy ( NACTEST ) . The NACTEST is new and is the first major attempt by the government of Nigeria to holistically address the terror attacks that are being perpetrated by violent extremists . As a sub-set of the overarching National Security Strategy , it holds a strong promise for Nigerians and seeks to re-engage a stakeholder population that is losing or may have lost faith in ongoing efforts aimed at addressing threats . The strategy explains what organizations and individuals can do to help in its implementation in order to reduce the risks and ensure that people go about their lives freely and with confidence . <p> The NACTEST is organized around five streams , each with key objectives and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supporting attacks . SECURE ; strengthen protection capacity against terrorist attacks . IDENIFY ; pre-empt through detection , early warning and ensuring that terrorist acts are properly investigated . PREPARE ; to mitigate the impact of terrorist attacks by building resilience and IMPLEMENT ; a framework for the mobilization of a coordinate cross government effort . Seventeen ( 17 ) Federal ministries and Twenty Seven ( 27 ) departments and agencies are involved in the implementation of the strategy . My office has developed a benchmarking framework for the evaluation of the implementation of NACTEST in the following key areas : <p> a ) Respect for International Human Rights and the rule of law <p> b ) Successful prosecution of violent extremist offenders <p> c ) Capacity building of all institutions including the Criminal Justice System <p> d ) Public participation and consciousness in preventing terrorism <p> In order to achieve the objectives of NACTEST , prevent radicalization and build community resilience we designed a Soft Approach to counter-terrorism which has resulted in Nigeria 's Countering Violent Extremism Program involving local governments , state governments , civil society organizations and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and implementation of a prison based de radicalization program for convicted terrorists as well as terror suspects awaiting trial . We are building new skills in psychology , religious dialogue , counselling , art and sports therapy , educational and vocational training through a dedicated prison team . Our objective is to reform , rehabilitate and prepare violent extremist offenders for a possible re-entry into society . Secondly , we are piloting a counter radicalization program with special emphasis on community engagement and resilience building . Through peace initiatives , community outreach , engagement with youth , women and the religious environment , conflict resolution mechanisms , early warning systems and empowering critical stakeholders , we seek to raise awareness and unite Nigerians against violent extremism . We are also working to restore communal living in our towns and cities through purpose built community centers where our youth can go to learn new skills , vocations , arts and sports and absorb the cultural diversity we are known for . <p> Further to this , the threat that we face has drawn our attention to the need to overhaul our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that does not currently serve our security , political and economic interests and as we revisit our national security policy , education has remained a top priority . <p> While we grapple with education reform to ensure the right kind of education is available for all , the recent abduction of girls from their school in Chibok has compelled us to place the protection of schools high on our national security agenda . To that end working with international partners we have developed a safe schools project aimed at securing our schools , making them safe zones where students and teachers can learn without fear and in dignity . <p> Thirdly we are working to build the capacity of our institutions to communicate our policies better , guided by our national values . This will have a lasting influence on governance and political culture , resulting in a more open society where government and people work in trust towards peace , security and development . <p> Governance in times of insurgency presents a challenge to economic progress where development is arrested because of the absence of peace . Based on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terrorism and global best practices that seek to address these conditions , we worked with the Governors of the six North Eastern states of Nigeria to design an economic revitalization program targeted towards the states most affected by terrorism . Working with various stakeholders , we are currently designing a regional economic revitalization plan following the President 's directive in December , 2013 . The plan will serve as the foundation for a federal- state partnership to revitalize the region 's economy through the Presidential Initiative for the North-East ( PINE ) . <p> The inter-ministerial ; committee that is driving PINE has developed a short-term strategy called " the Emergency Assistance and Economic Stabilization ( EA-ES ) program " . This program , with a 24-months time frame , will cater to over 1 million people or 150,000 households . The EA-ES will provide food and non-food relief material ; medicines ; support to the elderly , widows and malnourished children ; and rapid and mobile medical assistance . It will also fast-track stalled federal projects in intervention-ready communities and employ 150,000 youth through its Productive Works program . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asset-based economic development approach . The Presidential Initiative for the North-East , is already mobilizing relief materials to be distributed to individuals and communities adversely affected by violence . <p> To defeat terrorism , we can not leave anyone behind . We can not allow ungoverned spaces and everyone must act responsibly in their sphere of authority . As a federation , doing this requires government actions at both national and sub-national levels . Local governments , which are closest to the people , must be re-focused on the important issues of good governance . Working with traditional institutions , community based organizations and the police , local governments must be proactive in building community resilience and good governance . It is time we leverage on our democratic processes to increase access to decision making for a majority of our citizens . Inclusive , non-discriminatory and participatory governance is more likely to detect discontent before it erupts . The goal of politics must be to lift our people out of poverty and provide them with the enabling environment to compete favorably . This may not eliminate the possibility of misguided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will address some of the underlying factors leading to recruitment into groups prone to violent extremism . <p> We must also address environmental pressure from climate change that results in increased competition for limited natural resources , leading to increased herdsmen , farmer conflicts , inter-ethnic and communal clashes . The youth bulge is both a challenge and an opportunity which the federal government has recognized and initiated programs to increase job opportunities . <p> Insurgents seek to force fundamental changes on society , operating with impunity ; they violate all decent human values in an effort to draw a commensurate response from authorities . Terrorists win when states respond to their attacks in ways that are incompatible with their values . We are conscious that in keeping our country safe we must abide by international human rights norms that place the protection of civilians as a major priority . To that end we have embarked on a series of human rights training for our armed forces , designed new rules of engagement that upholds the responsibility to protect civilians in the prosecution of our anti terror campaign . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have committed human rights violations are prosecuted and held up as examples to others . <p> We are confident that our governance approach to countering insurgency addresses the links between peace , security , development , rule of law and respect for human rights . These are the right priorities and we are taking careful but sure steps to build the right foundations , the right institutions and skills that would give us the leverage to secure lives and property , and to defeat terrorism . This might take time but like most countries of the world that emerged stronger from conflicts , Nigeria is on the path to a safer nation built on the right values . <p> I highlighted Nigeria 's efforts in order to convey three things . First , insurgency creates a difficult environment for progress , but such progress is one of the key tools for fighting insurgency . Second , in an insurgency environment , one must rely on existing infrastructure to deliver while simultaneously working to rebuild new infrastructure . This applies not only to traditional security and defense agencies , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , an insurgency environment challenges leadership , but also demands governance that can function in a rapidly changing and complex environment .

Reports have it that the man came crawling back years later begging for forgiveness and seeking for love from both Genevieve and the daughter he abandoned . <p> Genevieve Nnaji was that young girl of seventeen who after some flings of sexual immorality , discovered , about four months later that she was pregnant . <p> According to her interview with a news medium years back , it took her mother seven months to discover that her daughter was pregnant . According to Genevieve " The pregnancy was seven months gone before my Catholic mum discovered it . She could n't believe it , " How can she be pregnant when she was " very careful " according to her still remain a mystery to her till date . When a test confirmed it , her parents were disappointed but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel anything . I did n't even know till I was about four months . It was there , but I was still in shock .

My parents reacted the way any parent would react -- disappointed . I did n't know . My mother discovered it for me . I did n't know anything really .

So , you either correct your mistake by doing the right thing . If I was pregnant , and then have an abortion , it would have been like murder after fornication ! So , that was basically wrong . " <p> Genevieve with the scolding , rebuke , as well as resignation to fate of her parents , was able to rise up to become a shining star in Nigeria 's contemporary film industry . Genevieve rose beyond the heartbreaking disappointment of irresponsible men , taunts of friends , condemnation of close family acquaintances , and disillusioned remarks from church members , to occupy an enviable place in the annals of the entertainment industry in Nigeria . The Abor-Mbaise , Imo State born actress from a middle class parent comprising a banker dad and a teacher mum made news between 1998 and 2002 when she became the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Since then she has won awards both locally and internationally and is being adjudged as the most popular actress in Nigeria . She is the most celebrated actress in Nigeria and had gotten rare reviews in international magazines and news media . She is however not new to acting , having featured in the then poplar soap opera " Ripples " from when she was eight . <p> This is where the audacity of hope young Genevieve came in . Everyone has one sad tale or the other to tell in life . While some are self inflicted , others are as a result of the deceptions and wickedness of men . It is easy to condemn a girl put in a family way by an irresponsible randy man , not man enough to own up to responsibility . While for some it is unwanted pregnancy , for others it is a divorced marriage and yet for others it is childlessness in marriage . Rape , early widowhood also carries great disillusionment . Some have been jobless for more than usual time and everybody in the neighborhood adjudged them lazy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the neighborhood was attributed to them . That in itself cases self depression and low self esteem . Some were battered in a failed marriage and everyone attributed the crashed union to them . People make mistakes in life and it is expected that the next person who cares helps the fallen to stand . However , where nobody is willing to help , one must rise up , shrug off the disappointments and look up to God for a new beginning and surely with help from above , one is assured of a glorious bounce back . <p> A girl I came to know of in the year around 2007 was faced with a somewhat similar situation with our own Genevieve . This girl , a graduate of University of Jos by name Glory was betrothed to a man who refused to cut off ties with old girlfriend and after traditional marital rites began , the former lady resurfaced and the new one was abandoned with eight month old pregnancy . This girl from a decent Assemblies of God Church background , after traditional marriage , did not wait @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in pregnancy . The man abandoned Glory , after some domestic manhandling and she was forced to live with her brother to deliver the baby . With the help of highly understanding brother and equally understanding brother 's wife , she was shielded from a taunting mother . Also with the input of understanding gospel ministers and pastors God brought around her , Glory was able to pick up her life again with her lovely daughter and moved from jobless to a petty sales girl to a clerk in a construction site to an accounts officer in a thriving Bureau De Change and Micro finance Bank . In 2012 , a man from Port Harcourt came and snatched her in holy matrimony . This homely and intelligent young girl in early twenties with lots of acumen upstairs would have been rubbished by an irresponsible man . <p> Another Lady by name Favour lost her pastor husband few months into the marriage in 1999 or so , then she was a student of Enugu State University of Science and Technology ( ESUT ) . Though men wrote off the young widow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she put behind the widowhood , put her trust in God and became fervent in her church activities in Winners Chapel . Her good nature attracted some young suitors from where she prayerfully chose a handsome young man who accepted her with the son from the previous marriage . Both have been happily married since 2012 with three more lovely kids . Favour has helped lots of women having challenges in their marriage to find their footings , restoring peace to broken homes . Thus the devil that wanted to destroy he destinies of Glory and Favour failed woefully . <p> In contrast , a sad situation confronted me as I was stepping out of a commercial bank in , Abuja sometime around 2011 . A girl who in my estimate can not be more than 16 years of age and carrying a baby which appears slightly above one year plus accosted me . Both the girl and the baby looked unkept , tardy and distressed . This girl asked me for financial assistance so that she can go back to Umuahia , in Abia State and beg her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with her Akure born runaway boyfriend had failed . This girl whose parent according to what she told me , were staunch Christians , was impregnated by an Akure man who came to Umuahia to do a sub-contract job with a firm . This man denied the pregnancy and as the contract was over he absconded from Umuahia . The parents of the girl were informed months later that the man currently owns and drives a taxi in Abuja and they threw their daughter and the son out of the house , asking her to locate the boy 's father and marry him . According to her brief narrative , she came to Abuja to seek for her son 's father turned taxi driver but the man refused to be seen . All her efforts to locate him met brick walls and the man who should help locate the runaway friend was playing hide and seek , probably on the instructions of the taxi driver . <p> Having been toyed by her man 's friends for some weeks , sleeping in dangerous places with a baby boy , the distraught @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own words ' ' beg my father and mother to forgive and accept me back ' ' . I assisted her with some thousands of naira and she embarrassingly knelt down on the kerb on a busy Gwarimpa Estate road in thanksgiving for my kind gesture , not minding that passers by were equally embarrassed . I hastily disappeared from the scene , pondering over her impoverished and pitiable her situation that a few thousands of naira could bring such relief . <p> The world is full of mistakes , and people fall into all manners of traps that bring regrets , embarrassments , denials and stigmatization . The devil uses such to keep lots of people in bondage , destroys destinies and ushers in life of regrets . Irresponsible men , women , cultures , norms , government and policies have brought untoward embarrassment , pain , sorrow and damages to people but one must decide not to allow such blur a glorious future . <p> The Bible states " Brethren , I count not myself to have apprehended : but this one thing I do , forgetting those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things which are before , I press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus . " ( Philippians 3:13-14 ) I counsel those who found themselves in any situation that has brought some form of embarrassment , pain , depression , shame and stigmatization to take the advice of the Scripture , ask for forgiveness , forgive oneself , forget the past and move on with life . Parents , friends , family members , church members and colleagues must not hesitate to help out after initial corrective outbursts . All dogs eat shit , but the dog that carries shit in the mouth is easily identified as the shit consumer , so says a Biafra proverb , therefore , beyond the compulsory initial condemnations , where necessary , those at the receiving end of irresponsible men , women and cultural practices needs all the support they can get . Where the support is not coming , the affected must not condemn self . Jesus said to that adulterous woman ' ' Neither do I condemn thee : go , and sin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be our attitude . <p> Genevieve Nnaji is a classic example of how a young girl refused to give up in herself , and with the support of disciplined but understanding parents , was able to overcome a painful past and forge on unto glory . She is the face of hope from hopeless situations . She overcame psychological , emotional and intellectual trauma to land herself a glorious future . Genevieve had shown that with God on one 's side and with audacity of hope , a great testimony could come out of life 's worst depressing moment .

@@1884240 <h> A Review of Biyi Bandele 's Half of a Yellow Sun <p> Very few notable works of Nigerian authors have successfully made a transition into cinemas . Chinua Achebe 's " Things Fall Apart " comes to mind as it made a transition to television in the late 1980 's and had relative success as a television drama . Now comes the film of Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie 's 2006 novel -- Half of a yellow sun . Directed by rookie writer director , Biyi Bandele , the movie tells a tale of lives in Nigeria driven apart by the 1960 's Biafra war . <p> The film has an appropriate cast : Chiwetel Ejiofor as Odenigbo otherwise known as the " revolutionary " interprets his role as a conceited and strong headed academic well . Thandie Newton is impressive as the Heroine Olanna who must transform from an upper class society lady to a ranching domestic woman . <p> However , some of the actors were not convincing enough in their performance .

More so , it is evident the director holds back on the violence so as not to unsettle the audience which inadvertently makes it seem the director is less interested in the politics and more interested in the romantic conflicts . <p> By so doing , a mismatch is created between the movie 's enormous scope and how people identify with it .

He had a great marriage but at one point in time he cut it off and left his home , few years later he died . He even died some days to when he was supposed to return home to my mother .

It was at the point where he was trying to get back to his wife that he died in 1982 . I never knew what it was like to be a child because my father never treated me like one .

Even when he left my mum at Ife and was at Ibadan , I used to go to Ibadan every weekend . <p> " My relationship with him blossomed till he died .

My mum remained a professor at Ife . My mum was one of those amazing human beings that you can ever imagine . I can not tell you how she did it but you can be such that it was God that helped her . And the most difficult part was that watching a man you of loved die in your hands . By the time my father was dying , my mum was right there . He died with his heads in her hands .

We should not have allowed him to go into the hands of the devourer . He used to tell me , do n't worry it is all going to be alright . Meaning that we are all coming back as family . I could see that he always wanted to go back home . His death was one of the most difficult things I had to overcome . <p> " My mum had traveled on sabbatical to Belgium and at one point my father was passing through Belgium .

@@1889237 <h> 2015 : The exodus of APGA lawmakers and the war within <p> They may not have been the leading opposition but they were a bunch that could bite . And they did when occasion demanded it as their number fetched them a place in the mainstream opposition . <p> But as far as the 7th assembly of the House of Representatives is concerned , they are no more because their number has been pruned to two out of seven persons who gave their political party a national significance at the dawn of the present dispensation in 2011 . <p> This is the situation with All Progressive Grand Alliance , APGA , at the moment . The party 's numerical fortunes in the House began to dwindle in September , 2013 when , in one fell swoop , some 37 lawmakers from the ruling Peoples Democratic Party , PDP , defected to the opposition All Progressive Congress , APC . <p> Ordinarily , nothing in the development was of any concern to the APGA lawmakers . This is according to some analysts , but for seeming political reasons , two members of the party got taken by APC , leaving the party with five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ State and so followed their governor , Rochas Okorocha , who helped to form APC . <p> But barely one year after the development , the largest of all blows visited APGA . This time , it was a well calculated attempt by its members in the House to finally snuff life out the party . <p> At the centre of the current development is Hon. Uche Ekwenife , member representing **25;0;TOOLONG Federal Constituency of Anambra State in the House . <p> To keen observers of Ekwenife 's exploits , her action is not entirely a novelty . Tutored in the political dynasty of former governor of Anambra State , Dr. Chinwoke Mbadinuju , Ekwenife has since understood appropriate moves that could pay off . <p> First , she launched a grip on PDP , secure the ticket , contested for the national parliament and won . But hardly had her first term elapsed when she threw in the towel for a governorship contest in 2010 . Aware of the hurdles in the Anambra PDP which lowered her chances of grabbing the ticket , the banker-turned-politician headed for the Progressive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ticket , contested but failed . But she was not not perturbed . Her consolation apparently came from the fact that her term was still running at the National Assembly . Of course , she headed back to the House . But not too long , campaigns for the 2011 elections came on stream . Again , aware of her slim chances with PPA to return to the parliament , Ekwunife migrated to the ruling APGA . APGA favored her and she got re-elected on the party 's platform . <p> Until August , no one thought that Ekwunife , who is also the House Committee Chairman on Environment , would ditch APGA for any other party . But far from it . Early August , the lawmaker packed her things and joined the chorus in the PDP . She would rather not move alone as she dragged four other lawmakers with her , leaving APGA bleeding in the parliament . <p> On the heels of the defection filtered the news that Hon. Victor Ogene , member representing Ogbaru federal constituency of the state in the national parliament followed suit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water as Ogene himself refuted the claim , authenticating his tenacity in APGA . <p> In fact , if there is any one who has decided to swim and sink with APGA , it is Ogene . He did not defect . He has been joined by his colleague and member representing Akwa south and Awka North , Hon. Emeka Nwogu . <p> Ogene , who is the Deputy Chairman , House Committee on Media and Public Affairs , has reasons he would not move . One : he wants to remain grateful to the party under which he got elected in 2011 . Two : His people have assured him of their unflinching support in the 2011 race , after all , such was the case in 2011 when they ignored all the entreaties of a sitting representative from the PDP and voted for him . <p> Perhaps , the biggest of the reasons Ogene is staying back in APGA is yet another call by the people of Ogbaru federal constituency to him to return to the National Assembly in 2015 . This way , they would show appreciation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three and a half years of his political career , made altruism his watchword . <p> Again , repudiated as the shining face of APGA upon the exit of Ekwunife and co ; it will be easy ride for him as the people would pour in their sympathy . Ogene 's strides <p> Within the period under review , a plethora of unassailable feats now stand conspicuous on every nook and cranny of Ogbaru despite the fact that as a legislator , he is more lawmaking-oriented than he is in the provision of social infrastructures . But even before providing the infrastructures , Ogene , who is an accomplished journalist cum editor , had decided to start from the basics . This is better elucidated in an interview he granted recently . <p> His words : " First and foremost , when I entered the fray as it were , I made it clear that I was not going to be sharing money because I was not coming into the field as a money bag . Secondly , I told the people that I was not going to build skyscraper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do so . However , I still have my campaign pamphlets because I asked them to keep it safe and secure ; that that would be the basis upon which they judge my tenure at the end of my tour of duty . First , I offered to give my people a voice within the larger Nigerian spectrum . <p> " By that I mean , in not too recent past , when you ask anybody from my own sub-ethnic group within the larger Igbo nation ; the Ogbaru people are on the banks of the great River Niger , and when you ask where are you from , and we say we are from Ogbaru , the next question is where is Ogbaru ? You now begin to explain that it is where the highlife king , Stephen Osita Osadebe comes from . <p> If the person does not catch the drift , you now say okay , do you know Prof. Ben Nwabueze , the foremost constitutional lawyer , you say yes that is where I come from , close to Onitsha . <p> " But I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ought to be a lot more visible , and I started that even right from the campaigns by setting up the Ogbaru Voice , a community tabloid , which we have sustained . We are into our fifteenth edition , and we give it out free . Besides giving it out as an identity for an Ogbaru man , it also serves as a kind of feedback position for our representation . <p> " So , whatever we do , we put it there alongside other community based stories . Then moving from there , on the floor of the House of Representatives , we also have not been quiet . Virtually everybody , the other 359 members now know Ogbaru . At the mention of the word Ogbaru , you know it is in Anambra state , associated with Hon. Victor Afam Ogene . So , through my interactions with the media , contributions , Ogbaru now has added impetus " . <p> Not long ago , Ogene empowered over 150 of his constituents who were essentially youths . The youths graduated from a skill acquisition programme of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Ogene 's father at his home in Atani community . However , the training programme was in conjunction with the National Directorate of Employment ( NDE ) . <p> The event , which attracted the presence of the Deputy Speaker of the House of Representatives Hon. Emeka Ihedioha , as the Special Guest of Honour , APGA National Chairman , Chief Victor Umeh amongst other party stalwarts , had the youths graduate in the different fields which included computer application , fashion and designing , electrical installation , barbing , hairdressing , catering and GSM repair . <p> Also , over 350 men , women and the physically-challenged , benefitted from the lawmaker 's generosity , as they went home with various items of empowerment . <p> Besides all these , by Ogene 's efforts , some communities in his constituency had been connected to the national grid of Power Holding of Nigeria , PHCN through the distribution of transformers . <p> Hurdles <p> But despite these strides , Ogene faces some challenges in his ambition to stage a come back to the House in 2015 . At the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Assembly , Rt . Hon. Chinwe Nwaebili , who is eying Ogene 's seat . <p> Ordinary , there is nothing wrong with her ambition but many people think that the way she is going about defies every conceivable political nuances . For instance , she allegedly stopped her father , Igwe P.C.U Afubera , who is incidentally the traditional ruler of Ogbakuba , Ogbaru , from conferring on Ogene a chieftaincy . <p> Ogene displayed maturity and asked for a postponement of the exercise which was originally slated to hold on July 26 , 2014 . Last week , the wife of the governor of the state , Mrs. Ebelechukwu Obiano , during her maiden familiarization tour of Ogbaru local government , also defied every political decorum and pronounced Nwaebili the choice of the party for Ogene 's seat . <p> But for the interventions of elders of the community , a free -for -all would have ensued between the supporters of both parties .

TAN has conducted regional rallies in support of Mr. Jonathan since August , with the last of its six conventions held in Kano , for the northwest , which comprises Kano , Jigawa , Katsina , Sokoto , Kebbi , Zamfara , and Kaduna States . <p> The Kano event held Saturday , September 27 . As with the previous five regional rallies , the event was attended by senior officials of the federal government , and thousands of supporters . Much of the crowd at the event was rented , some aggrieved members of the group have told newsmen . The politicians , who are members of the ruling Peoples Democratic Party , PDP , in Kano State , and were drafted to be part of the TAN rally , have narrated how they were asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fee , only to be left stranded without money to compensate hundreds of youth and women hired for the rally . <p> The matter is threatening to tear the support organization apart with the aggrieved members threatening to seek redress and to expose the sham they claim was on parade at the event . The aggrieved agents now have a pile of debt to settle and some of them who spoke with journalists say they do not know who to talk to about the money they spent in bringing in supporters . One of the agents , Ibrahim Lawan , who said he is the Secretary of the PDP Youth Awareness Initiative , Kano , said that he was instructed to bring in 500 youth and women and to hire buses that will transport them to the venue of the rally in Kano city . <p> The arrangement , according to Mr. Lawan , was that each participant would be paid N500 on arrival , and N2,000 for each bus .

" This left us in rancour with over 600 angry youths who went wild due to frustrations of spending lots of hours , no food or water and also no available transportation back to their various destinations , " he said .

TAN has no official representation in Kano , it was understood . Our correspondent , who made findings in Kano , was told the group has only two resource persons who are responsible for the entire northwest . One of the officials , who agreed to speak , but on the condition his identity be protected , said he had received several complaints of people short-changed by the group after the event . <p> " I simply told them I am not an insider into the activities of TAN because I do n't know much about them .

" Kano rally was our last rally . The response of Nigerians to our objective and rallies was spontaneous and they are full of passion and conviction . From the South East rally to the North West , that has been the trend . However , stakeholders , including those contesting elections , can mobilize people to come to the rallies .

" Till now , those in charge of the mobilisation and payment of transport fares and feeding stipends are nowhere to be found or contacted , " he said . " It 's indeed a pity to see how things are being organised by TAN Northwest ( Kano ) . Please PDP , GDG and TAN members , come to my aid , I am currently under pressure and threatened by angry PDP youths to pay them their stipends .

I mean N500 reward . GEJ should know for sure that the picture painted by TAN across the nation is not a true reflection of what the people stand for or what majority of electorate are saying . What we the electorate are saying is that we are tired of poor leadership , we are tired of sick leaders without good drive to take us to the promise land after about 16yrs of misrule , and institutionalization of corruption by PDP in Nigeria .

Where were they when Governor Orji restored the manhood of Abians to borrow the insightful words of Chief Ojo Maduekwe ? Just to mention a few . <p> " It 's evident that the two APGA chieftains apart from being economical with the truth were also envious of Ochendo 's laudable and verifiable achievements which put him ahead of other past leaders of the state . <p> " Governor Orji 's remarkable achievements have won him uncountable awards and laurels from all parts of the world . He is one leader who does not believe in propaganda as a tool for governance , rather he believes in hard work and selfless service to humanity . <p> " One begins to wonder where Umeh , a man who can not be trusted , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anambra State later dumped him , got his facts from on the state of roads in Aba . <p> " The truth is that Umeh has come to Abia with his long red cap to cause confusion and declare war against peace loving Abians . Abians no doubt have become wiser and I am convinced that they will definitely reject Umeh and his cohorts who are out to destroy the legacies put in place by the Ochendo administration . " <p> Ajunwa , who described Otti as a failed politician , said that Abians had continued to enjoy purposeful leadership under Governor Theodore Orji since he came on board in 2007 . <p> " Governor T.A . Orji is the father of modern Abia and no amount of propaganda and treachery can change this fact because he has through his numerous achievements endeared himself to the consciousness of all Abians who have wholeheartedly embraced his government . Governor Orji represents the true change as his style of governance is completely devoid of any form of violence . <p> " This approach has ushered in growth , development , peace and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hypocrisy for Otti to claim that the " people of Abia had suffered too long because of lack of purposeful leadership . <p> " Otti is taking more than he can chew as he does not have the capacity to fix anything . He should be examined by doctors to find out if he has mental challenge . In fact , if there were anything at all to be fixed in Abia , Dr. Okezie Ikpeazu , the PDP governorship candidate , is coming in to consolidate on Governor Theodore Orji 's laudable achievements in the state . <p> " Governor Orji has fixed many roads , he has fixed the education sector , he has fixed healthcare sector , he has fixed the agriculture sector , he liberated and secured Abia . Therefore , the likes of Umeh and Otti have nothing tangible to offer Abians rather than their skewed minds which are full of lies , deceit , envy and treachery " . <p> Cursed be the day you were born for putting up a bold face to defend the indefensible . No sane person will go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everyone to see will not ask if there is a government in Abia . <p> Mr. Ajunwa , you are secretary to the state government , Please remain that . As for the roads in Abia as a whole , within your conscience , you know that nothing was done in Abia , have you not go to Akwa Ibom , your neigbor state to see what other PDP governor did ? I do n't blame you , I blame the elders of the state who have chosen to be quite , despite knowing the fact that His excellency governor T.A Orji , did not use the income of the states well enough , but , a day of reckoning will come in Abians state , I trust God for that . Any so called King , or elder of the state that , took money in order to look away from dids of the governor or his aid , will one day suffer the consequences . <p> onisan udoh <p> December 13 , 2014 at 7:29 am <p> They are Poverty Development Party .

The authorities of the Bayelsa State Police Command had in April this year arrested Ogbuku over alleged complicity in the murder of an ex-militant committed in 2011 . Also mentioned as an alleged accomplice is the former state chairman of the youth security outfit known as Bayelsa Volunteer , Hon Sonny Igoli . But the State High Court sitting in Yenagoa and presided over by the state chief judge , Justice Kate Abiri discharged and acquitted Ogbuku over lack of diligent prosecution and substantial evidence linking him with the alleged murder . Sam Ogbuku , who won the ticket of the APC to represent Ogbia Federal Constituency as candidate of the party in the 2015 National Assembly elections , has since been released and has returned to his family in Lagos . Commenting on the development , the organising secretary of the APC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certificate of return bearing Sam Ogbuku 's name as the APC flag bearer for Ogbia Federal Constituency is still awaiting his collection , the decision by the court is a welcome development .
