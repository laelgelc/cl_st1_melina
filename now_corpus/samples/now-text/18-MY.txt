" The development provides plenty of opportunities for both owner-occupiers and investors , " says Lim . " It is located in a strategic area in Petaling Jaya , near Bandar Utama , Tropicana and SS2 . It is near institutions such as KBU International College and The British International School of Kuala Lumpur , " says Lim . <p> " AmanAra is located just opposite Glomac Centro , a serviced apartment by Glomac Bhd .

" Generally , Malaysians are accustomed to this type of properties , and several similar projects , such as 16 Sierra in Puchong South and Sri Hartamas , have townhouses that are quite sought after , " he says . " The best-selling property types in this area are terraced houses and condominiums . " <p> According to Toh , the average price of townhouses in Kayu Ara is between RM400 and RM550 psf . Meanwhile , the yields range from 2.5% to 4% . <p> " Owner-occupiers , upgraders who live within the immediate area who have more money now and want to have a bigger family , young couples and those who work near Kayu Ara would be attracted to this development , " he says . <p> Developments in Kayu Ara do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smallholdings in the area . In order to create an environment on a par with the likes of Tropicana , Bandar Utama , Damansara Jaya and Damansara Utama , you need a huge piece of land to conceive wholesome , attractive developments .

In addition , the price has to be attractive enough to attract buyers to stay in the area , " says Toh . <p> Nonetheless , Kayu Ara has a good road network and public amenities nearby , he opines . " There will be a continuation of small boutique developments as the area is too small for big developers . However , it provides more opportunities for smaller developers to enter the market in a mature area such as Petaling Jaya . " <p> Redefining urban living <p> SHD was first established in 2011 . The company stemmed from Oh and Lim 's long-term friendship and partnership . <p> " Oh and I became close friends during our college and university days in the UK . She was studying in Bristol while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of mutual friends . We also have similar upbringing , " says Lim . <p> " Upon receiving my law degree , I returned to Kuala Lumpur and joined my late father 's company . He was a developer in the early days . In fact , I started following him to construction sites when I was nine years old , " he reminisces . <p> " We developed a few projects under different companies . They include Taman Aik Ann at Semenyih in 1977 ( with a unique cantilever , roof porch ) , Belair at Damansara Heights in 1982 ( one of the first few apartments in Malaysia , and the first duplex ) , and Contessa in Bangsar in 1996 ( shaped like a butterfly to ensure every unit has views of Kuala Lumpur and Petaling Jaya ) . <p> " One of the key things that I have learnt from my father -- and would like to carry on with this company ( SHD ) -- is that it is important to have unique features for each development , " says Lim . <p> " Meanwhile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sdn Bhd , " says Oh , who previously worked at KPMG . <p> " My father has encouraged me to invest since young . He would advise me to look at stock markets , to take risks and invest . In 2006 , I joined the family business and we have invested in diverse industries . " <p> According to her , property development seemed like the next natural progression for their investments . " Upon discovering this land in Kayu Ara , Jonathan and his father came to see us and asked if we would like to partner up for this project and we said yes . And that is how we got into this partnership . " <p> " Our main focus for AmanAra and our future projects is to create unique features for the projects , to blend old and new features and concepts such as courtyards and so on . Our motto is to ' redefine urban living ' . For example , our AmanAra project is niche and has been carefully designed with urban features to suit our buyers , " says Lim . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ developer does not have land bank and will develop as and when there is an acquisition . " We are selective . If the opportunity arises , we may consider acquiring land . But for the time being , we would like to focus on AmanAra . " <p> " In the long term , we would like to create more niche , low-density , practical developments for buyers and investors . We do look at areas such as Puchong and Taman Desa as potential places for our future developments , " says Lim . <p> " As for the type of development , we would have to see the land to determine what would be suitable for the land and the surrounding community . I admire details of developments such as The Commons in Bangkok . It offers open spaces and sustainability , and defines urban living . It is something we would like to introduce in the local property market . <p> " In terms of the property market , we believe there is still demand for houses and there is no oversupply , but rather an oversupply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we have the capacity to build something different for the market . We will most likely continue to develop in mature housing areas and offer unique developments . <p> " Lastly , for AmanAra , I would like the development to last ... to see families live there for generations to come , " concludes Lim.

A story that does not hold water will tarnish the police reputation for sloppy standards . <p> To most of us who have seen the CCTV footage - and I did opine on it in Malaysiakini shortly after the incident - there is more than meets the eye . The public perception is the kidnapping of Koh could not have been carried out by a novice .

However , they have yet to carry out the deal . <p> According to sources , the two are still waiting for Bank Negara Malaysia to greenlight the proposed acquisition . Taiwan 's banking regulator , the Financial Supervisory Commission , had approved the deal last June . <p> The unusually long wait for the local central bank 's approval has sparked industry speculation on whether all is well and if the deal will proceed at all . <p> A source familiar with the situation , however , is confident that despite the delay -- it was initially expected that the deal would close in the second half of last year -- the acquisition will happen as planned , likely in the first half of this year . <p> " The parties are still in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's taking some time , but you have to remember , this is not a domestic consolidation where the buyer knows the market well .

In 2007 , it had as many as five branches in Malaysia , when it had a stronger focus on retail banking . <p> These days , it does mainly corporate banking , serving customers from its sole branch in Menara Hang Seng in Kuala Lumpur , two corporate sales offices in Johor Baru and Penang , as well as an offshore branch in Labuan . It had some 70 employees last year . <p> The Edge had reported in June 2016 that the Canadian group was exploring the sale of its Malaysian subsidiary as part of a wider plan to scale back in Asia to focus on domestic banking and certain key South American markets . <p> Based on the latest unaudited financial statements posted on its website , Scotiabank 's net profit for the nine months of its financial year ended Oct 31 , 2017 ( FY2017 ) fell by 10.1% to RM20.69 million . In the third quarter itself , however , net profit doubled to RM8.51 million from RM4.23 million . <p> It attributed the decline in the nine-month earnings to lower net interest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and lower fee income earned during the period , which was partially offset by a reduction in operating expenses . <p> The group 's assets , at RM2.91 billion as at end-July last year , had decreased by 16.4% compared with RM3.48 billion nine months earlier .

@@22872233 <p> In the past , it was common for early-stage businesses to look for seed investments from angel investors in exchange for equity . However , in recent years , the need for angel investments has gradually declined due to the emergence of other early-stage financing alternatives such as accelerators , incubators , micro-venture capital and , most recently , initial coin offerings ( ICOs ) . <p> To stay relevant , angel investors will need to look for new gaps to fill and step up their offerings when it comes to intellectual capital and mentoring , says Robert Lomnitz , managing director of Thailand-based Bangkok Venture Club . " Angel investing has been around for a very long time , filling the market need of early-stage financing as venture capitalists ( VCs ) typically would not want to write a cheque for less than US$1 million . It is just not worth their while . But the world has changed . <p> " Today , companies can easily raise US$50 million on the back of a piece of paper through ICOs . There are 20 pitching competitions happening at the same time , offering winners a cheque worth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not play in the pre-seed stage anymore . There are too many initiatives filling the gap that angels used to fill . So , the role of angel investing needs to be thought through much more carefully . " <p> " In fact , ECF is a very good platform for angel investors because if they are accredited , they are eligible for the Angel Tax Incentive , which gives them a tax exemption . The government recognises the importance of angel investors . Since 2015 , more than 45 companies have been funded on ECF platforms and almost RM30 million has been raised . Most of the investments are actually from angel investors , " said Azra'i , who was speaking at the session on " Progress of the Angel Investing &amp; Start-up Ecosystems in Asean " during the recent MBAN Summit 2017 . <p> " This is a very good development for Malaysia . It is good for start-ups too because it is possible for them to raise funds easily in a short amount of time . Human resources system Kakitangan.com , for example , raised RM1.5 million @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grown in popularity in recent years . This is seen in the number of angel clubs , networks and syndicates in the country . While the members of these organisations come from various professions , a significant number of them are the second generation of wealthy families , said the panel speakers at the session on " Progress of the Angel Investing &amp; Start-up Ecosystems in Asean " . <p> Lomnitz says angel investing appeals to the affluent as it provides them with a constructive way to contribute to society while spurring the growth of the economy . " The majority of the angels in the region are business owners using these investments as a way to give back to the community . However , there is a growing number of angels who are the second generation of wealthy families . They gained an understanding of early-stage investing when they were either studying or working abroad . Now , they are bringing that knowledge back home . " <p> Petrus Huang , board member of the Business Angel Network ( Southeast Asia ) Ltd ( BANSEA ) , and Csaba @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They say the affluent members of the second generation tend to invest generously . " It is interesting to see this new wave of angel investors and how they assess investments , especially in countries such as Vietnam , where the angel investing landscape is still nascent , " says Bundik . <p> In its efforts to connect angel investors with start-ups across the region , MBAN -- the most structurally advanced angel network in Southeast Asia -- has formed the Asean Angel Alliance ( AAA ) , a non-profit collaboration of angel investor networks in the region . The members include HATCH ! Ventures , BANSEA Singapore , the Myanmar Angel Network , Cambodia Investors Corporation , Bangkok Venture Club , Angel Investment Network Indonesia ( ANGIN ) and the Philippines-based 1000 Angels . <p> The AAA 's objectives include promoting intra-Asean investment in technology-based start-ups or high-growth businesses ; facilitating cross-border syndication and co-investment support ; promoting the sharing of resources , best practices and investment experience ; co-creating capacity building and investment programmes , standards and certification ; and serving as a policy lobbyist . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ encouraging cross-border investments for angel investors . It is a platform for us to understand investment risks in each country , " says Azra'i . <p> " At the same time , we can co-invest to tap each other 's skills and expertise . For example , Malaysian angels can join the deal pitches facilitated by 1000 Angels in the Philippines and co-invest with other angel investors there . " <p> MBAN is currently working on a structured way to inform its members about future pitches in the countries of the AAA members . However , the tax incentive is only eligible for investments made in Malaysia , notes Xelia Tong , vice-president of investment ( grants ) at Cradle Fund . <p> ANGEL INVESTING IN THE REGION <p> There has been tremendous growth in angel investing all over the world . According to a report by the University of New Hampshire 's Center for Venture Research last May , angel investments in the US alone reached US$21.3 billion in 2016 , with 297,880 active angel investors . <p> Meanwhile , early-stage investment platform Go Beyond Investing , which represents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the amount invested by its investors in 11 countries , mainly in Europe , increased to CHF3.6 million in 2016 -- more than double the CHF1.3 million in 2011 . <p> In Asean , however , angel investing is still considered a niche space , with investors typically not disclosing the number and size of their deals . Developments in each country differ tremendously , with some angel networks more mature than others . <p> BANSEA Singapore , for example , has been around for 15 years . Yet , the network only has 200 accredited members . The Bangkok Venture Club was only launched in 2014 , but it already has about 400 active members . The latest member to join the AAA -- the Myanmar Angel Network -- was launched early last year and only has 12 members . <p> MBAN , which was previously under the auspices of Cradle Fund Sdn Bhd , is Malaysia 's official trade association and governing body for angel investors and clubs . Established in 2013 , the network now has about 200 accredited angel investors . Its initiatives include monthly curated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ angels . <p> There are also different processes for member accreditation . According to Huang , BANSEA members are required to make a self-declaration that will be vetted by the committee . <p> " Of course , today everyone is on LinkedIn . So , we can initially check their credibility there . For example , if a committee member says a person is dodgy and further investigation is needed , our secretary will do it for us . That seems to work without requiring them to file their income tax statements to join the association , " he says . <p> The Myanmar Angel Network has significantly more stringent rules , with multiple core requirements and a hefty annual membership fee , says head Loring Harkness . " When we were setting up , we made the decision to take a more hands-on approach that involved only a small number of investors who would be very active -- hence , the strict rules . Our annual membership fee at US$1,000 is chunky enough to turn a lot of people away , although I think we are going to increase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each member to hand us US$25,000 annually to be invested , " he adds . <p> For MBAN , one has to be a tax resident and either a high-net-worth individual with at least RM3 million in net assets , have a gross annual income of not less than RM180,000 , or have an annual income of RM250,000 jointly with one 's spouse in the preceding 12 months . <p> Deals and investment amounts also differ from country to country . Tong points out that in Myanmar , there are more investors than there are start-ups to invest in whereas in Thailand , there are more start-ups to invest in than there is capital to be invested . <p> In Malaysia , the Angel Tax Incentive provides a tax exemption for accredited angel investors for certain deals . The incentive is similar to Singapore 's Angel Investors Tax Deduction Scheme . However , in other Asean countries , there are no tax incentives for angel investors . <p> MBAN 's Azra'i says the network is hoping for an enhancement to the tax incentive , such as eliminating the requirement for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a period of two years prior to claiming the exemption . He also suggests that the government could set aside matching funds to help mitigate investment risks . <p> " For example , the angel investor puts RM300,000 in a start-up . Immediately , the start-up would get some type of matching funds from the government , say another RM300,000 . This would basically extend the deal , leading to higher potential of success for the start-up . Perhaps this is something the government could consider , " says Azra'i.

@@23844236 <p> IT is effectively a pre-election " state of the economy " report card . The commendations are implicit -- " Malaysians have never had it so good " and " Steady as she goes " . All this towards achieving that coveted goal of high-income nation ( HIN ) status as defined by the World Bank by 2020 . <p> With Malaysia 's 14th general election a few weeks away , the unveiling last Friday by Prime Minister Datuk Seri Najib Razak of the latest National Transformation Programme 2017 annual report , could not have been more relevant . NTP 2017 is a continuum of what international agencies such as the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) and World Bank have been saying of the government 's management of the economy and development goals . <p> The recent IMF Article IV Consultation stressed that Malaysia 's economic fundamentals remain strong and surpassed expectations . The strong real gross domestic product growth , estimated at 5.8 per cent for 2017 driven largely by domestic demand , pleasantly surprised the executive directors of the fund . Inflation is under control and projected to decline to 3.2 per cent this year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is getting closer to achieving high-income status " , with the usual caveats of increasing government revenues , cutting expenditure and investing in social capital , especially the female labour force . <p> The timing of NTP 2017 is irrelevant -- it would have been published irrespective of whether 2018 was an election year or not . Yet , its provisions and conclusions are coincidental and largely convergent with those of the gatekeepers of the global economy , especially the IMF . <p> The key takeaways of NTP 2017 are the achievements of Malaysia 's march towards HIN status including managing the nation 's finances , boosting its economy through stimulating GDP growth and containing government debt , generating employment , raising living standards and fighting corruption . <p> Malaysia is no longer stuck in the middle-income trap and its Gross National Income ( GNI ) per capita of US$9,660 ( RM37,800 ) is only US$2,427 shy of the World Bank 's high-income status threshold of US$12,087 . <p> Its fiscal deficit has declined from 6.7 per cent in 2009 to 3 per cent in 2017 , and it attracted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ target of RM1.4 trillion , of which 68 per cent was accounted for by private investments in 2017 . The Barisan Nasional government also created 2.68 million additional jobs in the last seven years . GDP growth of 5.9 per cent is exceeding all projections and suggests that the economy is over-achieving . <p> The ratio of public debt to GDP is 51 per cent , albeit below the government 's self-imposed debt ceiling of 55 per cent , but still slightly higher than some peer economies . The above economic indicators would be meaningless if their impact is not translated into the two defining key performance indicators ( KPIs ) in a modern democracy -- raising the living standards of ordinary citizens and fighting corruption . <p> Raising living standards is a challenge for any economy , irrespective of national wealth and HIN status . <p> According to the World Bank , inequality between the rich and poor , and very rich and middle classes has grown dramatically . Not surprisingly , the IMF has warned that inequality is one of the greatest threats facing humanity . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poverty rate has declined from 4 per cent in 2009 to 0.4 per cent in 2016 , and mean monthly household income has increased from RM4,025 to RM6,958 for the same period . But , achieving a balance between raising living standards and rising cost of living is testing for any economy . Governments , short of subsidising everything , can only intervene up to a point , because cost of living is often governed by external factors such as commodity prices , currency volatility , political instability , etc . <p> Malaysia is rightly increasing its minimum wage , especially to boost the median monthly income of the B40 group to RM3,000 . A social indicator that could help Malaysia over the HIN finishing line would be the eventual introduction of a living wage , which admittedly most HIN countries do not have . If Najib can achieve this would be a unique moral victory for BN . <p> BN 's stated policy is to have in-built measures aimed at lifting Malaysians out of the B40 income group up the social mobility ladder . But , it can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ backbone of a free market economy . Fighting corruption nowadays is a given in any polity . While Malaysia 's enforcement is second to none in almost all sectors , more can be done . <p> BN 's introduction of a Political Financing Bill is aimed at " ensuring greater commitment to uphold integrity in the political system " . The fact that Malaysia is ranked 62nd out of 176 countries in the Transparency International 's Corruption Perception Index 2017 , suggests that there is room for improvement . <p> NTP 2017 to me is a " vision of the eminently achievable " and a testament of hope for the future of the current and next generation of Malaysians . Amidst an opposition largely in disarray , NTP 2017 suggests that Malaysia is verily on the right growth and governance trajectory .

@@23882236 <h> Mysay : Words can not carry meaning the way actions do <p> Humans will always have conflicts . It is understandable , even acceptable , when these are due to irreconcilable differences in material interests , be they economic in nature or cultural . But more often than not , conflicts grow out of differences in the words used rather than differences in values . <p> Disagreements that are generated by the words being used are what we call " contradictions " . Contradictions do n't exist in nature ; they are purely cultural and purely literal . Words and phrases can contradict each other , concepts can contradict each other , but in nature , what you have are conflicts for resources and space , not contradictions . <p> Contradictions occur when we adopt a strict attitude in defining words . If it were more generally accepted that words used in daily interactions need not be precise at all , then fewer misunderstandings would occur , and fewer conflicts based on rigid dogma and tight principles would take place . <p> Some of the clearest examples of conflicts that stem from contradictions are found in religion . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used to define them , but the fundamentalist tendency is always present . In fact , one can almost be sure that , to the fundamentalist mind , words are meant to confine rather than define and describe a religion , and to constrain behaviour rather than to deepen and enrich it . <p> Why are religions often so tightly defined ? Well , for one thing , once defined , they can easily be wielded as a rough political tool . Thus , there is an unavoidable dialectic in religion between its spiritual and psychological goals and its political impact . <p> Since this dialectic is not always easy to pin down because it is a highly emotional one , it is more prudent to look beyond the words and review a religious route , or any system of thought , through the behaviour it commonly generates rather than through a strict study of its precepts . <p> Wang Gungwu , perhaps Malaysia 's greatest historian , once told me a story about how a village in Borneo converted to Islam . A devout Muslim had visited the village @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with great dignity , behaved himself impeccably and went about his business without troubling anyone . He said his prayers and performed his daily rituals devoutly . In the end , the village converted to Islam because the villagers yearned to act in the admirable way that this man did . Hardly any words were used or any attempt to convert the villagers was made . The good spiritual presence he exuded was what attracted the villagers , not any words . <p> I remember once asking the famous anthropologist , Professor Shamsul Amri Baharuddin a question that puzzles many Western-trained Southeast Asianists : " How did it come about that Islam managed to spread so effectively in Southeast Asia to the extent that , without the use of arms , it subsumed all the earlier kingdoms in the Nusantara ? " <p> His insightful answer to me , and I hope I did not misunderstand him here , was that Islam came as a liberator from traditional power -- from power that had slowly but steadily suppressed the common people for too long , as is the wont of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though , a struggle ensued between Islam as a liberating philosophy and the religion becoming the new clothes that the powerful could now wear . This struggle between , on the one hand , power -- whether established or aspirant -- and , on the other , spiritual liberation , is a constant and common one that must occur wherever there is management of human affairs . <p> This perpetual battle to prevent power from becoming despotic is one that has to be fought anew by every generation . <p> In Chinese , the word for " contradiction " is " mao dun " , literally meaning " spear " and " shield " . There is an interesting story behind this . There was once a street salesman , the story goes , who would boast that his spears could pierce any material at all . He also sold shields that he claimed could not be pierced by any material either . Clearly , in making these claims , he created a " contradiction " -- a " mao dun " -- through carelessness , insincerity or his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am sure all of us are often too categorical with our words and we create contradictions that we then do not care to correct , and to save face , we are prepared to enter into conflict . How much more are we not willing to make corrections when the contradictions were created by our forefathers and we feel the need to defend the honour of family , clan , tribe or race ? <p> And so , careless words put into action lead to conflict ; contradictions , which do n't exist in real life , become real conflicts . What we should do is look at the long-term results of the practices , more than the words , in order to judge what the good sides and what the bad sides of any teaching are . <p> In this context , another thing to consider is that we rely a lot on analogies and metaphors when we think . We sometimes wax lyrical without realising or admitting it , carried away by the strength of the stretch of the imagination that being poetic allows .

The first " collection " I 've ever designed was for the children from the movie Sound Of Music . I filled many of my brown school books with drawings of girls in dresses . <p> I then went to Australia for boarding school . Upon completing my secondary school , I enrolled in a more traditional university , University of Virginia , USA , intending to major in English &amp; Economics .

@@24193238 <p> Amanah leaders , such as Mohamad Sabu and Salahuddin Ayub , are confident that Pakatan Harapan 's nomination of Mahathir as ' prime minister-in-waiting ' shattered Umno 's propaganda that an Umno defeat would mean " Chinese DAP domination " . <p> Mahathir has brought many advantages to the Harapan side . But his unsuspected value lies in his persona of a saviour . Historical circumstances and his exertions conferred that upon him . <p> The challenge <p> He was involved in the anti-Malayan Union movement that Malays regarded as the definitive event in saving Tanah Melayu and the special position of the Malays from colonial perfidy and immigrant domination . <p> As a young doctor , he built up a good reputation for treating the sick , an esteemed way of saving lives . As was " Dr Umno " , he was an ideologue for the mission of saving the ' Malay race ' from poverty and economic backwardness . <p> Abdul Razak Hussein co-opted Mahathir for his project to recover Umno 's pre-eminence that was battered in the May 1969 elections . In 1988 , Mahathir " saved " the de-registered Umno by forming Umno @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rescue the national economy in two crises . In 1986 he " held the New Economic Policy in abeyance " , one reason for Team B 's challenge to his leadership of Umno . In 1998 he imposed capital controls against economic orthodoxy and international condemnation . <p> In ' Menghadapi Cabaran ' ( The Challenge ) , a book he wrote when he was the deputy prime minister , he endlessly lectured the Malays on their ' unworthy values ' , their tendency towards religious obscurantism , and indifference to new forms of colonial subjection . It was tiresome to them but Mahathir meant to save the Malays from themselves ! <p> One begins to see how a man with this background offers himself as a rallying point to rescue the economy from bankruptcy , the people from suffering and the nation from continued shame . <p> When Mahathir began talking to the PKR leaders , Tian Chua said simply to me that , " Ultimately Mahathir 's a nationalist " . The opposition leaders made a tacit bow before his saviour 's persona when they allied with him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's spokespeople mocked at Mahathir . They pronounced him too old and infirm . They chided him for not relaxing with his grandchildren . Such insensitivity only raised the sincerity and value of Mahathir 's sacrifice in the public eye . <p> Wisdom and epiphany <p> Mahathir did not act from political motives alone . He was probably driven by deep personal motivations between the 13th general election ( GE13 ) and the expos ? of the 1MDB scandal in 2015 . <p> He was contemptuous of Abdullah Ahmad Badawi and scarcely believed that Najib would lead Umno-BN to a worse performance in GE13 . For the next two years , Mahathir was preoccupied with Umno 's weaknesses . <p> Dreading the thought of Anwar 's eventual triumph , he went to the ridiculous extent of patronising so-called ' Malay-first ' bodies like Ibrahim Ali 's Perkasa . <p> On hindsight , Mahathir pulled himself back when the 1MDB story broke across the world . <p> With his intelligence in different senses of the word , Mahathir grasped the reality of the Najib Razak-1MDB entanglement . He foresaw the destruction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> His 22-year premiership was imperfect but it brought successes that he valued : Malay progress , economic transformation , political stability , and , dearest to him , national dignity . We were admired abroad as an ' Asian tiger ' before , he nostalgically told his audiences . <p> He found Najib 's record appalling : setbacks for Malay society and business , economic stagnation , social divisiveness and globally exposed national shame . If we are asked today where we come from , we lie that " We 're from Brunei , " he sorely joked with his audiences , <p> Mahathir claimed that Najib rejected advice on 1MDB and other issues . " I spoke to Najib because many people asked me to do something " , said Mahathir , " but Najib bragged that he could buy support because ' cash is king ' . " <p> Mahathir claimed Abdul Razak for his " idol " because of the latter 's contribution to rural development . But Razak 's son , Najib , only looked after himself , his wife , their children and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest , a prime minister 's ultimate sin in the eye of the ultimate nationalist . <p> Filicidal wrath <p> Is it far-fetched to think that the wisdom which comes with age came to Mahathir as an epiphany ? In a flash , he saw the double injustice of his treatment of two prot ? g ? s who looked to him as their political father . <p> On one of them , Anwar , he had visited filicidal wrath . He had elevated the other , Najib , to power . The one stood for reformasi , the other was kleptocracy itself . <p> The rest is not hard to grasp . It was not too late for Mahathir to atone for both dreadful errors but , past 90 , he had to hurry . <p> He publicly humbled himself to who in power made it a point not to admit a mistake . Mahathir flayed himself for misjudging Najib : " He was not even a bit like his father . " And so , Mahathir reconciled with Anwar , apologised to him and his family for their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his leadership of Harapan . <p> In the ways he knew best , which he knew better than anyone else , Mahathir set out to re-enact his previous ' destroy-and-promote ' drama . This time he would reverse the characters : he would depose Najib and he would resurrect Anwar . <p> From Mahathir 's lenses ( without belittling Harapan negotiations ) that must be the meaning of the Mahathir-Wan Azizah-Anwar sequence for the post of prime minister . <p> Even Mahathir can not unilaterally determine how his new drama will end . GE14 will decide that . But as always when he set his mind on a project , he put his ( somewhat ailing ) heart and ( probably pained ) soul into leading Harapan 's charge against Najib and Umno-BN . <p> Yet all this might have lifted a big load off his conscience , for he is unusually light-hearted at many ceramah . <p> A Harapan victory will be his finest hour . He can clear up many problems and allow Wan Azizah and Anwar to succeed him . He will retire after that , forever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from kleptocracy at his last stand . <p> It is a strange scenario to contemplate . <p> Mahathir is no more immune to hubris than other ' patriarchs ' who can not distinguish between their lives and those of their nations . <p> But if he succeeds , we will understand why that sharp and irreverent blogger , SakmongkolAK47 , was awed into calling Mahathir ' The man who can walk on water ' .

Firstly , Pakatan Harapan still has a long way to go in terms of organisation . Secondly , this may be a much closer race than some of us expected . <p> We may believe that in some of these instances , a Harapan candidate 's candidature would have been sabotaged no matter what degree of preparation . <p> However , from a cursory glance at the six currently known disqualifications ( along with other near-disqualifications and last minute candidate changes ) at present , it appears that only one could not have been evaded by any amount of preparation , while two other cases appear to be at least somewhat ambiguous . <p> The disqualification of Tian Chua ( centre in photo ) from contesting in Batu does indeed stink of heinous , premeditated manipulation . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not allowed to contest in the 14th general election ( GE14 ) due to a conviction and RM 2,000 fine , despite being allowed to contest in the previous general election after a different conviction which also resulted in a RM 2,000 fine . <p> Simple logic suggests that absent any changes in the law ( there were none ) , you can not arbitrarily interpret the rules one way for one election , and another way for another election . <p> I also do not believe for a second that some lowly returning officer in Batu made such a big decision on his own , or without some sort of " guidance " . <p> Avoidable disqualifications <p> That said , it appears that in all other 5 cases , disqualification should theoretically have been avoidable . <p> In Johor 's Bukit Pasir , Penang 's Penaga and Kelantan 's Kuala Balah , two Bersatu candidates and one PKR candidate were disqualified on the grounds of bankruptcy .

Why is it then that so many candidates for political office seem to be ? <p> It appears the Bersatu members at least went to some trouble to ensure that they were legally solvent ahead of time , so it is hard to say whether added preparation would have made a difference . <p> Failing to change addresses <p> The case is much more clear-cut for many other instances , however .

@@24549240 <h> Cover Story : Be prepared for when the dust settles <p> THE stage is set for the 14th general election ( GE14 ) , which will be held in less than two weeks . The towns and cities are festooned with the flags , posters and banners of the political parties while there are ceramah every night for the politicians to garner support . <p> Much has been said about a pre-election rally on the local bourse but against a backdrop of global uncertainty , investors seem to have become risk-averse . <p> The market is widely expected to rally if Barisan Nasional retains its federal power , whereas a victory by Pakatan Harapan could put Malaysia in uncharted territory , in which no one can conclusively say where the market will head . It could swing either way . For example , Bursa Malaysia succumbed to heavy selling when the incumbent Barisan Nasional lost its two-thirds majority in parliament in the general election in 2008 , for the first time since polls in 1969 . But it is worth noting that an external factor -- the 2008/09 global financial crisis triggered by the US subprime meltdown -- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Indeed , the FBM KLCI plunged 33% within 12 months of polling day . <p> The outcome of GE14 aside , when the dust settles on the political front , there are five other variables that we believe could determine the direction of the local stock market . <p> 1 ) Crude oil prices <p> It can not be denied that the movement of crude oil prices influences the local stock market . To recap , Brent crude oil was trading at an average of US$108 per barrel in 2013 . This formed a strong platform for the post-GE13 rally that lasted until late October 2014 , when oil prices collapsed , sinking below US$30 the year after . The FBM KLCI gained close to 10% within 12 months of polling day in 2013 but the rally on the broader market was even stronger . For example , the Bursa Malaysia Small Cap Index surged 62% within 15 months of polling day . Oil and gas stocks were well sought after as their valuations were at historical highs with hefty premiums , given the robust upstream activities at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oil-producing nation , Malaysia benefited from the high crude oil prices . Its coffers were replenished with oil revenue and the ringgit appreciated against other currencies . Interestingly , the inflation rate at the time was lower than that seen last year . <p> Brent crude has risen more than 40% in the last 12 months , from US$52 per barrel to US$73 per barrel as at press time , thanks to the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries ' ( Opec ) production cut agreement signed last year . The agreement between Opec and allied non-Opec producers to cut production by 1.8 million barrels a day is set to be extended to year-end . This is expected to lend support to oil prices . <p> It is worth noting that crude 's current price level is a far cry from the oil boom in 2013 . Indeed , the oil and gas industry landscape has changed over the past three years . <p> Many local oil and gas players are in the process of adjusting to the " new norm " , finding ways to survive in a low @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and mounting debt pressure . Generally , jobs remain scarce , although upstream activity has increased of late . Simply put , the pie is smaller than before , at least for now . <p> That said , CIMB Research is optimistic about the sector , maintaining its " overweight " call on it . The research house believes the current strength of oil prices has legs , citing the accelerating pace of OECD industry oil inventory drawdown , geopolitical risks and the production cut commitment of Opec and non-Opec members as among factors that will sustain the momentum of crude oil 's recovery . <p> The International Energy Agency is forecasting US oil production growth to slow down by the fourth quarter of this year as pipeline capacity hit 96% utilisation recently , forcing Permian Midland shale oil producers to discount their crude selling price , according to CIMB Research . This may pose a threat to future production as producers slow drilling activity and/or slow down the completion of drilled wells , it adds . <p> 2 ) The ringgit <p> The ringgit is one of the best-performing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ currency has appreciated 11.76% against the US dollar since the start of 2018 . The sharp gains show that the market has realised how undervalued the ringgit is , some quarters say . <p> The strengthening ringgit makes local assets , be it equities or government bonds , more appealing to foreign investors . It will be double bonus for foreign investors , in the form of capital gains and foreign exchange gains , when asset prices appreciate . For Malaysians , a stable local currency will discourage capital flight . <p> The ringgit 's newfound strength could be attributed to four factors : Bank Negara Malaysia 's shift to a more hawkish stance on the back of robust economic growth ; the strengthening of crude oil and natural gas prices ; a weakening US Dollar Index ; and accelerated repatriation of export proceeds by Malaysian exporters on expectations of the ringgit strengthening further . <p> According to AmInvestment Bank , there was a strong correlation between the FBM KLCI and the ringgit 's strength against the US dollar from Jan 1 , 2014 , to Sept 30 , 2017 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since October 2017 -- which we strongly believe is temporary in nature . In other words , assuming the ringgit 's strength is sustainable , at least , we believe the market will eventually catch up , " says AmInvestment in its 2018 Market Outlook Strategy report . <p> In January , Bank Negara raised its overnight policy rate ( OPR ) by 25 basis points to 3.25% , the first hike since July 2014 . This boosted not only the ringgit but also crude oil prices . Most analysts have maintained their OPR forecast of 3.25% for 2018 and expect another hike to come only in 2019 . <p> A strong ringgit is a double-edged sword . It is a boon for domestic market-oriented companies that need to import raw materials . Companies that need to acquire new equipment and machinery for automation or capacity expansion will also benefit . <p> However , it is a bane for export-oriented companies as any strengthening of the exchange rate would translate into lower converted export revenue . <p> The continued strengthening of the ringgit would even result in forex losses among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and semiconductor manufacturers . In fact , some companies had already felt the impact in the first quarter of the year . <p> On the economic front , a strong ringgit will help contain inflationary pressures caused by costlier imported items . Subsequently , the pain of the rising cost of living will ease as people 's purchasing power improves with a firmer ringgit in hand . <p> Bank Negara has raised its GDP growth forecast for this year to between 5.5% and 6% , up from between 5% and 5.5% previously . Theoretically , robust economic growth should translate into a stronger local currency . <p> 3 ) External uncertainties <p> Global events could take centre stage , dictating the direction of equity prices on Bursa . Trade wars , geopolitical tensions and the global interest rate trend , particularly in the US , are external uncertainties . <p> Trade tensions between the US and China have unnerved many . They have prodded the equity bears and sparked a round of heavy selldown in the past two months . <p> A full-fledged trade war would have severe repercussions for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lagarde had recently warned that the biggest danger from the US-China trade dispute is the threat to global confidence and investment . <p> " The actual impact on growth is not substantial when you measure in terms of GDP . ( But ) when investors do not know under what terms they will be trading , when they do n't know how to organise their supply chain , they become reluctant to invest , " Lagarde explained . <p> Being an open economy , Malaysia is likely to be affected , especially its export-oriented manufacturing sector . <p> Mounting geopolitical tensions in the US , Syria and North Korea also continue to cast a shadow on the stock markets . <p> Over a week ago , the US , France and Britain launched missiles targeting what the Pentagon said were three chemical weapon facilities in Syria , in retaliation for a suspected poison gas attack on Douma in early April . <p> Over in North Korea , Pyongyang said it no longer needed nuclear or intercontinental ballistic missile tests because it had reached its weapon development goals . That said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he has shut down his nuclear programme . <p> Meanwhile , economies around the world , including Malaysia 's , are moving out of a decade-long low interest rate environment , which had stemmed from the US subprime mortgage crisis in 2008/09 . Should central banks raise interest rates faster and more aggressively than anticipated , it is unlikely to go down well with the stock markets . Interest rate hikes would affect the direction of investment money flow . Besides , the impact of the end of a low interest rate era on equities and the global economy is still an unknown to the experts . The pressure of interest expenses on consumers , business entrepreneurs and countries ' fiscals should probably not be overlooked . <p> 4 ) Corporate earnings <p> Corporate earnings in 2017 were not considered impressive , given that the domestic economy grew at a fast clip of 5.9% -- one of the highest in Asia . <p> Moving forward , analysts are less upbeat on earnings growth forecasts , considering the uncertainties on the horizon . Investors will probably start paying more attention to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as the exchange rate of the ringgit against other major currencies normalises . <p> Based on Bloomberg data , the earnings of 447 of the 877 companies listed on Bursa improved in 2017 , while those of the other half deteriorated . Some of the 447 charted profit growth in their 12-month earnings due mainly to changes in other comprehensive income , for example a reversal of provisions earlier recognised as well as foreign exchange translation differences . <p> Others saw a pick-up in business as reflected in the growth in their revenue and better earnings as a result of cost-optimisation measures . <p> " Our economic fundamentals remain robust and the global economy remains on a growth trajectory . Corporate earnings growth is expected to be 9% , underpinned by a stronger banking sector , which is a good proxy for the economy . Moreover , we see accommodative interest rates as well as improving consumer sentiment and liquidity in the banking industry , " says Kenny Yee , head of research at Rakuten Trade Sdn Bhd . <p> Mohd Redza Abdul Rahman , head of research at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to moderate at 4.39% for FBM KLCI constituents and about 3.4% for the 117 stocks in the research house 's universe . " After a good performance last year , the higher base and the appreciation of the ringgit will result in lower corporate earnings growth this year , " he says . <p> The bottom lines of export-oriented companies boosted by foreign exchange gains on a weak ringgit are likely to feel the high-base effect . But it could be the reverse should the ringgit strengthen . Manufacturers , whether in the semiconductor , furniture or glove industries , will have to deliver growth in core profits . Sales volume , profit margin and cost efficiency are likely to be closely watched , given that the market has a high expectation of earnings growth . <p> Meanwhile , it would be interesting to see if the massive impairment on asset value among the oil and gas companies is at the tail end of the cycle . The steady climb in crude oil prices has lifted optimism about the sector with some investment analysts already starting to recommend oil and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across the board , analysts say , as healthy balance sheets are crucial at the moment to keep these companies afloat when jobs are still limited . <p> The property sector is expected to spring a pleasant surprise as it is pretty much a buyer 's market . <p> 5 ) Stock valuations <p> Global equity markets delivered good returns last year , driven by strong economic growth in both developed and emerging markets . <p> Many stock markets have reached their record highs , raising the question of whether corporate earnings are strong enough to justify such expensive valuations . <p> In fact , the US Federal Reserve had warned in February that the valuation of stocks on Wall Street was getting too high . <p> According to the Fed 's Monetary Policy Report to Congress , in the second half of 2017 , valuation pressures edged up from already elevated levels . It noted that the price-earnings ratios ( PERs ) of US stocks were " close to their highest levels outside the 1990s " . <p> Trading at a PER of 16 times , the Malaysian market @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yardstick , the FBM KLCI is trading slightly above its five-year average of about 17.2 times . As for the small and mid caps , they remain pricey relative to an average historical PER despite the intensive selldown earlier this year . <p> The Bursa Malaysia Small Cap Index is trading at a PER of slightly more than 50 times , compared with the five-year average of 24 times . <p> Earnings will have to catch up to sustain the current share price level of companies , not to mention for the prices to climb . <p> Share price valuation could be seen as an equation of many variables , including economic fundamentals , earnings prospects , industry landscape , management quality and business risks . <p> Other factors that determine premium or discount pricing include market sentiment or even herd instinct . <p> Perhaps a pertinent question is , when the ample liquidity in the financial markets in the past decade starts to evaporate , how will that affect the current expensive valuations of equities ? <p> Valuations are also expected to moderate as the risk-on mode creeps in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commodity prices , but this will be moderated by the expected compromise in the US-China trade war , says Mohd Redza Abdul Rahman , head of research at MIDF Research . <p> " Stock valuations are relatively cheap , particularly for the beat-up stocks , including small caps , but investors need to look closely at earnings visibility going forward before acting . Counters such as property and telecoms have seen price declines but at the same time , they are good dividend picks , " he adds . <p> Market experts have repeatedly warned that global markets are trading at very high valuations . The potential risk of this has been overlooked , or even ignored , by investors . <p> While 2017 was a good year in terms of stock market performance , investors are advised to be more cautious this year by shifting into defensive mode .

@@24699230 <h> Matt Levine 's money stuff : High-frequency trading for bitcoins <p> It is not original to me , but one thing that I think and write a lot is that cryptocurrency enthusiasts keep re-learning the lessons that regular finance learned decades ago , and that you can see a lot of financial history replaying itself , sped up , by observing cryptocurrency . ( I have occasionally also argued that the story of cryptocurrency might actually be the opposite , that it 's about traveling back in time to progressively forget the lessons of modern finance , but never mind that . ) <p> In many ways this is a snarky and condescending thing to think ; the implication is that the crypto people had simplistic and naive expectations about how trustless decentralized purely market-based finance could work , and are slowly discovering the **25;115;TOOLONG benefits of trust and central counterparties and regulation and non-market mechanisms . On this theory , financial history is a journey from darkness into enlightenment , and those of us who have seen the light can watch in amusement as cryptocurrencies make the same journey . <p> On the other hand that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The most important financial innovation that I have seen the past 20 years is the automatic teller machine , " Paul Volcker famously said , and there are plenty of people who would argue that at least the past few decades of financial history have been a story of reckless deregulation , risk , scandal , inequality , over-financialization and rent-seeking . <p> On this view , if cryptocurrency does quickly repeat the history of conventional finance -- if in two years we end up with too-big-to-fail Bitcoin banks that use chat rooms to manipulate crypto indexes and set up fake accounts for their users -- then that will be bad . Cryptocurrency 's original promise was n't simplistic and naive ; it was idealistic and pure , and importing all the controversial features of scandal-plagued modern finance will be a tragedy . <p> Coinbase Inc. , which operates the largest U.S. cryptocurrency exchange , said on Tuesday that it would upgrade its systems with services that cater to ultrafast traders . The upgrade , planned for later this year , will make Coinbase one of the first bitcoin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> San Francisco-based Coinbase plans to introduce " low-latency performance , " the company said in a blog post , using a term in the exchange industry that means extremely fast processing times . <p> Coinbase also said it would allow trading firms to place their servers directly in its data center , a practice called co-location . <p> That 's fine ! Catering to professional market makers -- having professional market makers , for that matter -- is probably a way to make the market better and more useful for most investors . " These additions will allow for a more efficient price discovery process to occur , creating tighter markets , deeper liquidity , and increased certainty of execution , " says Coinbase . <p> It is a stage of enlightenment , an adoption of useful ideas from conventional finance . ( Along with the co-location , Coinbase is also " developing several tools to lure institutional investors onto its platform , " including " custodial services where investors can store large amounts of digital currencies " ; obviously having a safe place to put your Bitcoins would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's original promise of decentralization . ) <p> On the other hand that 's not actually how many people think about exchanges that cater to high-frequency traders ! I mean , co-location , my word : <p> Coinbase 's move is likely to raise eyebrows , since many investors view high-speed traders with suspicion . Critics like Michael Lewis , author of the 2014 best-seller " Flash Boys , " have alleged that HFT firms take advantage of slower-moving players . <p> Some number of people got into Bitcoin because they felt like the conventional financial system was rigged against them , and I suspect that some number of them felt like that because stock exchanges let high-frequency traders pay to run their algorithms right next to the exchanges ' servers so they could have faster access to the exchange than anyone else .

And there are those in the crypto community who argue that the tradeoff should go the other way in cryptocurrency regulation : Let a million blockchain projects bloom , accept that most of them will be frauds , but do it anyway to foster innovation . <p> That is interesting , or at least potentially interesting . ( Not all of the regulators are moved by it !

Redstone . <p> We talked yesterday about CBS Corp 's amazing effort to get rid of its controlling shareholder , Shari Redstone 's National Amusements Inc , by issuing enough voting stock to other shareholders to dilute away NAI 's control . The point of this effort would be to prevent Redstone and NAI from using their voting power to fire CBS 's directors and try to force through a merger with Viacom Inc , another company controlled by Redstone . <p> A flaw in CBS 's plan is that it had to give Redstone notice of the board meeting ( scheduled for tomorrow ) at which it will issue those new shares , and so she can fire them before they hold that meeting . But it asked a Delaware court to enjoin her from doing that , so it could go and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NAI filed its reply to that lawsuit , which denies the basic conflict that CBS claimed . <p> Plaintiffs suggest that NAI intends to force such a merger by removing and replacing the CBS independent directors . There is no truth to that . NAI does not have , and has never had , any intention of replacing the CBS Board or taking other action to force a merger . Plaintiffs ' supposed belief to the contrary is based on unsourced media reports and conjecture . <p> -- But also notes that , even if it were true , diluting away Redstone 's ownership " would still be egregiously overbroad and unjustified " : <p> If Plaintiffs were genuinely concerned that NAI would seek to force a merger upon the company , and NAI had not committed to refrain from doing so during the pendency of this action , the relief to which Plaintiffs would even plausibly be entitled would be an injunction to prevent NAI from forcing a merger upon the company while this litigation is pending . It would not be to dilute NAI 's voting power , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an unprecedented usurpation of a controlling stockholder 's voting power . <p> Look : That is obviously correct . If the controlling shareholder wants to do something bad and wrong over the board 's objection , then the board should say no . The board should n't fire the controlling shareholder . That 's not even a thing . You can sort of understand the board 's point of view though . If the chief executive officer wanted to do something bad and wrong over the board 's objection , then the board really might fire him . Firing the CEO for doing bad things is how the board exerts its power , how it demonstrates that it is in control of the corporation . If the board really is supreme , if it is in control of the corporation and the shareholders are just sources of capital , then why should n't it fire the shareholders too , if they make it mad enough ? <p> By the way yesterday I expressed some surprise that the board would even try , but apparently there is precedent for boards trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were n't looking . ( " You go on one long vacation out of cell-phone coverage and , bam , you 're out , " I wrote yesterday . ) It did n't work though . From NAI 's filing : <p> The proposed dilutive stock dividend would be invalid under Adlerstein v. Wertheimer . There , the Court recognized that where a controlling stockholder has the power to forestall board action by preemptively removing directors , the board can not take steps to neutralize the controlling stockholder 's voting power in order to effectuate the board action . In Adlerstein , the controller had the power to remove certain directors and , recognizing this , the board kept the controller in the dark about a board proposal that destroyed his voting control over the corporation until it was too late for the controller to act . Recognizing that the controller was entitled to an adequate opportunity to protect his interests , the Court held that the directors ' decision to keep the controller uninformed about the proposal invalidated the board 's approval of the proposal . <p> Still , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lawyers here are from Wachtell , Lipton , Rosen &amp; Katz , where I worked long ago . I remain very fond of Wachtell , and I do n't think that I am biased when I say that it is undoubtedly the U.S. 's leading advocate of the theory of " board primacy " in corporate governance . I do n't really think they will , but if they do convince a Delaware court that boards of directors should be able to get rid of shareholders they disagree with , then that would be quite a total victory for board primacy . <p> Should index funds be illegal ? <p> No , write Thomas Lambert and Michael Sykuta of the University of Missouri , in " The Case for Doing Nothing About Institutional Investors ' Common Ownership of Small Stakes in Competing Firms " : <p> We show that the theory of anticompetitive harm from institutional investors ' common ownership is implausible and that the empirical studies supporting the theory are methodologically unsound . The theory fails to account for the fact that intra-industry diversified institutional investors are also inter-industry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The empirical studies purporting to demonstrate anticompetitive harm from common ownership are deficient because they inaccurately assess institutional investors ' economic interests and employ an endogenous measure that precludes causal inferences . <p> Even if institutional investors ' common ownership of competing firms did soften market competition somewhat , the proposed policy solutions would themselves create welfare losses that would overwhelm any social benefits they secured . <p> The point that " intra-industry diversified institutional investors are also inter-industry diversified " is worth emphasizing . When people worry that common ownership of multiple firms in the same industry by big institutional investors reduces competition in that industry -- the antitrust worry that I often shorthand as " should index funds be illegal ? " -- the theory is more or less that if all the airlines raise prices , rather than compete with each other on price , then they will all make higher profits and benefit their common shareholders at the expense of customers . But , in general , the mutual funds also own the customers .

" <p> It is harder to see how corporate managers would maximize that . But it is a pleasingly Marxist diagnosis of institutional investors as advocates , not of reduced competition in any particular industry , but of the interests of the capitalist class generally against those of workers and consumers . <p> People are worried about unicorns . <p> Private markets , I sometimes say , are the new public markets ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot of money or create secondary liquidity or achieve widespread name recognition or whatever , but now they can do all of that in the private markets .

But the VCs are working on fixing that problem too : <p> New Enterprise Associates , one of Silicon Valley 's largest venture-capital firms , plans to sell off a big chunk of its startup investments in response to a dearth of initial public offerings , according to people familiar with the discussions . <p> The firm plans to sell roughly US$1 billion worth of its stakes in about 20 startups to a new firm it is seeking to create , one of the people said , in an effort to return capital to its limited-partner investors .

In order to meet the demand for builders , Captain Francis Light requested for a large number of work force from the British East India Company ( BEIC ) in Calcutta . This request , and subsequent arrivals after 1787 , led to the growth of the Chulia settlement . <p> On Jan 25 , 1794 , Light wrote that the Chulias who hailed from the ports along the Coromandel coast as well as from nearby Kedah were second only to the Chinese in terms of numbers . While most of them were shopkeepers , other members of this community earned their keep by working as traders , boatmen and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Penang 's six member civil administration . Long Fakir Kandu , who hailed from Kedah , held the prestigious position of writer and earned an annual salary of 360 Spanish Dollars . <p> Growth in Penang was spurred further when the colony received additional funding after becoming the fourth Presidency of India in 1805 . A census ordered by the acting governor , Colonel Macalister five year later showed a total population of 24,422 with the Chulias numbering more than 5,600 . <p> This relatively large number of Indian Muslims already had their own places of worship since the earliest years of the colony . A 1791 town map indicated the presence of two mosques south of , what was then known as , Chulier Street . One was on the present site of Masjid Kapitan Keling , while the other was located at the end of Queen Street . <p> The former catered primarily to the BEIC troops while the latter , known simply as Chuliar Mosque , was a prayer house erected by the Chulias who relocated from Kedah .

On Nov 21 , 1801 Leith executed Land Grant No. 367 which granted an a 7.2ha piece of land for Mohudeen to build a mosque on the south side of Malabar Street ( today Lebuh Chulia ) . The grant clearly stated that the land could not be sold or transferred and ownership would immediately revert back to the BEIC once it ceased to be used for the religious purpose intended . <p> Over a period of two years , Mohudeen demonstrated leadership by bringing in builders , stones and bricks from South India to build the mosque .

Also , at around this time , the other mosque near Queen Street fell into disuse and its followers were believed to have moved to join the congregation at Masjid Kapitan Keling . <p> The Lebuh Campbell Market in George Town was built on former Muslim cemetery land . <p> MASJID MELAYU <p> This period of prosperity in Penang also saw the arrival of a significant number of Acehnese traders , who brought with them much sought after commodities like pepper and betel nut which the Chulia merchants exported to India in large quantities . <p> Like the Chulias , the Acehnese also saw the need to set up a place of worship of their own .

This disagreement eventually led to the birth of a unique Penang custom called masjid bergilir ( alternating mosques ) where the combined congregation had to alternate between the two places of worship each Friday . <p> Historical records are unclear as to when this incident took place exactly . <p> It 's only known that towards the end of the fasting month on one particular year , Sheikh Omar Basheer from Masjid Melayu announced the date of Hari Raya Puasa but his calculations were disputed by the congregation at Masjid Kapitan Keling . As a result , Basheer brought the Masjid Melayu cannon to Masjid Kapitan Keling and promptly fired it to declare the end of Ramadan . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goers . <p> The next day , the community living around Masjid Melayu celebrated Hari Raya while those at Masjid Kapitan Keling continued their fast . One thing led to another and eventually a fight broke out between the two communities . During the ensuing melee , a youth from Armenian Street was badly beaten up and left to die in a nearby ditch . <p> The British authorities acted swiftly to prevent the chaos from escalating further . Three suspects were eventually arrested while another managed to escape by stowing away on a ship destined for Jeddah . <p> In order to mend ties , the two rival groups were ordered to alternate between the two mosques for Friday prayers . So , on each Friday , worshippers would all go to the appointed mosque and leave the other empty .

@@24788240 <p> Agriculture is critical for achieving the Sustainable Development Goals ( SDGs ) . As the Food and Agriculture Organisation ( FAO ) notes , " From ending poverty and hunger to responding to climate change and sustaining our natural resources , food and agriculture lies at the heart of the 2030 Agenda . " <p> For many , the answer to poverty and hunger is to accelerate economic growth , presuming that a rising tide will lift all boats , no matter how fragile or leaky . Most believe that market liberalisation , property rights , and perhaps some minimal government infrastructure provision is all that is needed . <p> The government 's role should be restricted to strengthening the rule of law and ensuring open trade and investment policies . In such a business-friendly environment , the private sector will thrive . Accordingly , pro-active government interventions or agricultural development policy would be a mistake , preventing markets from functioning properly , it is claimed . <p> The possibility of market failure is denied by this view .

In Africa , the World Bank 's influential Berg Report claimed that Africa 's supposed comparative advantage lay in agriculture , and its potential would be best realised by leaving things to the market . <p> If only the state would stop ' squeezing ' agriculture through marketing boards and other price distortions , agricultural producers would achieve export-led growth spontaneously . Almost four decades later , Africa has been transformed from a net food exporter into a net food importer , while realising only a small fraction of its vast agricultural potential . <p> Examining the causes of this dismal outcome , a FAO report concluded that " arguments in support of further liberalisation have tended to be based on analytical studies which either fail to recognise , or are unable to incorporate insights from the agricultural development literature " . <p> In fact , agricultural producers in many developing countries face widespread market failures , reducing their surpluses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ report also noted that " diversification into higher value added activities in cases of successful agriculture-led growth ... require significant government intervention at early stages of development to alleviate the pervasive nature of market failures " . <p> In the wake of Haiti 's devastating earthquake in 2010 , former US president Bill Clinton apologised for destroying its rice production by forcing the island republic to import subsidised American rice , exacerbating greater poverty and food insecurity in Haiti . <p> For nearly two centuries after independence in 1804 , Haiti was self-sufficient in rice until the early 1980s . When president Jean-Claude Duvalier turned to the BWIs in the 1970s , US companies quickly pushed for agricultural trade liberalisation , upending earlier food security concerns . <p> US companies ' influence increased after the 1986 coup d ' ? tat brought general Henri Namphy to power .

For example , the European Union 's Common Agricultural Policy ( CAP ) supported its own farmers and food production for over half a century . <p> This has been crucial for ensuring food security and safety in Europe after the Second World War . For Phil Hogan , the EU 's Agriculture and Rural Development Commissioner , " The CAP is at the root of a vibrant agri-food sector , which provides for 44 million jobs in the EU .

An OECD policy brief observed , " the benefits from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ OECD member countries reformed their agricultural policies . Currently , agriculture is the area in which OECD countries are creating most trade distortions , by subsidising production and exports and by imposing tariffs and nontariff barriers on trade " . <p> If rich countries can have agricultural policies , developing countries should also be allowed to adopt appropriate policies to support agriculture , to address not only hunger and malnutrition , but also other challenges including poverty , water and energy use , climate change , as well as unsustainable production and consumption . <p> After all , tackling hunger is not only about boosting food production , but also about enhancing capabilities ( including real incomes ) so that people can always access sufficient food . <p> As most developing countries have modest budgetary resources , they usually can not afford the massive agricultural subsidies common to OECD economies . Not surprisingly then , many developing countries " protect " their own agricultural development and food security . <p> Hence , a " one size fits all " approach to agricultural development , requiring the same rules to apply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be grossly unfair .

For the past 25 years , politicians and economists have followed the guidelines for debt and de cit that were agreed at the time of the Maastricht Treaty that set up the euro . <p> Malaysia already has a GDP per person that is very comparable to that in seven member states of the euro-area , so the guidelines that apply to these seven countries ( and to the richer euro members ) could also make sense here . <p> In fact , Malaysia could even be more comfortable to satisfy the euro norms than many of these euro countries , since our economic growth is likely to be higher than in Western Europe and that helps in managing the debt . <p> This is where the euro-area norms come from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a national debt of 60 . The ratio of debt-to-income stands at 60% . <p> Now , assume a real economic growth of 2.5% and inflation of also 2.5% . Then , next year the GDP amount to 105 . <p> If the deficit equals 3% of GDP , then the debt will increase from 60 to 63 , leaving the debt-to-GDP ratio unchanged at 60% . All these numbers are arbitrary , but they make sense for developed economies . <p> Malaysia has the advantage of higher growth . Let 's say growth this year and next averages 5% and in addition there could be 3% annual inflation . <p> From a starting point of 100 , the GDP would grow to 116.6 in 2020 . If the deficit was to equal 5% this year and 4% of the then GDP in 2019 , the debt would increase from 80.3 to 90 . <p> In 2020 , the debt-to-GDP ratio would come out at 90/116.6 = 77.2% , already on a healthy path down to the norm of 60% of GDP . <p> Another three years with the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ euro norm of 3% of GDP , would bring the debt-toGDP ratio down to just below 70% of GDP , and after another five years , the debt ratio would be at the norm of 60% . <p> A deficit of 5% this year -- high because of the scrapping of the Goods and Services Tax -- 4% in 2019 and 3% thereafter would work nicely to reduce the debt-to-GDP ratio , as long as Malaysia continues togrow . <p> Optimism is warranted if the new government manages to reverse the talent exodus of too many educated Malaysians . One important step to stop the brain drain would be to eliminate all harmful involvement of the state in the government-linked companies ( GLCs ) , because then investment by the private sector will increase . <p> Research by Jayant Menon and Thiam Hee Ng of the Asian Development Bank has shown that investment has consistently been lower in sectors where businesspeople have to compete with GLCs , because the GLCs may at any time get unfair competitive advantages from the government . <p> That has to end , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business optimism will increase in the private sector . <p> In addition to stopping the brain drain and getting the " G " and " L " out of the GLCs , Malaysians have expressed a clear desire at the election to make one further big change . <p> The Bumiputera policies should be recalibrated into policies for all poor Malaysians , irrespective of ethnic group or religion . <p> Policies are needed to help all poor citizens -- especially the older ones -- with their medical bills . <p> Support for training should also become available to all low income Malaysians , to right some of the injustice suffered by the poor non-Bumiputera . <p> The incoming government will want to work on these glorious but hard issues ; if they manage to reduce the deficit to 3% of GDP from 2020 onwards , the growing economy will take care of the national debt . <p> Eduard J Bomhoff is professor of economics at Monash Malaysia **25;158;TOOLONG .

In case you did n't know , the mobile wallet is completely different from the Touch ' n Go card and you 'll need to reload it separately . <p> According to Amanz , this form of mobile payment will be offered to 1,000 users in its initial testing phase . The trial run will start this week until 31 July 2018 . <p> We are curious if QR-code based payments are actually more convenient than tapping a Touch ' n Go card . According to the slide above , you would need to present your QR code at gate . To do that in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ app , tap on pay and enter your 6-digit PIN before it displays the custom QR-code . That 's quite a lot of steps needed before you walk up to the gate . If you 've tried the e-gate system at cinemas , you 'll know that some users might struggle with QR-codes if the screen is n't bright enough . <p> We still think that it could have been better if it was done via NFC . Hopefully the final product works better than the recently discontinued Touch ' n Go top-up feature . What do you guys think ? Let us know in the comments below . <p> QR code getting famous and applied faster anywhere in the world is because it 's cheaper solution . only need camera which 99.99% smartphone has it . and even it does n't need high resolution camera . <p> NFC chip only equipped in mid to upper model smartphone. furthermore , merchant also need to have NFC reader . while in QR code merchant can use his phone , standard scanner or printed QR code in piece of paper . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the common folks ; not 18 months+ down the line . Like I said NFC is a better option but utilizing QR is more pratical now . Moving from QR to NFC should n't be a major problem later down the line when NFC is widely used on cheap devices . <p> More practical ? QR code requires them every terminal to support qr scanning . How is that more practical than using a tech that 's already compatible with all of the current terminal , they should work on making it work with nfc first , while at the same time work on upgrading the terminals to support qr code scanning , so that by the time the support for qr code is out , we can actually use it . <p> It 's practical in the sense where generating QR codes can be done on most devices now that the common folks are using . The Terminals can be updated easily by TnG to support QR scanning since it 's thier initiative to begin with rather than to have all the common folks to have NFC devices is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not using the latest tech like NFC and etc , again , the whole idea is to make it work and usable to the mass common folks now .

Maybe touch and go provide three different way of using and let us netizen choose how we pay whether it is NFC , qr code or card . Peace <p> Free advice <p> QR code is ok if app design is good . Can just do 2 step : 1 . Open app 2 . Use fingerprint to authenticate and app will auto show QR code <p> NFC still best solution . Better to have a working app than widely supported technology that no one want to use . <p> Why is tng doing this ?

They do nt mind to give you last century technology what they care is making most possible money with least cost and minimum possibility of cheat by users <p> Pretending to catch up , that 's what they are trying to do . QR codes are for smaller traders who do n't have funds to kickstart their way into accepting mobile payments thus it works , but TNG with millions of users ca n't afford to develop up-to-date application for all users is just a shame on the brand itself . How is it still touch n go when you have to login , verify , and scan ? <p> We have tried the app ourselves and it will request the 6 digit pin before the QR code is revealed . Even if you use the scan and pay method , the 6-digit pin is also required . If the pin is not necessary then what ? ? ? s the pin for then ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it does n't check for transaction amount . This makes sense as the fare is n't calculated until you exit at your destination . In its current version , the 6 digit PIN is a must before the QR code is displayed . You can bypass this if you 're receiving money instead . <p> Touch n Go should have intro this years ago . Without protectionism , Alipay would have conquered TnG . Of cos , TnG is owned by CIMB ( another Razak son ) . Oh , I personally have been forfeited more than 100 bucks for non usage of TnG .... that rule is so DAMN DRACONIAN ..... I do n't see TnG use this is charity , only to fatten the bosses ' pockets . <p> you 're definitely entitled to your opinion but do everyone a favour before you blast it out .

Believe you 'll be surprised . <p> NFC is the future , we should embark the future @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still missed out on the newer tech . Even watch and fitness wristband offer NFC and you do not need an actual phone and it is common in China the fitness wristband with NFC act as a payment tool for transport fares . <p> QR payment is better for shop environment transactions . But for quick 5 seconds one , nothing comes close to NFC . TnG should just explore both . yes , not a lot of people have NFC to their phone but this a big plus for foreign tourist . i do n't mind using TnG for small purchases . do it like china , you buy ramly burger also can use QR pay . <p> QR payment is now widely used for Transit by millions of users in China , available for most of phones ( unlike NFC ) .

" <p> &gt; How is gaming disorder treated ? <p> " There really has n't been a good study of what kind of treatment works , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ science at University of Washington 's School of Medicine in Seattle and chair of the American Psychiatric Association 's Council on Addiction Psychiatry . " We 're in the realm of semi-experts giving recommendations , " he said . <p> Cognitive behavioral therapy , which focuses on identifying the problem and devising strategies and paths to resistance , works well , said Dr. Petros Levounis , an addiction specialist who chairs the department of psychiatry at Rutgers ' New Jersey Medical School . <p> " Gaming disorder does seem to respond to psychotherapy , and counseling can be quite effective , " he said . <p> As in other addictions , the biggest challenge comes up front , " where people may see nothing wrong with it , " Levounis added . " There 's a lack of insight into the consequences of the behavior that 's difficult to address . " <p> &gt; Are certain people more at risk for gaming disorder ? <p> Yes , people who have other psychiatric disorders . " Rates of depression , anxiety , ADHD are very high among this population , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that might make it easier to treat the internet gaming disorder . " <p> &gt; What are the arguments in favour of ? <p> Multiple studies have found that substance addictions and behavioural addictions share much of the same brain circuitry . Imaging studies have found that the urge to play video games activates the same brain regions that light up when compulsive gamblers or those addicted to illicit drugs ponder the prospect of gambling or drug use . <p> Some of the neural consequences may be the same too : A 2012 study suggests that the effects of excessive online game-playing on working memory may be similar to those observed in patients addicted to drugs or alcohol . Consequently , some researchers assume that problematic gaming might share some of the same neurobiological mechanisms as pathological gambling and substance dependence . <p> &gt; What are the arguments against ? <p> There 's a key practical distinction , adherents to this side say . <p> Dependence on alcohol or drugs - and for that matter , gambling - can be treated with abstention or avoidance . By contrast , eating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relationship , and shopping is virtually impossible to avoid . <p> In the 21st century , spending time online is pretty much a fact of life as well . That makes abstention or avoidance all but impossible , Saxon said , " Do you tell people you ca n't go online or have devices ? Because you ca n't go online without getting that stimulus they 're seeking . " <p> &gt; How do we know that digital gaming is n't just a fad ? <p> With games like Fortnite , League of Legends and Pokeman Go , digital gaming has taken the world by storm relatively recently . But it could lose its allure - and vast audience - just as quickly . Is this any way to diagnose a true psychiatric disorder ? <p> Opinions differ on this one as well . Levounis noted that over the years , many diseases have bubbled up and either died down on their own or been swatted into obscurity by vigilance and treatments . But they still needed to be identified , characterised and treated , he argued . Despite having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real disease , he said . <p> Saxon is n't so sure . <p> " Substance use disorders have been with humans through recorded history , " he said . " But having an electronic device that lets you connect to the rest of the world has only been widespread for 10 to 20 years . For all we know , some phenomenon will come on and five years from now , people will be doing other very disruptive things with their lives . " - Los Angeles Times/TNS

@@25343235 <h> Is the new AG choosing his briefs like a private lawyer ? <p> COMMENT In a recent article I said : " It ( Tommy Thomas ' appointment as attorney-general ) has become a reality . So , I will not argue about it . On the contrary , I will wait and see what he will do regarding certain issues and , if it is necessary , comment on it and even support or oppose it . " <p> I refer to his statement that his position is the same as that of the Bar Council ie , the attorney-general should not , at the same time , be the public prosecutor . <p> I am not arguing for or against the separation of powers between the attorney-general and the public prosecutor . However , until the Federal Constitution and the Criminal Procedure Code are amended , the attorney-general is also the public prosecutor . <p> To refresh our memory , Article 145 , inter alia , provides : <p> " ( 2 ) It shall be the duty of the attorney-general to advise the Yang di-Pertuan Agong or the cabinet or any minister upon such legal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legal character , as may from time to time be referred or assigned to him by the Yang di-Pertuan Agong or the cabinet , and to discharge the functions conferred on him by or under this constitution or any other written law . <p> " ( 3 ) The attorney-general shall have power , exercisable at his discretion , to institute , conduct or discontinue any proceedings for an offence , other than proceedings before a Syariah Court , a native court or a court-martial . " <p> " ( 1 ) The attorney-general shall be the public prosecutor and shall have the control and direction of all criminal prosecutions and proceedings under this code . " <p> So , when Thomas accepted the post of attorney-general , like it or not , by law , he is also the public prosecutor . He can not say he only wants to be attorney-general but not a public prosecutor . <p> He can not say he only wants to advise the government , but not prosecution . He can not pick and choose his briefs as if he is still in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pay as attorney-general . <p> Power to institute , conduct or discontinue any proceedings for an offence is exercisable at his discretion . To make the decision , he has to study the investigation files to satisfy himself that the decision is correctly , fairly and properly made . <p> There are also provisions that require him to act personally , for example , Sections 68(c) and 376(3) of the CPC . <p> If he did not agree that by becoming an attorney-general he will also be the public prosecutor , why did he accept the post ? <p> Why shy away from prosecution ? <p> For the benefit of politicians and the public who think that lawyers in private practice are great experts or even " kings " in all fields of law , and that legal officers in public service are " second class " lawyers , if not outright stupid , let me say this : <p> No lawyers in private practice have seen a criminal investigation file , what more studying them in detail in order to make a decision whether to prosecute , and they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no exception . <p> Defending a criminal case is much easier , as you can win a case merely on a mistake made by the prosecution which , even if you do not see it , the judge will catch . <p> Even then , I wonder whether Thomas had ever acted as a defence counsel in a criminal trial . <p> Prosecution is the most difficult , laborious , time-consuming and tiring of all legal work . Tommy Thomas has never experienced it . Is that the reason why he is shying away from it ? <p> Attorneys-general from the judicial and legal service like Abdul Gani Patail , Mokhtar Abdullah and Abu Talib Othman spent a lot of their time doing prosecution , all of them during the period when Dr Mahathir Mohamad was prime minister . <p> Gani continued to be attorney-general until he was relieved of his job by then-prime minister Najib Abdul Razak . Whenever there is a high profile case , they would lead the prosecution team . We expect Thomas to do the same . <p> Since he is not going to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deputy public prosecutors . <p> Or , is he going to appoint members of the Bar , on a larger scale than what the BN government did when it appointed Shafee Abdullah to represent the public prosecutor in Anwar Ibrahim 's second sodomy case , which Pakatan Harapan so strongly condemned ? The finance minister should be aware of this . <p> I would say that an officer from the judicial and legal service has better all-round experience and understands how the government machinery works , which will make him more suitable for the job of the attorney-general in this country . <p> I am sure many people would be surprised to read Article 145 of the Federal Constitution , which states : <p> " ( 1 ) The Yang di-Pertuan Agong shall , after consultation with the Judicial and Legal Service Commission , appoint from among the members of the judicial and legal service an attorney-general , who shall be a person qualified to be a judge of the Federal Court . <p> Note that the AG must come from the judicial and legal service . There must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would not do prosecution , would he have submitted his name for appointment as attorney-general ? <p> AGC will not represent EC ? <p> Now , I refer to his decision that officers of the Attorney-General 's Chambers will no longer represent the Election Commission in election petition cases . <p> " As the neutral arbiter in the conduct of elections , the EC should not be represented by members of the AGC because of any potential conflict of interest and the perception that justice must be seen to be done . <p> " Because members of the government are invariably parties to such election petitions , whether as MPs , state assemblymen or defeated candidates , it is invidious for the AGC to also act for the EC . " <p> Before going any further , let me state that in an election petition , in a straight fight between two candidates , there will be three parties -- the petitioner , that is , the losing party , the respondents consisting of the winning party , and the EC . <p> The grounds for the petition could be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the EC , or both . An example of the complaint against the winning party is the allegation of corruption , that is , voters were paid by the winning party or its agents to vote for its candidate . <p> Even though the allegation is only against the other candidate , EC is made a party to the petition so that whatever order is made by the court , will bind the EC . <p> Bear in mind that each party involved will engage his own lawyers , except the EC which will be represented by the AGC . <p> The reason why the AGC represents the EC is because it is a government agency , established by the constitution , fully financed by the government ; its officers are public officers subject to the laws and regulations applicable to civil servants , in the discharge of their official duties . <p> They can not be expected to pay from their own pockets . Neither the EC has an allocation for employment of private lawyers when sued because the AGC is there to represent it . <p> That is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cost the government anything extra and that has been the arrangement ever since the EC was established . <p> I spent forty years in the judicial and legal service and the judiciary . Not even once did I hear any complaint of conflict of interest , otherwise , I am sure , it would have been made a ground of such petitions . <p> Regarding public perception , how does it arise ? What prejudice or injustice does it cause to the petitioner ? I did not hear any such complaint as a ground of petition or otherwise . <p> In the example above , the legal officer would not be actively defending the petition as the allegation is not made against the EC . <p> Let me give another example , that is , where the allegation is made against the EC , say , it is alleged that the returning officer had wrongly refused a request for a recount . <p> Here , the legal officer from the AGC who represents the EC will take an active part to defend it . He acts as counsel to present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the court to decide . <p> Again , how does the conflict of interest or the perception arise ? It had never been an issue all these years . I just can not foresee how it can arise . <p> It is said that it may give rise to the perception that justice is not seen to be done , because the party involved may be a government MP , or , I would add , the PM himself . <p> How does the perception arise ? <p> With respect , I do not understand the logic of it . <p> Take the example that the allegation is made against the EC above . The winning party may be a government or an opposition MP . The legal officer 's duty is merely to prove to the court what was done by the returning officer was in accordance with the law . In doing so , he may be arguing in favour of the government or the opposition MP . <p> That is not his concern . He is a professional . So is the judge . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in favour of opposition and government MPs . In one case , I decided against a BN chief minister causing him to lose his job . <p> The question is how does the perception arise ? It looks as if it is an imagination of the AG of the perception of the public that does not exist , in other words , his unfounded imagination . <p> It is true that the EC is established as an independent commission by the constitution . So are the Judicial Appointments Commission , the Public Services Commission , the Police Force Commission and the Education Commission . <p> Even government departments , like the Audit Department , are required to act independently ( to avoid complications , I will not include the courts ) . <p> Based on the reasoning given by the AG , from now on the AGC will not be giving them any legal advice or represent them in any suit , civil claims included , nor represent their officers sued in respect of their official duties . <p> For sure , it will drastically reduce the volume of work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the number of legal officers at the AGC by half to fulfil Harapan 's election promise of trimming the civil service ? <p> On the other hand , all those commissions , including the Audit Department , will have to hire private lawyers for their legal work , which may run into millions . Where are they going to get the money from ? <p> Bear in mind that all those commissions are financed by the government . Applying the same reasoning , the Treasury should not allocate funds to them as it will give rise to public perception that they are not independent . <p> Of course , the members of the Bar will be happy as a lot of work will go to them , provided those commissions have funds to pay their bills . <p> That is the problem when you pick a lawyer , experienced only in running a law firm consisting of a few partners and a handful of staff , to head a huge legal department which services numerous government ministries , departments and agencies .

By early 2004 , she had dropped out of college , and used the remainder of her scholarship money to fund a healthcare start-up . <p> Groundbreaking idea <p> Holmes ' idea of an armband with microneedles was groundbreaking and futuristic ; it is just that in reality , it would take years to get it to work . Yet , she needed to keep raising money and her investors ' expectations to boost Theranos ' valuation . So , she quickly pivoted to a new device inspired by diabetes monitors that test blood sugar levels , and came up with something that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Essentially , she was proposing a full range of blood tests from a mere drop or two of blood from a single finger prick . <p> But , even that idea did not work , so Holmes pivoted to a device she dubbed " Edison " -- named after America 's best-known inventor . Basically , she bought a glue-dispensing robot off-the-shelf that was reprogrammed so that the robotic arm mimicked a lab scientist testing blood . The problem was that device could perform only 12 tests from a menu of 250 tests . The remaining 238 tests were run on commercial blood analysers made by competitor companies . What made things worse was Theranos modified the tests by diluting the blood sample to create more volume . That caused even more problems since it clearly put patients ' lives in harm 's way . Moreover , Theranos regularly rigged the tests to produce better results for its Edison devices . <p> There is a backstory to Holmes ' obsession to create something that would replace hypodermic needles . Her mother was terrified of needles , as was Holmes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when girls in her school were asked what they might do when they grew up , Holmes reportedly told her classmates that she wanted to become a billionaire busineseswoman . <p> Over the years , Theranos conducted eight million blood tests , of which one million have already been voided . The US Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services found that Theranos was running tests so haphazardly that some patients could be at risk of internal bleeding or stroke . The last iteration of Holmes ' device was dubbed Mini Lab -- a hacked Siemens machine that was supposed to test blood but that she could never get working . <p> Her powerful board of directors never realised anything was amiss . The veterans , who were all given millions of dollars of stock options for sitting on the board , just wanted relevance in retirement . In 2014 , Holmes blatantly asserted that Theranos was developing a US$100 million project with the Pentagon , the headquarters of the US Defense Department . Theranos never had a contract with Pentagon . <p> Holmes was obsessed with Apple co-founder Steve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turtleneck , and often used Jobs ' quotes that she had read somewhere . She liked referring to Theranos ' blood-testing systems as " the iPod of healthcare " when it was ? anything but . Indeed , Theranos ' obsession with fast-paced success and being " the next Apple " meant billions of dollars the firm raised were spent not on R&amp;D but on image-building and public relations as well as legal fees and internal security . <p> Early investors <p> Many billionaires and mega-millionaires , mostly old white men , were charmed by Holmes . Among the early investors were Oracle 's founder Larry Ellison and prominent venture capitalist Tim Draper . Another early investor was billionaire media tycoon Rupert Murdoch , who invested US$5.8 million in February 2005 and more later . At its height , Murdoch 's total investment in Theranos was worth over US$125 million . He was not alone staring at big losses . Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim , the world 's fourth-richest person , lost US$30 million ; the Walton family , heirs of Walmart founder Sam Walton , lost US$150 million ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ million . <p> Theranos was covered by a fawning tech media that specialises in the IT , software and internet sectors . Most reporters who cover tech do not understand the intricacies of medicine . One journalist who was not taken in by Holmes ' little white lies was John Carreyrou , an investigative reporter at The Wall Street Journal , which is owned by Murdoch 's News Corp . Carreyrou , who covered healthcare for years , was sceptical that a 19-year-old could be behind one of the biggest breakthroughs in medicine . He kept digging and uncovering her lies and eventually helped bring down the house of cards that Holmes had meticulously built . <p> At the height of WSJ 's reporting on the scam , Holmes visited Murdoch in his office and urged him to shut down the newspaper 's investigations . To his credit , Murdoch refused , telling her that he normally left editorial matters to the paper 's editors , who were best positioned to decide what was fit to print . The media baron put the newspaper 's credibility above his own financial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investment was wiped out . <p> So , what went wrong at Theranos ? Frankly , it did not have the technology or expertise that it claimed . ? Holmes hoodwinked savvy investors , some of the US ' best-known public figures and the media into believing something that nobody should have believed in the first place . Think about it : What kind of world do we live in where a 19-year-old girl with less than 16 months of college education , with little or no knowledge of medicine or the sciences , can come up with a groundbreaking idea on blood testing and be believed by the world 's most admired public servants and handed over a billion dollars by sophisticated billionaire investors ? <p> It is unclear whether Holmes will eventually face criminal charges , but she is set to be a household name . Jennifer Lawrence will play the Theranos boss in an upcoming Hollywood ? biopic directed by Adam ? McKay , who was also the director of The Big Short , based on the US subprime housing meltdown that triggered the 2008 global financial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Holmes is still young , and Americans believe in second chances and giving everyone a shot at redemption . Indeed , in recent weeks , as Theranos lays off the last of its remaining 20 or so workers and lights are switched off for the last time at its headquarters in Palo Alto , ? Holmes , still seen in her signature black turtleneck dress , has been visiting wealthy investors . Whether she gets funding for her next start-up or ultimately serves time in prison before getting a chance to pitch ideas again at investors looking for the next big hit , the Theranos drama and JLaw 's movie potrayal might someday be remembered as just an opening act for Holmes .

According to DoJ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was the referee for Tan to open an account with the bank . <p> Funds that originated in the 1MDB bonds issue that were deposited with the Bank of New York Mellon were transferred to the account of 1MDB Global Investments at BSI Bank in Lugano .

The email also falsely represented that the transfer of US$681 million to that account was pursuant to a shariah-compliant financing agreement , known as a mudharabah agreement , between Tanore and SRC International . <p> A supposed copy of that financing agreement was submitted to Falcon Bank to conceal the true nature of the payment to Malaysian Official 1 , which , if disclosed to the bank , would have required the bank to engage in additional compliance enquiries to verify the legitimacy of such a large transfer of funds to a high-ranking public official , the DoJ says . <p> On Aug 26 , 2013 , US$620 million was wired from a different account at AmBank to the Tanore account . This AmBank account also belonged to Malaysian Official 1 and the transfer represented funds from the US$681 million of payments that were being returned to the Tanore account . <p> A portion of the US$620 million that Malaysian Official 1 " returned " to the Tanore account was passed through various additional accounts controlled by Tan and Jho Low and was ultimately used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Najib 's wife . <p> The necklace was commissioned in July 2013 after the jeweller met Jho Low , Husseiny and the wife of Malaysian Official 1 in Monaco .

Naturally , seeing the pains and sacrifices he endured , the love and the ideals of the party were passed down to me and indeed became the core of what I believed in . <p> Over the past few decades and for most of my life until recently , I had served Umno loyally and to the best of my abilities . This was the party that truly cared for the Malays and at the same time very balanced , fair and gracious in its treatment to other races . <p> The party who fought not only for the Malays but genuinely cared for the interests of the rakyat , regardless of race or religion . This was the party that I knew and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Sadly , this is no longer the Umno of today . While Umno was founded upon the ideals of ensuring that the Malay race , the religion of Islam and culture were upheld and protected , this did not in any way mean that other races , beliefs and traditions should be marginalised . <p> As much as it pains me to admit , it is clear that the ideology and philosophy that Umno was built on have been twisted to become intolerant , self-centred and even undemocratic . Its leaders have grown elitist , too far removed and detached from the grassroots to listen or understand the needs of our rakyat . <p> Worse , these same leaders have practised and condoned a denial syndrome that has gone on for far too long , foregoing transparency and the rule of law in favour of their own excesses . Umno 's leadership in recent years has destroyed the party 's image , reputation and good name , as they allowed abuse of power and corruption to thrive . <p> Umno is not the party I had once known . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own survival and gain and cared little or none for the rakyat 's . The ideals which the party once held sacred were abandoned and at best used as rhetorical speeches for Umno politicians with vested interest . <p> Be that as it may , the principles the party once believed in are still very much alive in me and that ironically made me realise that I can no longer serve the party which abandons its principles or ideals . <p> Never had I thought there would come a day that I would abandon Umno -- the party that I was born into , the party that was selfless and instrumental in paving the way for the nation 's independence . <p> But seeing what it is today , the troubles it intentionally courted and the shenanigans its leaders involved in , I can no longer stay and pretend that all is all well and good . <p> Some may have seen or heard of my open support for Pakatan Harapan in the run-up to the recent GE14 .

He was expected to be charged on Wednesday in Kuala Lumpur , it said in a statement , without providing further details . Bernama News Agency reported he could face more than 10 counts of committing criminal breach of trust , citing a source . <p> Najib will be detained overnight at the headquarters of the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission in Putrajaya , according to an official . Authorities had earlier banned him from leaving the country . A spokesman for Najib , who has repeatedly denied wrongdoing , did n't immediately respond to calls seeking comment . <p> The arrest is the latest chapter in a stunning downfall for Najib , the son of a former prime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and subsequently rose to become Malaysia 's most powerful person . The 1MDB scandal galvanized an opposition led by his former mentor Mahathir Mohamad , who at the age of 92 rallied a disparate coalition to oust Najib from office . <p> " For Dr Mahathir , this is not just about winning the case but he also needs to show that his government is able to establish that Najib is guilty as charged and that these are not drummed up political charges , " said Eugene Tan , associate law professor at Singapore Management University . " Najib is not going to take this lying down . This will be the fight of his life with his liberty at stake . " <p> ' Wolf of Wall Street ' <p> Shortly after taking office , Mahathir revived a probe into the state investment company set up under Najib 's watch in a bid to recoup US$4.5 billion that went missing , as well as fees paid to Goldman Sachs Group Inc .

Markets were spooked by the May 23 disclosure that government debt and liabilities had jumped to 1.087 trillion ringgit ( US$268.4 billion ) , inflated by state guarantees for borrowing at 1MDB . The ringgit slid to a six-month low and overseas ownership of the nation 's bonds dropped to the lowest since August . The challenge now for Mahathir is to make good on his promises to root out the corruption he said is rife in many government departments . <p> Malaysia 's police last week said they had seized about US$273 million of items in raids linked to Najib . They included stacks of cash , Hermes International handbags , Rolex watches , a diamond necklace and more than 200 pairs of designer sunglasses . <p> The arrest on Tuesday was made in connection with SRC International Sdn Bhd , according to a statement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unit of 1Malaysia Development Bhd . Bernama reported in May that investigators had asked Najib about an unspecified amount of funds he had received from the company . <p> In January 2016 , former Attorney-General Mohamed Apandi Ali had cleared Najib of wrongdoing in connection with SRC , saying there was no evidence he knew that money from the company was transferred into his personal accounts . Meanwhile , Swiss investigators said in October 2016 that some US$800 million in natural-resource investments from SRC International appeared to have been misappropriated , hidden in part through the creation of a Ponzi scheme . <p> Najib 's supporters rallied to his defense on Tuesday . The women 's wing of Najib 's party , the United Malays National Organisation , called for a " transparent and fair " trial and said its members would hold special prayers for him . <p> " The trial should be a fair but speedy one for the sake of closing a sad chapter in the nation 's history , " said Oh Ei Sun , senior adviser for international affairs at the Asian Strategy and Leadership @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be drawn out as Najib has put together a stellar legal team .

@@25516238 <h> Trending Now <h> Balancing aesthetics with sustainability <p> THERE has been a long ongoing debate on form versus function but advancements in construction and green technology are allowing property developers to come up with buildings and structures that are both aesthetically pleasing and sustainable in the long-run . <p> In the past , the idea of sustainable buildings was often associated with only energy efficiency , carbon emissions and material chemistry issues , while design elegance or style was placed on the backburner . <p> However , the industry has grown leaps and bounds and developers in this era are able to build not only aesthetically pleasing but also sustainable buildings , says Real Estate and Housing Developers ' Association Malaysia ( Rehda ) president Datuk Seri FD Iskandar Mohamed Mansor . <p> " Buildings are built to serve the purpose of the community -- as a dwelling , office space , recreational centre , and so forth . An aesthetically-pleasing design is an added necessity to a building and the purpose it serves , " he tells EdgeProp.my . <p> He notes that elegant and visually attractive buildings that are also sustainable by global standards can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ones such as the Bahrain World Trade Center , Taipei 101 , Oasis Hotel in Singapore and Bank of America Tower in New York . <p> " We are living in an era where we do not have to make that choice between sustainability and beauty . Building sustainable and practical projects that are also good-looking is possible and has been done by many developers , " he adds . <p> This is because developers realise the need to be cognizant of environmental and sustainability issues and do their part while remaining relevant with the times and industry . <p> Most importantly , FD Iskandar stresses , they are also realising that buildings must also be practical and allow for sustainable maintenance in the long-run . <p> " Rehda promotes the adoption of the maintenance culture among all Malaysians , not only for enhancement in a property 's value , but also for enhanced quality of community living . <p> " Buildings are meant to serve a purpose . We wo n't be able to do much with buildings that are aesthetically pleasing but are not practical and not sustainable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sustainability and the culture of maintenance , " he opines . <p> Wisma Rehda a leading example <p> Taking the lead , Rehda built its headquarters Wisma Rehda with sustainability features incorporated into its functionality . Located in Kelana Jaya , Petaling Jaya , Selangor , the building was completed in 2012 even before the association launched its GREEN rating certification -- GreenRE -- in 2013 . <p> The 3-storey building with a built-up of 29,000 sq ft is purposeful , sustainable and visually pleasing . <p> According to FD Iskandar , the hot and humid environment is a major challenge for Malaysian developers , which have to find ways to design and build structures that could withstand the climate . <p> Wisma Rehda for instance , is designed to face south in order to avoid direct sunlight while its west-facing wall has a " double skin " that prevents heat from directly entering the building . All its office spaces are located at the north and east part of the building , well shaded from direct heat . <p> Unlike most office buildings , not many air-conditioning systems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it does not feel stuffy or warm inside as its two side facades face the prevailing wind direction ( north and south ) . <p> " 14 of the 22 rooms or 63.6% of the space have natural ventilation from prevailing winds . On top of that , the adoption of the Air Conditioning and Mechanical Ventilation ( ACMV ) System also helps in reducing heat in the building , " says FD Iskandar . <p> Water features at the entrance of Wisma Rehda also help to cool the air while creating a nice landscape . Water metres and water-efficient fittings are also installed at various locations to monitor usage and to detect leaks . <p> Meanwhile , the usage of tempered glass ceilings in the centre of the building allows sufficient amount of daylight into the building , thus reducing the use of electricity for lights . <p> Besides this , the building has a photovoltaic system to harness solar energy and rainwater harvesting system to collect water for cleaning purposes . <p> Retrofitting existing buildings for better efficiency <p> For existing buildings that do not have sustainable features @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ management corporations could consider retrofitting the building for better energy and water efficiency . <p> " First of all , it must be noted that getting a majority of the occupants or owners to agree to a very significant change involving substantial cost would be a challenge . Hence , it is essential to get it right from the very beginning at the planning and design stage , " he says . <p> Although it involves a high cost at the initial stage , existing buildings can benefit from retrofitting for sustainability and to reduce wastage . For instance , one could replace fluorescent lights with LED lights , install timers for pumps , use lift inverters and motion sensors . <p> However , he adds that a careful analysis to weigh the cost against the savings has to be conducted first to ensure that retrofitting is a viable option . It usually makes economic sense to retrofit existing buildings to incorporate sustainable features that could cut down energy consumption , operation and lifecycle cost , he explains . <p> " Energy efficiency is a big component of sustainable design @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for instance , will reduce energy bills , thereby offering a payback element to offset the additional capital expenditure . <p> " Lower electricity consumption will also have a knock-on effect of reducing our use of natural resources . Currently 90% of electricity in Malaysia is generated from non-renewable resources , " notes FD Iskandar . <p> Be a responsible buyer <p> A responsible homebuyer looking for a property with sustainability features should have a checklist in hand . Homebuyers can check with the developer if a project has been certified by green rating tools . A development that uses the Industrialised Building System ( IBS ) could also have adopted sustainability requirements within its design , construction , operation and maintenance . <p> One could also find out if the development utilises equipment or fittings that have energy-saving and energy-efficient labels . Besides this , a well-designed building has good natural ventilation to reduce indoor heat .

He was apparently not pleased with the progress , warning that some stern action needed to be taken to deal with the problem of delays . He was told that the new hospital at Petra Jaya had only been partially completed since work on it started five years ago . Extension of time to complete the project has not helped .

@@25533239 <p> Investors are keen on gauging the overall health of the local financial sector , specifically assessing if the recent shares selloff presents investors with a good buying opportunity . <p> It has been a steady quarter for banks in Malaysia -- domestic loan growth in the first quarter of 2018 ( 1Q18 ) of most banks was above the industry rate , although dampened by the slower pace of overseas loans . <p> Foreign exchange ( forex ) translation with the strengthening of the ringgit also affected the growth of international loans . <p> According to Affin Hwang Investment Bank Bhd ( AffinHwang Capital ) in a sector overview last week , stocks in its banking universe mostly saw a reversal in fortune over the past three months while succumbing to volatility in share prices . <p> It said the banking sector faces risk of further correction -- despite a recent decline , the valuation for the local banking sector has yet to reach its record low level . <p> This indicates that there could be risk of further correction . <p> In an analysis , AffinHwang Capital noted that the banking sector was now trading at an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ price-to-earnings ( P/E ) on a one-year forward basis . <p> This is compared to the sector 's all-time low of 1.13 times P/BV and 8.9 times P/E in 2009 . <p> The current inexpensive valuation of the sector was mainly attributable to the significant decline in the share prices of several large banking stocks such as Malayan Banking Bhd . <p> According to AffinHwang Capital , sentiment towards local banking stocks in general had turned sour in the last one month , as investors were spooked by potential resignations of CEOs of government-linked companies ( GLCs ) affecting the industry . <p> AffinHwang Capital was of the opinion that investor reaction to potential changes at GLCs was only a short-term effect . <p> " We believe that investor reaction to news of potential resignations of CEOs of GLCs may be temporary , and we expect share price recovery once there is more certainty with regards to news flows , " it opined in the report . <p> " At this juncture , we think earnings risk will be the biggest threat to our price targets ( for banking stocks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Based on our estimates , the sector is now trading at a 1.3 times its price to bool value ( PBV ) multiples and a 12 times its price to earnings ratio ( PE ratio ) at 10-year mean , based on a 1-year forward basis . <p> " Compared to the lows of 2009 , sector PBV touched 1.13 times while PE touched 8.9 times . <p> " At this juncture , we think earnings risk will be the biggest threat to our price targets . <p> " Otherwise , we believe that investors ' reaction to news of potential resignations of CEOs of government-linked companies ( GLCs ) may be temporary and we expect share price-recovery once there is more certainty with regards to news flows . <p> Going into specifics , the research firm saw that share prices of Malayan Banking Bhd ( Maybank ) , CIMB Group Holdings Bhd ( CIMB ) and Public Bank Bhd ( Public Bank ) saw the largest stock price correction in the last month . <p> Other financial stocks which saw recent pullback include Alliance Bank Bhd , Hong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given their strong fundamentals , the research firm believed his presents a buying opportunity for their shares . <p> " Should valuations stay low for certain banks -- such as with a PBV multiple at below one times -- we are of the view that industry mergers an acquisition ( M&amp;A ) activities could emerge , driven by the larger-sized banks with more robust return on equity ( ROE ) levels , " it advised . <p> The sector is currently trading at a 2018 estimated P/BV multiple of 1.3 times versus the past-10-year average of 1.47 times . <p> Kick-off the year with robust fundamentals <p> FundSupermart analyst Jerry Lee observed robust fundamentals since its first call on the Malaysia banking sector early this year , posting a rather respectable return of 4.6 per cent on a year-to-date basis . <p> It outperformed the broad index , FBM KLCI index by 6.8 per cent . <p> " In fact , prior to the 14th General Elections , the Financial sector delivered an even outstanding return year to date of about 8.9 per cent , " Lee said in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the increasing political and policy uncertainty amid the unexpected GE-14 results -- a change in new government for the first time in 61 years , Malaysia equity market witnessed significant foreign outflow since a week before the GE14 . <p> " As a result , the Financial sector which has previously benefited from the strong foreign inflow experienced inescapable intense selling pressure , posting 4.8 per cent of losses over the past one-month period . " <p> Lee said quite a number of banks maintained strong earnings momentum over the first quarter of 2018 with an average earnings growth of about 10 per cent year on year ( y-o-y ) . <p> Insignificant Impact from MFRS 9 <p> Generally , the impact of the new accounting standard , MFRS 9 on bank capital was insignificant . <p> In fact , on average , the actual impact of about 40bps and 20bps reduction in banks ' Common Equity Tier 1 ratio and Total Capital was much lower than the consensus estimates of about 50bps to 80bps reduction . <p> On top of that , after the reduction in the capital ratio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Malaysia 's Banks continue to stand comfortably above the minimum regulatory capital adequacy requirements for CET1 and Total Capital of 4.5% and 8.0% . <p> In addition , the credible rating agency , Moody 's Investors Service mentioned that the adoption of the new accounting standard is largely credit neutral on Malaysian Banks as they expect that the underlying economics of bank asset will remain unchanged . <p> All in all , after assessing the 1Q 2018 financial results , the impact of MFRS 9 was manageable for the Malaysian Banks and not as bad as what was predicted earlier . <p> Political uncertainty poses risks for banking system <p> Moody 's Investors Service cautioned that uncertainty over future policy changes by the new government will weigh on investor and business sentiment over the course of 2018 . <p> The international ratings agency in a June 18 note highlighted this on the back of reaffirming a stable outlook for the banking system in Malaysia ( A3 stable ) over the next 12 to 18 months . <p> Macroeconomic conditions will remain robust , Moody 's added , as it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to expand by 5.4 per cent in 2018 , with loans pegged to grow six or seven per cent in the same period . <p> " The removal of the goods and services tax ( GST ) could boost private consumption and benefit domestic businesses in the near term , " it said in its statement . <p> A key supporting factor of the stable outlook , it said , is the robust macroeconomic conditions in and outside Malaysia . <p> Moody 's vice president and senior analyst Simon Chen said this factor will result in a favourable operating environment for Malaysian banks and help stabilise their asset quality and profitability . <p> " At the same time , while we will see faster loan growth , such growth will remain at a pace that is slower than the banks ' profit retention , which will lead to stronger capital buffers , " he said . <p> Moody 's conclusions are contained in its just-released report on Malaysian banks titled " Robust macro conditions and improving capitalisation support stable outlook , " and is authored by Chen . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drivers : operating environment ( stable ) ; asset quality ( stable ) ; capital ( improving ) ; funding and liquidity ( stable ) ; profitability and efficiency ( stable ) ; and government support ( stable ) . <p> Moody 's said that the banks ' asset quality will stay stable , against the backdrop of easing stress among troubled corporates and slowing growth in household debt levels . <p> As for capitalisation , such levels will improve , as capital generation exceeds asset growth , and prove sufficient to cushion one-time adjustments to capital ratios to meet the MFRS 9 standard . <p> Moody 's also said that the banks ' funding and liquidity will stay stable . In particular , the banks ' loan-to-deposit ratios will rise as loan growth accelerates , but such ratios will remain below 100 per cent . <p> In addition , the banks will remain well positioned to comfortably meet minimum requirements under Basel III liquidity and funding rules . <p> Moody 's also saw that credit costs will rise because of the new MFRS 9 standard , but only slightly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ support for the banks in times of stress will continue to prove strong , " it continued . " Recent legislative reforms have not suggested any shift in the government 's policy for the resolution of troubled banks outside liquidation , with a lack of legislation to force bank creditors to bear the cost of any bank bailouts . " <p> The rated commercial banks accounted for some 85 per cent of total loans and deposits in the Malaysian banking system at the end of 2017 . <p> Moody 's has maintained a stable outlook on the Malaysian banking system since 2010 . <p> While policy uncertainty , following the surprising outcome of the recent 14th General Election ( GE14 ) , has a negative impact on the Malaysian banking sector , the downside risk to the sector 's earnings will likely be mitigated by cost discipline and stable credit growth . <p> According to UOBKayHian Research , post-GE14 , most banks in Malaysia are unlikely to perform as well as they did prior to the May 9 polls , hence the brokerage would maintain its " market weight " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uncertainty could have a slight dampening effect on the banking sector 's growth . <p> " As such , we believe the sector is unlikely to chart the same degree of outperformance prior to GE14 . <p> " Given this scenario , we reckon the sector could mirror the FBM KLCI performance in the second half of 2018 , with a slight upward bias as asset quality remains stronger than expected , " the brokerage wrote in its report . <p> " Our earnings growth assumption is driven by the prevailing positive operating jaws ratio , underpinned by well-controlled opex growth of only three per cent versus revenue growth of six per cent , but partially offset by a mild increase in net credit cost to 35bps in 2018 versus 32bps in 2017 , " it said . <p> The banking sector in general registered a decent earnings growth , in line with expectations , during the first quarter ended March 31 , 2018 . <p> AmInvestment Bank Bhd ( AmInvestment Bank ) in a June 26 report was also overweight on the sector with anticipation for the sector 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after lowering its expectation for banks ' non-interest income . <p> This will be contributed by an increase in revenue and improvement in operating expenses . <p> " For 2018 , we retain our loan growth expectation office per cent for the Malaysian banking industry supported by a GDP growth of 5.5 per cent . <p> " Domestic demand and improvement in external trade remain the drivers of economic growth . We expect loan growth of banks to improve in 2H18 , underpinned by a pickup in consumer loans . " <p> A stronger consumer spending is anticipated in the short-term period between the implementation of zero-rated GST and reintroduction of SST . <p> " We expect business loan growth to also improve , supported by the absence of large corporate loans repayments and a non-repeat of the forex translation impact seen in 1Q18 . " <p> Loans to the manufacturing , wholesale and retail sectors benefitting from the improvement in consumer spending are anticipated to be stronger compared to loans to the construction and construction-related sectors . <p> This is in view of the fact that several major infrastructure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AmInvestment Bank said . <p> The lagged repricing of banks ' deposit rates adjusting to the increase in OPR coupled with keener competition for deposits compared to 1H18 as the sector moves closer towards the implementation of net stable funding ratio ( NSFR ) will be the contributing factors . <p> Also , the tapering of margin is also expected to be partly attributed to pressures on the asset yield of banks ' subsidiaries in Indonesia ( Maybank Indonesia and CIMB Niaga ) . <p> " We expect bank 's net interest margins to expand by 2bps for 2018 against a projection of a 3bps increase previously . <p> " The OPR is likely to be maintained at 3.25 per cent in 2H18 . This is based on the headline inflation which is still expected to be low , thus sustaining a positive real interest rate . We project the inflation rate for 2018 to be two to 2.5 per cent . " <p> Meanwhile , the implementation of zero-rated GST effective June 1 until the reintroduction of SST in September provides a three months ' tax holiday , hence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -- both RON 95 and diesel until the end of 2018 -- are likely to keep a lid on inflation pressure . <p> Moving forward , FundSupermart 's Lee opined that household loan -- which accounts for more than 54 per cent of the total loan applied -- is expected to further improve due to the several recent policies announced by the new government . <p> These include the zero-rating of GST , abolishment of toll collections , stabilizing the RON 95 Petrol price as well as the Hari Raya special assistance to civil servants and pensioners which are expected to return about RM 20.7 billion to the people pocket . <p> " Prior to the implementation of SST in September 2018 , we believe the consumers are likely to utilize the window of opportunity to purchase the big-ticket items which would further drive the loan demand moving forward . <p> " This is exactly the reversal of what we have seen in the local private consumption when GST was first introduced in mid-2015 . <p> " All in all , we believe that the fundamental for the Banking sector @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foreign outflow . <p> " Although we are generally positive on the Banking sector , investors are reminded that there will be some potential risk especially the possible sovereign downgrade which could eventually trigger an even hefty sell-off by the foreign investors . <p> " On top of that , the recent decision made by the new government to cancel several mega infrastructure projects might also dampen the business loan growth moving forward . <p> " However , given the expectation that the economic activity is likely to remain healthy in the quarters ahead coupled with the improving loan demand especially and the decent fundamental of the banking sector , we believe the sector could outperform the broad index in the next few quarters . " <p> AmInvestment Bank 's share performance reviews <p> RHB Bank : <p> We continue to like the stock due to an undemanding valuation , trading at 0.8x to FY19 BV/share . Also , the group 's asset quality is improving with provisions declining . <p> We expect earnings to improve in FY19 with a stronger revenue leveraging the group 's transformation initiatives .

Potentially , the cash portion of its dividends is likely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the reinvestments under the DRP . This is due to the gradual improvement in risk weighted assets despite the group 's expansion in assets . <p> Unclear stance in property sector affect banks <p> A major sector affecting the performance of banks is property , plagued by oncertainties as the new govenrment under the Pakatan Harapan ruling hopes to address and rebalance housing issues and policies as fairly as it can . <p> Kenanga Investment Bank Bhd ( Kenanga REsearch ) in its third quarter strategy report for properties saw that valuationon for property players under its purview were near rock bottom . <p> " Our universe 's average RNAV discount is now at 63.4 per cent or close to its historical peak level of 68.5 per cent . <p> " In terms of forqward PBV , we note that the following developers are trading at historical lows and are well below their own book values such as UEMS , IOIPG , SP Setia Bhd , Huayang Bhd , and Sunsuria Bhd . <p> " For big land-bank owners namely UEMS , IOIPG , and SPSETIA ; note that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bulk of acquisitions made several years ago , implying low land costs compared to prevailing market value -- it also means that the company 's valuations imply no further development profit . " <p> This may be a primer for potential mergers and acquisitions ( M&amp;As ) or even privatisation plays , Kenanga Research said , but at this juncture , it has yet to hear any whispers on the matter . <p> " We view the Financial sector ( KLFIN ) as key driver of the property sector as most house purchases are financed by home loans . <p> " The construction sector ( KLCON ) is equally important to the property sector as it is a cost factor which ultimately influences developer 's margins . " <p> The firm went on to highlight that higher business risk profiles should be commensurated by higher return on equities ( ROEs ) . <p> " Based on the type of risks undertaken by each of the players , it is fair to assume that banks carry the heaviest risks being the end-financier which has longer loan tenures -- some also finance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buyers . <p> " This is followed by developers which carry the development risks but has a shorter ' holding ' tenure and faster capital recovery than end financiers , and contractors carrying the least risks amongst the three players as it is more service-oriented in nature . <p> " So , it stands to reason that the KLFIN 's ROE should be higher than the KLPRP , while the KLPRP 's ROE should be higher than KLCON 's -- this was the case prior to CY16 but since then , the KLPRP 's ROE is currently below the KLFIN and KLCON , weighing down on property stocks ' valuations . " <p> But will property valuations re-rate ? Kenanga Research believes the sector needs further policy clarity , particularly on the affordable housing policy ( including a national database ) , which requires time for the new ruling government to study . <p> Minister of Housing and Local Government ( KPKT ) Zubaida Kamaruddin previously confirmed with a previous interview with BizHive Weekly that it will enter into discussions with the Ministry of Finance ( MoF ) and Bank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ current lending guidelines to enable more home buyers from the B40 and M40 groups to secure housing loans . <p> Part of the evaluation is expected to consider family household income as opposed to just individual income and widening the scope of rent-to-own ( RTO ) schemes . <p> " However , even if there is easing , we believe it will at best , only sufficient to help developers maintain current sales momentum for reasons we will elaborate below , " Kenanga Research added . <p> Thus , there was a need for further clarity in affordable housing policy . Under Pakatan Harapan 's manifesto , one of the promises is to build one million affordable homes across Malaysia within two terms of the new ruling government -- this implies an average of 100,000 new units per annum over a 10-year period . <p> " While this promise bodes well for the national aim to increase homeownership , it begs the question ; will listed developers see competing future supply ? , " it asked . <p> " Will there be room for the pie grows for house buying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the sector . <p> " Even residential loans applications and approvals indicators have shown strong improvements , we note that this has not been felt by our universe of developers ; in our earlier reports , we highlighted this could be due to competition from government housing schemes and other non-listed developers which are catering for this affordable market . " <p> With very flattish residential transactions , developers have had to fight for market share to achieve their sales targets . <p> Over CY17 , Kenanga Research did not observe any significant improvements in its universe 's market share on a year-on-year basis . <p> " We think the current banking system 's real-estate appetite has moderated from its peak three to five years ago , " it believed . " Currently , the proportion of housing to total banking system loans is at a record high of 31 per cent . "

@@25587237 <p> Interior Minister Horst Seehofer finally got to present his migration " master plan " to the press on Tuesday , a month after it was blocked at the last minute by Chancellor Angela Merkel , precipitating a crisis in the German government that almost cost them both their jobs . <p> Seehofer also hinted at the delay in publication by pointing out that the delayed release of his plans came on his 69th birthday , noting that this coincided with the return of 69 people to Afghanistan from Germany , and quipping , " that was not on my order . " <p> The minister did not appear to have been out to calm the waters more generally , calling reporters to a press conference in the Interior Ministry to present a plan that did not include the 11th-hour compromises made by the government last week , which averted his resignation . <p> Instead , Seehofer , who is also head of the Christian Social Union ( CSU ) , the Bavarian sister party to Merkel 's Christian Democratic Union ( CDU ) , emphasized that " this is n't a master plan of the coalition , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ referring to the Interior Ministry , but could also be presenting a plan by his party . <p> The document published on Tuesday , he said , had been finalized on July 4 , which meant that it did not include the compromises made last week with Merkel and with the coalition 's junior partner , the Social Democratic Party ( SPD ) . He also admitted that it was not yet clear which measures contained in the plan the center-left would agree to . <p> An old new plan <p> Perhaps most provocatively , Seehofer 's plan still contained the term " transit centers , " which the SPD had vetoed in favor of " transit procedures , " and which has already been ditched by the government he represents . Still , the interior minister refused to admit it was a provocation -- at least not in so many words . " It is not a provocation , but if you like , you could also see it that way , " he told the Bild newspaper elliptically . <p> In its introduction , the plan also demands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We want to stop people disappearing during or after their asylum procedures , or hide their real identities . " <p> Seehofer 's " master plan , " now effectively published after it has gone out of date , included so-called transit centers situated at the German-Austrian border , in which asylum seekers would be held if another country was found to be responsible for their applications . <p> Instead , the German government , apparently worried by the prospect of keeping asylum-seekers in what might look like concentration camps , agreed last week to an SPD amendment : implementing fast-tracked transit procedures in existing border police stations , which would ensure that asylum seekers are returned to other countries within 48 hours . <p> This will require bilateral agreements with other European Union countries , especially Austria , Italy , and Greece . Seehofer said that such an agreement had already been made with Austria . <p> Other measures in the master plan ( most of which are backed by Merkel ) include : <p> - Tougher sanctions against asylum-seekers , especially those who return to their countries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well as those who do not attend integration courses . <p> - More " anchor centers " : Seehofer has long since called for these " one-stop " centers , where asylum-seekers will be registered , have their cases considered , and be deported from all as quickly as possible . However , these would have to be administered at state level , and Germany 's state governments have been reluctant to implement the plans so far . <p> - More EU border protection : Apart from reinforcing the EU 's border security force FRONTEX , as agreed at a Brussels summit at the end of June , Seehofer also wants to install " disembarkation platforms " in North Africa . The problem here is that no North African country has yet agreed to allow such a platform to be built . Merkel and Seehofer are both hoping that agreements similar to the one struck with Turkey two years ago can be reached . <p> The circus continues <p> Seehofer 's decision drew irritation from his Social Democrat coalition partners , whose deputy chairman Ralf Stegner told the DPA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all in another performance in the CSU summer theater . Our common master plan is and remains the coalition contract -- and Mr. Seehofer has enough to work on there .

@@25587240 <h> Lives of youth matter more <p> DEAR " bro " Syed Saddiq , first and foremost congratulations for the well-deserved appointment . We are privileged to have the youngest minister in the Cabinet ( throughout its history ) to act as a constant reminder that our youth has arrived and it matters . More so for the portfolio accorded to you and your deputy " bro " Sim . The combination is formidable but there is a caveat to it , viz , provided we are able to address three major concerns as discussed below . The reasons are simple , namely , each issue is in itself a " black hole " that sucks our youth away from the rightful role or place in our society where they are expected to contribute as citizens of this beloved country . <p> While we are sure you are planning to take them forward over the next five years ( if not more ) , much of the aspirations will fall on the wayside if these concerns are not effectively dealt with once and for all . Overall , the threat it has on youth can not be overstated . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worsening " state of drug abuse in our society . This is an overdue social time bomb that seems to be intractable since about 50 years ago . You were not born yet , but it is still very much alive with no apparent solution in sight . It only means that many young lives have been lost over the five decades , and many more will be wasted in the future if the issue is left to " grow " like a multi-headed hydra . For example , not too long ago we saw the incursion of e-cigarettes in our midst playing " havoc " with very lethargic public policy decisions . It creates yet another gateway for youth , enticing them to be hooked on other hard drugs . In the near future Malaysia will be facing another incursion , specifically cannabis or ganja if the global trend to decriminalise it continues as we have seen in some countries recently . In short , the prevailing drug abuse problem can get worse ; distracting the youth from your plans to take them forward to the next level . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drug abuse as part of their immediate concern , if at all , which in part explains the dire situation today . We do hope you will make the difference this time . <p> The second is an emerging issue generally related to mental health problems , with depression coming up very strongly as the case in point . While it could be seen as another " health " problem like that of drug abuse , the fact remains that youth are said to be at the centre of it all . Worse still , many are not even aware that they are involved or know how to cope with it . This can be life-threatening when they are subjected to stressful ways of life with suicidal tendencies taking precedence . Otherwise , due to pressures brought about by fast changing global scenarios ranging from the deterioration of the ecological environment to geopolitical ones , resulting in prolonged uncertainties . All these culminated in the youth becoming more vulnerable in the search for identity and support in quality living . Failing which they sink into the world of depression that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " when associated with the first . Depression no doubt can drag some into the world of drug abuse in the quest for escapism making the condition even more life-threatening . That is to say drug abuse will continue to be on demand creating an endless , addictive vicious cycle . <p> The third , by no means the last , is the " new " threat of digital addiction , more specifically termed as " screen " addiction . Of late , the World Health Organisation has recognised " gaming ( behavioural ) disorder " as a form of mental health aberration mostly interfaced through devices with a " screen " attached . More and more of such devices are shaping our lifestyles . Needless to say the youth community is/will be the most affected given their way of life that is virtually screen-related . Consequently new types and range of addictions are expected to be on the rise as seen today when the population are hard-wired with information and communication technology . Most unfortunately this is prevalent among youth ( especially boys ) who are more deprived socio-economically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is no wonder many countries , of late France , decided to disallow e-devices to be used during school hours in an effort to bring back face-to-face interactions among them . Others provide " hotels " for such devices -- to be checked in when attending school and checked out when leaving . The overall aspiration is not just to develop a disciplined way of managing e-devices but also to warn against the notable negative emotional and mental health issues affecting the students insidiously . This takes us full circle to the above-mentioned predicaments making the situation even more complex in the search for lasting solution(s) . <p> While it is logical to argue that all of the above falls foremost under the ambit of various designated ministries , it must be recognised that it is the youth who will face the ultimate brunt should the relevant ministries slag off as the case seems to be . Meaning , that the Ministry of Youth and Sports will have to pay a high price to see its constituency shrink ( in numbers and quality ) if it too turns a blind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open letter to call to your attention to take the path not travelled by urgently moving things around to save precious lives other than just winning medals as a measure of " real " success . This is after all the dawn of a " new " Malaysia . And the lives of innocent youth matter much more .

The first-time minister , like many of his contemporaries , is still getting used to the job , immersing himself in meeting after meeting to get to grips with the different facets of the ministry he is now in charge of . <p> The reformasi war horse has come a long way . He started his career in politics with Umno in 1990 and was a rising star in the youth wing . But when Datuk Seri Anwar was fired as deputy prime minister and deputy president in 1998 , Saifuddin stood by him -- which got him sacked from Umno too and he went on to be one of the founders of Parti Keadilan Nasional . <p> His struggles as a politician has seen him falling to the depths and scaling the heights in politics , where he now has immense responsibilities as a minister , who in more ways than one , is connec ? ted to people on the ground . <p> The public will know him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cost of living . From the prices of goods they pay for food to petrol , Saifuddin 's ministry is under the microscope to ensure that living costs are brought under control . <p> But his responsibilities are more than just keeping tabs on the price of everyday goods and ensuring that consumer 's rights are protec ? ted , he tells Sunday Star about his new tasks . <p> It has been over a week since you started at the ministry . What are your immediate challenges ? <p> Ini memang hot seat betul ! ( This really is a hot seat ! ) We need to manage the public opinion and public perception on certain things , ( what to ) come out as announcement . You ca n't avoid this because the challenge is to come up with a proper script and narrative that is accurate . I attended a briefing on the findings about the price of goods after the abolition of the GST . <p> We have 1,044 officers who keep track on prices . Their job is to go out and check on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fast food restaurants , mamak restaurants . Every day they update ( the prices ) . They did a survey of 417 items including food items , from 1 June to 5 July at over 17,000 premises which I think that 's fairly representative . It is analysed here . <p> After we zero-rated the GST , there are items that have not increased in prices . However , out of the 417 items that we surveyed , there are items that are exempted from GST . So after the GST is zero-rated , there is no GST either . So my officers found that there are some prices that did n't increase . There are items that saw a slight reduction in prices , but these are negligible . It is 0.04% . The largest drop in prices is 13% . <p> Out the survey of 417 items that saw a drop between 0.04%-13% , how many items actually saw a drop in price ? It 's 70% of them . But if the headlines read " 70% of items saw a drop in prices " that 's misleading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reduction in prices " . It did n't drop by a large percentage , but that is the findings . <p> Are those findings good or bad ? <p> The prices could drop further , it could happen . But that is the actual findings . And that triggered a few measures being taken . We took a look at the number of complaints that increased . In May , we had only 1,400 complaints . In June , they increased to 4,500 . When we did an analysis , we found that 50% of complaints were on prices that did n't change or prices that increased involving restaurants , cafeteria and food outlets . <p> I am reliant on the information from the officers , but I choose to go down to the ground . I chose a market in Pantai Jerejak ( he is the state assemblyman ) . I spent about an hour there . I spoke to traders and housewives who were shopping . A trader who sold onions and dried chillies thanked me and told me he has more customers after the GST was zero-rated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheaper price and in return is able to sell his product cheaper too . <p> I went to a shop selling spices . The trader there said the same thing , that there are more customers . I thought that is a clear indication of the ( increased ) purchasing power and confidence of consumers . They are spending . <p> Previously , when consumers get their salary , they would ( apportion ) it for bill utilities , car insurance , house rental and toll money . They were very frugal . ( So ) if the traders can tell you that now the number of customers has increased , that is a clear indication . People now dare to spend . <p> KPDNHEP is usually associated with issues related to cost of living . In your opinion , is it right that the ministry alone holds that responsibility given that there are broad considerations such as currency exchange or supply and demands that are not within the jurisdiction of the ministry ? Are there new measures or policies that the ministry plan to introduce to address cost of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planning to improve the Consumer Protection Act ( CPA ) 1999 to protect the interest and rights of consumers . The ministry is hoping to conduct a research to provide greater protection for consumers as there may be some gap which needed to be addressed to protect consumers from unscrupulous businesses . <p> First of all , we need to understand the definition of cost of living . <p> " Cost of living " can be defined as the average cost of food , clothing and other necessary or usual goods and services paid by a person or family . Cost of living not only covers prices on goods and services but is also covers other elements such as housing expenses ( rental , maintenance ) transportation expenses ( fuel , fare ) and utilities ( water , electricity ) . <p> The cost of living issues in Malaysia is not only under KPDNHEP jurisdiction but involve other ministries such as Housing and Local Government ( housing/rental ) , Energy , Technology , Science , Climate Change and Environment ( utilities ) and Transport ( public transport/fare ) . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Living . This council serves as the main body to address issues and challenges regarding cost of living that affects people 's well-being . The ministry will be the main secretariat and the council will focus on cost of living issues in the various sectors . We will reactivate the council as soon as possible . <p> The anti-profiteering law gave the authority to your enforcement division to take action against excessive pricing . Is this applicable to all types of goods/products including house or land ? If not , why ? <p> The Price Control and Anti Profiteering Act 2011 ( PCAPA 2011 ) is enforced by the ministry to deal with unreasonable profiteering activities via the Price Control and Anti-Profiteering ( Mechanisms to Determine Unreasonable High Profit ) Regulation 2018 . This regulation applies to all goods and services including home and land . However , we do not control house and land prices . The ministry leaves it to market forces . <p> Profiteering is determined by applying the mechanism under section 15 of the PCAPA . It occurs when the profit percentage of the current year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The mechanism is not intended to determine or restrict businesses from making profits . Traders still have the freedom to determine the profits and prices of goods and services being sold or supplied to consumers . This legislation is a way for the government to control traders from exploiting the situation and making excessive profits . <p> Fuel price has always been a subject widely followed by the public . Is the present price mechanism working well or is there any plan to come out with new policies to determine the price ? <p> The price of fuel in Malaysia is determined by the Government based on the Automatic Pricing Mechanism ( APM ) since April 1994 . Components in the APM consist of product cost , alpha , operation cost , oil company margin and petrol station dealer 's margin . <p> The Government is aware that the rise in petrol and diesel prices will burden consumer 's pockets . That is why on June 7 , the Government decided to maintain the price of petrol RON95 at RM2.20 per litre and the price of diesel at RM2.18 per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thursday as this is a premium product . By maintaining the price a current levels , consumers are able to enjoy lower oil prices than actual market prices . <p> Another area the ministry is involved in -- free trade agreement negotiations . Can you elaborate the ministry 's role vis a vis FTAs ? Which are the divisions or agencies involved in FTAs or meetings at international level ? <p> KPDNHEP is involved in international intellectual property ( IP ) , competition and state-owned enterprises ( SOEs ) negotiations in multilateral forums such as the World Trade Organisation , World Intellectual Property Organisation ( Wipo ) , Asean , Apec and UN Conference on Trade and Development . The ministry through its international section of policy and strategic planning division also leads negotiations on IP , competition and SOEs chapters in bilateral and regional free trade agreements such as Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership ( RCEP ) and Comprehensive and Progressive agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership ( CPTPP ) . <p> The ministry 's positions in FTA negotiations are based on domestic laws and policies and best practise approaches along with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IP and competition policies .

@@25744234 <p> A few days ago , TM had set up a page where you can check if you 're getting the announced speed upgrade . To recap , existing Unifi customers can get up to 10X faster speeds of up to 800Mbps while Streamyx customers will get 2X faster speeds . Unfortunately , due to high traffic , TM 's website could n't cope and many Unifi and Streamyx customers were unable to verify their status . <p> To address the issue , TM had sent out emails to selected customers to inform them that they are in line to get the speed upgrade . If you have n't received it yet , you can check your inbox for the subject " Get ready for turbo speed Internet ! " <p> What we noticed is that the message is generic to all subscribers that qualify to get TURBO-ed . It just mentions that you 'll be one of the first to get up to 10X faster speeds and the upgrade will be rolled out in phases starting 15th August 2018 . As highlighted previously , some eligible customers will be getting their upgrade between August to December 2018 while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2019 . The email also fails to mention what speeds they will be upgraded to and it is a far cry from the previous upgrade exercise . <p> Do note that the actual speed you 're getting is still subject to technical availability . If you 're staying in a high-rise building using VDSL ( copper wire ) , the chance of getting any speed upgrade is much lower compared to those residing at landed properties which are connected with 100% fibre . <p> The biggest question left to be answered is what happens to those who are not eligible for the upgrade ? Will they be bumped up to the next best speed possible ( e.g. 10Mbps to 30Mbps ) and whether TM will offer a rebate or discounted add-ons for unlimited mobile postpaid and wireless broadband ? <p> If you 're not eligible for an upgrade , will you still continue with TM or will you consider switching to other providers ? Let us know in the comments below . <p> Who is " everybody " ? Maxis has its own NGBB network and TIME has its own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are superior to TM 's " barai " network filled with spying and traffic shaping lame firewalls . Maxis fibre has green stripe and TIME fibre is red . If you see yellow stripe fibre in your area , then bad luck for you lah . <p> Stupid marketing lie . Maxis and TIME are superior to TM when you 're on their own network . Pings and international connectivity is excellent . Torrents load as smooth as butter one . Only if you 're using Maxis Home Fibre on TM 's HSBB then probably it sucks . <p> Later they sell you 1Gbps plan also no use , do speedtest to USA or UK , speed result only 10mbps . Just like many Singkies regret buying 2Gbps plans all now want to downgrade to cheaper 300-500Mbps plans because feel like cheated . Do n't believe me ? Go to Speedtest site , select a far away server in other region such as China , Germany or East Coast USA . You 'll be disappointed with the speed result . <p> That 's why there are Content Delivery Networks or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speed up large downloads from the likes of Microsoft , Youtube , Netflix , Google , Facebook , Apple , AWS , Steam etc . Very few major downloads need to go outside Malaysia/Singapore due to CDNs today . <p> Your argument is invalid and dumb , nowadays with CDN all over the world no point doing impractical speed test to overseas servers . I can even download Steam games , Origin games , Nvidia drivers with max speed thanks to CDN . <p> I am in X2 residency ( Puchong ) . We have fibre to the building so I assume I will go from 30 to 300mb ( already received the email ) . Have to say this is an excellent move .... increasing by a factor of 10 is unheard of and I have lived in many countries . In the past 7 months the internet has been down for 2.5 hrs only . I look forward to the upgrade , hopefully it will be in August . Well done Unifi <p> Enjoy your speedtest results only to local Malaysian servers la . TM wo n't be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not prepared and capable of doing so . Many regional Tier-1 isps are shunning this useless company from their expansion plans . Already TM was n't invited to join the new upcoming SJC2 cable in 2020 with 14TB initial capacity . SG , Thailand , Cambodia and Vietnam all are members.Nowadays isps such as Singtel , TrueOnline and Telin all for test serves around the world . Where got like incompetent TM still asking subscribers to trust local speedtest server only ? <p> Lucky for those who had fiber installed . Like me they wont install fiber cable even I loyaly paid the bill every month and they ask me to wait every time i ask when . 2 years and 7 month now i have waited for unifi . <p> For those who are not eligible for speed upgrade they should give 50% rebate instead of giving unifi mobile or hypptv package which is not equivalent value to permanent speed upgrade . Hypp rv packages is only for 1 year , unifi mobile still need to pay , not free . So how these offering is equivalent for those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call from TM , straight told them if need to upgrade just upgrade but still the girl insisted on thumb print . Was surprised told the girl not free . All the trouble just for upgrading ? Might as well forget it ! <p> They ca n't even unify their entire network with standard equipment setup and buildouts , do n't expect professionalism from TM . Where got telco company tell its fibre customers some of you can get upgrades some of you can not . There 's very serious corruption , theft and looting going on in this company that resulted in this situation today . If you ca n't cover the entire country then give out to other companies to build fixed lines lah . <p> Tm personnel are very unprofessional . If you took down the ' check for verification ' feature from your website , why do n't a statement be made on your homepage ? Standard typical poor Malaysian mentality , no announcement and lack of basic courtesy ! <p> Where got telco so incompetent and got face to tell its customers that some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charging everyone the same price ? You think this is lottery draw ah ? It 's like selling mystery packs and boxes to people all at same price and telling people it 's your luck if it 's empty inside.This is serious opening for corruption and misappropriation of universal funds to be investigated by MACC and MCMC . <p> Half price ? You should n't even be paying more than RM10 for 2M-4M rusted copper ADSL plans . 5-10M plans should n't even cost more than RM50 . What they 're doing now is indirectly telling their customers , sorry if you 're bad luck for not being eligible for the upgrades , but you still need to pay the same as others who are lucky enough to enjoy the speed upgrades . You think this is insurance scam or lottery draw ah ? Many people are going to be pissed including existing customers left out and new potential customers who are interested in subscribing . <p> I need upgrade my stremyx speed.i just have maximum 2mbps only.how can ! ! ! please help me upgrademy stremyx up to 10mbps.my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let us can installation unifi but still not yet . <p> I was told that even if you 're a new subscriber next year when this is fully rolled out , you will not get these speeds.They 're only for existing customers who subscribed Unifi in 2018 and before . WTF ? So they just slam the door shut for interested future Unifi subscribers leads ? No thank you ! <p> What can TM offer to those who already on 8mbps streamyx line and no unifi availabe .. honestly 512kbps upload in 2018 is beyond slow .. can they unlock faster connection for streamyx user ? Atm it bit a let down .. <p> Ponzi pyramid scams actually work like this . They tell all their customers pay the same rate but only their own founding family members , cronies and kakis are the only ones benefiting from it to convince the other dumb victims.Many existing TM customers are going to feel betrayed and pissed with this move.I 'm not a Unifi subscriber yet so I asked a reseller days back about the possibility of being eligible for these new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I immediately get such speeds if my area is ready . He told me no I wo n't be eligible , if you want to qualify must subscribe now . I my mind I was thinking whether I should shove my middle finger down his rear . <p> DiGi 's backhaul network runs on TIME 's fibre nationwide network in major cities and town . That 's why some of you will see TIME laying cables in your city or town but no signs of their TIME Home Fibre around . TM 's HSBB is a lame and cacat network that no other providers want to rent if they had the choice . <p> If I am not eligible for the upgrade than I will change to Times . Remember when I started using streamyx , the speed is only 512 . Each time they encourage me to upgrade.So now I am using Unifi . So I hope I am eligible .

The culture of corruption , impunity and greed is so pervasive that it touches almost every aspect of life in our nation . <p> It is a staggering fact that each year billions upon billions of public fund -- our money -- are stolen by corrupt politicians and civil servants . A recent Transparency International Malaysia report , for example , noted that we , the people of Malaysia , lost RM46.9 billion in 2017 due to corruption within the public sector ; an amount higher than all the GST collected that year . <p> As well , year after year , Malaysia is singled out for mention internationally for illicit financial outflows . Last year , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ illicit financial outflow per capita in the world . And all we do is make a few sanctimonious speeches about how committed we are to tackling corruption . <p> When we are going to get angry enough ? <p> When are we going to get angry enough with this brazen wholesale theft of our money to do something about it , to demand that our politicians and our justice system bring to book these thieves -- no excuses , no compromises and no mercy . <p> We 've been fooling ourselves that there is even a modest effort going on to slay the demon of corruption . The fact is we 've long since lost the war on corruption despite the occasional headlines of some major arrest . Even when there 's an arrest , there 's no guarantee that the culprits will go to jail . Remember the RM12 billion PKFZ scandal ? Remember the RM250 million ' Cowgate ' scandal ? <p> Vast sums of public money disappear and no one is held responsible -- scandals without culprits , crimes without criminals . <p> And we 've lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we ca n't win but because the political will to seriously root out corruption wherever it may be found is lacking . <p> Great expectations <p> There is great expectation that our new government , born out of our long struggle for justice , and now comprising several vocal anti-corruption crusaders , would aggressively move not just to strip away the impunity that corrupt officials have long enjoyed but to ruthlessly destroy the very culture that enables corruption to thrive . <p> To be sure the task facing our new government is a broad and massive one . It will take time and much effort to put in place the kind of legal , political and ethical infrastructure to effectively eradicate corruption . However , impressions and perceptions are important even in these early days as people look to see just how serious the government is on the issue . <p> No doubt , the government is right to focus on the 1MDB scandal and endeavour to bring to justice all the crooks involved but does it also plan to go after the dozens of other crooks out there who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear senior officials say that they investigated a certain tycoon in Sarawak a few years ago and found no evidence against him we have to wonder whether Najib-era cover-ups are still going on . <p> What we would like to see , even in these early days , is a clear and unambiguous signal that there will be no compromise in the fight against corruption -- not just against Najib but against anyone anywhere who is found to be corrupt . Is tougher legislation in the offing ? Will the MACC be given independent prosecutorial powers ? Will it be completely free of political interference ? <p> The government can also do much to restore public faith in the fight against corruption by bringing in someone with unimpeachable credentials and integrity -- someone like former Court of Appeal Judge Mohd Hisamudin Yunus , for example -- to overhaul and oversee the war against corruption . <p> Just look at how a few inspired appointments -- theSpeaker of the Dewan Rakyat , the Attorney-General , the Chief Justice of Malaysia , the Chief Judge of Malaya -- radically altered the public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ priority <p> The fight against corruption is one of our most important national priorities ; it deserves to be given high priority .

Just recently the prime minister announced , to the delight of the nation , that all repressive laws will be repealed . I hope the government will also delight the nation with its determination to finally slay the demon of corruption .

@@25948232 <h> Cover Story : ' We put our own reputations on the line ' <p> SAPURA Energy Bhd chairman and non-independent non-executive director Datuk Hamzah Bakar , who doubles as the chairman of the board remuneration committee , and independent non-executive director Gee Siew Yong , who is the chairman of the board audit committee , sat down with The Edge to discuss the events at the company 's annual general meeting last Wednesday . At the AGM , some shareholders questioned the board on several issues , including president and CEO Tan Sri Shahril Shamsuddin 's pay package of RM71.92 million in FY2018 and an additional RM43.4 million he took home from an intellectual property rights payment . <p> Here is an excerpt from the interview . <p> The Edge : Were you surprised by the eventful AGM ? <p> Datuk Hamzah Bakar : They chose to ignore some points ... for example the fact that when we pay a bonus , the board wants to make sure that the result is indisputable ; we take the decision on the bonus after we approve the audited accounts . <p> Therefore , the bonus for performance in FY2017 ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2017 . We ca n't put it in the FY2017 accounts , so we put it in the FY2018 accounts . But unluckily for us , we suffered a loss in 2018 . So it looks like we paid a bonus when we made losses . <p> It just so happens that in 2017 , we made profits . It ( the bonus ) is not just ( based on ) financial ( results ) . We have business development , we have cost savings , strategy , restructuring , business opportunities , new contracts won and so forth . All those count ... so , it 's unfortunate . <p> The other element that nobody wants to acknowledge , although we have told them , is the long-term incentive plan . Say for 2017 , we paid 50% of the allocated amount , the rest is in the following two years . If the following two years are loss-making , you still have to pay . The rationale for deferring is so that he ( Shahril ) stays . <p> Gee Siew Yong : The whole purpose of an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that staff , not just Tan Sri ( Shahril ) but all those who are eligible , have a longer-term view of the company . They earn it , they get granted , according to the criteria that are set , but they do n't even receive it until over three years . <p> But because of this rollover -- I would n't even call it unfortunate -- we have tried to explain this but if ( shareholders ) choose not to understand , what can we do ? <p> These are the facts we have articulated when queried , so it 's not like you ( shareholders ) were told yesterday . They have raised it , and we just said ' noted ' and did nothing . That is not quite an accurate picture . <p> Are these explanations done on a regular basis ? <p> Hamzah : Last year , they ( the EPF ) raised this issue at the AGM and we explained . We made it a point to explain clearly . <p> The other point is that when we go to the banks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of money buying assets to expand the business , and they recognise this company ( Sapura Energy ) right from the beginning , it is moved by an entrepreneur ... so I think they believe that if the entrepreneur is not there , they may not get their money back , as the company may go under . <p> So they ( the banks ) insist that the CEO , the mover , give his personal undertaking not to run away , basically , not to give up his management position . The other part is not to sell his shares to below 10% , and he has to remain a director of the company . <p> So , without these , the loan would be breached . <p> If it was me , I would n't ( take such a risk ) ... Shahril does n't have 51% ( of Sapura Energy ) , he has only 17% , so to give an undertaking for the benefit of the rest of the shareholders is a bit much to ask . <p> So the alternative , if he ( Shahril @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , is for a company to get a bank guarantee ; if you look around , the lowest may be 1% basis , so imagine our loan of RM16 billion ; 1% is RM160 million and that is for every year the loan is outstanding . <p> But the cost to him ( Shahril ) , when he made that commitment , the price of Sapura Energy 's shares was about RM4 plus . Let 's say RM4 , so he could n't sell 10% for RM4 ; 10% is 600 million shares . Let 's say we take a price a few months ago , before one of the institutional shareholders started selling the shares , say at RM1 , so he lost RM3 per share , multiplied by 600 million , it is RM1.8 billion . <p> So , we have to take that into consideration . <p> One of the issues brought up is that you are not an independent director ... <p> Hamzah : It 's technical ... when Sapura bought Crest Petroleum a long time ago , I became the nominee of Sapura on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a nominee of a major shareholder , I can not be independent . <p> So , you believe Tan Sri Shahril 's salary and remuneration are fair ? <p> Hamzah : They are fair , given all the factors we have to take into account . <p> Why are the covenant and his ( Shahril 's ) guarantee of the debts not recorded in the annual report ? <p> Hamzah : The covenant is supposed to be confidential . But we explained it to the institutional investors , we explained it last year at the AGM , we explained it at the meeting with institutional shareholders . <p> They ( institutional investors ) say it ( covenant ) is normal ( laughs ) . How could it be normal ? I would n't do it . <p> It 's easy to look at the profits of the company and just jump to conclusions : oh , the company is not making profits , so his salary is exorbitant ... but there are other KPIs . <p> But then , how much salary would he ( Shahril ) draw when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought up by some shareholders . They asked , if I 'm not mistaken , if it would be RM200 million to RM300 million ... <p> Gee : We -- I speak as an independent director -- have our own fiduciary duties , and we have a structure within Sapura Energy that respects that , so even if he is going to be paid RM200 million to RM300 million , it has got to go through the due process . We have a remuneration committee , we have independent directors on the board , we all have to be convinced first . It 's not like when the oil price goes up , it 's automatic ( he gets higher pay ) . <p> In the corporate environment , the rules and regulations are quite strict . There are many things we ca n't say in the annual report for it would be ( tantamount to ) forecasting but there are things we , the board monitor and we as a board , know , and the board consists of mostly independent directors . We know our fiduciary duties , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the exchange . We did n't just pluck the figure -- RM55 million . There was a basis ( at arriving at the figure ) and that went through our corporate governance process . <p> Hamzah : The board did not pluck the number from thin air . <p> Gee : In 2014 , which is FY2015 , oil remained at US$100 until October . That year we made a profit after tax of RM1.4 billion , and Tan Sri was not paid a lot more . It did n't triple to RM200 million to RM300 million . <p> The EPF had board representation on Sapura Energy . Does it mean the EPF has also approved the remuneration package ? <p> Gee : He retired at the end of the financial year but he was there during the deliberation , all deliberated and voted for . The quorum was made up of those who were not executive directors , Tan Sri and also his brother . In this case , there were seven directors : all together , the chairman , all the independents you have , Tunku Ali @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deliberated for , no one abstained and no one voted against . <p> Some noise was made but there were other shareholders while the MSWG ( Minority Shareholders Watch Group ) says it represents the minority shareholders . We , the independent directors , represent all shareholders . We put our own reputations on the line . <p> Hamzah : A lot of the investors were more worried about the company making profits and paying dividends ; no violent reactions to compensation . They understood that an entrepreneur running the business gets paid ... just bring in the profits and pay dividends . <p> How does it work ? His pay was above RM80 million from 2014 to 2017 . In FY2018 , it fell to about RM71 million . So , why the drop ? <p> Gee : The KPIs . We had a lost-time injury ; that was a percentage of the KPIs . The board sets the KPIs up front and there are lots of categories . You have KPIs for stakeholder management , KPIs for health and safety , KPIs for the P&amp;L ... it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and lots of them . <p> Would you say that Tan Sri has achieved his KPIs in a satisfactory manner over the past five years ? <p> Gee : Yes . We have a methodology that is transparent and quite rigorous . And it is consistently applied . <p> Is it an issue that there are no dividends ? <p> Gee : They ( the shareholders ) understand ... <p> Some feel that maybe he should not get such a high salary but suffer with the other shareholders ... <p> Gee : What do you mean by suffer ? <p> The share price being battered and no dividends paid ... <p> Gee : No dividends is across the board , and we can understand . But this company , at this time , can not pay a dividend , but when we can , we try to . When we look at our results , we go through them with management ... one of the items on the agenda is , are we paying a dividend ? And the explanations come ... it 's not like we ignore the shareholders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is prudent financial management . Over the past few years , all the growth trajectory , the acquisitions , were made without any cash call to the shareholders . There is no dilution , which is how the company was built . We built the business without taking money from the shareholders . <p> Gee : All the bank borrowings have been put into the company for real physical assets . <p> Over the past 10 months , it seems as though there have been unpleasant surprises to shareholders one after another . The massive impairment , then another round ... the share price falls off the cliff , then at the AGM , you had the issue of high salaries . These have made shareholders unhappy ... <p> Hamzah : We have to mark to market . Impairing the assets allows us to recalibrate the depreciation charges , which is a component of the day rate . So , it is to the advantage of the company to do it ... also , it is something that accounting standards require . <p> If we were not responsible , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impair , and we wo n't have the losses and we would look good ... but it 's not good for the company , but good for the CEO . If and when things improve , the asset value will increase , and it will be time for us to write back . <p> Some wonder if there is a huge hole covered by all these impairments ? <p> Gee : We have audited accounts , we have due process , we have quarterly results , we did impairments twice because it is our process , but think of our total assets , look at our balance sheet , and this RM2 billion relates to our rigs . <p> For all segments , our revenue is still higher than our costs , so we are still bringing in cash . We only show a loss because of paper depreciation .... we have always been Ebitda-positive , every single year in every single segment . <p> Could you elaborate on the intellectual property payments ? <p> Gee : There is always an annual review of benefits and services rendered , albeit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and PwC looked at the intellectual property but PwC , from a tax perspective . But both did not come out with the same figure as they have different methodologies of calculating . But we used the lower of the two . <p> The intellectual property fees were presented and approved . How it works is that if Sapura Energy does not want to pay annual fees , they can pay a one-off US$230 million to take the band off Sapura.

His last official visit to China as prime minister was in October 2001 to attend the Apec CEO summit . <p> Dr Mahathir is a regular visitor to China . In the 22 years of his first stint as prime minister ( 1981-2003 ) , he visited China seven times . He visited nine more times after he retired , making it a total of 16 . <p> This coming visit has an added significance because he is leading a different government and there are several touchy issues standing in the way of good relations between the two countries . <p> In his previous official visits , he was leading the Barisan Nasional government . In this visit , he is leading Pakatan Harapan which ousted Barisan in the May @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Barisan . Back in 1974 , it was the leader of this newly-formed coalition Tun Abdul Razak Hussein who made the ground-breaking visit to China . That visit resulted in Malaysia becoming one of the earliest countries in South-East Asia to recognise China . <p> Bear in mind that although Indonesia recognised China in 1950 , their relationship soured and was suspended between 1967 and 1990 . Singapore , a predominantly Chi ? ? nese nation , recognised China only in 1990 , and Brunei did so in 1991 . <p> It was not an easy decision for Malaysia because it already had diplomatic relations with Taiwan since its independence in 1957 . <p> The recognition of Taiwan was reflective of Malaysia 's pro-Western stance and staunchly anti-communist policy . The armed communist insurgency starting in 1948 did not help to endear Malaysia to China . <p> With the disbanding of the Malayan Communist Party ( MCP ) following the 1989 peace accord , which involved the MCP and the governments of Malaysia and Thailand , the Malaysian Chinese Association ( MCA ) became the last remaining vestige of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that while the MCP was fashioned after the Chinese Communist Party ( CCP ) , MCA was the mirror image of the Chinese Nationalist Party , Kuomintang . <p> Abdul Razak 's own party , the United Malay National Organisa ? ? tion ( Umno ) , was staunchly anti-communist . Still , Abdul Razak pulled it off and received overwhelming endorsement from voters at the 1974 general election in which the enlarged Bari ? ? san coalition was contesting for the first time . <p> So , given this very long history of mutually beneficial relationship and Dr Mahathir 's own affinity with China , his visit is not only special but also offers the two countries the opportunity to clarify and sort out issues that could stand in the way of good relations . <p> Dr Mahathir had wanted to visit earlier but time was not favourable .

It also topped the music charts in 15 other countries . <p> Is technology -- and history -- repeating itself 39 years later ? Is the personal computer being killed by the surge in sales of tablet computers and smartphones ? <p> A traditional PC , as defined by International Data Corp ( IDC ) , includes desktops , laptops , workstations and convertible laptops . It excludes servers , pure-play tablet devices ( such as the iPad ) and smartphones . The problem : traditional PCs have been on a sort of comatose state for the last six years . <p> But for the first time since 2012 , growth in sales of traditional PCs registered a brief blip on the ECG monitors at IDC . About 62.3 million PCs were sold in the second quarter of this year , up a surprising 2.7% from the previous corresponding quarter , according to the preliminary results of IDC . <p> Why is this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 0.3% growth and marked the strongest year-on-year growth in more than six years -- that is after a growth of 4.2% in the first quarter of 2012 . <p> " Although helped to some extent by a weak 2Q2017 , which was impacted by key component issues , the 2Q2018 results decidedly bucked the trend from the previous three quarters , which had the market hovering slightly above or below flat growth , " says the research firm . <p> " The market grew for both the premium and entry models . Chrome OS-based devices , premium notebooks and gaming PCs all fuelled the mix in the wake of improved supply and prices of graphic cards . " <p> The growth was across all major markets worldwide . " Although the traditional PC may not be the default device for many usage scenarios , the market continued to show pockets of resiliency as PC usage experience evolves and improves .

It now includes Brunei , Vietnam , Lao PDR , Myanmar and Cambodia . <p> " More than 100 million people are estimated to have joined Asean 's workforce over the past 20 years .

Its current gross domestic product is set to reach US$500 billion by 2022 , with a growth of about 5% per year from 2017 . Growth in the fourth largest Asean economy ( together with Singapore , by GDP size ) is expected to be driven by multiple factors , including stabilising global commodity prices , improvements in global demand for exports of electrical and electronic goods and rising infrastructure spending , according to PwC . <p> The Malaysian government plans to boost infrastructure spending in the next few years , especially in sectors such as transport , logistics , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a trade and investment-friendly country known for its ease of doing business , " says Sridharan Nair , managing partner at PwC Malaysia . <p> " It looks to be on a steady growth path over the next 20 years , although we can expect some short-term ups and downs as a mature emerging economy . The introduction of sustainable economic reforms , a focus on technology and education and efforts to address the wage gap will help support Malaysia 's growth .

A total of 62.1 million units were shipped worldwide in the second quarter of this year , up 1.4% y-o-y -- the first quarter of global growth since 1Q2012 .

Startup brands accounted for only 2% of market share across 45 product types they disrupted from 2012 to 2016 , the report said .

Its main shaving club rival , Dollar Shave Club , has about 8% . <p> It 's been a gut punch to the industry leaders . <p> Gillette controlled about 70% of the US market a decade ago .

" It 's still unknown what these companies will do to revert the situation , or if that is possible at all . " <p> The shaving wars <p> It was a different era when salesman King C.

Katz-Mayfield persuaded Raider to do the same for razors . <p> They were soon scouring the world for quality blades , finally tracking down a German factory that produces the Croma . Raider and Katz-Mayfield secured a deal for custom-made blades and eventually bought the plant in a US$100mil ( RM413.82mil ) gamble . <p> They teased their 2013 launch with an innovative social media campaign that offered free products to anyone who signed up for company updates , sweetening the deal for those who referred the most friends .

Dollar Shave Club offers a four-blade and a six-blade razor , with the cheaper one priced at US$1.50 ( RM6.20 ) per cartridge . <p> It is a deliberate contrast to the dizzying array of razors offered by Gillette and Schick , the legacy of their century-old tradition of trying to outdo each other . Their lower-end products are priced comparatively with the shaving clubs , while their premium razors are much pricier . <p> " The average guy does not like shopping and comparing 27 different things , " said Katz-Mayfield , the Harry 's CEO . <p> But Schick and Gillette are not about to abandon their tradition of rolling out flashy new inventions , still critical to defending their positions as the premier brands in shaving . <p> Gillette is testing a razor designed for caregivers who shave elderly men and has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ US$150 ( RM620 ) heated razor . <p> " There is no one type of shave for every man in America . Whatever every person needs , we have a solution for you , and that is what Gillette is , " Bhalla said . <p> How the newcomers compare in quality is a matter of furious social media debate .

Zakiah Koya revels in what the political and social activist spews out . <p> Dissecting Hishamuddin Rais the man reveals almost an enigma , what with his ideas , the serious books he reads , the hats and jackets he wears in the hot afternoons and the frugal way he lives . This as he " mentors " young undergraduates on socio-politics at coffeeshops into the late nights . <p> Having lived in exile for nearly 20 years before he returned to Malaysia in 1994 , his vast knowledge and deep thoughts on such issues have stirred many young Malaysians in their journey for " enlightenment " in a country many sensitive topics are not be discussed in public . <p> One might think that with such complex issues such as democracy and socialism being his main staple of conversations at the street university of Universiti Bangsar Utama , the Malaysian Che Guevara ( as some have come to call him ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own self seriously before .

How people perceive me , it 's up to ( them ) ... I can not create a perception . What I am now is what I am . That 's it , you know ? I can not change the perception . <p> " Some said that I have been paid . But I have to tell you this , during my student days in University Malaya , I have been ( allegedly ) paid by the communists . Then , I have been paid by the CIA . The last time when I came back , I was paid by Anwar , by Zahid Hamidi . Now I have been paid by Daim . <p> " The thing is that , I really hope that these people bloody pay me . I 'd be so happy . I would n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I will be somewhere in South of France , lying on the beach . But nobody pays me nothing ! <p> " No one pays me you know ? I still have to go and shop in Chow Kit Road to buy the cheapest vegetables , the cheapest fish and the cheapest fruit , " Hishamuddin says out loud . <p> Despite never holding a post in any political party or organisation , except for a short stint in Bersih , Hishamuddin is much sought for his intellectual views and ideas on politics and socio-economic . <p> Many of his followers will testify that he is a relentless teacher who loves a heated discussion and hates the intrusion of gadgets . <p> He is a former Malay College Kuala Kangsar student who went on to Universiti Malaya as a history undergraduate before being involved actively in campus activism . <p> His fight was for the landless . Hishamuddin was part of the Baling protest for poor farmers in 1974 . He sought asylum in Belgium when the government , then under Tun Abdul Razak , arrested those involved in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Catholique de Louvain in 1984 before moving to London to study arts at Brixton and Westminster University . He called London home for 15 years ; hence , conversations with him tend to lead one from the rice fields of Negeri Sembilan to the European cities he has stayed in . <p> He has also been in and out of detentions , not only in Malaysia but also in India , Russia and Australia . The longest was for 26 months in Kamunting Detention Centre in 2001 , where he was popularised as the man behind the Reformasi Movement - something he says he had no idea of how he came to be . <p> Despite his travels , it is obvious that his heart is very much into Malaysian politics . <p> There is a potential we might be a full blown democratic society but then there 's also a potential we might slip away for what we have won May 9 <p> " Malaysia , during UMNO , is a procedure democracy . We have all the procedures . We have the election , we have the newspaper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we have the system . The procedure is there . But not the essence of democracy . <p> This democratic space we must protect and defend it - create an institution <p> " Now , I can not say , " he contemplates . " Yes , we are a democracy state because it is only four months old . We are in the process of creating this democratic space . So , there is a potential we might be a full blown democratic society but then there 's also a potential we might slip away for what we have won on May 9 . So , all this is possibility . <p> " I have seen how democratic space won by thousand million of people in the Philippines , they came to the street , they put Aquino , they call themselves " people power " . It collapsed and what is now ? Duterte . <p> " As you can see also what happened in Indonesia . I have always tried to tell people to ' be aware ' . This democratic space , we must protect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A with Mr B and then with Mr C does n't really help . But if you have institutions and structural changes , then we might be on the right path for a real democratic space , " says Hishamuddin . <p> He says that Malaysians are obsessed with two things - food and politics . <p> " In London , they are not obsessed with politicking or food , they are obsessed with football . In Italy , people are obsessed with food . In France , people are obsessed with food . Here , in Malaysia people are obsessed with who is who . " <p> He pointed out that this obsession is further fed by the politicians who are either power-crazy or insecure . <p> On the present situation of politics , Hishamuddin has written a few articles recently capturing the details behind the scenes before Pakatan Harapan took over . <p> Having been lambasted by Prime Minister-in-waiting Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim for making up stories , Hishamuddin says he was merely recording in the annals of Malaysian history . <p> " I am so surprised that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mohamad said . He is the next Prime Minister . I am not sure why he 's so insecure . So , I personally hope brother Anwar will flush out his insecurity for whatever reason . Then , we will stabilise the country . <p> " For Mahathir , this is the time for him to create the democratic space to create those institutions . If I have the chance to tell Mahathir : Tun , you will remember this for the rest of your life . Both of us , Hishamuddin Rais and Mahathir Mohamad were created because of the Universities and University College Act 1974 during the demonstration in Baling . So now Tun , you have to abolish it completely . <p> " Let us go there and take a picture together to be remembered for the rest of our lives . You will be the Prime Minister . I am the guy who created the mess before you cleaned it up . <p> He says that while Mahathir is talking about another national car to further industrialise Malaysia , Anwar should harness his Muslim democrat role @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " If the Muslim democrat does not come to the fore , the right wing extremist Muslim will . This is the danger , " says Hishamuddin . <p> He also warns the present government to listen to those who criticise them . <p> We need opposition . We need people to criticise the current government <p> " We need opposition . We need people to criticise the current government . Whether it comes from non-government individuals like me or from any other member of parliament , from any other party , than the Pakatan Harapan . We need this . This has to be the way a modern society is structured . We can not go without opposition . It 's bad , " Hishamuddin warns a one party strong system is dangerous for the country . <p> He says UMNO should continue to do what it has been doing especially when it comes to championing the issues of Malay and Islam , whilst emphasising that it is pertinent that UMNO represents the rights and issues of every Malaysian too . <p> The right approach is key @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an intellectual manner that is accepted by the whole nation . You can not ask , ' Eh , Cina ! You tau kah , ini Tanah Melayu la ' That is not the way . That is anti-intellectual . <p> " You discuss it , if there is an issue , " adding that every party or organisations have had an important role to play in the formation of Malaysia and should not be disregarded . <p> " Well , UMNO or any other party also played a role in the independence of Malaysia . The Communist Party of Malaya also played an important role . We can not deny UMNO 's role . Neither can we deny the communist party role , " says Hishamuddin . <p> All said and done , Hishamuddin says that if Pakatan Harapan and Barisan Nasional do not know how to play their roles , they are more than welcome to come to him and learn how to . 
@@40100239 <p> PENAMPANG : Parti Warisan Sabah leaders believe that STAR president Datuk Dr Jeffrey Kitingan is trying hard to deny the reality that the new government is doing its best to serve the people and as such he therefore is forced to resort to wild allegations . <p> Jeffrey 's propensity to twist and turn even positive actions that are good for the state into something sinister is indicative of a desperate mind , said Honorsius Alfred Bosuin , the Director of Communications of Parti Warisan Sabah . <p> " Jeffrey likes to hurl all kinds of accusations and make crazy claims but where is the proof to support his statements ? " he asked after lodging a report at the Penampang police station here on Sunday night . <p> In the report , Honorsius urged police to investigate an article being shared on social media entitled " Jeffrey questions Shafie 's motives for mobilizing JPN on each visit " saying that it had slandered the Chief Minister and his cabinet ministers by accusing them of issuing identity cards to illegal immigrants and therefore creating incitement . <p> " Jeffrey sees a ghost in everyone who represents the Parti @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking at their actions with suspicion saying that they have some hidden agenda , " said Honorsius . <p> " His latest shot in the dark while being blindfolded is his accusation of the Parti Warisan-Pakatan Harapan government 's actions through the National Registration Department ( JPN ) . " <p> He pointed out that the courts also provided assistance at the event in Keningau by despatching the Mobile Court to help people who qualify to obtain the necessary identification documents . <p> Nevertheless , Jeffrey persisted in twisting the issue by inciting people to believe that the government under Chief Minister Datuk Seri Panglima Hj Mohd Shafie Hj Apdal is the mastermind of another Project IC , Honorsius stated in his report . <p> MP Goviind , the chairman of Parti Warisan Sabah 's MA63 Bureau , who lodged a similar report at the same police station , said it is necessary to register immigrants in Sabah and gather accurate information on them before the State government could formulate short , middle and long-term plans to deal with the controversial issue of illegal immigrants . <p> " Jeffrey has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Goviind said after making his police report . <p> " Past state administrations found the need to undertake such exercises although it was known by different names then . " <p> Datuk Yong Teck Lee called it the Regularisation Programme in 1997 while Datuk Chong Kah Kiat did a similar programme but under a different brand . Such exercises were also carried out during the PBS administration when Jeffrey headed its think tank . <p> Goviind said such exercises resulted in giving the government valuable data not only on illegals from Indonesia , the Philippines , India and Pakistan but also on the number of foreign workers in the State . <p> " Without such exercises that must be supported directly by the Federal government through its departments and agencies , how can Jeffrey expect the new Warisan-PH government to start serious action on this issue that he pretends to champion ? <p> " It is time for Jeffrey to discard his blindfold and start to look at realities with a clear mind and not a twisted one , " he added . 
@@40100240 <p> Benedict Lopez explains why he did n't need a car to get around in the Swedish capital . <p> Traffic jams in Kuala Lumpur will continue to be a perennial problem unless the public transport system in the city is improved . <p> The light rail transit , Star , monorail and commuter rail services have done a good job in reducing traffic congestion in the city , but more needs to be done . <p> The Rapid KL feeder bus services are poor . The other day , when I arrived at the Bangsar LRT station at 8pm , I immediately walked downstairs along with others to catch the feeder bus . But much to our dismay , we had to wait more than half an hour for the Rapid KL bus . <p> This long wait was appalling -- especially when commuters were most eager to get back home after a tiring day at work . <p> Rapid KL can afford to adopt a lackadaisical attitude as they have a monopoly of this and all other routes in the city . If Rapid KL can not buck up , it is time for the government to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ routes which are now being dominated by the federally owned bus company . Healthy competition leads to enhanced efficiency and consequently better services by bus operators . In the long run , commuters are the ultimate beneficiaries . <p> In fact , the government should encourage and issue licences to three-wheel autos or tuk tuk , as they call them in Thailand , to ply the routes from LRT stations to residential areas . It will not only be cheaper but more efficient than the normal bus services . <p> In the 1960s , when I lived in the Cochrane Road government quarters , the Tong Foong buses plied the routes near our home every few minutes . It was so easy and convenient to take a bus those days . <p> In a city like Stockholm , bus stops are located adjacent to the train stations and the city 's red and blue buses ply the routes every few minutes . These buses are long , with either two or three entrance and exit doors , and the routes crisscross the city . The middle portion of the bus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a baby on a pram , and it is free of charge . <p> The bus drivers exercise utmost care and caution , constantly looking back to see if all the passengers are on board before continuing the journey . When the bus stops at a station , the exit door opens , and it is always adjacent and parallel to the bus stand , in contrast with our buses where the exit door is about a foot above the road , making it precarious for senior citizens , people with disabilities and expectant mothers to alight . <p> A commuter can buy a monthly pass , the Access Card , which gives the commuter unlimited travel on trains , buses , commuters , ferries and trams . When I left Stockholm in July 2014 , a monthly Access Card cost only SEK790 ( RM350 ) , which I thought was a bargain .

As hosts , they qualified for the tournament automatically because of which they did n't play any qualifying fixtures which are considered competitive games . Instead , Brazil played friendlies when other teams were playing qualifiers and Costa played for the Selecao in two such friendlies . <p> In September 2013 , the Spanish federation requested FIFA to allow Costa to play for Spain because he held a Spanish passport and the following month , the player sent a letter to Brazil Football Confederation ( CBF ) declaring his intention to play for La Furia Roja .

Perhaps reader interest was because he laid out all the weaknesses in one article and in the next offered suggestions on what can be done to dramatically improve the situation . <p> Bookmarking both articles is a great " cheat sheet " for anyone who wants to pass off as a well informed person on what ails and what can cure the weak VC ecosystem in Malaysia . But I know Sivapalan will take no joy from this . <p> Having been involved in Malaysia 's startup ecosystem since 1999 at least , Siva , who has a doctorate in venture capital from University of Edinburgh and has written a book on innovation , is as steeped and informed about Malaysia 's venture capital sector as few others . His views should be taken seriously and I hope the minister of Communications and Multimedia , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eng , read the articles and especially Siva 's recommendations before they make any lasting decisions around Malaysia 's venture capital sector . <p> The recommendation , actually it is more like an urgent reminder , I found particularly interesting just revolved around expediting decision making on two key policy decisions that were introduced in Budget 2017 and that could quickly unlock over US$240 million ( RM1 billion ) into the venture capital market . ( Recommendation No3 in his second article ) Another matching fund suggestion could unlock a further US$80 million ( RM333 million ) . ( Recommendation No5 ) . <p> Let 's hope the urgency that Sivapalan and other ecosystem leaders feel around these suggestions strikes a chord with Gobind and Lim and we see some quick action taken that ultimately benefits the startup ecosystem . <p> Switching tack now from the funding picture of the Malaysian startup ecosystem to probably the most clued-in Brick &amp; Mortar leader about the potential impact of digital , Tony Fernandes is hoping to be up to his eyeballs in digital come 2020 . He has partnered with Google to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drive to turn AirAsia into the next great travel tech company . <p> He is hoping that AI and machine learning can help unlock the value of his customer data to allow him to sell them more than just flight seats . Of course , Tony did declare as far back as in 2015 at DNA 's What 's Next conference that AirAsia was an internet company already . He may have jumped the gun then , but there is no doubting that not just the airline but the entire AirAsia group is on its way to becoming a digital company and fulfilling Tony 's declaration made in 2015 . <p> I think what other corporate leaders can learn from Tony is that he is not caught up in the hype around digital and buzz words like AI and big data analytics etc . To him , all these are just tools that will help unlock additional revenue for him while helping him run a tighter , leaner ship . Now which CEO does n't want this ? So , learn from Tony , folks . <p> And finally , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Malaysian based tech entrepreneur , Jeffri Shahul Hamid , has launched an Email Service Provider product , Enginemailer , that he hopes will be able to take on the global players such as MailChimp . It is not bravado talking or even a large funding round ( though he will no doubt welcome that ) but just confidence in the product that he has built which comes with modules that his global competitors do n't have and at prices the market will love . <p> And I love it when established entrepreneurs from Southeast Asia talk about taking on the global players . For instance , Jeffri has already been delivering email services to enterprises for over 10 years . He just made the decision to move the business model to a cloud based SaaS ( Software as a service ) model . So , there has to be confidence in the product , one 's business model and in the team .

It was given five more months to submit its regularisation plan to the relevant authorities for approval . <p> Nonetheless , there is now talk of THHE , in which Lembaga Tabung Haji holds a 29.08% stake , seeking more time from Bursa . But whether the regulator will show the company any leniency is anybody 's guess . <p> " We in the oil and gas industry have not heard of anything , any plan , or white knight coming in for THHE . And the people who previously stepped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problems now , " says an industry player . <p> Questions to THHE CEO Suhaimi Badrul Jamil went unanswered . <p> Lifeline cut <p> Before May this year , there was market talk that certain contracts linked to the RM4 billion Trans-Sabah Gas Pipeline ( TSGP ) could be injected into THHE , which would have given the company a shot in the arm . <p> But it is a drastically different scenario after GE14 . The Pakatan Harapan government has decided not to go ahead with TSGP , which involves the laying of a 662km pipeline from the Kimanis Gas Terminal to Sandakan and Tawau . <p> The project was among the " red files " discovered by the PH government . The crux of the matter is that although 88% , or RM3.5 billion , of TSGP 's total cost has already been paid , the only work done so far is the clearing of 12% of the land . <p> Before THHE slipped into PN17 status , Tabung Haji 's former chairman , Datuk Abdul Azeez Abdul Rahim , who was also the member of parliament for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the oil and gas company bag a RM738.9 million contract for the supply , delivery , testing and commissioning of three offshore patrol vessels ( OPVs ) for the Malaysian Maritime Enforcement Agency , in partnership with Destini Bhd . <p> Market talk had it that Azeez was looking to secure more work for THHE . But he is probably out of action now as he and two of his family members were remanded by the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission ( MACC ) late last month , thus dashing hopes of THHE finding its financial footing anytime soon . <p> Two income-generating assets <p> Bluntly put , the oil and gas company 's two assets have not generated as much earnings as it would have hoped . <p> Its 56.79-acre fabrication yard in Pulau Indah , Selangor , is its core asset . However , the yard has been blacklisted by Petroliam Nasional Bhd ( Petronas ) since April 2016 , after the non-performance of the procurement , construction and commissioning of KNPG-B Topside PH II , Kinabalu Non-Associated Gas Development Project . <p> The company 's other core asset is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , currently on a novation contract with Yinson Bhd for the provision of engineering , procurement , construction , installation and commissioning and leasing for Layang FPSO that was awarded by JX Nippon Oil &amp; Gas Exploration ( M ) Ltd for RM374 million cash . <p> THHE utilised the RM374 million it received in early June this year to settle debt obligations . <p> Named Deep Producer 1 , THHE 's FPSO was bought for US$82.5 million -- about 40% of the US$200 million the previous owner had spent on building the vessel -- in July 2011 when high crude prices were fuelling a global oil boom . <p> While the purchase seemed like a good deal , the FPSO was bought without a locked-in charter contract . This was a risky move as THHE burnt RM2 million a month while awaiting a chartered contract . <p> Finally , three years later , it secured a US$900 million chartered contract from JX Nippon Oil &amp; Gas Exploration to deploy the FPSO to the Layang oil and gas field , off Sarawak 's shores . Based on calculations and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to provide THHE with a recurring income of about RM70 million a year . <p> However , it incurred a conversion cost of US$230 million or RM875 million . <p> Tabung Haji 's call <p> There is a good chance that the equity interest of Tabung Haji in THHE could be bumped up . To recap , Tabung Haji , the single largest shareholder of the oil and gas company , was the sole subscriber for its rights issue of Islamic irredeemable convertible preference shares ( ICPS ) in 2015 . <p> The pilgrims fund pumped in RM275 million of fresh capital for 99.76% of almost 1.1 billion of the ICPS in the cash call . The tenure of the ICPS is five years . <p> Tabung Haji will control more than 64% of the company should it convert the preference shares . This means the ball will be in the pilgrims fund 's court if THHE decided on a recapitalisation . <p> THHE has been bleeding red ink since its financial year ended Dec 31 , 2014 ( FY2014 ) . It had accumulated losses of RM697.07 million as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months ended June 30 , the company incurred a net loss of RM104.23 million on revenue of RM329,000 .

This large amount is due for payment soon , adding more stress to THHE 's financial condition . Its cash balance stood at RM68.8 million as at June 30 . <p> While THHE has no other substantial shareholder than Tabung Haji , the names on the list are nevertheless interesting : Pelaburan Mara Bhd ( formerly Amanah Saham Mara Bhd ) with 4.61% ; Mohamad Faroz Mohamad Jakel , a well-known businessman with interests in textiles and property , with 3.38% ; Datuk Seri Hadian Hashim , the substantial shareholder of special purpose acquisition company , Sona Petroleum Bhd , with 0.54% ; and Yayasan Pok dan Kassim , which is linked to former Perlis menteri besar Datuk Shahidan Kassim , with 0.36% . <p> This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ status .

Claure declined to comment to reporters on whether Softbank would accept the capital if it were offered . <p> " There 's no certainty , " he said . " We do n't have a date " for the closing of the second Vision Fund , he said . <p> The Vision Fund acquired a 25 percent stake in Arm from Softbank last year , among the fund 's largest deals to date for Softbank Chief Executive Masayoshi Son .

@@40159239 <h> How Gareth Southgate made England believe again <p> Yesterday was probably the first time that it seemed as though the UEFA Nations League was finally fulfilling the purpose that it was brought in for . As England picked up a thrilling 3-2 win over Spain , it was a game that kept us at the edge of our seats even when the score was three nil in the Three Lions ' favor . It seemed as if the charm of international football was back . But more than that , it was a sign of something else too . <p> Critics have been going on and on about the English national team ever since they reached the semi-finals of the FIFA World Cup some months ago . It was deemed as an ' overperformance ' that they might not do ever again in the near future . Easy games in the route to the semi-final against Croatia were seen as an excuse for why Gareth Southgate 's youthful side had gone so far when Croatia themselves had played easier sides in the lead up to the game against England in the final four . <p> For a young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person in the country , it was deemed as a fluke by many . The win over Spain though , attracted more glances than their run to the World Cup did . While the second half was n't as good as the first one , the way England managed the game and took the sting out of it repeatedly showed one thing- they 've come of age . <p> It is obvious that that one can put that argument down by saying that it was the case of just one game . But if you look at how England have been in the UEFA Nations League so far , it will suggest otherwise . <p> The youngest England side since 1959 have just beaten a Spain team who have n't lost a competitive home game in 15 years .. <p> At Wembley against the Spaniards , England did struggle sometimes but created enough to deserve a point . And unfairly enough , Danny Welbeck 's stoppage time goal was taken away on the allegation that the former Manchester United man had fouled his former teammate David de Gea , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out as 2-1 winners in a game where England deserved a point for how they had played . <p> Fast forward to the behind closed doors game against Croatia in Rijeka , England probably deserved to win that too . They were the better team and hit the bar twice and created far more than Luka Modric 's Croatia did . The 4-3-3 formation did take time in coming into full effect , but it certainly did . <p> Against Spain though , we saw two different sides of England . One that involved taking the chances when they fell . Big chances , in fact . And the second side involved digging in and getting the result against a formidable Spanish side when goals always seemed to be around the corner . They kept taking the sting out of the game and managed the game to perfection . And Gareth Southgate 's tactical changes of switching from a back four to a back three worked perfectly as having an extra man at the back allowed England to nullify the aerial threat that Alvaro Morata was providing . <p> It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ English side in the past 15 years or so . If there 's anything that it is down to , then it is down to how much Gareth Southgate knows the English game . <p> If you look at the side that now plays regularly for the Three Lions , there is one common thing between almost all of them- Southgate knows them from his time as the England Under 21s boss . He knows them from top to bottom , knows how they will play in what conditions and know where their strengths and weaknesses lie . <p> The decision to bring on Nathaniel Chalobah was met by surprise and anxiety by many , but Southgate knows him better than anyone else . The Watford man has appeared 97 times for the England junior sides and has done a job for Southgate in the past multiple times . It was his first England cap , but it would not have seemed so for a man who 's played for the country on different levels a bit less than hundred times . Above all , Southgate has complete faith in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> If Roy Hodgson would still have been the manager , England might not have seen the emergence of so many youngsters in the national side . It would have been a case of same old , same old . Jadon Sancho , James Maddison , Harry Winks or Ben Chilwell would never have been called up , perhaps . It would have been a team full of hyped superstars who have nothing more to prove in their careers . <p> Southgate though , has somehow made the English crowd identify with this team . Every time a player gets selected , it seems as though he is one from the English crown and he is that kid who dreamt and that kid from the streets of Salford who made it big . The human element to stories like these grab your attention . It makes the people feel connected to them even more because they are not superstars . They are a hard-working bunch of individuals who leave their hearts out on the pitch . <p> Since Southgate knows them better than their club managers , he knows how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was lucky to have little pressure on him when he took the job , the first thing Southgate did was installing a system that the team would play the game . Possession football was seen as the way forward and the players were selected on that basis , as Chris Smalling was left out because he was n't a ball-playing defender . <p> Harry Maguire , who has played under Southgate for the England Under 21s , was called up because he is a ball-playing defender and he enjoys the manager 's trusts . And players were selected not because they were good , but because they know how to play the brand of football that Southgate wants them to play . That 's the sign of a proper leader- someone who knows how to impose his authority on a bunch of players . <p> POWER TO THE PEOPLE ! <p> A petition to put England defender Harry Maguire riding a unicorn on the new ? 50 note has been signed by over 2,000 fans ? ? ? ? https : //t.co/r4JU5bj6Tx <p> On top of that , Southgate is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ footballing greyhead like the England managers of the past . The very look of his face gives you the impression of a man who is young and bright and every press-conference he gives shows you the progressive thinking that he sticks to . <p> Of course , he knows how it feels to let the country down and he had many things to turn around in the World Cup . He was transformed into a meme of the late 1990s when he missed that penalty for England against Germany in the 1996 EUROs semi-finals . He had a monkey of his own to take off his back and after years of seeing English football struggle in a mess , he knows what sparked the downfall . He knows what started it . It was probably him . And there he was in the World Cup , all ready to stop the carnage and make things look bright again . <p> Yesterday , it was another reminder of how after 22 years of taking his country down into a footballing abyss , Southgate knows how to take England out of that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @

It 's easily the most popular Lexus vehicle available , especially the generation that is currently on sale , but the next generation is promising to be something quite mature and competitive . One of the most important aspects of a luxury vehicle is refinement , and for Lexus that begins with noise reduction . <p> A true soundless environment can be a little unnerving and unsettling , which is why the aim was for a car that could be superlatively quiet . A quiet car is one that 's relaxing to drive or be a passenger in , and after three years of development , Lexus feels that they have achieved the result that they set out for .

An attempt to blanket cancel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most readily picked up by human ears - resulted in a stifling , nauseating environment that proved incredibly uncomfortable . The task fell upon engineer Hirotaka Tsuru to find the sounds that needed cancelling , and the ones that did n't . <p> Where wind tunnels are usually used to test aerodynamics , Tsuru used a wind tunnel to refine the components on the outside of the ES that would generate noise . By moving and adjusting the position of these items , he could reduce airflow across them and in turn reduce the noise and vibrations these elements generated . He then focused on ways to reduce noise from entering the car through gaps in the bodywork , which he achieved with sealant and sheet metal . This was all complemented with absorption material on the suspension towers , fenders , undercarriage , and other areas . <p> But perhaps the most defining characteristic of the all-new Lexus ES , in terms of sound quality , is that it is available with a 3.5-litre V6 engine . The engine is said to give the car its identity , especially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many of the unpleasant noises by introducing something a lot more pleasant .

@@40162234 <h> Suggestions for our education minister <h> Share this article <p> With all due respect , sir , while I welcome your 12-point plan to improve the education system , I believe there are bigger issues that need radical changes . <p> Before I proceed further , let me say that I am a great proponent of the national school system . Unlike many parents , I believe that all children should attend national schools . I feel that private , international and even vernacular schools are detrimental to the aspirations of our nation . <p> I believe that national schools -- and the caveat here is , if they are done right -- are the key to promoting unity and nurturing our children to be the future of this country of ours . <p> Allow me to be blunt , sir . <p> Many have lost faith in our education system . The wealthy choose to send their children to private or international schools . Even those who are not wealthy will scrimp and save to give their children what they think is the best . <p> The Chinese have more or less left national schools . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> To me , as controversial as it may be , I believe that we should have only one school system . <p> That means getting rid of private , international , religious , fully boarding , vernacular and all other different systems we now have in place . <p> Different school systems are not only detrimental to national unity , but also cause inequality by creating different playing fields . There is a need to focus on improving the national school system and make it excellent . One excellent school system for the nation . Equal opportunity for everyone . <p> Then , there is the syllabus . While I admit that children these days seem to be learning more at an earlier age , especially in terms of science and math , and also other subjects like " reka bentuk teknologi " , there is a serious lack in other subjects . <p> History seems to focus too much on local and Islamic history . World history seems to have been forgotten . Even local history that was taught 30 years ago seems to have been edited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and more importantly , why ? How are our future leaders supposed to function effectively when they are taught a myopic view of the world ? <p> And , we all know that our English has gone to the dogs , with many students simply unable to string together a coherent sentence . <p> Bring back holistic education . One that encompasses equal focus on sports , extracurricular activities and academic excellence . Make it mandatory for students to participate in all three parts . The lessons you learn from sports , clubs and societies will prove invaluable . In today 's ever-evolving world , pure academic excellence is not enough . <p> Speaking of sports , in my time , we had dedicated and trained teachers in charge of sports . <p> Teachers who could actually coach football , rugby , hockey , and yes , even swimming . Today , however , most teachers are no longer equipped to coach sports . Schools that have swimming pools do not have skilled coaches . <p> So , while your idea of introducing swimming lessons may hold water , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as build enough pools nationwide . <p> Another thing that needs to be looked as is a change in the grading system . We are churning out too many students with a multitude of As in public examinations . So much so , that the grades seem meaningless . In the Sijil Pelajaran Malaysia grading system , you can get an A with a score of 70 . <p> This gives students a false sense of achievement , and makes them think they are better than they actually are . <p> Schools should also impart holistic life skills like financial planning , embrace technology where possible , and leverage , or perhaps , encourage technology-centric companies to aid learning institutions in the use of technology as part of these firms ' corporate social responsibility . <p> Religious studies should not focus only on one religion , but encompass all the world 's religions . This can only serve to foster a greater understanding and acceptance between everyone . <p> What I have touched on is probably just the tip of the iceberg , but this in itself shows that there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are other issues , like the quality of teachers , discipline in schools , interference by parents and so on .

the state would request for it . <p> In the contractor company 's 15% ( net 11% ) Petronas has 15% to 20% with no management/working interest with carried interest ( free ) and some direct investments in the older PSCs but more direct investments from 40% to 60% with controlling working interest in the new PSCs . <p> Minus the standard 10% royalty before recovery costs and taxes as cash payments ,

On the other hand , the arrangement of sand , silt , and clay to ensure some degree of the stability of these particles to prevent for instance , soils from collapsing is referred to as soil structure . <p> Soil texture can easily indicate how sandy or clayey soils are or it could suggest how challenging it will be to manage such soils . <p> On the other hand , how loose or dense ( compact ) such soils are is partly controlled by soil structure . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particles and their aggregation ( soil texture and structure ) play essential role in determining for example , how well water is distributed in soils , how much water and nutrients soils can hold , how fast or slow water and air can move in soils , how fast water can penetrate ( infiltrate ) soils during and after rain fail or irrigation , how much water runs through and out of soils ( leaching ) , and how water can run on and from soils ' surface ( runoff ) . <p> Soil physical properties can also control plant root respiration ( breathing of plants ) , movement of roots , uptake , transmission , and distribution of water and nutrients by roots . <p> They also influence the living conditions/environment of organisms which are not seen with naked human eyes ( example , nematodes , bacteria , fungi , viruses , and so on ) or can be seen with naked human eyes ( termites , earthworms , rodents , and so on ) . <p> Although soil physical properties are important in agriculture , their role vis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of soil characteristics because as an example , aggregation of soil particles to form good soil structure to enable good plant growth and development needs literally , a ' special glue ' called soil organic matter which holds/cements sand , silt , and clay together such that such a soil has good spaces for crops and organisms to thrive . <p> It must be noted that soil organic matter comes from decomposition or breakdown of dead plants materials , animals , and other living and non-living organisms . <p> How fast or slow soil organic matter forms in soils is partly controlled by soil physical properties such as texture and the activities of very tiny organisms such as bacteria and fungi and also bigger organisms such as earthworms , insects , root exudates , and so forth . <p> The involvement of organisms to positively or negatively impact soil quality or health is known as soil biological properties and this is shown in the picture below where organisms interact with the soil . <p> Among the positive interactions is borrowing soils by rodents ( rats , mice ) and earthworms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and nutrients transmission and one of the negative interactions is plant root destruction by nematodes and fungi . <p> Note that soil organic matter is one of examples of soil chemical properties . <p> This means that good soils should have some reasonable amount of organic matter to ensure such soils are less compact to some extent that good amount of water can be held and supplied to plants for use . <p> This soil water should also be able to transport nutrients ( food of plants ) timely without the nutrients being lost from the soil or locked up in the soil . <p> The organic matter also facilitates the inflow and outflow of oxygen in soils to ensure that plants and other organisms have adequate amount of oxygen for their daily activities just as in human beings . <p> The right amount of organic matter also ensures good soil temperature to avoid excessive heat which could kill or destroy plant roots and other organisms in soils . <p> Certainly , soils with good organic matter makes such soils reasonably loose to boost the activities of living organisms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example , can easily penetrate or infiltrate them to avoid too much of water being lost from their surfaces to cause flooding or washing away of seeds , fertilizers , pesticides , weedicides , and herbicides . <p> Water distribution in soils with reasonable organic matter is good because soil organic matter literally acts like a sponge to timely absorb and release water . <p> From economic point of view , sufficient amount of soil organic matter will not only save farmers from losing fertilizers but it will also enable farmers to make good money from good harvest because efficient use of fertilizers and related farm inputs are guaranteed to increase crop yield and profit margin . <p> Furthermore , the soil organic matter itself is rich in plant nutrients such as nitrogen , potassium , phosphorus , calcium , magnesium , and so on , thus it could compliment nutrients from chemical fertilizers . <p> Additionally , because soil organic matter are made up of negative charges , they are very good in attracting and storing positively charges nutrients such as potassium , ammonium , calcium , magnesium , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from farms . <p> The ability of soils to hold or store and release positive nutrients for plants to use is called cation exchange capacity ( CEC ) .

The country is going to be in permanent election mode for the next 24 months -- government strategies and policies will be subordinate to that . <p> * Trump will feel that his political strategy of divisiveness appeals domestically and aggressive posturing abroad has been vindicated . After all , it does look like his late-stage barnstorming probably helped the Republicans do better than expected in the Senate vote . The election shows a divided nation , with a solid core of voters who are easily swayed by Trump 's hardline nativist appeals . <p> * Trump 's dismissal of Attorney-General Jeff Sessions immediately after the election provides a foretaste of the political turbulence that we should expect . Sessions ' firing is almost certain to set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as an effort to shut down the special prosecutor 's investigation into the Trump campaign 's dealings with Russia in 2016 . <p> * The divided control of Congress spells policy gridlock , with the Republicans and Democrats unlikely to agree on the country 's pressing needs .

Trump will be meeting Chinese President Xi Jinping at the end of November and there are signs that some kind of trade agreement is being negotiated . However , we do not see such an improvement going very far . The tussle between the two big powers has now gone well beyond trade to a more strategic one , with the US determined to push back against China 's efforts to assert itself in a range of areas . <p> What about the economy ? <p> On the surface , the US economy looks in the pink of health . The labour market is tight , with employment growing at an average @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above what is needed to absorb the new entrants into the workforce . Not surprisingly , wages are accelerating . Activity indicators such as purchasing manager surveys suggest an economy still growing above its long-term potential growth rate of around 2% . Lead indicators point to continued growth in the next six months . <p> But the rapid growth is clearly the product of the tax cuts and raised spending that was announced earlier this year . These stimulants will fade as we get into the latter half of 2019 , which is why the absence of new growth drivers is a worry : In particular , capital spending continues to lose momentum despite a strong economy and the tax cuts that had been expected to boost companies ' plans to expand capacity . Recent data on orders for capital equipment was surprisingly weak . On current trends , economic growth will cool rapidly by the third and fourth quarters of 2019 , perhaps to less than 1% . <p> Still , the US Federal Reserve is , at least for now , set on its tightening path despite nascent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's time . Rising wage inflation and fears of financial excesses point to a few more rate hikes in the coming months . <p> Slowing growth is not the only economic challenge the country faces . Its fiscal position is weakening rapidly while external deficits are also expanding . <p> * The trade deficit widened to US$54 billion in September , the largest deficit since the financial crisis ( except for a brief spike in February this year ) . On a 12-month moving average basis , the underlying US trade deficit is at pre-crisis levels and the trend is clearly worsening . <p> * The budget deficit for the fiscal year that ended in September was US$779 billion , the highest since 2012 when the economy was just shaking off the effects of the global financial crisis . Adding in off-budget items , the true deficit is estimated at just below US$1 trillion : This is an extraordinarily large deficit for an economy which , being at a cyclical peak , should be generating huge revenue growth and a declining deficit . If more stimulus is added to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Democrats may well support , then the deficit will grow even larger . <p> One result of these developments is that 10-year Treasury bond yields have surged to the highest levels since mid-2011 . Further signs of fiscal laxity could cause a more destabilising surge in bond yields that will exert further pressure on the US economy . <p> Asian economies must build resilience against potential US-led risks <p> In short , the US could turn from protecting the existing international order and supporting the global economy to being a source of stresses as its imbalances grow . <p> Consequently , the region has to prepare for a period of stresses and turbulence . <p> First , regional countries need to organise defences against a US that will be pressing for more trade concessions . They have to act in concert to be able to withstand such pressures . That means quickly implementing regional trade agreements . It is good to see the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership now coming into force now that six of the signatories have ratified it . However , while the CPTPP is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 11 participating countries , more needs to be done . The much larger Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership is being negotiated currently -- but is struggling to reach a conclusion because of an inability to agree on some important parts of the RCEP such as trade in services . The RCEP will offer Asian nations much more protection since it encompasses 16 countries and includes heavyweights such as China , India , Japan and Indonesia , which will vastly strengthen the unified group 's bargaining position . <p> Second , it must prepare for the boost the US gave to global demand for Asian exports to taper off by the second half of 2019 , which would presage a downturn for trade-dependent Asian economies . Since the continued risk of emerging market turbulence limits the use of monetary policy , such as interest rate cuts , the emphasis must be on higher government spending to support demand . Another course of action would be to accelerate efforts to woo foreign investment and tourism . <p> Third , Asian countries should do more to leverage off some positive trends . One example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Such relocation has been evident for some years because of rising Chinese costs , but is now gathering stronger momentum because of the fears that the US will expand protectionist measures against exports from China . So far , the evidence suggests that it is Vietnam , Thailand and Malaysia that will benefit most from this relocation . <p> In conclusion , managing the consequences of political and economic changes in the US will be a key pre-occupation for Asian policymakers . <p> Manu Bhaskaran is a partner and head of economic research at Centennial Group Inc , an economics consultancy

@@40261236 <h> The State of the Nation : Exchange rate has greatest impact on CPI <p> THE rate of inflation , as measured by the Consumer Price Index ( CPI ) , is influenced by a confluence of factors . <p> These include changes to the overnight policy rate ( determined by the central bank ) , exchange rate volatility , wage levels , energy prices , fiscal position of a country , demand-cost related issues and economic growth . <p> This year , the CPI grew 1.3% year on year in the January-to-August period . <p> In comparison , over an eight-year period between 2010 and 2018 , the long-term average inflation rate hovered at 2.5% . The lowest increase during the period was recorded in February 2015 when inflation gained a mere 0.1% , while the highest rise was seen in March 2017 when it expanded 4.9% year on year . <p> An analysis of inflation in Malaysia in the Economic Outlook 2019 Report reveals that the exchange rate had the highest impact on CPI over the eight-year period . Essentially , a 1% change in the exchange rate would alter the overall CPI by 0.337% . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CPI mainly through imported inflation , especially for food items , which cost some RM25 billion a year . <p> Thus , the exchange rate 's impact on CPI comes as no surprise given that the ringgit depreciated rapidly against the US dollar from the third quarter of 2014 to January 2017 . Between August 27 , 2014 , and Jan 3 , 2017 , the local currency tumbled 42.83% , from 3.14 to 4.49 to the US dollar . <p> Meanwhile , indirect tax per capita in the form of the now repealed Goods and Services Tax , which was implemented in April 2015 , has the least impact on CPI . <p> Even though it has often been blamed for the higher prices , analysis shows that for every 1% change in indirect tax per capita , the overall CPI changes by a mere 0.073% . <p> Other variables in the analysis include crude oil prices , which affect the overall CPI by 0.112% for every 1% change in price .

There 's still no majority in Parliament for a re-run of the 2016 vote , but if more pro-EU Tories come out in favor it will make it even harder for May to get her deal approved .

My answer is neither ! <p> We seem to feel that there is no alternative although both " solutions " are NOT working . <p> Other than as punishment ( or vengeance ) , what benefit does the death of the convict provide ? The victims and their families do not get any benefit at all except to vent their rage as revenge . However , in the revolutionary alternative I am suggesting , other people can truly benefit even when the convict is alive . <p> Also , there is a good opportunity for the criminal to reform and contribute to society . It is almost guaranteed that the criminal would never repeat his crime ! <p> As we know , the death penalty is NOT really a deterrent for would-be criminals . For example , drug smuggling cases continue to increase even though in Malaysia we impose the mandatory death sentence for those caught ! Also , death is not really a deterrent for those with blind loyalty to some cause . In fact , many ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dying for their cause . Even for such cases , I think my suggested punishment would be more effective as a deterrent . <p> Life imprisonment also creates several major problems . Firstly , more money needs to be shelled out by taxpayers to build more prisons and for wages to staff the prisons . Secondly , even parolees may relapse into their former criminal ways . Thus , long jail terms may not actually rehabilitate the convicts . <p> So what is my revolutionary suggestion that could be more effective as a deterrent , allow a better chance for penance and reform for the convict as well as provide some restitution to the public ? <p> My suggestion is that those convicted of violent crimes ( like rape , armed robbery and murder ) who have been sentenced to death or life imprisonment be instead compelled to donate their eyes to an eye bank . Do n't be shocked ! It is not as inhumane as hanging or spending the rest of their life behind bars . <p> My reasoning is simple : <p> 1 . Restitution : While @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not benefit anyone , donating his eyes to those who need them is immediately doing a good deed . He might have taken a life or caused lifelong trauma ( in rape cases ) to his victims so by giving up his eyes , he will give light to others . This is immediate restitution . <p> 2 . Deterrent : I believe it is a great deterrent . Even the criminal who is not afraid to die would think twice about having to lose his sight . Most of the time , these criminals act violently and cruelly because they feel they have power and strength . <p> 3 . No relapse : On losing his sight , the convict has to learn again to just live day to day -- to walk , read Braille , and etc . Immediately , he loses the so-called power that enabled him to hurt others . The chances of him ever repeating his heinous crime is almost zero . I have not heard of sightless robbers ( except in movies ) or rapists . I do n't think one could even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> 4 . Chance to repent and reform : The convict now has the opportunity to reflect on and really think about his actions and life . Thus , there is every chance that he may truly repent and reform . <p> The convicts whose eyes are donated can be put under the care of the Malaysian Association for the Blind ( MAB ) and given special counselling for six months to a year until they have adjusted to the loss of their sight . <p> The money saved from having to build more prisons and staffing them can be channelled to a national eye foundation or MAB , which can use the funds to improve the lives of the many unfortunate blind people in this country . <p> Perhaps the eye operations can even be reversed ( depending on the convicts ' behaviour and state of medical science ) .

@@40286235 <p> HIGH home prices are an issue even in developed countries where the average wage earner is paid a lot more than Malaysians . <p> Malaysia 's RM5,228 median household income in 2016 means RM188,208 should be the maximum affordable house price , using Demographia International 's Median Multiple ( MM ) method , where a house is considered affordable if it is less than three times the household median annual income -- a level Malaysia and many parts of the world has not seen since 2004 . <p> The bottom 40% of households ( B40 ) can only afford homes priced up to RM108,000 each while the middle 40% households ( M40 ) can afford up to RM225,900 , based on their median monthly household income of RM3,000 and RM6,275 respectively . <p> That is some way below Malaysia 's average all-house price of RM387,258 as at end-2016 , according to data from the Valuation and Property Services Department ( JPPH ) , The Edge wrote in October 2017 . <p> Some 41% or 2.23 million urban households earn less than RM5,000 a month but Malaysians would have to earn RM10,757 a month for the average house price @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the MM method , instead of being " severely unaffordable " at 6.17 times income . <p> As it is , households earning below RM2,000 a month spend 94.8% of their income and only have RM76 left over for emergencies or savings at the end of the month , according to a recent report by Khazanah Research Institute . <p> The same study found that households earning below RM3,000 a month spend over 80% of their monthly income while those earning below RM5,000 a month spend at least 70% of their income on necessities in 2016 . While those earning above the median household income of RM5,228 have a bit more flexibility with up to 67% going to household expenditure , their residual income is actually lower after taking into account income paid as taxes and compulsory social security schemes . <p> A key takeaway from the Khazanah research is that housing and housing-related items take up the largest share of household expenditure at 28.2% , way above the 18% for food at home and 13.7% for transport . All three take away six out of every 10 ringgit earned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only increase over time and has to come with higher productivity , which results from education , training and reskilling . <p> Reducing the cost of housing and transport , which makes up 42% of household expenses , can also help increase disposable income for people who do not have much money left over after accounting for rent/mortgage , food and transport . <p> This concept was highlighted in Budget 2019 and addressed through a fixed monthly transport card as well as the private sector-driven property crowdfunding platform , which Finance Minister Lim Guan Eng said only serves as an alternative source of financing for first-time home buyers . <p> The government " will continue to support the construction and completion of affordable homes " , with RM1.5 billion allocated for that in Budget 2019 . Bank Negara Malaysia is setting up a RM1 billion fund to help those earning below RM2,300 a month become first-time homebuyers for houses up to RM150,000 at lower than market financing rate of 3.5% per annum . First-time homebuyers buying residential properties under RM500,000 will also be exempted from paying stamp duty on sales @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ December 2020 , Lim said when tabling Budget 2019 on Nov 2 . <p> The government also wants property developers to pass on to consumers the benefits of cost savings from the Sales and Services Tax ( SST ) exemptions given to construction and building materials by reducing the prices of new homes . Certainly , there is always room for improvement . <p> An example of a private-sector driven property crowdfunding platform is FundMyHome , which hopes to help Malaysians , especially those with young families , own their homes instead of renting . <p> It " will not require government funding , concession or guarantees " , says Tong Kooi Ong , chairman of EdgeProp Sdn Bhd , in an open letter to former prime minister Datuk Seri Najib Razak . Tong is also chairman of The Edge Media Group , which owns The Edge . <p> Under FundMyHome , investors ( currently institutions and not individuals ) pay 80% of the property price , gets 5% guaranteed yield on their investment a year for five years , and have 80% share of the upside in property price @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 20% of the property purchase price but gain full utilisation of the property for five years , thus saving on rent and may even earn some rent towards a down payment or take a mortgage after five years . <p> The buyer also gets 20% share of the gains if the property appreciates . <p> If buyers can afford to pay 20% of the house price , there is nothing stopping them from getting a loan for the whole house instead of opting to get an 80% financial partner under FundMyHome . The government has also said it will continue to fund affordable homes . <p> A key difference between FundMyHome and conventional home mortgage is the size of the loan the home buyer commits to on day one . Someone earning RM3,000 a month , for example , is more likely to be given a RM60,000 loan ( 20% of RM300,000 ) versus a RM300,000 loan . <p> A RM60,000 personal loan at 5% interest over five years would cost RM1,250 a month , and incur interest of RM15,000 over five years . The RM60,000 loan would only need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FundMyHome gives the option for someone already paying that much on rent every month to pay towards a 20% share of the property instead of contributing to someone else 's . Alternatively , the buyer would also have a property with which to earn rental income for five years . <p> What about the step-up financing scheme offered by Perbadanan PR1MA Malaysia when 60% of PR1MA home buyers could not get conventional loans approved ? <p> Under the Special PR1MA End Financing ( SPEF ) , someone earning RM3,000 a month would only be able to get a RM187,000 loan under conventional financing but would be able to borrow up to RM283,200 under the step-up financing scheme plus withdrawals from Employees Provident Fund ( EPF ) savings . <p> Based on PR1MA 's illustrative monthly payment of RM1,096 ( Year 1 to 5 ) and RM1,615 ( Year 6 to 35 ) for a 35-year SPEF loan of RM238,200 , the total interest cost would come up to RM363,993 , bringing the total loan cost to RM647,193 , or 18 years annual income for someone earning RM3,000 a month . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asset , there is no guarantee the value will go up . Not tapping one 's EPF savings to help fund a larger mortgage than what one 's salary can currently afford also allows the compounding effect and EPF dividend to work earlier towards old-age savings . <p> To be sure , if a RM300,000 property under FundMyHome appreciates by 20% after five years , the owner would still have to take a RM300,000 mortgage to buyout the 80% investor because the property would now be worth RM360,000 . <p> But someone earning RM3,000 a month today would also be earning closer to RM4,000 a month in five years , if his or her salary grows by 5% a year , and he can better afford a larger loan . The knowledge that one would have to save enough money to afford a loan for the 80% after five years can also be an added motivation for savings and more prudent spending . <p> The property can also go under another five years of FundMyHome if investors are interested to continue , with the buyer only needing to top up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough to cover 20% equity . <p> As a loan for the 20% share of the property is based on one 's current income , the issue of subprime does not arise as the loan for 20% of the property is not a mortgage and is not a debt the buyer can not afford . <p> That said , even a 20% stake comes with some risk , as with any investment . If the value of the RM300,000 house falls by up to 20% , the buyer 's RM60,000 equity share of the house will be lost in proportion to the decline and he or she would still need to buy out the investor 's 80% share at RM240,000 after five years , or walk away from the deal . If the house price falls by 30% , or RM90,000 , to RM210,000 after five years , the buyer would only need to take a RM210,000 loan to buy out the 80% investor , or walk away . <p> The homeowner will bear all third-party costs , such as agent fees related to the sale , including the cost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , according to details on the FundMyHome website . <p> For now , concerns that the platform could fuel property speculation may be tempered by the fact that FundMyHome is for first-time homebuyers and properties priced below RM500,000 . Only institutions can be the 80% investor , pending details from the Securities Commission of Malaysia on the peer-to-peer financing framework that is being finalised to enable the wider public to come in as investors . <p> In the meantime , the increased disposable income for buyers as a result of having to spend less on home mortgage in the first five years will free up resources that can help raise national savings or private consumption to boost the nation 's economy .

Because of the players on the team , the likes of Messi , Ronaldo , Marcelo and Ramos always get a Team of the Year so it 's just a case of upgrading each of them . That 's why I have n't really replaced Ramos yet even though I could with an Icon , because I know he 'll probably come back into the team when he gets a blue card . <p> As your team is so expensive , are there any cheaper , more affordable players you 've tried this year that you would recommend ? <p> Yeah I 'd say Mousa Dembele and Riyad Mahrez , especially Mahrez @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good as Messi , that 's how good he is . <p> With your 4-2-3-1 , have you played around and experimented much with tactics at all ?

@@40351236 <p> CAN the woes at the Federal Land Development Authority ( FELDA ) be fixed by merging it with another floundering government agency ? This question could be answered in the federal government 's White Paper on FELDA , which is scheduled to be tabled in parliament on Dec 10 . <p> The Edge Malaysia had reported earlier ( " Saving FELDA " , Issue 1241 , Nov 19 ) that the White Paper may contain a number of proposals to revive FELDA , including a potential merger with the Federal Land Consolidation and Rehabilitation Authority Bhd ( Felcra ) . <p> In any case , any such merger would not be feasible . The two entities were set up for different purposes , though with a similar goal -- the economic uplifting of the poor . <p> Their different paths mean they may not share enough overlapping functions to justify a meaningful merger . The resulting entity is unlikely to see improved efficiency or reduced costs amid a lack of synergy between the two .

It stopped recruiting settlers in 1990 . <p> According to reports , the government agency has 317 settlements nationwide housing 119,000 settlers and their families . <p> Felcra was set up in 1966 to do something different -- create economic opportunities and raise agricultural output by rehabilitating and consolidating idle land in collaboration with state governments and private landowners . <p> Over the years , Felcra chose to pursue its mission largely by planting oil palm , rubber and padi . It now manages 220,086ha of the three crops for a minimal fee . Felcra was corporatised in 1997 . <p> While its function of helping oil palm smallholders may seem similar to FELDA 's , an economist tells The Edge that Felcra lacks the scale that comes from managing large areas of contiguous smallholder estates . That said , the economist adds that Felcra does own and manage a number of palm oil mills , which may be of interest to FELDA . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Felcra 's management also means that the operations may be too different from FELDA 's to consolidate in a beneficial way . <p> A look through Felcra 's 2014 annual report -- the latest available on its website -- reveals the six subsidiaries undertaking oil palm plantations are all based in Sarawak . At the time of writing , the geographical distribution of estates under Felcra 's management is unclear . Interestingly , it also has various subsidiaries and associates that are involved in a wide range of activities , including the management of a rice mill , agricultural wholesale trading , educational services , construction , funds investment and property development . <p> FELDA 's estates are mainly spread across Peninsular Malaysia and Sabah . Its listed commercial arm , FGV Holdings Bhd , does have a presence in Sarawak but its estates there are relatively small . <p> While FELDA has been under the spotlight for many years , Felcra has generally stayed under the radar . Its internal problems remain unclear to the public , despite undercurrents that hint at issues that need to be resolved . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ post-2014 . In the financial year ended December 2014 ( FY2014 ) , Felcra reported RM123.86 million in net profit on revenue of RM1.75 billion . But over the three years that have followed , Felcra 's margins have turned razor thin -- its net profit fell as low as RM5.11 million in FY2016 and only inched up to RM10.11 million last year , despite generally rising revenue . <p> Over the same period , its liabilities rose sharply from under RM1 billion up to FY2015 to RM4.34 billion in FY2015 and RM4.71 billion in FY2016 . <p> That is likely why an overhaul of Felcra seems to be on the cards . Tellingly , its new chairman , Datuk Mohamad Nageeb Ahmad Abdul Wahab , has pushed forward a full management audit of the group , signalling that a restructuring is at hand . <p> Replacing Umno politician and Kinabatangan MP Datuk Seri Bung Mokhtar Radin on Oct 1 , Mohamad Nageeb quickly got down to work and by end-October had made it clear that Felcra would tighten its belt to improve its finances . <p> " Trophy " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Football Club which costs RM8 million annually to maintain , and the disposal of its unfinished Menara Felcra in Jalan Semarak , Kuala Lumpur , as it can not afford the additional RM400 million needed to complete the tower . <p> FELDA is also in a financial squeeze . News reports say its cash balances may drop to as low as RM100 million by year end because it is drowning in over RM8 billion of debt and the land lease payments from FGV may not suffice to meet its needs . <p> In any event , with both entities struggling with their individual issues , a merger would not be a magic bullet to resolve their problems . <p> As things stand , the better way forward would be to identify the underlying issues at each entity separately and to formulate measures that address them specifically .

@@40399232 <p> Women are on track to earn the same as men -- in 202 years Wednesday , December 19th , 2018 at , Wealths World <p> SINGAPORE * The good news : The global gender gap has improved , slightly . The reality : Differences in economic opportunity , including pay between men and women , are so vast it 'll take 202 years to fully bridge them , according to the World Economic Forum ( WEF ) . <p> The group looks at several measures of equality between men and women in this year 's Global Gender Gap Report , released yesterday . Overall gender disparity across politics , work , health and education improved by less than 0.1% , meaning it 'll take 108 years to reach parity . The economic opportunity gap -- based on participation , pay and advancement in the workforce -- remains the area that 'll take the longest time to close . <p> The figures are a tiny improvement from last year 's results , where the gap between the achievements and wellbeing of men and women widened for the first time in more than a decade . <p> " What we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country that 's achieved gender equality , regardless of level of development , region or type of economy . Gender inequality is the reality around the world , and we 're seeing that in all aspects of women 's lives , " said Anna-Karin Jatfors , regional director for United Nations Women . She added that " 202 years is too long a wait " for economic equity . <p> Jatfors said governments can help spur improvements with equal-pay policies and investment in parental and elder care infrastructure , and by allowing women legal protections including job security during pregnancy . <p> There 's been " minimal progress " since last year 's report in measuring economic participation and opportunity , the WEF said , with the worst-performing countries mainly in the Middle East and North Africa . Only 34% of global managers are women , and income gaps have been " particularly persistent " , with 63% of the global wage gap having closed so far . <p> Iceland Tops <p> Iceland was the best performer on the list for the 10th year running . It also remained No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slid in female representation among legislators , senior officials and managers . In October , Prime Minister Katrin Jakobsdottir was among scores of Icelandic women who walked out of their workplaces to protest wage inequality and sexual harassment . Other nations with female leaders -- New Zealand and the UK -- finished seventh and 15th . <p> In Asia , the Philippines edged its way into eighth place on the overall global index . As such , it was the best performer in Asia , boosted by gender equality in education , politics and an improvement in wage equity . The country is far ahead of the continent 's next best performer -- Laos at 26th . Singapore ranked 67th and China was 103th , coming in last globally in women 's health . <p> Political empowerment is where the gender gap remains the widest , according to the findings . The US fell to the 98th spot for the measure , sliding from 66th in 2006 . Still , in the midterm elections last month , which took place after the survey data was collected , women won a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 19 , fuelled by Democratic opposition to US President Donald Trump . <p> Progress in political empowerment in the West has been slightly reduced , with the gap of women in Parliament in 22 Western countries being 41% . Yet , improvement is being made in the rest of the world . <p> Warning Ahead <p> A new sector for gender imbalance is emerging , according to the report . The gap in artificial intelligence ( AI ) is three times larger than in other industries , according to an analysis conducted by the WEF and LinkedIn . Women with AI skills are more likely to be employed as data analysts and information managers , while men tend to land in more lucrative and senior positions such as engineering heads and chief executives . <p> A number of factors are at play here , the report said , including automation affecting jobs typically done by women and fewer women entering high-growth employment areas such as information technology . <p> " In an era when human skills are increasingly important and complementary to technology , the world can not afford to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talent is already scarce , " said Klaus Schwab , founder and executive chairman of the WEF . <p> In this area , Singapore , Italy and South Africa outperformed others .

The group 's spokesman C. Supramaniam urged the government to ensure a level playing field between taxis and private cars . <p> " The current situation has greatly affected our livelihood .

But because he knew many connected people in the previous corrupted Government , he managed to have complete freedom and not serve his prison sentence . <p> I think high time the new Government enforce the court ruling . He has cheated before and he is cheating again now . <p> All these requirements for our Grab drivers is because the lazy teksi drivers are making so much of noise , threats and walkouts .

@@40399236 <p> The Penang Stop Human Trafficking Campaign calls for an end to exploitative practices in the recruitment and treatment of workers . <p> The recent man-made tragedies at Granito and Bukit Kukus in Penang exposed the shambles of employment practices in the construction industry , so carelessly sacrificing the safety and lives of workers for the sake of profit . <p> Equally , the tragedies exposed the very sad fact that no one either at state or federal level seemed or seems inclined to do anything at all to confront and address the many issues . <p> Now we have the allegations relating to Top Glove . No one who has been working on issues of labour migration will be in any way surprised . <p> The same issues have been highlighted again and again for many years by many groups , not least by the workers themselves . Unmonitored , exploitative employment practices are by no means confined to Top Glove alone . <p> These practices have been allowed to continue and become an endemic , established part of how our industries recruit and treat workers because of the indifference and self-interest of the previous government . Despite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , those in charge consistently behaved as though they were more interested in protecting companies and Malaysia 's ' image ' , whatever that may be . <p> Many of us have been quietly hoping that things were going to change under our new government , not least because modern-day exploitation of workers does nothing for the image of Malaysia . <p> Top Glove is a huge conglomerate . It has 40 factories , 648 production lines and 18,000 employees , producing the mind-boggling figure of 60.5 billion rubber gloves every year ( amongst other products ) . It has offices in Thailand , China , the United States , Germany , and Brazil . It has factories in the Klang Valley , Ipoh , Kelantan , Negri Sembilan , Johor and Kulim . <p> Their operations include recruitment practices which involve a complicated supply chain where it is relatively easy to lose track of who is actually responsible for whom and what , especially if no one is interested in establishing rights , standards or accountability . <p> It is a little distressing to watch the new minister attempt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a comprehensive overview of the many issues and a comprehensive policy that addresses all of these . <p> The key is to know on what basis we are operating as a country . Is our attitude to labour that it just needs to produce as many goods as possible at the lowest possible rate and therefore making the maximum amount of profits for the various sub-contractors and conglomerate companies like Top Glove ? <p> Or are we interested as a country to establish clear standards for employment as for all other aspects of our society , to ensure that all workers are properly valued , respected , protected and engaged , and all have a clear and effective right to redress when things go wrong ? <p> If we are interested in the latter , then we will be completely committed to identifying and calling to account anyone who is exploiting workers and any practice which abuses people . <p> As we have said several times , if company directors were made to serve jail time for any abuse of employment or other relevant laws , practices would quickly change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be political will . <p> Sadly , but possibly predictably , the present response is mirroring the responses of the previous government . <p> Firstly , if we can possibly blame the workers , we will . We are indifferent to the fact that millions of migrant workers here are in situations of debt bondage , which locks them into employment situations over which they have little choice and little options . Working long overtime is just one consequence . Instead of addressing the reasons why this has happened , and why for example there are so many reports of arbitrary deductions being made by employers or agents -- which trap workers further into debt -- we blame workers for daring to raise issues and blame them when they run away , desperate for a better situation . <p> Secondly , we deny that we know the facts and insist on a long and tortuous inquiry process , which may or may not address all the issues and will certainly take a long time and result in very little ( which is the idea , of course ) . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ad hoc and without thought , but presumably so people will think we are ' on top of the situation ' . The apparently serious suggestion to hold 20% of the foreign worker 's salary as forced savings is just one example of this sort of knee-jerk reaction . <p> Modern day exploitation of workers is hugely serious and hugely present , in Malaysia as elsewhere . <p> The allegations against Top Glove just add to the considerable body of evidence of how workers are trapped and exploited and labour and other laws flouted , across many industries , locations and companies . <p> Once again we are provided an opportunity to assert our commitments to Fair Labour and to Decent Work for All . Once again , we are given the opportunity to say that we are serious about respecting and enforcing our own laws ( and amending them where they are inadequate ) , bringing people to account , and stamping out the horrors that modern day oppressive conditions bring . <p> Our minister could have referred to the work and evidence gathered by , for example , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the many recommendations already on the table to stop the abuses . Why did n't he ? <p> Is the image of Malaysia that we want to promote an image trying to hide the fact that it is built on the back of modern-day exploitation of workers ? We do n't think so . <p> Top Glove is another case that beckons us to examine oppressive conditions for workers . Such an examination would allow us to see to what extent industries consistently fail to respect , protect and value workers . If these sorts of allegations are true , it demands from us the response that employers and company directors are made responsible for their actions , whoever they may be . <p> The Penang Stop Human Trafficking Campaign is not alone in praying that relevant employers , contractors , company personnel and any other person in authority are properly and quickly investigated and punitively charged , not just to face a pathetically small fine ( which was the case of Granito , for example ) . <p> Nor are we alone in praying that the New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changes to our recruitment , treatment , and protection of all workers , wherever they are in the supply chain , and from whatever background or place of origin . Work is being done to this end , so let 's make it meaningful . There is clearly a long way to go . <p> The Penang Stop Human Trafficking Campaign is a member of the Migrant Workers Right to Redress Coalition , whose report ' Towards a Comprehensive Policy on Labour Migration for Malaysia ' has been made available to government agencies and policymakers as a major contribution to finding solutions .

" <p> Wong said this when met at the handing over of 375 strata titles from the State Land and Survey Department to City Mall buyers and developer at Wisma PKNS , Thursday . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took the buyers and developer more than 10 years to receive their strata titles . Wong also urged all property developers to surrender their titles for subdivision as soon as possible after starting their development projects . <p> " I notice they ( property developers in the State ) seemed to be very slow in surrendering their titles for subdivision . This will pose a lot of problems for buyers if the developers do n't fulfil their responsibility to buyers . <p> ADVERTISEMENT <p> " After you start the project , you should surrender your title for subdivision . In fact , the Land and Survey Department said most of the applications have already been approved for subdivision and that the developer has to act fast to engage a surveyor and pay the premium so that the surveyor can survey all the lots . <p> He said if the survey can be done after physical completion rather than after the Occupation Certificate ( OC ) is issued , then it 's even better . <p> " If after the OC ( and there are already people living in the units @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing the survey .

Otherwise , It may take them ( buyers ) up to 20-30 years ( even ) to get their titles . " <p> Wong said property buyers should also look at the management fee charged by the developers ( when they want to sell their units or get a loan ) . This is because some developers might also charge a high fee of RM5000- 10,000 just to get a consent letter . It should n't be that much . Around RM500 should be more than enough .

@@40439234 <h> Year Ender : Sea change in Malaysia 's approach towards trade pacts <p> 30 Dec 2018 / 14:55 H. <p> Pix for representational purpose only . <p> KUALA LUMPUR : The year 2018 saw a sea change in Malaysia 's political and economic landscapes , with a high-profile trade war and tit-for-tat action between the world 's two largest economies serving as a backdrop to what could be an eventful year for international trade pacts . <p> Apart from dealing with the game-changing double whammy , the rise of trade protectionism , resurgent nationalistic movements and inward-looking policies also slowly took place globally , even within Asean countries . <p> Consequently , getting a final nod for the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership ( CPTPP ) and Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership ( RCEP ) deals -- the two biggest trade pacts involving Malaysia -- is proving elusive as different countries have different sensitive issues that they are defending or promoting , never mind coming to a collective agreement or concession . <p> Domestically , Pakatan Harapan ( PH ) which won the general election and came into power on May 9 , helmed by Tun Dr @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and campaign to curtail foreign interference especially in terms of trade and economy in the country . <p> During the 2018 Asean Summit in Singapore , Mahathir pointed out that taking into account national priorities did not mean advocating the government to adopt inward economic policies but rather to work together and actively engage in finding amicable solutions and resolving trade issues through multilateral dialogues . <p> He also made Malaysia 's position very clear -- Malaysia will not agree to lopsided trade deals and any trade deal must either be equitable for developing nations or there will not be any deal at all . <p> The deal must be mutually beneficial and no arm twisting or smaller economies cowing to powerful nations and engaging in populist narratives just so to please economic superpowers , he had stated . <p> And this , more often than not , refers to the mother of all trade deals , the CPTPP , which is a rebranded Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement ( TPPA ) that collapsed after the United States withdrew in January 2017 under President Donald Trump . <p> The prime minister said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agreement on the CPTPP to see how it would affect Malaysia 's efforts to distribute wealth in the country in an equitable manner . <p> He said although there was a possibility that Malaysia would ratify the CPTPP , the country would ask for some exemptions . <p> As of October , more time was required to ratify the CPTPP , according to the Ministry of International Trade and Industry secretary-general Datuk Isham Ishak . <p> He said at least two additional Parliament sittings would be required to amend the laws and regulations . <p> " There are 18 laws and regulations that must be amended by Parliament before Cabinet approval is sought . As per the original schedule , we are supposed to get the CPTPP ratified by February 2019 , " he said . <p> Japan , Singapore , Mexico , Canada , Australia , New Zealand and Vietnam had ratified the deal , which met the minimum threshold -- ratification by six signatories -- for the CPTTP to take effect by year-end . <p> Aside from Malaysia , Brunei , Chile and Peru have yet to ratify @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been mixed with three PH members of parliament ( MPs ) calling for the government to withdraw from ratifying the CPTPP , stating that Malaysia would likely face devastating socio-economic consequences if it choose to ratify the pact . <p> Permatang Pauh MP Nurul Izzah Anwar , Subang MP Wong Chen and Klang MP Charles Santiago said the CPTPP would not bring any benefit to the poor , terminally-ill , women or even governments . <p> The Bantah TPPA/CPTPP movement said Malaysia should not ratify the trade deal as it may lose the flexibility of its essential policies , shaped by the multi-ethnic society . <p> Meanwhile , the Institute for Democracy and Economic Affairs ( Ideas ) opined that Malaysia should ratify CPTPP to ensure sustainable economic development in the future . <p> Ideas described the pact as a high-quality agreement that would benefit Malaysia because historically , the country 's economic growth was largely driven by trade openness rather than infrastructure developments . <p> Negotiations on the RCEP , another mega trade agreement , is still ongoing . At this point of time , its conclusion date @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Alluding to the world 's largest trade pact , covering nearly half the global economy , its negotiation is set to be completed by end of next year , <p> RCEP is often conflated as a Chinese-led initiative but in fact Asean is the main driver behind it with other members that also include Australia , China , India , Japan , New Zealand and South Korea . <p> Prevailing geopolitical tensions between member economies may lead to the continued stifling of progress with regard to RCEP negotiations but RCEP stands as the alternative for member countries , especially Asean to advance the trade liberalisation agenda . <p> Some 65% of Asean 's trade is with RCEP countries , therefore it must leverage on existing high-level trade linkages . <p> Mahathir said both the Asean Economic Community and RCEP can work in tandem to provide a good template for the rest of the world towards inclusive and dynamic integration among countries of varying level of development but with common aspirations for progress and economic engagement . <p> As for Asean , its intra-regional trade has been stagnant at between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ groupings such as the European Union and The North American Free-Trade Agreement ( Nafta ) at 63% and 50% , respectively . <p> Achieving over 30% intra-trade in Asean is seemingly an ambitious target but still , all in , Asean must pursue and embrace this by opening up opportunities and explore new possibilities . <p> A global Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation report divulged that Southeast Asian corporates had the most bullish trade outlook in the world , expecting more production and investment to swing in Asean 's path . <p> Going forward , Malaysia has developed a strong trade network and diversified sectors over the years , which would enable domestic companies to navigate disruptions and seek new opportunities and alternatives . <p> Besides , the country was committed to engage and pursue other trade initiatives through bilateral and multilateral agreements that would benefit Malaysian companies and entrepreneurs .
