@@125231 <h> Do I really need a Ryanair passport ? <h> Q I signed up for a Ryanair Cash Passport because I was told that it was the only way I could avoid paying credit card charges . Now I am told this is no longer the case . <p> A : Big story this . Ryanair customers are going to save a packet on credit card charges in 2013 because of a change in English law . Now they charge only a 2pc card fee , which is 88 cent on the average Ryanair fare and only reaches the old fee of ? 6 if you pay ? 300 for a ticket ( as can happen ; try missing a flight and buying a new seat at the airport ) . There is no need for a Cash Passport . <p> It was Ryanair 's way of weaving their way through consumer regulations .

But it was the only way of avoiding the then penal ? 6 each way credit card charge , or as Ryanair always described it , an administration charge , because it was so far above the fee charged by credit card companies . Even debit cards were being charged . <p> This was in defiance of EU Unfair Commercial Practices law , which ( as Ryanair suspected ) was difficult to enforce .

That means and endless procession of big-bang , book-now flash sales , repeated in cycles . The current offering is near-identical " children go free " offers ( book with Stena by March 16 and Irish Ferries by March 19 ) . <p> The problem arises with peak travel prices , where fares are up around 20pc on former levels .

On the other hand , the general consensus was that the beaten Munster finalists Borrisokane were the better team and had been stunned by two late goals in their provincial decider . <p> While overhead conditions were dry if bitterly cold , under-foot conditions were far from perfect yet two well matched teams produced a wonderful contest with both sides enjoying periods of dominance . <p> Roscrea got off to a great start and before they knew where they were the Laois side were trailing by three points . They settled with the aid of a strong breeze as Daire Quinlan and Pat Whelan fired over two points before the Roscrea captain , Conor Sheedy restored the two point advantage . <p> Rathdowney then enjoyed a great spell shooting points from Aiden Corby and Stephen Bergin to lead by two after 13 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ score for St Fergal 's .

Sheedy pointed before Ciaran Collier set up Sam Conlon for two magnificent goals , and the Camross man , Collier added a long range point to leave the Munster champions in front by four and it was looking bad for St Fergal 's . <p> They did not panic and shot two points through Quinlan and Corboy to narrow the gap entering the final quarter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in defence .

We may be harbouring the next U2 , James Joyce or Neil Jordan in our midst , but we have no money to nurture and develop them.Lack of arts funding is not just an Irish phenomenon , though . <p> Aoife Scott <p> Last week , it was announced that a movie version of the US TV series Veronica Mars will go ahead because 33,000 fans raised over $3m for the project on the Kickstarter website , an international funding platform for creative projects . Over here , we have Fund it , a ' crowd-funding ' website . <p> The way it works is that the artist sets a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , and then friends and supporters pledge an amount towards it . A range of enticing rewards is promised in exchange for the amounts pledged , but the rub is that if the target is not achieved , the funder does n't receive any funding at all . <p> Aoife Scott ( 30 ) is a talented singer-songwriter who is raising funds for her debut album through www.fundit.ie . <p> Aoife has been gaining a stellar reputation in recent years . As the daughter of Frances Black , she was immersed in the world of music from an early age . Her exquisite vocal talents were featured heavily in the IFTA award-winning TV series 1916 Seachtar na Casca and she beat over a thousand artists to win a support slot to Bob Dylan and Van Morrison at the London Feis . <p> Aoife also won first prize at the Ballyshannon Folk Festival Showcase in August 2011 . She is aiming to raise ? 7,500 through Fund it for her debut album , which will be released later this year . See www.fundit.ie/ project/aoife-scott -- -debut-album <p> It was seeing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money through crowd-funding campaigns that inspired Aoife to start her Fund it campaign . With straitened record companies slow to invest in emerging artists , particularly in the area of folk and traditional music , the charming singer from Dublin 8 knew that it was up to her to self-finance her debut album . <p> " It has always been my dream to be able to hold that bit of plastic in my hand and say , ' This is my album ' , " she says . " I do n't think I 've ever wanted anything more in my entire life , but I procrastinated for about six months because of the fear of it not working out , and putting my fate in the hands of people who believe in me . " <p> Production <p> As a former film editor and producer , Aoife was well-versed in the area of budgeting , but chose to pitch her campaign amount lower than the final figure required . <p> " I will need to borrow the rest to make up the difference , but , thankfully , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I worked out studio costs , musician costs , album duplication , printing and artwork , and budgeted it from there . <p> " You want your first album to be the best that it can possibly be , but being a production manager in a past career life made me want to immediately cut corners everywhere . " <p> Apart from the regular rewards of concert tickets and signed albums for pledging small amounts , Aoife 's research suggested to her that people were motivated to get involved by the more interesting and unusual incentives . So she is offering the likes of a cycling tour of Dublin , singing a harmony part on the album , or having a song written about you . <p> " I love cycling , and I love Dublin , so for a few bob pledged I will bring people on a cycling tour of the city , " she says . <p> " For me , it would be a joy to bring someone out to show them two of my passions , but they 'll have to listen to me waffling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rewards are that myself and my songwriting partner , Enda Reilly , will find out a bit about you by Skype , and then we 'll write a song about you . I think doing it this way is a brilliant way of getting fans more involved , because once they 've funded it , they are constantly kept in the loop as to how the project is going and are hugely involved with the whole process . " <p> Aoife believes that crowd-funding is a fantastic idea in a recession , when money is tight for everyone , particularly for those in creative industries . <p> " I really feel that it 's like a beacon of light for the arts industry in Ireland , in what is a very dark and scary time for everyone , " she says . " I feel very lucky to be a part of something that is so positive . I am three-quarters of the way there with the funding and have two weeks left , so hopefully I will reach my target and make this album .

More than that , she is being ridiculed for gaining weight . While pregnant . How very dare she . <p> This is not a piece in defence of Kim -- grabbing column inches is her main occupation , and she 's no fool . But call me crazy , I was of the assumption that once a woman was pregnant , her body was off limits to criticism . Even writing that I feel ridiculous , because , of course , all of our bodies should be off limits to public scrutiny . But the sad fact is that women 's bodies are metaphorically dissected and judged , from coffee shop gossiping to rag mag gloating . <p> Kardashian , though , is an interesting study as until now she has been touted as a positive body image role model . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tape and subsequent reality series , and no , she 's not role-model material in terms of substance or intellect . However , women are inexplicably drawn to her and the millions she 's made from endorsements suggest many of us also want to emulate the Armenian beauty 's look .

This is something the girl ca n't help , and nor should she have to . In fact , she 's been working out with a " baby trainer " to avoid such a kerfuffle , but getting criticised for that too . <p> This is a prominent example of being careful what one wishes for , as Kim 's international camera-hogging means she has put herself out there to be scrutinised .

" <p> I assume nobody has been fooled by Minister for Health James Reilly 's claim that he has instructed the Health Service Executive to review the funding of young people 's mental health website SpunOut. ie , arising from its publication of an article advising teenagers on how to approach the tricky question of three-in-a-bed sex . Surely everyone copped that the SpunOut initiative is part of a long-term strategy to restore the economic conditions of the Celtic Tiger ? Indeed , I suspect it 's part of a radical pilot scheme designed to further expand options and understandings relating to intimate relationships , which , if successful , could be rolled out across the EU . <p> Allow me to explain .

Back in the 1970s the price of an average house existed in a cast-iron relationship with the average annual income of a male worker , which was usually , for mortgaging purposes , subject to a multiplier of 2 ? . A key triggering factor in the creation of the 1990s housing boom was the undoing of this correlation , when banks altered their basic mortgage-lending formula to take account of double-income families as more and more women moved into the workplace . Thus , banks were enabled to cut loose a little , extending additional credit equivalent to a second household income , opening up a rolling frontier of lending capacity . Consequently the money supply across Europe more or less doubled in every decade since the 1960s , largely accounting for the ostensibly exponential expansion of the European economy during that period . <p> Mortgage ceiling By the turn of the millennium , however , the mortgage ceiling was being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and female ) salaries having been stretched as far as it could reasonably go . It was becoming obvious that , within the present dispensation , there was no possibility for generating another surge , and the present plateau was arrived at . <p> Mortgages , from which most of our money originates , now take two total concurrent careers to repay and can not be further expanded within the existing model . Since money is chiefly generated through mortgage lending , the European money supply has recently been contracting alarmingly , as prudent borrowers take advantage of every opportunity to pay down debts early . <p> Hence James Reilly 's ingenious strategy . It 's obvious that the only thing standing between Europe and a return to robust economic health is the rather uninspired habits of its population with regard to marriage and cohabitation . The recalcitrant propensity of citizens to settle down with just one partner is clearly at the root of our continuing difficulties . Far better for people to live as threesomes , foursomes and whatever-you're-up-for- yourselfsomes . Hence the SpunOut experiment . <p> When ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ implausible , consider a scene in a public house , about 1974 , in a sleepy midlands hamlet , where the town 's two openly homosexual men ( the word " gay " still meant " happy " ) might be sipping pina coladas together of a fair day . Were you to walk into that bar in Granard or Drumlish and fall into conversation with these two notional national prototypes , you would find it impossible to communicate how much public attitudes towards them would shift in the coming half-century . Were you to tell them that , by the teenage years of the 21st century , they might be able to get married -- and to one another ! -- they would fall off their stools laughing . Within an hour the joke would have travelled the length and breadth of the town , provoking the same response in all who heard it .

Why not four or five or 100 ? Why not one man and the National Women 's Council of Ireland , or two women and Shamrock Rovers ? Or one man and One Direction ? Surely only backwardness and myopia stand between us and total freedom -- not to mention , as James Reilly has so shrewdly understood , economic nirvana ? <p> One day we will look back on the SpunOut episode and indentify it as one of the great national turning points -- akin to the 1971 arrival of the condom train at Connolly station -- when we finally shook off the narrow-mindedness of the early 21st century . <p> On that day , in a commune in the midlands , a child will turn artlessly to her mother 's partner and enquire , " Daddybuddy , what 's a couple ?

Instead tell them that " there is n't any specific treatment to make your illness go away but there is a lot we can offer you to cope " . <p> Patients should also be regularly offered discussions regarding their prognosis , concerns , needs and wishes at the end of life . <p> The patient should also be offered the option of not discussing topics and deferring the discussion to another time . <p> " Once a terminal diagnosis is made patients can feel abandoned .

As sometimes happens when you get an intriguing pop observer like Koenig talking loud , there 's just not enough room in print for everything which he has to say . In this case , he 'd a lot to say about his views on pop which just did n't quite fit into an interview about their new album " Modern Vampires of the City " so here 's some extracts from the transcript which did n't make it into print . Call it the extra tracks on the bonus disc . <p> " People have so many different ideas about making their band stand out that it can be easy to forget that the easiest thing to do is have great songs . If somebody took the temperature of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that America had been invaded by the European sensibilities of dance music and there was also the big use of AutoTune . Based on that information , you 'd tried to predict the next big band and you 'd think it would be dancey , electronic with big beats . But the next big band turned out to be Mumford &amp; Sons . So nobody knows anything . <p> " If I looked at Rolling Stone and Pitchfork and the New York Times now and tried to create a Frankenstein song based on what they were saying was cool , it would be impossible . But I 'm a modern person , I listen to dance music , rap , rock , pop , weird minimalist electronic stuff and country . Rather than having to mould that into one thing , I can focus more on the feelings or sounds that inspires in me . <p> " People lose perspective . At any given moment , there are people who hate pop music because they associate it with bros or stupid backward people . The truth is if you look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ influence of electronic dance music and the manipulation of vocals and sounds , it 's incredibly avant-garde . These are the kind of things that science fiction writers in the Fifties were dreaming about , music made entirely without organic sounds and vocals processed to perfection . You could make an intellectual case for why that is amazing and exciting . But it 's all about context so you have to be excited about the moment you 're in . If you get too reactionary , your music will become a little joyless . <p> " I 'm 28 , I 've been obsessive about pop music since I was 10 years old . But the odds that I 'm going to hear a record that sounds like something I 've never heard in my life are unlikely . I might find something which moves me in a way I did n't think was possible when I was a teenager , but I think I 'm fairly au fait with most genres of music . <p> " I 'd always defend current pop music to the death . That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a band , something like ' we 're living in borrowed time , the rock canon ended years ago , everything is a rehash , it would have been cooler to have been alive in 1977 ' . I 've never bought into that . I 'm happy now , this is the time I belong in . <p> " When I picture those stories that you read about some young guy in England hearing Elvis and rock'n'roll for the first time , I believe that was a seismic event because he had so little access to outside things . To suddenly hear that was crazy . <p> " Like , when I was first heard A$AP Rocky , I thought he was fresh and distinct but I 've been listening to rap since I was a little kid . It did n't blow me away but my curiosity was piqued and I began to spend more time with it and realise he is a very important and unique modern artist . You almost have to have a more subtle ear now . No-one is going to hear rock'n'roll or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? ' <p> " The period that we came out in was a funny period . People would say ' look at Clap Your Hands Say Yeah , you guys are idiots for signing to a record label ' . In 2007 , people were saying they 're about to stop making CDs . Other people were saying to give your music away for free and just tour . Others were saying bands would n't be able to fill arenas anymore because there would be no more global superstars . People were saying and thinking so many crazy things that to have clearcut expectations of success was just not possible in that period . It was hard to know what to expect . Could you have dreams of having a gold or platinum album ? Even that was mental . <p> " My goals were modest . I wanted to play the Bowery Ballroom in New York . When I was in college , The Walkmen played there and I thought that was so cool . We accomplished that very quickly so everything else was the icing on the cake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us to become a professional band . When you start out , you 're excited about art and music and culture . Then , at a certain point , making albums and going on tour and doing press becomes your job and a joyless experience . We have n't let that happen . We still put our excitement about music first . <p> " The thing to remember from being around for all this bloggy music period is how quickly music can get chewed up . I 've seen bands disappear after one album . The craziest thing is seeing bands disappear before they even release their first album , which is so bizarre . When you break it down and take a calm look at all these opportunities and showcases and infinite chances for a band , you need to wonder if you say no to all of these if you really disappear off the face of the earth . Then you remember that the best thing you can do is when you release an album that it 's strong and you believe in it . Rushing something out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is never going to work out . <p> " Having two successful records helps to take the pressure off . When people ask if there 's pressure for the new album to be a success , I go ' well , there was n't that pressure the last time around ' . You do n't have that existential dread that you might disappear with a bad second album , that your very existence might be threatened by a bad second record . That makes you nervous . Even if you 're working on a good second album , you still question yourself a lot . Who wants their whole life to change in a bad way ? With a third album , there is pressure but it 's creative pressure . Does this continue the story of the band ? Is this a retread in any way ? We 're in a place where I ca n't predict our future commercial success but we have built ourselves a nice creative platform . It feels very free . We can do anything we want now . <p> " We signed a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an album before we had a label . We 've always been self-sufficient so we 've only worked with people who understand that . We really appreciate the counsel of our team but ultimately , we make the final decision . <p> " You have to be careful when you say no . We said no to shows for 18 months which some people thought was unusual but we knew we wanted to work on the record . It 's funny how quickly your perspective changes .

Played before a large attendance , the high scoring contest saw some stylish passages of hurling from both sides , Clarecastle finishing the stronger with seven late points , in response to St Josephs solitary white flag . Alan O'Neill led the way for the Parish with a 3-5 haul , his three goals coming in a four minute spell either side of half time that turned a 1-9 to 0-5 deficit into a 3-6 to 1-9 lead two minutes into the second period . The Magpies absorbed the blows however and hit back with some of their own , Stephen Ward also catching the the scoreboards eye , his 2-2 from play proving a vital contribution .

@@418238 <p> But to a criminal lawyer , this description is barely recognisable . A trial is a highly specialised type of ritual , with much in common with a complex game . It is full of technical pitfalls for the prosecution which can and often do result in relevant evidence being withheld from the jury . <p> In Ireland , we have a very vocal human rights industry that is rightly vigilant against any miscarriage of justice that involves the conviction of someone who is , in fact , innocent of the crime concerned . <p> But who is to be vigilant for the other type of miscarriage of justice -- the acquittal by a court of the person who is in fact guilty of the offence ? Such a miscarriage of justice is not something that can simply be accepted with a shrug . It can have devastating effects , firstly on the human rights of the victim of the crime , and secondly on society by releasing the person to offend again and violate the human rights of some potential future victim . <p> Where a jury has properly considered all the evidence and acquitted the person , that decision is quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been interfered with or if compelling new evidence emerges -- changes that were introduced in 2010 as recommended by the Balance in Criminal Law Review Group of which I was privileged to have been a member . <p> The real problem is not so much decisions of juries , which rightly must command great respect , but acquittals directed by a judge or convictions quashed by an appeal court . Of all of the reasons why judges feel obliged to rule out relevant evidence , the most objectionable must be what is known as the " exclusionary rule " -- the rule that evidence that is obtained in conscious and deliberate breach of the Constitution must be excluded , in the absence of extraordinary excusing circumstances . <p> This rule came centre stage in 1961 when the US Supreme Court held it binding on state criminal trials . After that , it was only a matter of time before it reached our shores , and in 1964 the Supreme Court here decided that it formed part of Irish constitutional law .

This is a luxury we can not afford , and I wonder how long we are going to tolerate it . <p> The rule is completely disproportionate and allows virtually no discretion to the judge to weigh and evaluate the competing interests . It places no real value on the rights of the community or of the victim , or on the substantive weight of the evidence in terms of showing of innocence or guilt . <p> Murder weapon found in the accused 's house ?

Where evidence is obtained in breach of the Constitution , a judge should have discretion as to whether to admit it or not . But the notion of ruling such evidence out in almost all circumstances has introduced a massive imbalance at the heart of our criminal justice system and turned trials into technical battle grounds . <p> Evidence obtained " in breach of the Constitution " sounds like a serious matter . But seeing as the Constitution quite properly protects the home and personal liberty , any minor irregularity with any arrest or any search of a dwelling puts the gardai on the wrong side of the Constitution . <p> The legal context is now entirely different from that in the Sixties .

We could wait for the Supreme Court to cut the exclusionary rule down to size .

You thought you knew your partner , trusted him , but in the blink of an eye , that trust is shattered . <p> It might be time to call a private investigator <p> PIs are the kind of thing we associate with our Atlantic cousins . They are mysterious , chain-smoking characters straight out of the pages of a Raymond Chandler novel . <p> But according to one of Ireland 's top PIs , turning to a private investigator is , for many , the only way to get an honest answer . <p> Liam Brady is Ireland 's most sought after private investigator . With over 36 years in business , he has seen a growing demand for his services , a demand he attributes partly to the recession . " Every day I see an increase in the domestic cases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phone calls a day from frantic people desperate for help , " he says . <p> For Liam every case is different but there are alarming trends he links to the economic downturn . <p> " I 'm seeing more and more of it in the recession . People are under more pressure and react to it in different ways . " <p> The process of hiring a PI is straightforward . A client -- or someone close to the client -- will make contact as they try to find evidence to support their suspicions . It is always emotional and rarely leads to reconciliation . <p> " If we were talking figures , I would say 70 per cent of the people we investigate are male and 99 per cent of the time the client 's suspicions are confirmed , " he says . <p> Despite today 's rising marriage age and a more cautious approach to commitment , Liam says affairs and other types of cheating behaviour are easily facilitated using modern technology . <p> " Technology has affected the way affairs happen , for example people use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's ironic but it 's often having an untraceable second phone that gets people caught . " <p> Fergal Rooney , a psychologist with St John of Gods Hospital and Co-ordinator of Psychological Services for Healthy Relationships and Sexuality , agrees that technology has created more opportunities for people to stray : " Any fantasy is now just two taps away on a phone . We now have people immersed in anonymous online communities which may give them a temporary sort of comfort , but is creating a sort of double life , splintering their personalities . " <p> So , despite fantasies being a mere ' two clicks away ' , why do only some of us succumb to temptation ? <p> For Fergal , the answer lies in our childhood . " A huge part of how we carry out our adult relationships is based on the quality of our early relationships , " he says . <p> Fergal agrees with Liam that during the recession , people may be more inclined to engage in adultery and damaging sexual behaviours . But he feels it stems from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experiences affect our ability to ' get up and go ' and cope with what comes along our way . These affect our individuality , our interpersonal skills .

" <p> The results of Liam 's investigations -- despite being expected -- usually bring about shattering emotional trauma . <p> " When we collect the information and proof we need , we can deal with it two ways . We either give it to the client directly , especially if they already had an inkling about the case . Or , in more sensitive cases , we can give it to their local solicitor who can then -- in strictest confidence , pass the information on to the client .

" <p> Cases like this are extreme and Fergal insists it is not reflective of Irish society as a whole . " I want to reinforce the message that this is not the bulk of the population . It 's representative of a specific demographic but it 's not everyone . " <p> So we should n't give up on trust and monogamy . But when is the right time to contact a private investigator ? <p> In Liam 's experience , there is often no smoke without fire . <p> " The old saying is true : when in doubt , check it out .

For example , the key outcome from the meeting in Brussels was that innovation has to be at the heart of the major changes that must take place to achieve sustainable healthcare systems , she said . <p> Technology <p> Richetta emphasised the importance of achieving the best health outcomes possible and using technology to both drive this and save costs at the same time .

" The earlier you act on chronic disease , the less costly it will be later on . A wait-and-see approach can be damaging and you can miss the chance to have an early solution for the patient .

The project revamped the appointment system , and by contacting the patient beforehand , made sure they were more likely to attended their appointment and were also more likely to have all the necessary information to hand . <p> " The results speak for themselves . Previously , there was a 34 per cent rate of no-shows which dropped down to 5 per cent and resulted in increased efficiency within the system .

This is convenient for parents and avoids unnecessary travel and pressure on hospitals . The project , launched in 2008 , has been very successful and has treated more than 3,000 babies , leading to the avoidance of 14,000 hospital appointments . <p> Conclusion <p> Richetta said she hoped the Dublin Clock Watching meeting had encouraged the Irish healthcare stakeholders it brought together to engage , discuss and work together on creating solutions to ensure Ireland 's healthcare system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for all who need it . <p> Dr McLoughlin told the meeting that the Government wanted to engage in a " true partnership with industry " and see innovation hubs covering medical devices , pharmaceuticals , ICT and other industries on the campuses of all the hospital groups . <p> While Ireland 's healthcare services are currently going through very challenging times , Richetta said there was a real sense of connectiveness in Irish healthcare that not all countries have , as well as a willingness to work together to improve patient care . <p> Concluding , she said it was now clear that healthcare stakeholders do not achieve much by working in isolation , and that it is by working together that meaningful and successful change can be achieved . <p> Yes friends , I have supported your ideas of patient involvement in regards to their treatment to achieve life long wellbeing .

" Continuing your rudeness , you might then go on to point out that , in the 1960s , music changed more quickly than at any time in the 20th century ( or , possibly , any other century ) . I do n't think that applies to Bob Dylan . Just consider how many of the psychedelic artists continued to cover his songs . The Dylan of the mid-1960s still seems pretty modern now . His refinement and perfection of post-Beat gibberish poetry remains the model for all contemporary lyricists . <p> Anyway , Pennebaker 's documentary proves -- if proof were needed -- that Dylan was painfully aware of the contradictions inherent in his supposed alternative to the mainstream . The iconoclast ( consider the film 's title ) had become an unshakeable icon . His response was then -- and always has been -- to offer a sort of parody of himself . As long ago as the year covered by Do nt Look Back , his live performances featured versions of his own songs that , with their exaggerated drawls and throwaway aspirations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called " Bob Dylan " . <p> Pennebaker captures that , but , more importantly , he captures Dylan 's commentary on the absurd business of being unwillingly placed in charge of the counterculture as it approached its busiest hour . There is so much to enjoy in these conversations . His joust with a confused Time magazine correspondent is hilarious and a little cruel . His treatment of acolyte Donovan is harder to read : is Bob really a fan or is he slightly appalled by this efficient copy ? Joan Baez -- though a good sport about it today -- has every right to be slightly disgusted by the cavalier way she , an early supporter of Bob , is ( sometimes literally ) shifted into the wings . Perhaps , only Cracked Actor , Alan Yentob 's relatively minor study of David Bowie , catches a more revealing picture of a pop star during his most creative period . <p> The highlight of it all , of course , remains the opening treatment of Subterranean Homesick Blues . Do n't call it the beginning of the rock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the end . Everything that happened on in the 1980s seemed silly by comparison . That really is Allen Ginsberg prowling in the background as Bob spins through his cards . <p> It 's an extraordinary record of an extraordinary time . But it 's also a great documentary in its own right . A lot of guff is written in glorification of the often-dreadful 1960s . This film proves that some of the hysteria is deserved . <h> Forgot Password ? <h> Thank you <p> You should receive instructions for resetting your password .

@@442234 <h> The Bigger Picture <p> Firstly , a recap of the last weekend for Rangers Football Club . It is a situation so fluid that even as I write this , circumstances are changing . <p> Embarrassingly knocked out the League Cup in the first round to lowly Forfar Athetic , many believe Ally McCoist 's time is up . Whilst he was unable to field any new signings , this side should have been more than good enough to beat the part-timers of Forfar . The positive signs and feel good factor of pre-season is all but eradicated . But despite this humiliating result , there is a bigger picture to look at here . <p> Charles Green returned to the club on Friday in what is described as a ' consultancy role ' . One of his first acts in this ' role ' was to run to a tabloid and claim that McCoist " had to win a league and a cup " , that he " would never have sanctioned the number of signings McCoist 's made " and reiterated his belief that last seasons Rangers side was ' the worst Rangers team ever . ' McCoist understandably blasted these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is clear him and Green are not friendly . <p> Just hours after the announcement of Green 's return , Rangers revealed they had received a request for an EGM , with the proposal of removing members of Charles Green 's consortium including Bryan Smart , Brian Stockbridge and Craig Mather , and replacing them with Paul Murray and Frank Blin . <p> Confused ? I do n't blame you . So let 's break it down . <p> Rangers looks to be subject to a takeover once more . Charles Green 's consortium has done it 's job , it has raised in excess of ? 35m through IPO money and season ticket sales , which have actually increased this year . Green and his chums are pocketing very healthy salaries from this cash , but they have spent a huge amount of it . According to some newspapers , only around ? 15m remains in the bank and this is being consumed at an alarming rate . Best guesses are that Rangers will run out of money sometime around this seasons midway to end point unless extra capital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into play . Charles Green and co will make their money via the sale of their shares , and will be millionaires for it . The request for the EGM is believed to come from Jim McColl , a man worth ? 800m and who is thought to have the backing of 30-40% of the shareholders at Ibrox . Paul Murray was Rangers finance director under David Murray , and Frank Blin was executive chairman of PwC in Scotland , a hugely reputable accountancy firm . Their job will be to examine how bad the state of financial affairs is inside Ibrox before reporting to McColl just how bad the situation is . <p> But whilst McColl may have his sights set on good corporate governance and financial stability for the club , he is not thought to want to invest a huge amount of money . Dave King has long been mentioned as a potential buyer , and he is someone who Paul Murray knows well . The pair of them is a plausible scenario . Meanwhile , Green 's consultancy role will undoubtedly be to try and find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for when he does sell . It is sitting around 41p right now . Buyers value it around the 35-40p mark according to newspapers , so this could also be a last ditch attempt to raise the share price . <p> And as for the McCoist -- Green spat through the press ? Well , McCoist and ex-chairman Walter Smith are close friends , and Smith formed part of McColl 's takeover team when he originally tried to buy the club . It is yet another symptom of the soon-to-be ongoing negotiations between the sides at Ibrox . <p> Rangers are already sold , that much is clear . The original consortium can not and will not fund the clubs losses . The ongoing tussle that will emerge in the papers is just to determine two things : Who will buy and how much for ?

@@442238 <h> Bus strike shows ' working week ' is outdated <p> Thursday , August 08 , 2013 <p> By Paul Mills <p> On Tuesday evening both sides in the Dublin Bus dispute decided that they needed to sit down with the Labour Court . <p> Whilst it was welcome it was not before time . After all , the basis of the strike was a Labour Court recommendation which was already a compromise to an earlier company plan that was rejected by the unions . <p> That a strike would happen was well signalled . That it would start in the middle of a bank holiday weekend meant not as many people as on a normal weekday would be inconvenienced . On Tuesday it started to bite and the voice of reason , even if it is only short term , won . <p> The genesis of the strike appears to be relatively simple . Government has been cutting back on the subventions paid to Dublin Bus . Furthermore it informed Dublin Bus it would have to make ? 11m in cuts and these would have to come mainly from the payroll side . Now given that this is a CIE subsidiary it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been suggested that having the unions from a CIE subsidiary lead from the front against government policy was welcomed because of that company 's ongoing worker history of objecting to any change and the relative weakness of their position on this one . <p> The weaknesses are several . One is that the initial company demand that core pay for a standard week , which is just shy of 40 hours , be reduced by 10% was thrown out by the Labour Court after the unions asked it to intervene . <p> The reductions were required only on premium pay which includes the equivalent of three times standard pay for a bank holiday . <p> On Tuesday , it became known that 75% of the workers in Dublin Bus do not want to work overtime -- so only 25% were really affected . To top it all we were informed on the Joe Duffy Show by one of the strikers that the company wanted to reduce workers ' holiday entitlement . It would appear that after a certain number of years , a Dublin Bus employee gets 34 days annual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Duffy were mixed . While most , if not all , were unhappy at the disruption to people 's lives , many did otherwise support the striking workers . Unfortunately , it did not appear that this support was specifically for the workers ' own case but was rather against government policy of taking and then again taking from those who can least afford to pay . <p> Indeed one 75-year-old lady spoke of having voted Fine Gael all of her life but never again . Whilst it was n't yet evident on various vox pops , it is hard not to expect that pensioners on bus passes would not be thrilled to hear the unions ' main suggestion was a levy on those having " free bus passes " . <p> This strike surely begs a lot of questions . For instance , why do we cling to the concept of a working week from Monday to Friday ? We live in a 24/7 world and very many people working in that world work in businesses and services that operate on a 24/7 basis . Every day is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ working overtime but why should there be any premium pay for someone rostered to work on any day of the week if it 's not specifically overtime ? <p> This Monday to Friday working week concept means our hospitals do not fully function over weekends or holidays . Our schools and colleges are generally closed or are not fully utilised over weekends . <p> These are issues that will raise their heads again . <p> Dublin Bus is in serious financial difficulty and any assurance to its workers that these overtime pay restrictions will be lifted after X period of time will make it a hostage to fortune . <p> It 's hard to see any early way out of its financial difficulties that do not include more subvention which is just not there or higher fares which would exacerbate diminishing returns .

The next six months might well be far more interesting than the last six months . Time will tell . " <p> Ice-cream had a bumper summer , as Caroline Smith of Smith 's Ice Cream Vans explains . " Those couple of weeks we had in July had a good impact . Ger Caroline 's husband is in this game over 30 years and I 'm with him for 15 , so it 's a long time since we got a good summer .

When the sun shone , everyone in the country wanted ice-cream vans . Corporate business took off . The phone never stopped with companies ringing to treat their staff last minute . They 'd ring up looking for a van the same day , so the logistics are difficult from my perspective , because obviously you do n't want to turn it down . <p> " We run from February through to the end of October , then it 's holiday time for me .

Almost every farmer in the county ran out of feed ; that never happened before . <p> " We went over to England and bought 8,000 tons-worth of maize silage . We also brought a lot of hay in from England . Myself and a colleague of mine went to France to buy hay . When we got there , a farmer told us there were 2,000 bales in the area . <p> " We said we 'd take them all if he organised it , and he said ' No , the farmers have to meet these men buying the hay ' .

" <p> Steve Dunford is an author and historian from Castlebar . He dedicated his summer to The Gathering event In Humbert 's Footsteps , re-enacting the 1798 invasion of Ireland by French forces . " It was all-consuming . It was absolutely fantastic . This whole idea started seven years ago when I was in contact with two French guys , and I had just written a book called In Humbert 's Footsteps . We stayed in contact , and for this re-enactment , we brought 20 guys form France , 20 guys from England , and Irish guys playing Redcoats . <p> " I wondered in the middle of it how Napoleon moved armies without email .

You can imagine organising the navy and helicopters , and permits bringing weapons in to the country , and feeding the guys and putting them up .

We 're not glorifying anything , but it has given a new impetus to view it in a different light . Gen Humbert is the only victorious Napoleonic general whose name is not on the Arc de Triomphe , and the only one not to receive the L ? gion d'honneur . But we 're going to work on that now . <p> " We 've got 1,798 trees from Coillte , and we 're going to replant them in little groves in all the places that have associations with 1798 here , in the North , in France and possibly in England , so there 's an environmental legacy to this as well .

When you look at it as a whole , it was n't spectacularly good , but it was placed in the context of the abysmal summers before it . <p> " One of the things we looked at in July is what we would define as a heatwave . Now , you can define a heatwave whatever way you want . What 's a heatwave in Spain , is n't one in Ireland . If you look at five days consecutively with a maximum temperature over 25 , then 10 of our stations would have reported heatwaves for five , six , seven days in July . We certainly have n't had anything like that since 1995 , and 2006 was also a pretty good year . <p> " Once the weather makes the news , when you see it at the front part of the bulletin as well as the end , be that a storm , flooding or high temperatures , our workload increases .

And health warnings as well : sunburn , UV warnings , pollen warnings , heat stroke , you 'd have to focus on those risks .

The better the weather is , the higher the number that are out in the water , the greater the number who get into some sort of difficulty . This year it was very much related to weather , because we noticed a spike , unfortunately , in loss of life , whereas during other summers people were n't out using the inland waterways . <p> " A lot of people were using waterways -- quarries or lakes -- that they would n't have usually or would n't have been familiar with .

You 're telling customers to bring suncream instead of , ' you 're not allowed bring umbrellas , wear wellies ' . Seeing people sitting down and having a drink was great .

Initially , he ran a sound studio , where people could make a recording of their own voice to take home , but it was when he bought a box camera that he began his life 's work . <p> " In the beginning , my mum Doreen had a studio near O'Connell Bridge and she 'd print the photos , and people would buy them .

People working in the restaurants near the Adelphi Cinema used to bring cups of tea out to him , " David says . <p> " At that point he 'd have been in his eighties and to many of the young people working around the place he might have looked like an old guy out to make a few pounds , but there was no getting him to retire , " he says . <p> " As a family , we 're proud that so many people remember him so fondly .

Despite the U.S. government shutdown affecting the site , a barricade was removed to give veterans access to the memorial.Law enforcement officers stand at right as the Lincoln Memorial , and most of the federal government , is closed in WashingtonThe Lincoln Memorial in Washington , and most of the federal government , is closed <p> President Barack Obama has scaled down a long-planned trip to Asia , as a US government shutdown entered a second day with no end in sight . <p> Obama is expected to leave on Saturday for summit meetings in Indonesia and Brunei but he will not visit Malaysia and the Philippines as planned . <p> The president would thus be able to return home just days before an even bigger crunch in Congress , which will put the United States at risk of defaulting on its debts if it does not raise the US public debt ceiling . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the government 's borrowing power is rapidly merging with the standoff over everyday funding , which has forced the first government shutdown in 17 years and forced hundreds of thousands of federal employees to take unpaid leave . <p> The White House announcement followed a fruitless day on Capitol Hill , with Congressional Democrats and Republicans coming no closer to resolving their differences . <p> Obama accused Republicans of taking the government hostage to sabotage his signature healthcare law , the most ambitious US social program in five decades , passed three years ago . <p> Republicans in the House of Representatives view the Affordable Care Act as a dangerous extension of government power , and have coupled their efforts to undermine it with continued efforts to block government funding . The Democratic-controlled Senate has repeatedly rejected those efforts . <p> The standoff has raised new concerns about Congress 's ability to perform its most basic duties and threatens to hamper a still fragile economic recovery . <p> " This is a mess . A royal screw-up , " said Democratic Representative Louise Slaughter of New York . <p> As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and government agencies stopped functions ranging from cancer treatments to trade negotiations , Republicans in the House moved to restore funding to national parks , veterans ' care and the District of Columbia , the capital . <p> An effort to pass the three bills fell short yesterday evening , but Republicans plan to try again today . They are likely to be defeated by the Democratic-controlled Senate . <p> " That 's important - a park ? How about the kids who need daycare ? " said Democratic Representative Sander Levin of Michigan . " You have to let all the hostages go . Every single one of them . " <p> The shortening of the Asia trip , designed to reinforce US commitment to the region , is the first obvious international consequence of the troubles in Washington . <p> " They 've shut down the government over an ideological crusade to deny affordable health insurance to millions of Americans , " Obama said on Tuesday . <p> Republicans said Obama could not complain about the impact of the shutdown while refusing to negotiate . " The White @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a spokesman for House Speaker John Boehner . <p> A Reuters/Ipsos poll indicated that 24pc of Americans blamed Republicans , while 19pc blamed Obama or Democrats . Another 46pc said everyone was to blame . <p> Republicans said their latest proposal would help elderly veterans who earlier yesterday pushed past barricades at the National World War II Memorial to get into the site . <p> " They 're coming here because they want to visit their memorial , the World War II memorial . But no , the Obama administration has put barricades around it , " said Republican Representative Mike Simpson of Idaho . <p> All three bills won support from a majority of the House , but fell short of the two-thirds vote needed to pass under special rules that allow quick action . Republican leaders plan to bring up the bills for a regular vote today . Obama said he would veto the bills if they reached his desk . <p> The veterans in question had gotten in to the memorial with help from several Republican lawmakers . But they did not seem interested in taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of little kids fighting over candy , " said George Atkinson , an 82-year-old veteran of the Korean War . " The whole group ought to be replaced , top man down . " <p> The selective spending plan appeared to temporarily unite Republicans , heading off a split between Tea Party conservatives who pushed for the government funding confrontation and moderates who appear to be losing stomach for the fight . <p> Representative Peter King , a New York moderate , estimated that more than 100 of the chamber 's 232 Republicans would back Obama 's demand to restore all government funding without conditions . That would be enough to easily pass the House with the support of the chamber 's 200 Democrats . <p> The shutdown closed landmarks including access to the Grand Canyon and pared the government 's spy agencies by 70pc . In Washington , the National Zoo shut off a popular " panda cam " that allowed visitors to view its newborn panda cub online . In Pennsylvania , white supremacists had to cancel a planned rally at Gettysburg National Military Park . <p> Stock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yesterday , with investors confident a deal could be reached quickly . The S&amp;P 500 closed up 0.8pc and the Nasdaq Composite gained 1.2pc . <p> But the US Treasury was forced to pay the highest interest rate in about 10 months on its short-term debt as many investors avoided bonds that would be due later this month , when the government is due to exhaust its borrowing capacity . <p> A week-long shutdown would slow US economic growth by about 0.3 percentage points , according to Goldman Sachs , but a longer disruption could weigh on the economy more heavily as " furloughed " workers scale back personal spending . <p> The last shutdown in 1995 and 1996 cost taxpayers $1.4 billion , according to congressional researchers . <p> The political crisis has raised fresh concern about whether Congress can meet a mid-October deadline to raise the government 's $16.7 trillion debt ceiling . Some Republicans see that vote as another opportunity to undercut Obama 's healthcare law . <p> Failure to raise the debt limit would force the United States to default on its obligations , dealing a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> A 2011 standoff over the debt ceiling hammered consumer confidence and prompted a first-ever downgrade of the United States ' credit rating . <p> Analysts say this time it could be worse .

The program had a rocky start as government websites struggled to cope with heavy online traffic . <p> " What I 'm hearing from my constituents at home is if this is the only way to stop the runaway train called the federal government , then we 're willing to try it , " said Texas Senator John Cornyn , the second-ranking Republican in the Senate . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @

@@564240 <h> ' I dare and survived electrifying Limerick obstacle course ' <p> Shocked : Leanne Moore and Brendan Ring completing the Adare to Survive challenge - through the electric shock obstacle . The pair were running for the Cliona Foundation , which was the event 's nominated charity this year . Picture : Liam Burke/Press 22 <p> It was the question most commonly put to me -- and no doubt many others -- when I said I did Adare to Survive , on Sunday last . People looked puzzled when I mentioned the name , and aghast when it was explained that it was the first 7.5km military style assault course to be held in the county , on the grounds of Clonshire equestrian centre . <p> It was just your average leisurely Sunday afternoon , of crawling under barbed wire , wading through pits of mud , climbing bales of hay stacked 20ft high , navigating two courses wired with electric shocks , and trying to springboard ourselves over fences built for horses , where the dismount was rarely graceful . <p> And when we thought we had conquered the toughest challenges , they then handed us a concrete block to haul around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us to crawl in darkness in an underground tunnel . Any phobias of heights , water , and confined spaces were put to the test here . <p> " Are you mad ? " they asked . <p> The answers were , ' Yes ' , and ' Yes ' . Thankfully some 600 people were just as mad to do it -- and many have vowed to do it again . It is not your average 10km run through a concrete city , with knees hammered by the tarmac . It was electric - in every sense - with over 30 natural occurring and man made obstacles to challenge the body , mind and perceptions of what you could and could n't do . Unlike the solitary nature of running , this was a course where complete strangers waited to give you a hand or leg up , and stayed back until you were firmly on your feet . The finishing time was inconsequential . This was truly a marathon ( team ) effort , and not a sprint . <p> " We wanted this to be an experience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ray Nash , who came up with the idea earlier this year . <p> The real feelgood factor about the event was " the incredible sense of personal achievement at completing the course . <p> " It 's not every day you find yourself getting into a skip of iced water before crawling on a mud bank under a bed of electric wires . " <p> Fellow director Mark Tuohy was responsible for the course design and said that the event slogan " Endeavour Endure Enjoy " was at the heart of the creative process . <p> " We were determined to produce an original course of the highest quality by incorporating the four elements of earth , fire , water and air . People had no idea what to expect . " <p> Gerard Burke of UK Biggest Loser fame took part , along with TV presenters Leanne Moore and Aidan Power of RTE , who tweeted " Electrocuted , burned , submerged and buried , all for a great cause .

@@574231 <p> Oh , no . Not another Marilyn Monroe documentary/Audrey Hepburn biography/Marvel Heroes adaptation/Last minute goal for Man United/Plotless Downton Abbey episode . Some things we 're sick of due to their inevitability and sheer volume but after Liz Garbus ' engrossing Love , Marilyn I can delete the first one from the list .

Her honesty , her insecurity , and her loneliness are all laid bare . Ben Foster reads from Norman Mailer , Paul Giamatti does his best George Cukor , and Adrien Brody thankfully does not do a Truman Capote impression . <p> This to-camera presentation jars at the beginning , however ; the actors try too hard , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the part , and Garbus ' tendency to have them jump about the screen like Chinese shadow puppets superimposed on the ' letters ' irritates . But the perpetual montage style works , picking you up and taking you along with it . <p> Calling this the ultimate hagiographic documentary is to come up short : Monroe is painted as a proto-feminist , in posing nude was ' anticipating a sexual revolution ... that would not have happened without Monroe , ' and , oddly , is completely faultless when she refuses to return to set , driving directors batty . The pills were forced into her by her psychiatrist ( played by F. Murray Abraham ) . <p> It 's the dual personality that 's most striking , though . There 's Norma Jean Baker , the orphan girl who dreamed of being a movie star , and there 's Marilyn Monroe , a construct , a thing invented to woo the world into the theatres . ' Do you want to see me be her ? ' she asks a confident before stepping in front of the cameras @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mirror , ' I 'm looking at her , ' was her reply .

@@578232 <h> Struggles in Kosovo <p> The last embers of the flames that licked through Kosovo during its bloody 1990 's conflict with Serbia flickered out a long time ago . These days it 's only cultural and diplomatic tensions between the two neighbours that burn , but the heat they generate makes working towards normalising relationships in the this part of the Balkans difficult . <p> The government in Pristina , representing the Kosovars in the Albanian dominated south , are locked in a tug of war with Belgrade and a Serb-led rebel assembly in the northern city of Mitrovica over what they say are their rights as a sovereign state . Their demands are plain and few . They want recognition of the declaration of independence made in 2008 , since offered legal ratification by the European Court of Justice but rejected by Serbia and a minority of other European states ; they want an international dialling code and a clear path to begin negotiations over membership of the EU ; and they want the Kosovo national football team -- the Rising Eagles -- to take what they consider to be their rightful place in UEFA and FIFA sanctioned competition . The situation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of change may be ready finally to start turning . <p> Football in Kosovo is a hostage to the country 's position in the international community . Without recognition by the UN as a sovereign neither FIFA nor UEFA will consider an application for full membership as was made plain by the most recent rejection in October 2008 shortly after independence was declared . That leaves the Eagles on something of a leash in international football terms . As of February 2013 friendly matches against FIFA-affiliated nations are sanctioned but on the draconian condition that no endorsement is made of Kosovo 's prospective position as a national unit -- no flags , no anthem , no acknowledgment that the team is representative of anything other than the eleven players on the pitch . Kosovans may play football but not , it seems , as Kosovans ; they must do so , in any nationalistic sense , invisibly . In pursuing a position of neutrality in the Serb-Kosovar stand-off it 's difficult to shake the feeling that the world governing bodies are n't implicitly rubber stamping the anti-separatist card . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this bizarre spectacle up on its feet . The Eagles have n't played a match since a 2-0 win over the now bankrupt Swiss outfit Neuch ? tel Xamax back in 2010 when a ban on competing against FIFA affiliates was still in place but the battle off the pitch for the Kosovan Football Association ( FFK ) is far from won . February 's decision marks a muddled beginning to a new phase of change but the goal has always been a place in the draw for major tournament qualifying , and here precedents come into play . The FFK point to the likes of Scotland and Switzerland who have long been UEFA and FIFA affiliates without holding a UN seat but inconsistencies are a constant blight on the membership criteria landscape especially where the Home Nations are concerned , and there are no noises coming out of Zurich that Europe 's governing body will be prepared to relax their legislation to allow smooth passage for Kosovo . <p> As for the nations that continue to oppose UN recognition for Europe 's newest state the feeling is that a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preventing the likes of Spain and Cyprus from co-operating , reluctant to step foot on the mine field that could open up before them if Kosovo are granted independence .

So far only a small gesture in the direction of police and judicial autonomy has been made by Pristina but if it helps pave the way for further concessions on both sides then a scenario in which Belgrade offers its blessing for the FFK to exist independently in world football does n't seem so fanciful further down the line . <p> As long as Pristina remains frozen out internationally by the domestic insecurities of neighbouring states improving the relationship with Belgrade seems the brightest hope of getting the Rising Eagles off the ground and into the winds of competitive football for the first time .

More than four months later , Shackleton arrived back on Elephant Island to rescue his 22 stranded companions and bring them all home . <p> There have been several attempts to recreate the voyage -- including the Irish South Ar ? s expedition of 1997 , led by sailor Paddy Barry and mountaineer Frank Nugent . The Irish group was forced to abandon the sea voyage when the replica lifeboat capsized three times in a row @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Period equipment and foodJarvis studied these previous experiences before his attempt , which would use period equipment such as wool and gabardine , and food such as biscuits and pemmican , a concentrated mixture of fat and protein . <p> While Jarvis and company did have a motorised support vessel shadowing them , there would be " no guarantee of rescue " if something happened at night in the Southern Ocean . <p> Jarvis left his wife Elizabeth at home with two small children . His oldest son had not even been born when he began planning the project . His accomplices were round-world racing sailor Nick Bubb , Royal Marine mountain leader Barry Gray , navigator and round-world sailor Paul Larsen , Royal Navy petty officer Seb Coulthard , and mountaineer and Arctic explorer -cum-cameraman Ed Wardle . <p> " Our one concession to safety , apart from lifejackets and lines -- which we did n't use -- and the support vessel , was an automatic identification system tracker , which would prevent us from being run down by another ship , " he says .

" Some made themselves sick -- it was very seasick-inducing sea , with 100 degrees of movement . But there were times when you had a chance to appreciate the wonder of it all . The close encounters with Right whales , which would roll over and one eye would appear , for instance . About 400 miles from Elephant Island one penguin popped up beside us , entirely alone , and then vanished again .

" <p> There were other similarities . " Among the three of us doing the traverse , Gray was the Tom Crean type character , as he had n't been a great sailor but cooked and sang ; and Larsen , as our navigator , was our Worsley . " <p> There were some " differences " of opinion , but no serious rows , he swears , and there is a taste of this in the three-part television series . " We did share a sense of unity in adversity , " he says . <p> As an environmental scientist , Jarvis had been keen to incorporate a climate change dimension to the venture . " People do n't listen to hockey stick curves by US guys in suits on this issue , " he says . " They respond to stories and personal experience . " <p> " Shackleton and company crossed three glaciers on South Georgia . One of those , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Penguin numbers are also falling , he says . With less sea ice , there is less algae on which krill feed , and less food then for the birds . " <p> " There has been 2.5 degrees of warming in parts of Antarctica since the 1950s , and so , where Shackleton was trying to save his men from the Antarctic , we feel we are trying to save the Antarctic from man . " <p> " And you know , although we did succeed in our mission , we still have n't done what he did , because we did n't have to leave 22 men on Elephant Island who were dependent on us for their lives .

Their wardrobe consisted of nothing more than black catsuits covered in tiny grey balls . Their props were frequently just lumps of wood or metal . <p> " It was strange because it felt so foreign to me , " admits Page of the set-up in the motion-capture studio . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little bit . Maybe that 's what I did , jumped , I guess . " <p> Frankly , it was not a good look for an Oscar-nominated actress -- even her face was dotted every day of the shoot with the grey balls -- but the effort was worth it because she humanises the most extraordinary game of 2013 . <p> Beyond eschews the tattered videogame tropes of big guns , over-muscled soldiers and improbably proportioned women . Instead , it mines a rare seam of introspective , interactive storytelling , spanning a decade of the life of a young woman cursed with a supernatural guardian . <p> Page 's subtle performance -- masterfully motion-captured and conveyed on-screen with unnervingly realistic graphics -- is equally at home channelling the eight-year-old girl as it is her older teenage version . Dafoe comfortably holds his own in a supporting role as a CIA agent assigned to investigate her . <p> While the actress anchors the emotional centre , the narrative is driven by Beyond 's director David Cage , a French auteur with a history of left-of-centre story-led games . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unique experience , " Cage told Edge magazine during the game 's protracted development . " I am not interested in giving people ' fun ' , I want to give them meaning ; I do n't want to challenge their thumbs , I want to challenge their minds . " <p> True to his word , Beyond is no twitchy shoot-em-up . The player gently guides the characters through the scenes -- there is no failure , no game over . The branching storyline caters for all eventualities -- if you fluff a task , the game moves on . <p> Make no mistake , though , Beyond delves into some dark places , going where few of its peers dare -- sexual assault , drug use , homelessness , euthanasia . Amid the many grim but moving moments lie glimpses of light , such as the home-birth and the awkward first date . <p> All of this is made possible by Cage 's 2,000-page shooting script and the bare Paris-based sound-stage where it was all brought to life . <p> " You walk past the performance capture space @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explains Dafoe . " You look at that and say , My God , all that stuff , happened in that space today . When I say happened I mean in your imagination . It 's a powerful feeling . " <p> Cage believes what he and his team did is unique . " What we used to do in the past was to shoot the voice in a sound booth . You lost all the body expression , all the subtleties . For Beyond it was completely different . " <p> Critics have responded to Beyond with accusations it lacks player involvement . But with dozens of possible endings , Cage is asking you to find meaning in your choices . Try that playing Call of Duty .

The only Cork club to have won the provincial crown since his own side did it in 1987 has been Newtownshandrum . <p> " The way the Cork champions have performed in the club championship in the last 25 years has been a reflection of Cork 's place in hurling . Newtown won three Munster titles in the 2000s ' 03 , ' 05 , ' 09 , one All-Ireland ' 04 , Cork won two All-Irelands ' 04 &amp; ' 05 -- our record has not been good . <p> " Cork hurling needs the county senior champions to be winning a lot more often in Munster and contesting at All-Ireland level at least .

Midleton has a proud record in Munster two titles -- ' 83 &amp; ' 87 -- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and no-one knows that better than Fenton . A former Cork All-Ireland-winning captain and Hurler of the Year ( both in 1984 ) , multiple All Star , he has been involved with Midleton at every level as player , coach , manager and selector and as such is acutely aware of the challenge facing them on Sunday week against the champions of high-flying Clare , whether that be either Newmarket-on-Fergus or Sixmilebridge . <p> The last time Clare made the All-Ireland breakthrough , 1995 , they then went on to dominate the Munster club scene for six consecutive years , so they too have their history . <p> Midleton though , are well equipped to deal with that challenge and , says Fenton , also well balanced , despite Conor Lehane garnering the headlines on Sunday with his virtuoso display , 2-10 of Midleton 's 2-15 total . <p> " His scores were incredible . He 's the best I 've seen since Joe Canning for hitting the ball on the run . But everyone contributed .

When you 're a spectator it can be a lot tougher . <p> " But the final whistle -- absolutely fabulous , and the feeling afterwards ; the excitement , the relief . It brought back memories of the ' 80s and ' 90s but this is all validation of the great work being done by the club at underage and Conor is one of those who epitomises what we 're doing . <p> " You had other guys there like Killian Burke , Tommy Wallace , the O'Mahonys , Cormac Walsh who came on as a sub , younger again than Conor -- they showed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fantastic . <p> " They 're very disciplined too .

@@633234 <h> Westmeath CG chairman questions changes to National Finals <p> THE Chairman of Westmeath Community Games has questioned the decision made at national level to again alter the running order of the National Finals from 2014 . <p> In recent years , the Community Games National Finals have taken place in Athlone with the first weekend of Finals hosted in May and two further weekends of action taking place in August . <p> However , speaking ahead of tonight 's Westmeath Games AGM ( Thursday , November 7 ) , Johnny Crowley expressed disappointment that the May weekend has now been moved to August as well . <p> " At a recent National Executive meeting the delegates were informed that the two National Festivals in 2014 will now take place on the weekends of August 15 to 17 and August 22 to 24 , " Crowley said . <p> " This decision to move the May weekend to August was made by the National Officers and Directors without consultation with the NEAC Members , the Areas or Counties , and will cause a lot of problems for us in trying to organise the large programme of events . <p> " We raised a number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are to be considered and published later .

@@633237 <h> Lessons in Yoga 11 : Handstands - turn your beliefs on their head <p> Handstands were also something I could never do . I would happily pretend to be the cheerleader while the other girls at school practised this seemingly death-defying feat . <p> My reaction to practising handstands in yoga was ... " Oh no way ... I do n't do that ... I never have and probably never will " . I reasoned that my long arms would not support my weight and that I most likely had a rare undiagnosed allergy to going upside down . <p> So when handstands were served up on the menu in yoga , I would sensibly sit them out and try unsuccessfully to ignore the disappointment in myself . <p> That disappointment in myself became unbearable when as a yoga teacher I watched my students kicking up into handstands . I appealed to the class to " not worry about going into a full handstand , it 's not that important " ... <p> Time for a confession ... I like to be best in the class . Ok I said it . <p> I take great pride in my students ' improvements and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I find my place as teacher toppled slightly when a student can do something I ca n't . That 's horrible , is n't it ? <p> What 's even worse is when I once distracted my class so they would n't notice someone kicking up into a ' free ' handstand ( that 's when you 're upside down but not against the wall ... really hard ! ) I have n't gone as far as pushing anyone over in a class . That just really would n't be very Zen , now would it ? <p> So here are my two unpleasant , un-yogic but very human qualities : disappointment and jealousy . <p> I 'm well aware of them and have every intention of unpicking them and learning more about myself . <p> I 've done well at tackling the disappointment , which I will tell you more about . But as for the jealousy , I 'm might have to get back to you on that one . <p> So a few years ago after realising I 'm closer to 40 than 30 I decided I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my fear of my arms collapsing and my head crashing . <p> This fear , like most fears , is very real and very logical . But , like most fears , it kept me stuck in a belief pattern that " Jess ca n't do handstands " when in fact as I now know " Jess can do handstands " . <p> How many times do we do this to ourselves ? Tell ourselves something that we believe to be true , but which is n't ? <p> " I 'm not flexible , no one in my family is . " <p> " I would love to go walking in the Himalayas , but I will never have enough money/time/energy . " <p> " Happiness and contentment is not something I will ever really know . " <p> Belief patterns are the same as postural muscle patterns . If we hold our bodies a certain way for long enough , they will stay like that . <p> For our muscles to be healthy , we need to stretch and move them regularly or they will cease up and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important to do the same thing with our minds ? <p> To move , stretch and challenge our thoughts and beliefs so they stay flexible , adaptable and mobile . <p> The older we get , the more important this becomes . We all know ' mature ' people who are set in their ways , inflexible and immobile , both physically and mentally . <p> So I say " To Hell with that ! " <p> I hate the thought of seizing up mentally and being stuck in my ways . So I 'm practising handstands to test my belief and challenge my opinions of myself . It 's not easy , and the reason ? Fear . <p> This fear is not just of the obvious logical physical challenge , but could it also be fear of succeeding ? <p> What if we can climb a mountain ? What if we can write a book ? What if we can feel content and at peace with ourselves ? <p> Then , where does that leave us ?

Bring one foot up onto the wall and push into it until your other foot lifts . Bring both feet up onto the wall see if you can stay here for about 5 breaths .

Notice where your hips sit and turn around and place your hands on the mat where your hips were . Doing this means that when you step halfway up the wall and straighten your legs your hips will be directly above your head . <p> You might feel like you are going to tip over your arms , but you wo n't , I promise . <p> Practise holding your body in this right angle , with your arms and legs straight for about 5 breaths . This will really challenge your strength and confidence . <p> Listen to your body and your mind . If something is hurting , or you are scared , then stop at this stage and go back to the previous one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> You might just ' think ' you ca n't do this , or want to stop because it 's challenging . So see if you can detect if it 's your body that ca n't handle it , or if it 's your mind that ca n't ? <p> Keep coming back to this challenging bit , building up your strength and examining your physical and emotional reactions . <p> When you can hold this challenging right angle ( which might take a good few weeks of practising ) you are ready to try kicking up to a full handstand against the wall . <p> In the last stage , you start with you hands on the ground a few inches from the wall . Walk your feet in as close to your hands as possible , and lift one leg as high as you can .

But I still have to give myself a little ' Champ talk ' before I do a handstand . ' Go Jess , you know you can do it . 110% , that 's what I want to see .

@@633238 <h> Do your home work : how tax relief scheme works <h> It was a welcome announcement in last month 's budget and amounts to a 13.5 per cent reduction on home renovations .

If you spend more than ? 30,000 , the maximum you will be allowed to claim back is ? 4,050 <p> Who is eligible to use the scheme ? You can only claim the relief on renovations carried out on your home -- or principal private residence ( PPR ) in tax parlance -- and you will also need to have paid your property tax to qualify . The credit applies to the house , so even if it has multiple owners you will only be aim to claim the credit once . It is due to end on December 31st 2015 , but if you get your planning permission before this , the scheme will apply until March 31st 2016 . <p> How does it work ? If you are a PAYE taxpayer the amount of the allowable credit will be included in your annual Tax Credit Certificates for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carried out . If you are a self assessment taxpayer it will be incorporated into your tax assessment for the two years following the year in which the work is carried out . So , if work is carried out and paid for in 2014 , then relief of 50 per cent is given in 2015 and 50 per cent in 2016 and so on . <p> If you get work done before the end of this year , it will be treated as if it was undertaken in 2014 , and the relief will be granted in 2015 and 2016 . If you do n't have enough of a tax liability in the first year , then the excess can be carried into year two . <p> How much relief will I get ? All work which costs between ? 5,000 and ? 30,000 is eligible . If you spend more than ? 30,000 , the maximum you will be allowed to claim back is ? 4,050 . So , if you spend ? 6,000 on a new bathroom for example , you will be able to claim back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remember that the amount allowable is ex-VAT . So , for example , if you get work done for ? 5,000 including VAT , it wo n't be eligible . <p> What renovations qualify ?

You wo n't be able to claim relief on carpets , furniture and white goods and work which is subject to VAT at 23 per cent . <p> What about my garden ? According to the Revenue , the relief may also apply to your garden if landscaping is part of the " repair , renovation and improvement " of your home , and if the work is subject to VAT at 13.5 per cent . <p> What happens if I get work carried out by different people at different times ?

No , it is a " lifetime " limit and is the maximum you can claim over the life of the scheme . <p> I 'm looking to upgrade my boiler . Can I claim a tax credit under the incentive as well as claiming and receiving an SEAI Grant ? Yes . And no . According to the Revenue , you can claim twice on eligible work , but any grant you receive will be disregarded from the qualifying amount by a multiple of three . So , for example , if you spend ? 10,000 ex-VAT but also receive a grant of ? 1,000 to upgrade your property , then you will only be available to claim relief on ? 7,000 ( ie ? 10,000 -- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ? 945 . Similarly , if you receive an insurance payment which you put towards the cost of an upgrade , the full amount of this payment will be disallowed . <p> Can I borrow money to avail of the scheme ?

But remember , the cost of borrowing ( 9.9 per cent for a personal loan/up to 4.6 per cent for a mortgage top-up with BofI ) will negate the value of the scheme . <p> Will home renovations increase my property tax ? No . The valuation you already gave for your home will stay the same until 2016 no matter what improvements you make to it . Thereafter , however , you will have to apply a new valuation to your property and if your house has increased in value , it might kick in then . <p> Can I use any contractor ?

" Especially when that husband and father is a well-respected , loved religious minister , husband and father , " she says . <p> Hinton 's young daughter discovered her father looking at online pornography 15 years ago , but mother and daughter believed his excuse that he was " researching porn for a sermon " .

" <p> Hinton also raises an almost unspeakable dimension that is rarely acknowledged : her own feelings of guilt . " I believe his life of molesting children began with his addiction to porn when he was a young teenager . He confessed to the authorities that the first time he molested a child was at the age of 14 , " she says . <p> " In looking back , I have wished a million times that I had done more , asked more , searched more , found out more .

The viewing of images or videos is facilitated by message boards , often hidden in the " dark web " , on which online child sex abusers post images . <p> Another form is online grooming of children . " In many circumstances , grooming online is faster and anonymous and results in children trusting an online ' friend ' more quickly than someone they had just met face to face , " according to a UK organisation , Parents Protect . <p> " People intent on sexually harming children can easily access information about them and they are able to hide their true identity , age and gender .

Hundreds of thousands of poor children in developing countries are induced by promises of payment to appear online , interacting remotely with abusers who order the child what to do , or what is to be done to the child .

@@645238 <h> JOE 's review of the 28.94 per cent of the Premier League season gone so far , Part Two <h> While we covered the bottom part of the table yesterday , today we are concentrating on those sides in and around mid-table . From Spurs in seventh to the Swans in 13th position . <h> 7th Spurs <p> Reasons to be cheerful : Let 's not lose sight of the fact that although they sold their star player and brought in a number of new faces , Spurs lie in seventh position , only five points off top spot . Their only away defeat has been a single goal loss to Arsenal and they have been incredibly difficult to break down , conceding just six goals -- three of those to West Ham in their worst performance of the season -- and only Southampton have a tighter defence . <p> Reasons to be fearful : Only the Saints have conceded fewer , but only the bottom two Crystal Palace and Sunderland have scored less than AVB 's men . The home supporters are not happy with their shortcomings in front of goals , added to the fact they have been beaten twice at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Unless they get their scoring boots on soon , their Champions League challenge could falter . <p> The star so far : Probably a toss-up between Hugo Lloris and Paulninho and considering how water-tight the defence has been we 'll give it to the French shot-stopper . The term ' sweeper-keeper ' has been coined thanks to his own high line , but his marshalling of the defence and authority in the area has led many to suggest he is the in-form keeper in the Premier League . And he 's a hard ba**ard too . <p> Flop : We 'll have to go with AVB on this one . Yes there has been a big turnover at White Hart Lane , but at times Spurs look as dull as dishwater , and the way he conducts himself does n't endear him to fans , not even his own . Criticising the home crowd might not have been his greatest ever idea . His comments after Lloris ' concussion were baffling and after spending so much money in the summer , the former Chelsea man still has a lot to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far : While concussion is not a laughing matter , Lloris ' defiance about going off while Brad Friedel was ready to take to the field at Goodison Park was certainly amusing . Of course the goalkeeper should never have been allowed return , and while his courage was admirable , the look of bemusement on Friedel 's face said it all . <h> 8th Manchester City <p> Reasons to be cheerful : Despite losing more than a third of their games so far , they are just two points outside the top four and primed for the knock-out stages of the Champions League . They have serious attacking weaponry and once the defence starts tightening up away from home , they will be confident of rising up the table . <p> Reasons to be fearful : That away form is simply diabolical . Aside from a point at Stoke , they have lost every other game and some of those teams are n't exactly world beaters , no offence to supporters of Cardiff , Aston Villa , West Ham and Sunderland . The defence is looking incredibly vulnerable on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if City are to claim a second Premier League title . <p> The star so far : Without a doubt Sergio Aguero . Eight goals in nine games in the Premier League and when you add in assists , no one has contributed more that the Argentinian this season . A class act , and if he remains fully fit for the season , he could well carry the hopes of a team plagued by inconsistency . <p> Flop : We 'll let Joe Hart of the hook here -- the poor fella needs a break -- and while he been culpable on a number of occasions this season and lost his place to a Romanian monster , it is most likely a form issue . Martin Demichelis on the other hand is a different story . The 32-year-old has looked all-at-sea in City colours , struggling to adapt to the intensity and pace of the Premier League , the most recent game at Sunderland a prime example . Joleon Lescott ca n't be that bad can he ? <p> Most hilarious moment of the season so far : Unfortunately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entertainment , if only for opposition fans . His succession of clangers has cost him his City spot for now , though his England position is still probably safe . Will be chomping at the bit to rectify his difficult start <h> 9th Newcastle <p> Reasons to be cheerful : Considering all the doom and gloom at the start of the season , most Magpie supporters will be more than happy to be sitting just above mid-table . Mixing the truly inept ( 4-0 defeat to City , awful first half at Everton ) with the unexpected ( wins over Chelsea and away to Spurs ) , it is never a dull moment on Tyneside . <p> Reasons to be fearful : When they are bad , they are truly wretched . The opening 45 minutes away to Everton is as bad a half as you are likely to see , while Hull also left the North-East with all three points . Inconsistency has always been an issue at St. James ' Park and this season looks like being no different . <p> The star so far : Loic Remy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world do n't they ? Well , that 's the guff we are generally told , but in Remy they look to have a saviour with Papiss Cisse currently forgetting how the game of football works . A great bit of business by Joe Kinnear . A line we are unlikely to ever utter again . <p> Flop : Maybe a little harsh considering his blistering form at the start of the season , but Hatem Ben Arfa 's form has dipped and watched successive wins over Chelsea and Spurs as an unused substitute . Maybe the kick up the backside is what the Frenchman needs to get his campaign back on track . <p> Most hilarious moment of the season so far : Moussa Sissoko 's headed clearance against Chelsea without looking at the ball will take some beating . For those that have n't seen it , or fancy another look , here you go . <h> 10th West Brom <p> Reasons to be cheerful : Mid-table can never be a bad thing for the Baggies and they have been models of consistency with five draws in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and conceded . A sign of their season is that they were aggrieved , and rightly so , to have left Stamford Bridge with just a point last time out . A great turn around after going the first four games without a win . <p> Reasons to be fearful : The void left by Romelu Lukau has been a difficult one for Steve Clarke and without him , they lack the same threat up front . Goals could be at a premium , though from an Irish perspective we would hope Shane Long gets more chances to impress . <p> The star so far : Claudio Yacob . Along with Mulumbu , the Argentine midfielder has formed a solid midfield partnership for the Baggies and has been an integral part of the team 's success under Steve Clarke . Goes about his business in a tidy fashion but a valuable player at the Hawthorns . <p> Flop : Nicolas Anelka . While the striker was a popular choice among Fantasy Players out there , his impact is n't what the home fans would have hoped . He has yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and references to Lukau 's brilliant season last time out probably do n't help . Sorry Nic . <p> Most hilarious moment of the season so far : We 're not sure what the Baggies made of Paolo Di Canio knocking around the Hawthorns after the 3-0 over Sunderland , but we found it bizarre and entertaining . The Sunderland supporters did n't find it quite so amusing and soon the Italian was given his marching orders . <h> 11th Aston Villa <p> Reasons to be cheerful : After the season they had last time out , Paul Lambert will be satisfied with 11th place . It has n't been pretty at times , in fact it has been almost harrowing to watch some of the action from Villa Park , but minus the services of Christian Benteke for a period of time , they have more than held their own . And they have learned how to score again . <p> Reasons to be fearful : It 's an obvious point , but they are over reliant on Benteke in front of goals . After missing some action @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Leandro Bacuna 's brilliant free-kick against Cardiff was Villa 's first in seven-and-a-half hours . Could do better is an understatement . <p> The star so far : Brad Guzan . While we are naturally disappointed to see that Shay Given is accustomed to life on the bench , it is hard to argue with Lambert 's choice of number one . He has been impeccable again this season , and more than anyone has helped Villa reach the safety of mid-table . <p> Flop : Nicklas Helenius. ? 2 million is a lot for Villa these days , and it is hard to see what the Danish striker offers the club at this early stage , besides serious height at 6ft 5in . Could follow in the footsteps of fellow countryman Nicklas Bendtner . <p> Most hilarious moment of the season so far : It 's that man Helenius after he was caught with his pants down by Spurs defender Jan Vertonghen during the Carling Cup tie . It was n't the Premier League , but there has n't been too many funny moments to choose from at Villa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be cheerful : Hull fans will be getting nosebleeds from the dizzying heights of 12th place . Most ( we 'll include ourselves here ) saw this being a long season of toil for Steve Bruce and his men and while Bruce can be painful to listen to as he blames officials for everything that goes against them , they have been impressive . Undefeated at home and an unlikely win away at Newcastle has seen them edge away from the relegation zone . <p> Reasons to be fearful : Aside from that game at St. James ' Park , they have struggled on their travels to score , never mind pick up points . And the home fixtures have been kind so far , so bigger challenges lie in store . <p> The star so far : Has to be our very own Robbie Brady . Has already scored three goals ( his two penalties proving to be match-winners ) and is a real danger with possession , illustrated by the fact the ball is given to him by his team-mates at every opportunity . <p> Flop : Danny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goal . Nine games this season in the league without a goal , and 11 games with Sunderland last year without hitting the onion sack , there is a pattern emerging here . <p> Most hilarious moment of the season so far : Leaving aside Bruce 's costly complaint over match officials - " I 'm not going to start criticising match officials , but ... " which set him back ? 10,000 , the issue over the club name has been an embarassment for most associated with the club , aside from the owner Assem Allam it seems . Hull City Tigers quite frankly sounds as ridiculous as the manager 's rants , but Allam is convinced it will help the club make an impact ' globally ' . And not as a laughing stock . <h> 13th Swansea City <p> Reasons to be cheerful : At times Swansea have looked like the great passing , entertaining side we have come to expect and the big victory away at an admittedly under-strength Valencia seemed to confirm as much . Michael Laudrup would have felt a big cash outlay in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( check ) would drive the club onto challenging for a European spot . Yet to put a run together , but look to be oh-so-close to doing so . <p> Reasons to be fearful : With just four wins in their last 20 games , Swansea fans have every right to be a little apprehensive . They are conceding late goals , their expensive signings are taking time to bed in and the Welsh derby defeat will be a sore point . Laudrup has cut a frustrated figure on the sideline and their home form needs addressing , with just one win at the Liberty so far . <p> The star so far : Wilfried Bony . The striker set the club back a fair few bob , or ? 12 million to be more precise , but he has shown at times why he was such a coveted player during the summer . He opened his account against Man Utd and after 10 goals in all competitions , looks like he is settling into his role in the team . A strong presence up front for the Swans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spanish signings and Jordi Amat cost the Swans ? 2.5 million this summer . He has n't played a great deal ( just three games in the Premier League ) , but from what he have seen , could take a while to find his feet . <p> Most hilarious moment of the season so far : Jonjo Shelvey 's performance against Liverpool was something else . He scored a belter and then set up his former side with a gift all within the opening three minutes . He then set up a Liverpool second goal , before assisting for Swansea 's equaliser . All-action.

@@645240 <h> Opinion : It is through gangland culture that many men find a status otherwise denied to them <p> The ending was flat and confusing on Sunday night , some of the storyline seemed undeveloped and there was a sense nobody knew where the series was going . But Love/Hate was magnificently written , shot , directed , produced , edited and acted , for which Stuart Carolan , David Caffrey , Dermot Diskin , Tom Vaughan-Lawlor , Peter Coonan , Charlie Murphy , Aoibhinn McGinnity and Killian Scott and all others involved deserve great credit . RT ? , the impecunious station that commissioned the series and paid spectacularly for it , also deserves credit , albeit with some reservations , mainly to do with the politics of Love/Hate and the politics of RT ? and of much of the media in reporting , commenting and portraying criminality . <p> ' Scumbags'The series underscored the sense that criminality , in the main , is associated with an assortment of " scumbags " ( in the airhead lingo of some crime journalism ) , " scumbags " emerging from communities that have no care for the welfare of children , for education , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At times , it is conceded , these " scumbags " may be charming , even charismatic , but they embody a violent gene , bringing fear not just to their victims but also to society in general and in particular to the societies in which they operate . It is implied that they deserve to spend their lives behind bars , irrespective of the niceties of the legal system . <p> There is hardly any reflection in RT ? , TV3 or elsewhere in the media that the kind of criminality depicted in Love/Hate derives in large part from the dysfunctional society we have allowed to evolve , where there are deep inequalities not just of income , wealth , power , influence , health , education and longevity but of respect and self-worth . <p> In Understanding Limerick : Social Exclusion and Change by Niamh Hourigan , she writes of men who get caught up in criminality : " Economically excluded , culturally stigmatised and insecure in their position as fathers and partners , these men have no legitimate source of pride or esteem available to them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admired and respected , is the same as everyone else 's . As results they have created a different system of status . This status is linked to being a ' hard man ' who embodies toughness and capacity for violence , as a figure who then elicits fear in his more vulnerable neighbours . " <p> Niamh Hourigan goes on to quote the sociologist Richard Sennett as claiming how lack of respect is one of the most significant " hidden injuries of class " . <p> Gangland culture is founded on both fear and status . It is through the gangs that many men find status and respect otherwise denied to them by society and it is a combination of fear and a desire for status that draws teenagers and young men to gangs and criminality . <p> Niamh Hourigan writes : " For a child who is growing up in an area where the ' disadvantaged of the disadvantaged ' are clustered , the likelihood of embracing the fear-based respect model is much greater . Evidence of the ' hard man ' culture will be visible daily on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of young children " . <p> If all that income and wealth inequality were confined to the arenas of income and wealth it might be tolerable , but , insidiously , income and wealth inequality seep into all other areas of life and society . Those with income and wealth can use that to gain power and influence ; they can corral preferential health and educational resources ; they can more readily avail of career opportunities through networks and elite training ; and they have access to the courts denied to others without the means of affording access . Most of all they can gain power over others and , in doing so , earn status and respect , in the process denying others status and respect . <p> The injury of inequality is brilliantly portrayed in the seminal work The Spirit Level : Why Equality is Better for Everyone by Richard Wilkinson and Kate Pickett . They show child wellbeing is better in more equal societies ; there is less hard drug abuse in more equal societies ; children do better academically ; there are fewer teenage pregnancies ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , individualism and consumerism . <p> Inequality of respectThe focus on poverty misses the point : it is inequality that matters for , crucially , inequality extends to respect , and inequality of respect is corrosive , lethally so . <p> There is a further point that emerges from Love/Hate : the " war " on drugs . This " war " has done far more damage than the drugs themselves , although of course the drugs too have done terrible harm . <p> More lives have been devastated by the criminalisation of hard drugs than by the drugs themselves . We could at least have greatly minimised the harm caused both by drugs and the " war " on drugs by ending the " war " and treating the harm of drugs , through health care and , more significantly , through more equality . <p> But it wo n't happen .

@@653230 <h> Desire for new party up - all eyes on Lucinda Creighton <h> Opposition has failed to capitalise on Government 's difficulties -- poll <p> SUPPORT for the formation of a new political party has increased significantly in the last three months , with almost half of the electorate ( 46 per cent ) now in favour -- a six-point rise since August , according to the latest Sunday Independent/Millward Brown opinion poll . <p> Enthusiasm is particularly strong among supporters of the Opposition -- Sinn Fein , Fianna Fail and independents -- while supporters of the Government parties , Fine Gael and Labour , are largely lukewarm at the prospect . <p> The nationwide poll also shows the country to be somewhat polarised on the issue . <p> Young and middle-aged voters outside Dublin are noticeably more in favour , while there is higher opposition among older and better-off voters in the capital . <p> Until now , voter support for a new party seemed to have been waning since a high point in December 2012 ( 50 per cent ) to last March ( 46 per cent ) to August ( 40 per cent ) . <p> However , the formation in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fine Gael TDs and senators , grouped around Lucinda Creighton , may account , in part , for renewed support for the formation of a new party . <p> In other findings , support for the Government parties is unchanged since last month despite controversies related to the Budget , the Seanad referendum defeat and the property tax furore . <p> The poll also reveals that the Opposition , by and large , has failed to capitalise . <p> However , the number of voters who fail to express support for any of the current parties , the ' do n't knows ' , has again increased to more than one-third ( 36 per cent ) -- a consistent pattern that will be closely monitored by those waiting or plotting in the wings to establish a new party . <p> In an analysis of the poll in the Sunday Independent today , former Progressive Democrats leader Michael McDowell addresses the need for such new party to have a broad appeal for voters . <p> In an unstated reference to Reform Alliance , Mr McDowell writes : " Not all ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favour of a centre or centre-right party . " <p> He adds : " I find that labels like ' right ' or ' centre right ' or ' left ' are not very helpful . " <p> Mr McDowell , who in the public mind is closely associated with the Reform Alliance , also gives a broad hint that the " important time-frame for a new party " is the next general election , not the local and European elections next year . <p> He identifies issues which he believes will " matter " to supporters of a new party : " whether you support enterprise and a looser confederal EU , rather than an EU federal super state " ; " whether a party allows freedom of conscience on matters of personal morality and whether your view of Irishness is inclusive of all the traditions and communities on this island . " <p> He adds : " How you stand on reformism and conservatism is important . How you handle moral , social and cultural diversity matters to me . How you care for the weaker and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reasonable balance between economy and environment matters . How parliament and government interact is hugely important . <p> " In reality , " he writes " is there any ' left-right ' connection between issues such as abortion and taxation or EU integration ? I think not . " <p> Notwithstanding Mr McDowell 's analysis , today 's opinion poll clearly illustrates some of the potential difficulties faced by the Reform Alliance if it is to attract what Mr McDowell says is the necessary 20 per cent of voters to have a chance of winning 25 to 35 seats in the next election . <p> The poll shows support for a new party is higher among Sinn Fein supporters ( 59 per cent ) , independent supporters ( 59 per cent ) and Fianna Fail supporters ( 53 per cent ) , as well as in Munster ( 53 per cent ) , among age groups 18-24 ( 51 per cent ) and 45-54 ( 52 per cent ) and the less well-off social group DE ( 50 per cent ) . <p> Opposition to the formation of a new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) and Labour supporters ( 60 per cent ) , aged 55-64 ( 39 per cent ) and over-65s ( 40 per cent ) , as well as the well-off AB social group ( 41 per cent ) . <p> The poll also shows current support levels for Fianna Fail , Sinn Fein and independents are somewhat ' soft ' . <p> According to Paul Moran , associate director of Millward Brown : " That the appetite for a change of the status quo is so much higher among supporters of the opposition parties is somewhat curious . It suggests there is a soft underbelly to their support -- while they are dissatisfied with the current administration , they seemingly have doubts about their chosen alternatives . " <p> He adds : " In light of the announcement that we are exiting the bailout and going it alone , it would appear that for the Opposition parties , and Fianna Fail in particular , any upturn in the economy will be a double-edged sword . " <p> Dissatisfaction with the Government remains consistently high : 74 per cent said they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 19 per cent were satisfied ( down two ) and 7 per cent did not know ( up a point ) . <p> Satisfaction with the party leaders also showed shifts in a month .

" <p> In the wake of an equally difficult meeting with the Fine Gael party , Mr Rabbitte is also facing a major Fine Gael backbench revolt on the issue . <p> Fine Gael TD John Paul Phelan told the Sunday Independent " these pylons are like a political bushfire , the issue has now spread across 19 counties " . <p> Kildare TD Martin Heydon also warned that people had legitimate concerns .

" <p> The Dail communications committee can not veto the appointment of Mr O'Connor , but one source noted that " if the committee found the person unsuitable for appointment it would be deeply politically embarrassing ; Pat Rabbitte would certainly have to publicly account for and reconsider the position . " <p> Irish Farmers ' Association deputy president Eddie Downey has attacked the dismissive attitude of Eirgrid to what he called " the legitimate and genuine concerns and fears of local communities and farmers " . <p> " All the indications are that this issue will dominate next year 's local elections .

Put them together and you get . . . well , we 're about to find out . <p> In what rates as one of rock 's more far-fetched hook-ups , jazz-soul singer Norah Jones and Billie Joe Armstrong of ageing emo crew Green Day have recorded a suite of duets wherein they wrap their collective tonsils around the great American songbook . <p> Inspired by an iconic covers LP made by the Everly Brothers in the 1950s , Foreverly ( baddum-tish ) sees the pair offering heartfelt homage to such dusky anthems as ' Long Time Gone ' and ' Roving Gambler ' . Think of it as their Rattle and Hum , with less cowboy hats and braying histrionics . <p> Surprisingly , Armstrong is the project 's driving force .

At the apex of his Thin White Duke phase , Bowie stood unchallenged as the hippest rock star on the planet . Seventy-four-year- old Crosby , meanwhile , had passed into his dotage and , before he and Bowie met , admitted to friends he 'd never heard of the Englishman ( Bowie was initially dead set against the song and required cajoling by his manager ) . <p> Nearly 40 years on , it is hard to say whether ' Drummer Boy ' qualifies as charming oddity or fascinating disaster .

But his recent work has not been kindly received by the critics , the general consensus being that films like ' The Dictator ' and ' Bruno ' lack the wit and brilliance of his early creations . <p> Ali G certainly was brilliant . With his ghastly tracksuits , blinging jewellery , silly hats and pinheaded observations , Alistair Leslie Graham ( to give him his full name ) seemed to embody everything that was awful about contemporary British culture . His interviews used his own foolishness to test the patience of politicians and celebrities to hilarious effect . <p> He once mistook the late author Gore Vidal for hairdresser Vidal Sassoon , asked the venerable political philosopher Noam Chomsky to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Donald Trump so much that the property magnate stormed out in a huff a minute into their interview . In my favourite Ali G interview of all , then-mayor of Belfast Sammy Wilson was asked if he was Irish . When the DUP politician answered sternly , " No , I 'm British " , a perplexed Ali G replied : " So , is you here on holiday ? " <p> The new Ali G is unlikely to have mellowed . When Cohen briefly appeared as Ali to pick up a gong at last year 's British Comedy Awards , he caused visible unease by making lewd jokes about Kate Middleton and Jimmy Savile . <p> Amazon yesterday entered the ever-changing world of television with its first original TV show , ' Alpha House ' .

Amazon must be pretty confident , because ' Alpha House ' costs up to $2m an episode to make . <p> The show is written by Gary Trudeau , creator of the long-running ' Doonesbury ' newspaper cartoon strip , and is set in a Washington DC house that serves as a crash pad for four very different Republican politicians . John Goodman 's character , Gil John Biggs , is a former college baseball coach and now a North Carolina senator who struggles with the nuances of Washington and is prone to embarrassing gaffes . <p> The show takes potshots at the Tea Party hardliners and rather predictably lampoons Republicans rather than Democrats , but Amazon is hoping ' Alpha House ' will establish it as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Netflix . <p> The difference with Netflix , however , is that television is its core business .

And while the success of its original drama , ' House of Cards ' , at this year 's Emmys gained a lot of attention , comic drama ' Orange is the New Black ' has proved an even bigger hit . It stars Taylor Schilling as an accidental drug mule serving 15 months in a women 's prison , and has been renewed for a second series which will be streamed on Netflix next year . <p> Further new dramas are planned and Netflix is constantly expanding its repertoire .

Remember ' Jon and Kate Plus 8 ' ? Back in 2008 , the show became a huge overnight hit on the TLC channel and turned its unlikely protagonists into stars . <p> Probably the only interesting thing about Jon and Kate Gosselin was their combined gift for procreating in ever-increasing multiples . They had twins in 2000 and sextuplets in 2004 , and in 2007 were chosen by the Discovery Health Channel for a series of one-hour investigative specials . <p> They quickly led to a plodding but very effective reality show called ' Jon and Kate Plus 8 ' , which really took off when it moved to TLC in 2008 . The show itself was fairly anodyne and taught me more than I will ever need to know about toilet-training an infant . But it was the apparent disconnect between the happy family portrayed on-screen and the reality of the Gosselins ' life that most fascinated a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably America 's second-most famous family after the Obamas , but not always for the right reasons . Tatty celebrity magazines published lurid claims that Jon was playing away and Kate was a fame-obsessed harpy . <p> Pennsylvania authorities launched an investigation into possible child exploitation during the series -- the paparazzi snapped photos of Kate apparently smacking one of her eight little darlings . Then came an even more damaging YouTube video of her refusing to share water with her thirsty chicks . <p> The show staggered on for a couple of seasons after Jon and Kate divorced in 2009 , but was canned in 2011 . And where are they now ? <p> Kate is battling furiously to stay in the public eye , and has published a couple of books , but her ex-husband has not fared as well . He currently waits tables at a smalltown restaurant , and in a recent interview bemoaned his fate and the negative effects the show had had on his children .

In August 2008 , a total of eleven climbers out of twenty-four had died , including Irishman Ger McDonnell . <p> Director Nick Ryan spoke to us about the complexities of filming on location with people were there during the events and the realities of what happened . <p> The film 's use of re-enactments is quite different to most documentaries about mountaineering , primarily because it 's difficult to recreate the conditions and the locations . What made you decide to do this ? <p> The primary decision was based on the desire to portray the complex narrative in a compelling and engaging manner . Even before we saw what footage was shot on the mountain during the 2008 expedition , we knew that there would be holes in the story , as when things started to go wrong , the climbers would inevitably be busy trying to survive and not so interested in documenting that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ footage of some of the climbers falling , we were uncomfortable with showing that , feeling it too voyeuristic and ghoulish . <p> In shooting the re-enactments , veracity was key , and they were based entirely on the testimonies of the survivors and were supervised on location in Switzerland by Pemba Gyalje Sherpa and three other Sherpa ( Chhiring Dorje Sherpa , Pasang Lama and Tsering Lama ) who climbed that day in 2008 to ensure technical accuracy . This was emotionally difficult for all of those climbers but was always part of how we felt this would be made . <p> As well as this , mixing it with actual footage gives it a real sense of credibility , was that important for you or did you feel you could make the documentary without it ? <p> You could of course have made the film without the re-enactments , however it would be very different . Our hope was to engage the audience in an experiential manner , to put them in the boots of the climbers . It was never our intention to trick the audience into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are far more cinematic than the actual archive footage . The archive was truly incredible , breathtaking at times , and we were always envious of how they could just point the camera anywhere and it looked amazing . We had to work very hard to achieve anything close to that , although having said that , the climbers in 2008 worked infinitely harder to get the footage they shot on the mountain . <p> The film really does read and feel , in places , like a horror movie . Was this intentional ? <p> The film does play like a horror film because the events in 2008 were truly horrific and sometimes worse than we could imagine . In hearing the stories for the first time from the individual survivors we saw this correlation in that the mountain seemed to be taking lives one by one over the duration of 48 hours . It was incredibly intense . <p> Given that the film is told in flashback and from different viewpoints , did that make for a more difficult experience for you in terms of editing and putting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps , discount some of their stories as too unbelievable or coloured by their experience ? <p> The structure of the film was derived at from the need to be able to show the audience what happened in 2008 and then put the causes that led to tragedy into context . If this story was told in a completely linear manner then it would be 40 minutes before anything would happen , and we would be watching climbers discussing seemingly irrelevant issues . The editing was lengthy and very considered and editor Ben Stark was an incredible and inspirational source along with Mark Monroe ( who wrote the film ) in the process . <p> We never discounted stories as thematically the film is about stories . Memories were absolutely affected by the extreme altitude and debilitating effects of the Death Zone ( that area above 7500m where the body is slowly dying , cell by cell ) . We chose to allow the climbers to tell their stories and let the audiences make their own minds up on what they hear . <p> Was your intention to make people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> We never set out to be judgmental about the actions and risks they took and will continue to take . If audiences take home the opinion that they will never climb a mountain like K2 that is fine , and equally if they feel the desire to head to Pakistan and embrace the challenge then great . Hopefully the film will serve as a reminder to the dangers and risks climbers are exposed to , but also the great joy and excitement that it brings . <p> Did you find yourself exasperated by the climbers actions and motivations ? It seems , at times , that they 're wilfully putting themselves in danger , knowing that the conditions are getting progressively worse and so on . <p> If you were to look at it slightly differently , and we were to ask you this question : If you had spent 67 days establishing camps and acclimatizing to the altitude and you find yourself on a perfect day , with no wind or clouds , six hours from the summit ... would you turn back ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @

@@2010232 <h> Smithwick Tribunal - Defining Collusion <p> That 's the first issue that has to be decided upon before any ruling can be made as to whether collusion actually took place . It may sound simple and straightforward - but it is n't . <p> There have been several definitions of collusion in several probes into several murders during the Troubles . <p> The version adopted by Judge Peter Smithwick is quite wide in its scope , allowing findings of collusion where other investigations would have found no collusion although the facts would be the same . <p> He decided that collusion could be established if there was action - or inaction - by an individual or police . <p> Everyone accepts the basic minimum of collusion - that someone working for the State , or a State body itself actively participated in the killing of a person . But it 's in areas like " turning a blind eye " or omissions that there is divergence . <p> The first working definition was drawn up by Sir John Stevens who was investigating claims of State collusion with loyalists in several murders . <p> In his view collusion ... " is evidenced in many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ records , the absence of accountability , the withholding of intelligence and evidence , through to the extreme of agents being involved in murder . " <p> Retired Canadian Judge , Peter Cory , who also investigated several controversial killings said collision should be defined " reasonably broadly " to ensure public confidence in the body being probed : " Because of the necessity for public confidence in the army and police , the definition of collusion must be reasonably broad when it is applied to actions of these agencies . <p> " This is to say that army and police forces must not act collusively by ignoring or turning a blind eye to the wrongful acts of their servants or agents or supplying information to assist them in their wrongful acts or encouraging them to commit wrongful acts . <p> " Any lesser definition would have the effect of condoning , or even encouraging , state involvement in crimes , thereby shattering all public confidence in these important agencies . " <p> The same definition was used by the first Northern Ireland Police Ombudsman , Nuala O'Loan , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was State collusion in the murder of Raymond McCord Jnr for example . <p> However , her successor Al Hutchinson , a former Canadian policeman , adopted a very different view of what constitutes collusion . <p> In his February , 2011 report into the bomb attack on McGurk 's Bar in Belfast , he said the term collusion was ill-defined and decided that there was no evidence of State collusion in the attack which killed 15 people . <p> His view of collusion is that it .... " requires that a number of elements be present . Usually , but not always , it involves an agreement between two or more parties . <p> " There is an additional requirement that a sufficiency of evidence exists to establish , on balance , that the act or omission complained of was deliberate and not merely negligent or inadvertent . " <p> The last part of that definition is particularly worthy of note . <p> The key word is " deliberate " . <p> This definition is significantly different from the definition used by Judge Smithwick in the Smithwick Tribunal . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ view of what would constitute collusion in his investigation . <p> " The issue of collusion will be examined in the broadest sense of the word . While it generally means the commission of an act , I am of the view that it should also be considered in terms of an omission or failure to act . <p> " In the active sense , collusion has amongst its meanings to conspire , connive or collaborate . <p> " In addition , I intend to examine whether anybody deliberately ignored a matter , or turned a blind eye to it , or to have pretended ignorance or unawareness of something one ought morally , legally or officially to oppose . " <p> In essence , his view is that collusion can be established by action or inaction of an individual or body .
