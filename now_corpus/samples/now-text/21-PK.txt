@@32811231 <h> India-Pakistan : The pros and cons of backchannel diplomacy <p> The Indian and Pakistan flags fly during a ceremony at the Wagah Border . Photo : AFP <p> The door of peace between Pakistan and India leads through backchannel negotiations and both countries have successfully used it to bring about substantial confidence-building measures . <p> For any backchannel negotiation to have sustainable long-term impact , however , it has to be used sparingly and with the mission of initiating a bilateral dialogue or it can threaten the entire fabric of the peace process . <p> According to media reports , Pakistan and India have been conducting these backchannel t ? alks on and off since 2017 , whereby New Delhi initiated a request to start a backchannel and Pakistan responded positively . <p> Backchannel negotiations , however , are not unique to South Asia , . Countries all around the world conduct such talks to provide breathing space for states/parties to negotiate outside of public scrutiny . <p> There are numerous other examples of such negotiation being used across conflict zones to bring peace . Some of the more famous examples of backchannel negotiations include the Israeli-Palestinian peace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from 1979 to 1980 . <p> Backchannel negotiations even played a huge role in eventually ending the apartheid era , as the Ministry of Justice of South Africa negotiated with the imprisoned Nelson Mandela . <p> Countries in the global north have also resorted to backchannels to resolve internal or external disputes . One such backchannel was extensively used for 20 years between the government of the United Kingdom and the Irish Republican Army during the era of great violence in Ireland . The negotiations eventually led to the Good Friday agreement securing peace for the British Isles . <p> These secretive talks are not unchartered territory for South Asia either . In fact , Pakistan and India have been involved in backchannel negotiations in the past themselves . It was due to the extensive and successful backchannel negotiations that the historic 1999 visit of Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee was made possible . <p> The two South Asian neighbors built numerous confidence building measures through a combination of backchannel negotiations and direct bilateral talk during the General Musharraf era too . <p> Despite the failure of previous negotiations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ today especially as the backchannel negotiations have already resulted in a substantial border relief to both countries . <p> Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan and Chief of Army Staff General Bajwa hinted at the Islamabad Security Dialogue that Pakistan is engaging or wants to engage with India in good faith and for the greater good of the subcontinent . This statement was followed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi wishing Pakistan on its republic day . <p> Moreover , Pakistan has also offered assistance to India by providing it essential medical supplies as the Indian state is in the grip of a third wave of Covid-19 and critical hospital needs like medical oxygen are in shortage . <p> These initiatives of peace and solidarity are proof that the negotiating process has resulted in building confidence that both countries can engage with each other in good faith . <p> For now , the official position of the Pakistani state is that while the country wants to engage in peace talks , it is based on certain conditions like restoring the statehood of the Jammu and Kashmir region . On the other hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regarding Kashmir will not be reversed bringing both countries to a stalemate . <p> Within that context , it is understandable why backchannel negotiations are preferred as they avoid public scrutiny and are n't based on conditions , which allows states not to take hardline positions or adopt counterproductive tactics . <p> The Indian Prime Minister 's foreign policy and election rhetoric have always endorsed a hostile and masculine approach to Pakistan . However , both countries have an incentive to engage in peace talks to improve their human and economic resources . <p> A secret backchannel peace process allows the Indian leadership to engage Pakistan without upsetting its conservative vote base . On the other hand , the backchannel peace talks allow Pakistan to have peace on its borders so it can concentrate on its new geoeconomics approach . <p> But in the end , it is incredibly important for these backchannel peace talks to be used sparingly . For any negotiation to bear results , it needs to be made in public so that the negotiated peace process can be implemented . <p> The Israel Palestinian conflict is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often opened the door for talks but a strong reliance on them meant that no open dialogue producing substantial results could be enforced . <p> Countries need to be cognizant of the fact that backchannel talks are only supposed to build a foundational ground .

@@52378235 <h> Senate strategy <h> Opinion <p> Since the formation of the political alliance called the PDM by the opposition , which unites most opposition parties under its banner -- except the Jamaat-e-Islami and the Sindhi nationalists -- there is talk that the alliance has been formed to stop the PTI from gaining majority in the Senate . <p> It seems that most analysts and columnists who are writing on the issue have not done proper homework , though . Here I will try to present some facts and figures to prove that the ruling party will not gain majority in the upper house of parliament in the face of a joint strategy by the opposition to contest elections collectively . <p> The Senate is made of 23 members from each of the four provinces , regardless of population ; four from the federal capital , for which the National Assembly is the Electoral College and eight members from Fata for whom Fata MNAs vote . However , with the merger of Fata no elections will be held on these four seats , which will be vacated by the retirement of the Fata senators . <p> Out of the 23 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seats are categorized as general seats while four each are reserved for women and technocrats ( including Ulema ) while one is for minorities . At present , the Senate has 102 members . 23 each from Sindh and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa , 22 each from Punjab and Balochistan , four from the federal capital and eight from Fata ( this is as per the official website of the Senate of Pakistan ) . <p> According to the Senate website , at the moment 15 senators belong to the PML-N , 19 to the PPP , 15 to the PTI , five to the MQM , four each are from the JUI-F and NP , three each from BAP and PkMAP , two from the JI , while the PML-F , ANP and BNP-M have one senator each . According to the website , 29 senators are independents out of which the majority belongs to the PML-N , whose symbols were withdrawn due to a court decision . The PML-N 's 15 , PPP and PTI 's seven , Independents six ( which include four from former Fata ) , MQM @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and NP 's two each , and the JI and BNP-M one each are among the senators who will be retiring on the 11th of March after completing six years . <p> Elections for at least 48 seats for the Senate will be held between February 11 and March 2021 . In Punjab , the PTI has 181 members so it can easily win 6-7 seats out of the 11 while 4-5 may go to the PMLN with the help of seven MPAs of the PPP and four independents . <p> In Sindh , the PPP with 96 MPAs will attempt to win 8-9 out of 11 Senate seats due to its experience in this regard and possible conflict in the opposition ranks . But if the opposition in Sindh ( PTI , MQM , GDA ) field joint candidates they can restrict the PPP to 6-7 seats . In KP , the ruling PTI has a commanding majority , therefore it can win 8-9 seats while the opposition can win two seats jointly . In Balochistan , BAP may get 4-5 seats , the PTI one and the rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because in Balochistan the ANP is in the ruling coalition . Two seats of the federal capital will be won by the PTI , but there is a hidden fear of defection amid secret ballots in the ruling party ; if its fears prove correct , it may lose both federal seats . <p> The PTI will emerge as the single largest party in the Senate , with 30-32 senators , while its allied parties may bag eight seats . With four Fata independent senators and two independents from Balochistan , the total number of senators from the treasury benches would be 46 , while the rest may go with the opposition parties . <p> The above situation is possible if the opposition parties contest Senate elections jointly by supporting each other . For example , the PPP must support the PML-N in Punjab , while both the PPP and the PML-N could support the ANP and JUI-F in KP , and the ANP and PML-N could help the JUI-F and BNP-M in Balochistan . By doing this , they can deprive 2-3 seats to the ruling coalition . Unity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to roll back constitutional steps made through the 18th Amendment , particularly those related to the NFC Award . <p> To a distant spectator like me , the emphasis on resignations from assemblies before the Senate elections seemed to have been to facilitate some behind-the-scenes maneuvering to achieve certain outcomes .

For the grand opposition alliance , the Pakistan Democratic Movement ( PDM ) , that would mean revising their entire strategy behind their plan to topple the government , which explains why most of their spokespersons have gone silent on the matter for the moment .

This was highlighted in southeast Bangladesh , at the town of Cox 's Bazaar , when a fire broke out at the camp , destroying some 500 shacks and leaving at least 2000 Rohingya refugees homeless . The fire is believed to have been started by a gas cylinder used at the camp to cook food .

There were no deaths , but at least 10 refugees were injured . <p> The area houses tens of thousands of refugees in camps , with some having fled the most recent purge of the Rohingya in their native Myanmar under a campaign of ethnic cleansing , and others who fled previously after the military regime in Myanmar , notably in 2017 , targeted the Rohingya community on the basis of their opposition to the regime , and also their religion and ethnicity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hit the group . Many Rohingya had walked for days to reach safety in the first place . They now find that the place where they live is not secure either . The fate of other refugees around the world is very similar . It is up to the world to do more for the Rohingya and other such refugees . The Rohingya , however , are particularly vulnerable -- in the sense that most of them have found shelter in Bangladesh , a country which itself is economically deprived and not in a strong position to support refugees who need not only physical support in the form of shelter and food but also emotional support , given the trauma they and their families have suffered in their native country . In addition to this , they need schooling and healthcare as well as other means to meet basic needs . <p> The fire was put out by Bangladeshi forces who moved into the area and district officials say every effort will be made to make the camp safer .

We have ( almost ) all information in advance . <p> Apart from the platform , the Samsung Galaxy A52 and the Galaxy A52 5G are basically completely identical . The 4G-only model apparently contains the Qualcomm Snapdragon 720G with eight ARM Cortex-A55 cores up to 2.3 GHz , while the 5G model comes with the Snapdragon 750G , which only reaches 2.2 GHz , but just bring an integrated 5G modem . <p> Depending on the model and the respective market , Samsung wants to offer both devices not only in variants with six gigabytes of RAM and 128 GB , but also to introduce variants with a total of eight GB of RAM and 256 GB of flash memory . However , as is so often the case , these are not likely to be available @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the internal memory can easily be expanded using a microSD card . <h> Display with FHD+ <p> The display of the new Galaxy A52 is always 6.5 inches and offers a pleasantly high resolution with 2400 x 1080 pixels . As in the Galaxy A72 , it is a SuperAMOLED panel that is kept completely flat and an optical fingerprint reader is installed under the surface . The panel also houses the front camera behind a small hole on the upper edge , which works here with an impressive 32 megapixels . The A52 probably also has a panel with an increased refresh rate . <p> A newly designed combination of four cameras sits on the back , with the main sensor with 64 megapixels in the center . There is also an 8-megapixel camera , which is very likely an ultra-wide-angle camera . <p> There is also a 5 and a 2-megapixel sensor , although we do n't yet know for sure what purpose these two sensors serve . It would be conceivable that one sensor is used for macro images , while the second additional sensor is used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ models . <p> Both versions of the Galaxy A52 are equipped with a 4500mAh battery , which , in conjunction with the economical Qualcomm SoCs , should ensure very decent runtimes . Power is supplied via a USB Type-C port , with up to 25 watts possible . Wireless charging is missing in both variants . Dual SIM is just as standard here as Bluetooth 5. x and NFC as well as ac-WLAN . The operating system is Android 11 in conjunction with the Samsung One UI . <p> A small surprise with the new Galaxy A models seems to be the fact that the devices are generally certified to IP67 despite the availability of a microSD slot and a headphone connection and should therefore be largely dust and waterproof . When it comes to colours , the customer can choose between black , white , blue and lavender . <p> The pricing is simple : the Galaxy A52 4G costs 349 euros , while the Galaxy A52 5G costs 429 euros . The prices can of course also differ within Europe depending on the country and region . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and industry professional in Digital Marketing , Social Media , Business News , and Technology News , with vast experience in the media industry , I have a keen interest in business technology , News breaking .

Many believe that it was Prophet Mohammad who brought Islam , but this ca n't be further away from what the Quran says . The truth of the matter is that Islam is not a recent , 7th century Arabic religion . It is the same religion that was revealed to all prophets : <p> He has ordained for you all , the same System of Life that He enjoined upon Noah -- And We have revealed to you ( O Prophet ! ) the same message as We enjoined upon Abraham , Moses , and Jesus : " Establish the Divine System of Life and make no sects in it ( do not be divided ) . Quran , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the religion of my fathers , Abraham , Isaac and Jacob . Quran , 12:38 <p> Having established that , it is obvious that Prophets throughout the times referred to God in their own respective languages . Hence , Allah is not a proper noun for the " God of Muslims . " It simply means " The God " in Arabic . Since the Quran is in Arabic , it refers to the Supreme Being as Allah . Similarly , if it was in any other language , it would refer to Him by the equivalent word for God in that language . <p> From a Quranic point of view , one can observe that Allah is not the name of a unique God that Muslims believe in , rather it is an all encompassing term for the Supreme Being regardless of the faith one subscribes to . Christians , Jews , and other religious group are seen as using the word Allah to denote God in the Quran , and never has this been contested in any verse ( 5:17 , 5:18 , 5:72 , 5:73 ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who acknowledge ( this divine book ) ; and those who are Jewish , and the Nazarenes , and the Sabians , whomever of them believes in ALLAH and the Last Day and does acts of reform ; they will have their reward with their Lord , with no fear over them , nor will they grieve . Quran , 2:62 <p> If we are to assume that believing in Allah equates to believing in Islam , then the first phrase of the verse loses purpose . After all , the gist of the verse is that no matter your religion , as long as you believe in God and continually reform yourself , you could expect reward . <p> A similar case is presented in the following verses <p> " And they claim , ' None will enter Paradise unless he is a Jew or a Christian .

" Quran , 17:110 <p> Conclusion <p> Did the members of Pekida never read the Quran for themselves ? This is not something that requires intensive research , as it is blatantly obvious ! So , what kinds of people are representing Islam in Malaysia ?

Natalie Schoon in her book " Islamic Asset Management " considers Time Value of Money as a euphemism for Riba al Naseeyah that is the addition of a premium paid to the lender in return for waiting for their money ( page-206 ) . Another luminary , Zubair Hasan in his masterpiece " Islamic Banking and Finance -- An Integrative Approach " shows that Islam does not allow a Time Value for money but grants Time a value in price . Therefore , Time Value of Money may enter price in the case of deferred payments . He further reveals on page 97 of his book that this is the basis of Cost-plus Sale or Murabahah transactions in Islamic Finance .

Muslim scholars of Islamic Finance are still looming in conundrum situation to solve the quagmire of Time Value of Money and Interest . There are indeed some loopholes in modern Islamic Banking that must be solved by the brains and brawn of Islamic Finance for full conformity with Sharia . <p> The concept of Time Value of Money only arises in the modus operandi of Fractional Reserve Banking due to the command of interest return/rates .

Thomas Greco in his book " Money : Understanding and Creating Alternatives to Legal Tender " has this to say on page 166 ....................... <p> " The principle of the " time value of money " is now an unquestioned axiom of business and economics , &amp; almost everyone supports the pretense that any rational economic man would prefer a sum of money now to the same sum of money later .

Hence , it is concluded that without Interest , there is no Time Value of Money . <p> The writer is post graduate in Community Child health from Khyber Medical University ( KMU ) and currently serves as medical officer at Type-D Hospital , Tehsil Banda Daud Shah , District Karak .

@@52538233 <h> Gutter politics <p> The writer is a retired air vice marshal and a former ambassador . He tweets @shazchy09 and can be contacted at email protected <p> The opposition is 20 seats less than the government in the National Assembly but in a non-transferable single vote manages to get a majority of five over the government nominated candidate for Senate . The government scores 16 votes short in a secret ballot . The vote was preceded by an intense verbal and legal battle between the two sides to hold an open ballot . The opposition spurned government proposals to amend the Constitution for a more transparent process through show of hands and wished to retain the ballot secret as provided under the Constitution . The government prayed before the court to permit an open ballot to ensure the integrity of the vote but was redirected to the Election Commission of Pakistan ( ECP ) . The court avoided being mired in a political dispute . The ECP stayed with the convention to avoid generating another controversy . <p> The government was fairly criticised for sleeping over it all this time and acting altruistic when it found the going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , despite a majority . Why and how did the government come to such pass is another study of Pakistan 's labyrinthine politics , and as interesting because it underwrites a most successful political effort at creating and expanding political space where none or very little had existed before . On the day this piece comes out the opposition may just be crowning its most remarkable reversal of political fortunes by electing its chairman in the Senate . The government will have a lot to introspect in why and how its fortunes have slipped over time . <p> Back to the ugliness though of how the electoral process is circumvented and compromised to produce unlikely results . Ideally , a Senate is meant to be proportionally represented in how the directly elected provincial assemblies are composed save one or two where ' magic happens ' or ' conscience prevails ' . I intend the pun . Not entirely though . There is also a rational explanation to where a senatorial candidate will emerge a winner when a party lacked basic numbers to make for a seat . It has to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a voting member in favour of his preferred choice after his own party nominee to the Senate has been placed above all . The system then transfers the preferred vote to others mentioned by the voting member . If enough of such transferred votes can accumulate to make a full qualifying number an unexpected candidate may appear a winner . <p> This is entirely legal in a voting system which holds the sanctity of the vote dear and expects the member to act per his or her conscience . The trouble is when neither , the sanctity or the conscience , are in line leaving a lot to lament . The trouble is when both , sanctity and conscience , are for sale . When it happens openly and gloated upon with chest-thumping it marks the depths of depredation and a sorry loss for the society . It marks the beginning of the end of any value system that was meant to underwrite democratic probity . It is as bad as raping a lonely traveller in the dark of the night before the eyes of her very children . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and its constituting elements . A fish is born with its head rotten . Rest is only a matter of time . <p> In the National Assembly where members vote to elect a federal candidate for the Senate the vote is single and non-transferable , almost a direct election . Ditto when choosing the chairman Senate . When a surprise emerges as was in the case of Yousuf Raza Gilani , there has either been a vote of dissent from the ruling party in favour of the opposing candidate , or votes have been ' enticed ' away from the ruling party . And this is where the rub has been for the last couple of weeks . <p> A video shows the son of Gilani , the Senate candidate , offering inducements to legislators for vote . The offers made are huge and ask of them to betray their party by either wasting their vote or voting for Gilani , the opposition 's candidate . In the ultimate count Gilani managed five votes more than the majority party -- seven governmental votes were wasted while nine out-rightly voted for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new and has happened before but never with such audacity and impudence . <p> It would be unfair not to mention the removal of an elected government in Balochistan in 2018 -- through a legal , democratic process but externally triggered and manipulated . A new political party formed of realigned members emerged overnight . The party went on to win the 2018 elections and nominated their candidate for the position of chairman Senate who won against all odds . Influence and money , both played their part . The common thread through these alleged manipulations was the role of a mainstream political party and its leadership which offered to play proxy for other players . This narrative has n't been denied . Asif Zardari claimed his ' magic ' had turned things around . He was also able to get two senators elected from a provincial assembly where the party did not have votes even for one . Life and politics are n't as straight as democracy tends to claim while this kind of ' magic ' defines the politics we must live under . <p> In the current @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Such was the extent of his intrusion into the PTI ranks impacting the integrity of the vote . Bilawal Bhutto , PPP 's current chairman , states that all that is necessary to win the electoral process will be employed . Apparently that justifies corrupting the process to gain numbers . PML-N 's Maryam Nawaz informs that votes for Gilani 's seat were acquired in exchange for a ticket in the next general elections whenever those are held . After this unexpected reversal the PTI and Imran Khan too are staking claims on using whatever means necessary to win the contest for Senate chairman . So much for the integrity and fidelity of the electoral process and politics itself . Many alibis for subverting the Constitution and corrupting the system are making the rounds but the entire process is so blatant it does n't even have a pretense . It is different this time round . Intent is difficult to establish even if every other indicator is a tell-tale sign of the members selling themselves for money and the leaders short-circuiting what they have undertaken on oath to safeguard . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The courts hide behind the need of maintainable evidence -- available videos of the crime somehow do n't match up to a detailed evidentiary matrix . The ECP does n't want to take sides in this extensively polarised political fight . Seeming neutral thus is safer . The institutions have been forced-muted and neutered under the fear of betraying partiality . A highly volatile and hostile political narrative peddled by the opposition seems to have cowed most institutions into submission . The media cherishes the opportunity to play up the fracas making for salacious news . The people look on . And all relish the moment because it somehow equates to fighting the military down into submission . The farce sustains .

Both yield and area of production declined to 24 million tons and area of production was reduced to 8.8 million hectors . Similarly , area of cotton production shrank to 2.5 million hectors . Cotton yield is 618 kilograms per hector while India is producing 29.4 million cotton bales . China is producing 27.5 million bales with 1,748 kg per hector yield , USA 19.5 million bales with 924 kg per hector , Brazil 12 million bales with 1,686 kg per hector . In the same way , sugarcane production was recorded at 75.5 million tons on 1.2 million hectors . Its production and area of cultivation was down to 66.8 million tons . <p> He suggested the government to reduce cost of production through direct support to farmers in purchase of machinery , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also be developed to ensure farm-to-market access . The government should formulate sustainable agriculture policy to ensure food security in the country , he added . <p> He said that due to the alarming decline in the cotton production seven million bales of worth $4 billion will be imported . There is a pressure on the economy . He also said that cotton production is lowest in 30 years . " The government should take practical steps for increasing the production of cotton in the country . It looked that government is not serious in increasing the production of the country . " After the 18th amendment agriculture is a provincial subject but unfortunately it looked that both the provincial governments of Sindh and Punjab are not serious in increasing the production as they had not taken any positive steps in this regard so far , he added . <p> Pakistan 's food security is dependent on production of essential crops that are providing basic food and input for industrial production , Anjum Nisar added . However , the performance of agriculture sector presently does not guarantee self-sufficiency . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could lead the country towards severe food security while shortage of essential food items would increase inflation . " Seed is the basic input for agriculture sector and has an imperative role in enhancing agriculture productivity .

Since all the economic indicators are moving in positive direction the government should now divert its full attention to share the benefits of this positive movement in economic spheres with the public , he added . 
@@52549237 <h> 70 golden years of Pak-China ties <p> The 70th anniversary of Pak-China ties is being celebrated this year and it is a good thing that the friendship with China is at the forefront of issues on which there is no difference of opinion in Pakistani society . The positive feedback on the usefulness of establishing closer ties with China in Pakistan came with the advent of the Chinese Revolution and its profound effect on the collective psyche of both nations . This is not just rhetoric , but when Chinese President Xi paid his first visit to Pakistan in 2015 , he wrote an article in which he expressed his feelings in this way " When I was young , I heard many touching stories about Pakistan and the friendship between our two countries . To name just a few , I learned that the Pakistani people were working hard to build their beautiful country , and that Pakistan opened the air corridor for China to reach out to the world and supported China on restoring its lawful seat in the United Nations . The stories have left me with a deep impression . " <p> Sentiments for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And this is not a new mindset that has gone up and down ; this friendship of the brotherly nations is recognised by the policymakers and opinion leaders on both sides . When the communist revolution broke out in China in 1949 , there was a fierce difference between capitalism and communism in the world . Non-communist countries did not seem ready to recognise the Chinese revolution , but under these circumstances , just three months after the revolution , on January 4 , 1950 , Pakistan sent a high-level delegation to China . And things started moving towards the establishment of diplomatic relations . Regular diplomatic relations were established between the two countries on May 21 , 1951 . It is important to know that Pakistan was the first Muslim country to establish diplomatic relations with China after the Chinese Revolution and the third non-communist country to take such a step . <p> From this , one can easily gauge the extent to which the government of Shaheed-e-Millat Nawabzada Liaquat Ali Khan was looking into the matter with proper understanding of this important issue . It was clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of big powers who were lobbying against the Chinese revolution . <p> Later , in 1955 , a high-level Chinese delegation led by Vice President Madam Song Ching arrived in Pakistan and high-level visits were made . In response , Prime Minister Hussain Shaheed Suhrawardy visited China in 1956 . The Boundary Agreement between Pakistan and China , signed in 1963 , is the most significant deed because it resulted in the regularisation of all borders with China so that there would be no future differences . <p> Pakistan became the first non-communist country whose airline launched flights to Beijing in 1964 and began to play its part in reducing China 's isolation from the world . Similarly , the Scientific and Cultural Cooperation Agreement was signed in 1976 , which opened a new path for Pakistanis on scientific matters . The Karakoram Highway of 1978 connected Pakistan with western China , while China also gained access to the Arabian Sea . <p> Similarly , in 1995 , a transit trade agreement was signed between Pakistan , China , Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan , opening the way from Central Asia to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ India since its inception . In order to prevent this threat and India 's air superiority , the Nawaz Sharif government signed an agreement with China in 1999 to make JF-17 Thunder fighter jets . JF-17 fighter jets joined the Pakistan Air Force in 2010 , which India enjoyed in the form of Abhinandan . During the Zardari government in 2013 , the Chinese Prime Minister Li visited Pakistan and the two countries discussed the concept of ' Comprehensive Strategic Cooperation ' . <p> In 2013 , the Nawaz Sharif government was formed in Pakistan and in the same year he visited China and presented the " vision for deepening China-Pakistan strategic partnership in the new era " and then President Xi paid a historic visit to Pakistan in 2015 in which the agreement for CPEC was signed and then the work started on CPEC under the Chinese vision of Road and Belt initiative . <p> No situation in Pakistan can spoil our relations and no other opinion can be formed in this regard . But it is worrying that after the political change of 2018 , a silence is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inappropriate . Similarly , our diplomatic position in the world is weakening . For example , it is very significant that President Joe Biden did not have contact with Imran Khan until a month after he came to power . At the moment , Chinese diplomatic circles seem to be questioning Pakistan 's future political landscape as they plan President Xi 's visit to Pakistan after April . But there are also fears of delays ; President XI 's visit should happen because it will give more strength to our brotherly relations .

@@52626230 <h> Debt relief <p> Pakistan is on the verge of receiving around $1 billion debt relief under the G20 plan . A much-needed good news for Economic Affairs Minister Khusro Bakhtyar . This loan suspension will , undoubtedly , provide fiscal space to our economy so that Islamabad can focus on the already-hardening battle against COVID . While indicators of a severe debt crisis were present in Pakistan long before the pandemic , being forced to completely shutter down has taken a great toll on its finances . With the third wave knocking on our doorstep with full force , we need all the help we can get . <p> It is for this reason alone that PM Khan is repeatedly making a case for debt relief for stressed countries . His call for suspension of debt payments until well after the pandemic if not debt cancellation was echoed by Ethiopian Prime Minister , Abiy Ahmed . As Khan is taking his bedridden economy to important UN gatherings , Ahmed wrote in The New York Times , " if the world is to survive the punishing fallout ... this initiative needs to be even more ambitious . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ owe the world much much more than we can squeeze out of our wallets . During such testing times , when we are being forced to balance our heavy liabilities with the public health crisis . Partial lockdowns have put millions out of work ; pushing 40 per cent of Pakistanis below the poverty line . With literally nill market activity and a deafening silence haunting industries , how are we expected to abide by the bullying deadlines and conditions of our creditors ? To many , this $1 billion relief may sound like a drop in the ocean . After all , our gross public debt has soared from Rs 24.95 trillion in June 2018 to Rs 36.95 trillion in September 2020 . The recent addition of $500 million from the alleys of the IMF is yet another story that comes with its own set of restrictions . Despite his wholehearted commitment to the issue of mounting debt , PM Khan is still playing the same old game . Debt-servicing constituted about 41. 28 per cent of the federal budget for the current year . But his ruthless critics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PTI government had inherited . Manipulation by previous administrations to artificially control the Pakistani rupee has taken its finances by storm . And it is this urge to keep our economy afloat that Islamabad is looking to the international community for a graceful way out . <p> Unfortunately , our outspoken position on this issue has sparked threats from Credit Rating Agencies with risk downgrade . More troubling is the vehement opposition of the US to our call for comprehensive relief at international gatherings . Ergo , when financial institutions paint a rosy picture to disguise dragging out economy to intensive care , allies , like China , hold the key to our true salvation . How on God 's green earth do the creditors expect a country with negative GDP , 12 per cent inflation rate and an over 80 per cent debt-to-GDP ratio to stick to their instalment plans ? <p> It can only be hoped that the next quarters see a realisation of wealth-creation initiatives ( Lahore 's Ravi Urban Project , Central Business District and Sindh 's Bundal Island ) being undertaken by the state . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spiral goodbye .

@@52659238 <h> Gilgit-Baltistan and the question of status <p> The interim status of province is deliberately framed as a bottom-up policy , since the decision was made at the local legislative assembly level . This narrative aims to counter Indian claims to Gilgit-Baltistan within the broader context of the Kashmir dispute <p> Gilgit-Baltistan ( GB ) is a diverse region and a distinct political entity , formerly known by different political adages , such as the Northern Areas of Pakistan and Gilgit Agency . This geo-strategic area shares borders with regional heavyweights China and India . Abundant in natural resources , GB 's trade potential through the Karakoram Highway replicates the ancient Silk Road . Then there are the unique ethno-linguistic formations . <p> The aforementioned has led to considerable attention from social science researchers and policy experts . Yet few have tackled the constitutional and political limbo that still lingers seven decades after Partition . On the one hand , the people of GB have expressed concern about protection of indigenous property and resources . On the other , they seek resolution to this prolonged ' identity crisis ' . It seems , therefore , that this subaltern population @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to quote indigenous historian Amanullah Khan -- under ambivalent arrangements . <p> It is against this backdrop that the people of GB have long pursued provincial status for the area ; thereby bringing it into the fold of legislation and governance and ensuring full constitutional rights . Pakistan 's latest commitment to integration came from the Sartaj Aziz committee in 2018 , which envisaged provisional status . More recently , in March of this year , the Gilgit-Baltistan Assembly voted towards this end , unanimously passing a resolution demanding the status of interim province . Chief Minister Khalid Khurshid acknowledged in a tweet the historical moment that fulfilled the aspirations of the people . <p> The interim status of province is deliberately framed as a bottom-up policy , since the decision was made at the local legislative assembly level . This narrative aims to counter Indian claims to Gilgit-Baltistan within the broader context of the Kashmir dispute <p> Since the 1970s , the Pakistani state has implemented several governance reform packages in GB . Yet these proved rather slow for the local population 's liking . Nevertheless , evolving policies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . By contrast , the interim status of province is deliberately framed as a bottom-up policy , since the decision was made at the local legislative assembly level . This narrative aims to counter Indian claims to Gilgit-Baltistan within the broader context of the Kashmir dispute . Until now , the Government of Pakistan had administered GB through its Ministry of Kashmir Affairs and Gilgit-Baltistan . The extent of such institutional neglect of local autonomy may be measured by the fact GB was , until 1975 , subject to the draconian British-era Frontier Crimes Regulation ( FCR ) . In fact , the area had to wait until the Gilgit-Baltistan ( Empowerment and Self-governance ) Order , 2009 was signed before enjoying any sort of legislative autonomy . <p> One must therefore ask : why now ? That is , what are the underlying conditions giving impetus to the GB integration drive ? Different factors are at play , CPEC ( China-Pakistan Economic Corridor ) being the most obvious . Beijing has invested heavily in Pakistan . Thus , both countries ' economies will benefit from the security that ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remains paramount that Pakistan consider the UNCIP ( UN Commission for India and Pakistan ) . To do otherwise would be seen as publicly abandoning the Kashmir cause . There is consensus among legal experts that the interim status of province will allow GB to come under the full jurisdiction of the Constitution ; either by amending Article I or Articles 51 and 59 , or all three . Thus the end goal , however it is achieved , is to make Gilgit-Baltistan the country 's fifth province , even if only temporarily . In this way , Pakistan 's stance on Kashmir will not be comprised . <p> Yet the impact on the local population as well as regional dynamics must be considered . Except for independent candidate Nawaz Khan Naji , all the members of the GB Assembly belong to national parties . The March resolution that won interim provincial status was moved by the newly-elected Chief Minister who belongs to PTI . Those who joined him in tabling the motion were : Opposition leader Amjad Hussain ( PPP ) , Ghulam Muhammad ( PML-N ) , representative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Rehmat Khaliq ( JUI-F ) . <p> The people of Gilgit-Baltistan have been here before in one way or another . In August 2015 , the local Assembly passed a resolution to grant the area special autonomous status while integrating into the federation . By October of the same year , then prime minister , Nawaz Sharif established the nine- member Sartaj Aziz constitutional committee as a panacea for all legal woes . The bottom line , then , like now , was to achieve the status of interim province . Thus , the approach to the GB ' orphan child ' has never truly been a bottom-up demand as per the wishes of the local population and their democratic representatives . <p> The area is rich in natural resources -- including water-resources which carry substantial hydroelectric potential -- and is home to tourist hot-spots as well as precious gems . This allows Pakistanis to reap the benefits of trade and transit routes , trophy hunting , mineral exploration and honeymoons under the clearest of blue skies .

@@52659239 <h> Pakistani politics -- trapped in a vortex <p> Pakistan is being governed by a self-righteous yet amateur leadership ; one that is generally perceived as being propped up by the establishment . Meanwhile , the motley opposition hardly seems capable of ending the dynastic politics that exists within its own ranks . <p> The recent battle between the ruling PTI and the religious right 's TLP ( Tehreek-e-Labbaik ) has highlighted the worst of the current political climate . Yet the battle among the collective opposition is equally unwelcome . Particularly , the relentless tit-for-tat jibes between the PMLN and PPP . <p> What we are witnessing therefore is an unprincipled power struggle within the ruling elite ; the faces of which are interchangeable . Most of the parties are family affairs and allow democratic norms to fall by the wayside . The TLP is but the latest party of this type among the power hungry . This leaves us with Jamaat-e-Islami ( JI ) , which has never once acted to strengthen Pakistan 's democracy , and Imran Khan 's PTI . Regarding the latter , the less said the better . For the party has failed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question of Riyasat-e-Madina . Thus , the status quo is actively working against the interests of inclusive and institutional democracy . <p> Many of the political parties that comprise the PDM have been in power in the past and some still have strong stakes in the current engineered system . These have willingly played the establishment 's game to protect their respective interests and may be prone to do so in the future , too . Even the PTI does n't have clean hands . After all , the party is now home to those who were once flag-bearers for the PMLN , PPP , PMLQ and Gen Pervez Musharraf . Thus the only tangible change is the transfer of leadership from one generation to the next , despite the fact that the PDM charter calls for the restoration of fundamental democratic rights and the end of the security establishment 's role in national politics . It is difficult to believe in the sincerity of these rallying cries given past records . <p> A sense of dynastic entitlement dominates the country 's political culture . With few exceptions , political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There is no concept of intra-party democracy <p> Pakistan 's tragedy is that it has oscillated between both authoritarian military rule and ineffective civilian rule . In addition , there have been no fundamental changes to Pakistan 's political power structure even though the country has enjoyed more than a decade of uninterrupted democracy . This holds particularly true since the PTI swept into power amid grand promises of bringing revolutionary change under the Naya Pakistan banner . Nevertheless , some PDM leaders , while declining engagement with the Prime Minister , appear to ready to negotiate with the powers-that-be , who always keep backdoor channels open . This explains why the PDM remains divided on the issue of resigning from the assemblies . Similarly , one can also understand PPP 's refusal to risk its hold on Sindh , which could see the party lose influence that does n't extend beyond the province . <p> A sense of dynastic entitlement dominates the country 's political culture and impedes the development of institutional democracy .

Despite the economic and social changes that have occurred over the last seven decades , the stranglehold of family-oriented politics remains . Influential families continue to control the country 's legislature . Such dynastic control has dire implications for our political and economic institutions . It undermines government legitimacy , especially in terms of policymaking , while promoting patronage and corruption . This is to say nothing of negative consequences borne of the ' selection ' effect . The result being that real power rests in the hands of a small oligarchic elite , which , in turn , impedes critical structural reforms that are urgently needed to facilitate sustainable economic development . <p> It is true that families from urban , religious and military backgrounds have emerged on the political scene , but their presence has not altered the personalised and dynastic culture of Pakistan 's politics .

Obvious reliance on the security establishment has not only affected democratic evolution but also produced a hybrid regime that has further damaged institutions . Imran Khan rode the political wave by saying no to dynastic politics . Yet after coming to power -- he co-opted politicians from dynastic political backgrounds while taking personality politics to the next level . Both of which have further weakened both state and democratic institutions . <p> Political parties are clearly divided on this critical issue . The development of democratic culture is not straightforward . It means providing and nurturing conditions that allow plurality and diversity in society . Democracy is not about power but , rather , about fundamental structural political reform and a representative democratic paradigm offers the only way forward for the country .

He kept his scholarly activities going and produced brilliant disciples like Dr Israr Ahmed and Javed Ghamdi to name a few . <p> JI could never manage to gain political power on its own .

The endless saga of political corruption started after the partlyless elections of 1985 , which is a direct consequence of Zia 's doctrine of ' positive results ' which have proven to be very negative for the country and its struggling democracy .

@@52668235 <h> Precautionary Measure <p> Observing the dramatic surge in Covid-19 cases in India , along with the havoc it has wreaked across the country , Pakistan imposed a travel ban on India .

An average of 200,000 cases are reported every day and a total of 15.3 million cases are active in India currently . To say the circumstances are dire would be an understatement . Another factor to be concerned about is that the Indian variant has doubly mutated which had made it partially resistant to vaccines .

While the sharp rise in the positivity ratio can be attributed to internal failures like a lack of compliance with social and procedural protocols , it is certainly more than justified for the government to take this step to eliminate the probability of the environment getting worse while the vaccination drive is expanded .

Our government , however , still has n't been able to enforce a strict lockdown -- which can actually help the government keep the situation under control . The authorities are always quick to close education institutions where SOPs can be followed strictly . On the other hand , markets , shopping malls and restaurants are allowed to open till 6pm . Many businesses violate these orders and keep their shops open till midnight . Police officers , too , intentionally ignore these violators . The government should enforce a strict lockdown for 15 days . This step will help it control the spread of Covid-19 to some extent .

It keeps announcing relief packages but does nothing to ensure that people 's financial challenges are resolved . Some overambitious plans were also announced in the past .

So far , it is limited to a war of words between the government and the opposition parties .

This is why the national accounts and GDP numbers are based on ratios from old surveys . A lack of funds prevented the PBS from carrying out new surveys . It also does n't prepare independent estimates of GDP . The National Accounts Committee does n't have any reputable national accounts expert .

From day one , the PTI-led government has been continuously blaming the past governments -- as well as the mafias , cartels , hoarders , and extortionists -- for inflation , instead of taking necessary measures to control it . According to a recent report , the inflation rate remained in double digits for the second successive month and stood at 10.9% in May . <p> It is no secret that the International Monetary Fund forced Pakistan to increase the interest rate and electricity prices that doubled the cost of debt servicing and pushed inflation upward .

In this respect , some Western countries and especially India have been calling on Islamabad to take action against the terror groups to avoid ' Dark Gray ' list status of the FATF .

Surprisingly , many in Pak Media are also idiotically blaming India without reading facts or questioning the worngs of their own government . As this foolishness in Pakistan is going on I suggest the readers to visit FATF website to understand where GoP is failing to follow FATF prescriptions . <p> The issues which still required to be complied by Pakistan , are as under : <p> ( 1 ) The issue which failed to comply in over a decade is that Pakistan require to continue making progress i.e. demonstrating that TF ( terror financing ) investigations and prosecutions target senior leaders and commanders of UN designated terrorist groups ; <p> ( 2 ) Pakistan 's 2019 APG Mutual Evaluation Report ( MER ) i.e. two years back , following additional deficiencies were identified ( and conveyed to Pakistan ) in which Pakistan needed to address following strategically important AML ( Anti Mony Loundring ) and CFT ( combating financing of terrorism ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amending its Money Loundring Act law ; ii ) demonstrating that assistance is being sought from foreign countries in implementing UNSCR 1373 designations ( to punish terrorists ) ; iii ) demonstrating that supervisors ( Govt .

Pakistan has NOT shown any progress to FATF on these issues and hence continues to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the issue is also of GoP 's denials , deceit , dishonesty , deception , trickery , neglecting seriousness , hoodwinking and fooling FATF . The FATF is giving long rope to Pakistan and slowly reaching to conclusion that avoidance on part of Pakistan is intentional , deliberate , planned and with ulterior motives . GoP needs to understand that such moves are not helping Pakistan but further dooming the nation .

Unfortunately , the warnings are now reality . Glaciers have shrunk , ice on water courses is breaking up too early , sea levels are rising and several places in the world such as a hitherto benign British Columbia in Canada and the never-so-benign Death Valley in California are witnessing heatwaves to rival Jacobabad in Sindh , once known as Khanger , the erstwhile heat champion of the world .

We must do something constructive to combat global warming . <p> The urgent need to minimize the effects of this warming on our long-suffering population is what this write-up is about . The rich have enough , and although their practices need to be changed , the same practices that have brought about global warming , it is the poor who need most help . <p> - Advertisement - <p> Pakistan is a poor country . Most of Pakistan 's population lives in the rural areas . Most people in these rural areas are unable to afford much by way of housing , so a small house composed of a single bedroom , a courtyard mostly for the cattle , and nothing else , is the norm . A corner of the courtyard serves as a kitchen and the fields as bathrooms . <h> The problem of course is that those who are less affluent are often not considered to be human by those with wealth in their pockets . That is the biggest problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rural areas are mostly fields , little concrete and no bitumen , you can get a little respite from the heat under a tree or in the great outdoors by night . The excessive morality of urban life does not plague the life of villagers , so if they must sleep on charpoys on the roof where the women are visible to neighbours , so be it . <p> That is not the case in our cities where villagers sometimes move to , so they can find work in fields other than agriculture , pun not intended . <p> What they discover when they move , however , can not be an improvement on what they leave behind . Cramped living conditions , filthy and excessively hot , thanks to the concrete and bitumen everywhere ; this is what city life turns out to be for the poor . It is not possible for women to sleep on the roofs here , because the tight housing means they can be seen by their neighbours , and nerves are not taught to recover from such sights in our cities . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the global warming that is upon us , because the resultant heat is beyond human endurance . One is to ensure that houses , however small , are constructed and designed better , to protect their residents against the heat . <p> To increase the number of trees must be made a priority . Construction and design must be overseen and thermal insulation made mandatory . There are a variety of insulation materials out there . They must be made available and affordable . Buildings must face away from the sun at its hottest . Bricks that are used in the construction of buildings must be designed to hold a layer of air within them . Windows must be recessed as much as possible and shaded against the sun . It should not be allowed to use metal in outside doors and windows because metal emits much more heat than wood . <p> - Advertisement - <p> The older systems of construction such as verandahs and ventilators high up on walls made great sense in our weather conditions . Extremely effective as they are , verandahs are not always affordable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be mandatory to allow the hot air to exit the building , seeing that hot air rises . Attention must also be paid to cross ventilation . In the absence of verandahs , green netting fabric must be provided free of cost to low-income housing as protection against the sun . <p> The old methods of plastering over construction with mud and clay are a great method of insulation . They should be used as a crucial finishing touch to all buildings , and renewed as required . <p> There is a greater danger of fire in extreme heat conditions . Fire proofing must be incorporated and fire escapes and evacuation regulations ignored at very great cost to those responsible . <p> One of the most common means of storing water now are those ubiquitous blue plastic storage tanks mounted on rooftops . It is best if plastic storage is not exposed to the sun long-term . According to the National Geographic , ' most plastic items release a tiny amount of chemicals into the food or beverages they contain .

That sporadic lifestyle has become the norm . It has been this way with encroachments for example , when those who encroached around drains and markets were allowed to do so for years until suddenly , the authorities decided to enforce the rules , ruthlessly ousting the long-term offenders in the process . The fact is that those who allow encroachments to take place and to persist are as much the offenders as those who build those encroachments . They should be held equally responsible for infringements of the law . <p> The same must apply to those who build @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hot ovens that are a crime against anything living -- animal , or human .

Negotiations between sitting government and Dr. Tahirul Qadri started last night and dead lock ended when government decided to accept his demands minus the his demand of abolishing Election Commission of Pakistan to formulate a new Election Commission . Political drama reached its peak on Thursday afternoon when Dr. Qadri during his speech from his purpose built bunker like Caravan gave one and half hour ultimatum to government to accept his demands or face the consequences .

Dr. Qadri calls Pakistani Parliament as bogus , corrupt , incompetent and useless maintaining that country was ruled by radical forces and terrorists and leaders were enjoying their lives instead of addressing these issues and providing peace and honest governance to the country . Therefore it has been decided that Parliament will be disbanded before March 15 , 2013 and interim government will be constituted with the consultation of all stakeholders sitting in and outside the parliament including Dr. Qadri and his party -- Minhajul Quran .

He stated a special meeting will be held in Lahore at the residence of Dr. Qadri on January 27 , 2013 to start execution of decision of Islamabad Declaration . When DND asked Zurqranain Haidar , a senior journalist and reporter of ARY News International who covered this sit-in and Long March , he was of the opinion that government had no option just to accept demands of Dr. Qadri because not a single participant left the place even after heavy rain sitting under open sky and all participants were of the view that they had gathered here till the last day of their life or till the acceptance of their just demands .

Political analysts are of the view that this is not a success of Dr. Qadri only rather a success of moderate religious faction against extremism and radical forces because Dr. Qadri believe in dialogue , non-violence and he has a stiff position against Taliban and radical forces while all other political parties sitting in opposition have soft corner for Taliban as being part of dictatorial rule of Gen Ziaul Haq who harboured Jihadis and Islamists to fight Afghan Jihad . It may be mentioned that opposition parties including former Prime Minister Mian Nawaz Sharif , Jamiat Ulema-i-Islaman , Jamaat-i-Islami Pakistan , Jamiat Alahadith had been part Majlis-i-Shura ( Islamic non-elected Parliament ) of Ziauh Haq and his non-party based election of year 1985 .

Starting from October , any money sent back to Pakistan through official channels -- mainly banks -- will be eligible for the National Remittance Loyalty Programme ( NRLP ) . Reward points earned under the NRLP would be redeemable for cash or other benefits , such as paying for PIA tickets and upgrades , tax and duty payments relating to personal phones and cars , or paying for goods and services at several state-owned companies businesses . <p> The benefits will progressively increase as the amount remitted increases . Total remittances under $10,000 will earn reward points at the rate of 1% , amounts up to $30,000 will earn 1.25% , and amounts over $30,000 will earn 1.5% . The scheme , approved last month , will cost around Rs13 trillion this year , according to reports . This amount , however , could rise significantly if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only estimated that about 25% of remitters will sign up in the current fiscal year . <p> The government is also crediting banks for bearing the cost of developing and operating apps to facilitate the process , although that investment is hardly altruistic -- banks will be the biggest direct beneficiaries of increased funds being remitted through formal financial institutions . The rewards structure is in line with the benefits offered by banks and many other credit card providers , which should not be surprising considering that it is the brainchild of one of the country 's most prominent bankers -- incumbent Finance Minister Shaukat Tareen . <p> The programme itself seems mostly harmless and could actually help raise remittances significantly . However , there is always the risk of the programme running a net loss . This would happen if it fails to encourage an increase in total remittances since the government is potentially ' spending ' up to 1.5% of all remittances . Meanwhile , there is also the potential for people to abuse the programme for perks , although existing banking controls on money leaving the country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @

@@53101238 <p> The previous two articles had presented estimates of the size of the four provincial economies and the economic structure of these economies respectively . This article gives estimates of the growth rate in the Gross Regional Product ( GRP ) of the four provincial economies in the tenure of different Governments from 1999-2000 to 2018-19 . <p> The analysis is useful in highlighting the two-way relationship between the growth of the national GDP and provincial GRPs . This depends on which sector leads the process of growth during a particular period . If agriculture , especially major crops , perform well in a particular year it disproportionately benefits Punjab . Alternatively , if industry , particularly manufacturing , shows faster growth then Sindh is likely to witness higher increase in the GRP growth rate . If services perform well , then this has a broader regional impact on the growth process in the country . Therefore , the sectoral policy regimes have a differential impact on the provincial economies . <p> During the Musharraf era , the growth momentum of the economy increased from 2003-04 onwards . The average growth rate of the manufacturing sector was exceptionally high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2007-08 , the national economy achieved a growth rate above 5 percent . It is not surprising that during these years , Sindh was the most buoyant economy with a growth rate of 6 percent . <p> The performance of agriculture was close to the average historical performance with a growth rate of just under 3 percent during this period . This meant that the economy of Punjab was likely to show a moderate growth rate . It was 4.7 percent , somewhat below the national average . The economy of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa was beginning to acquire some momentum after 9/11 with growth in remittances and rise in traffic volumes due to NATO supply movement and growing transit trade . Balochistan was experiencing constraints to its growth , with a relatively low growth rate close to 3 percent . <p> The years , 2007-08 to 2012-13 , witnessed a peak in power load-shedding and in acts of terrorism . The price of oil rose above $100 per barrel and the rate of inflation remained double-digit throughout these years . There were also devastating floods in 2009-10 which led to a big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ growth rate fell to below 3 percent . <p> All provinces suffered in varying degrees due to the negative impact of these factors . Sindh was badly hit especially by multiple acts of terrorism in Karachi and the growth rate fell from 6 to 2 percent . Balochistan was the worst affected by power outages and achieved a growth rate of only 1.8 percent . <p> The variation in the growth rates of the provincial economies has decreased from 2007-08 onwards . Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa has sustained a relatively high growth rate and remained the fastest growing economy up to 2018-19 . The gap between the growth rate of the economies of Balochistan and the country narrowed after 2012-13 . This was , of course , partly due to the fiscal equalization achieved in the 7th NFC Award which led to a big increase in transfers to the province and enabled a fiscal stimulus to be provided to growth . <p> Both Punjab and Sindh showed growth rates close to the national average during a period of moderate growth in the tenure of the PML ( N ) government . Punjab was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this period . <p> The long-term performance from 1999-2000 to 2018-19 of each provincial economy is shown in Table 2 in terms of the growth in real per capita GRP . <p> The numbers in Table 2 are very revealing . The three Provinces of Punjab , Sindh and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa have achieved a growth rate in real per capita GRP of close to 2 percent since 1999-2000 . Punjab and Sindh had somewhat lower GRP growth rate but the rate of population growth has also been smaller . <p> Khyber Pakhtunkhwa has performed relatively well and is the only province to have achieved a long-term GRP growth rate of 5 percent . However , the faster population growth has reduced the growth in per capita GRP . Unfortunately , the province of Balochistan has remained a straggler with a long-term GRP growth rate of under 3 percent . The result is that with the fastest population growth rate it has witnessed a fall in real per capita GRP from 1999-2000 to 2018-19 . <p> The fall in real per GRP of Balochistan is a matter of great concern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fishing , forestry , mining ( especially natural gas ) , manufacturing , transport , finance and insurance and private services has been falling or has shown little growth . Special measures will be needed to revive these sectors and promote the overall process of growth in Balochistan by removing constraints by supplying more water for agriculture , development of highways and a process of selecting regionally dispersed growth settlements with full access to services in the face of a low population density . Hopefully , the development of Gwadar Port and location of industry in the SEZs in Hub and Lasbela in close proximity to Karachi and Gwadar ports will raise substantially the growth momentum in the province . <p> There is need to reiterate that the success of the Federation of Pakistan , especially after the 18th Amendment and the 7th NFC Award , hinges on a process of reduction in regional disparities in the country . The Council of Common Interests must play a key role in monitoring and ensuring that this happens .

The present government could have benefited from that example at the first hint of the return of the dengue mosquito . Unfortunately , it waited for far too long . Only a few days ago , Chief Minister Usman Buzdar issued instructions for mobilisation of the field teams for anti-dengue sprays in public and private places ; draining out stagnant water , especially from shops selling tyres ( which tend to collect water having dengue mosquitoes and their larvae ) ; and carrying out street fumigations . This should be an annual exercise during the dengue season for as long as it takes to achieve the objective pursued . Other provinces also need to do that , considering that Pakistan has been experiencing dengue outbreaks for the last at least two decades with an increasing incidence of the affliction each time . Over 6,000 cases were reported across the country in 2005 , more than 48,000 in 2011 , and some 50,000 in 2019 .

This could lead , he warns , to emergence of multiple drug resistant ( MDR ) viruses or bacteria , and hence must be avoided . The issue being as serious as it is , the various bodies of medical practitioners need to take notice of this unprofessional approach and do something about it .

@@53288235 <h> PPA urges govt to allow poultry supply to Afghanistan <p> The Pakistan Poultry Association ( PPA ) North Region has suggested to the government that the poultry sector should be improved and a conducive environment should be provided so that poultry farmers can be protected from harm . <p> The PPA believed that the poultry sector was facing the worst business environment , largely due to the irrational activities of competitive commissions , the attitude of livestock and other government departments to control so-called prices , the ban on exports and the imposition of import tax on raw materials . <p> According to Chairman PPA ( North Region ) Dr. Abdul Karim , a meeting was held on the direction of Peshawar High Court to resolve these issues in which Secretary Agriculture Khyber Pakhtunkhwa ( KPK ) , Secretary Food KPK , representatives of the Peshawar High Court , stakeholders of the poultry and livestock sector were present . The meeting also discussed a ban on exports of poultry and livestock products to Afghanistan . <p> " In this meeting we gave a presentation on Poultry Update and highlighting the importance of the poultry sector , we said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ materials from the agricultural industries and uses it to make high-quality food , such as meat and eggs and on the other hand , it acts as a price regulator for other foods such as mutton , beef , lentils , and to some extent vegetables , " chairman said . <p> Dr. Karim cited the factors that led to the increase in the cost of poultry products and termed the ' cost of production ' in agriculture as a wrong analogy . <p> " In Agriculture ' In Put Cost ' is to be referred to when discussing cost increases . In the last 7 years there has been 210 per cent increase in the poultry input cost . We can see the example of Soybean Meal , which is of import base and there has been more than 300 per cent increase in cost during this time owing to increase in international price , rupee devaluation and on top of it increase of import duties and sales tax which did not exist up till year 2013 . Taxes and duties on imports of raw materials , which are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only increase the Input cost , " he said . <p> He urged market forces to operate and the government to understand this phenomenon rather than to disturb it . <p> " Exports can not be put On and Off , subject to local pricing , as it takes quite an effort to start and maintain exports . Any discontinuation will give chances to competitors , which may get very hard to regain . The exports do not factor the local price increase instead it encourages the farmers to produce more . To ban the national exports on the basis of DOC price limits or retail price of chicken in one town will send negative sentiments to farmers and will discourage them , resulting in reduction in production . <p> As a result of this meeting it was encouraging to know as the government lifted the ban on all livestock and poultry exports except DOC , which remained conditional to maximum DOC price of RS 70 and retail price RS 230 of Broiler in Peshawar and any increase in these rates will automatically stop exports to Afghanistan . Since at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mentioned rates , thus the export of DOC to Afghanistan remains closed , " he concluded .

@@53314236 <h> The Unfair Advantage <p> History was made when the world 's first transgender athlete participated in the Tokyo 2020 Summer Olympic Games . Laurel Hubbard , a New Zealander , became the first-ever openly transgender weightlifter to compete in the Olympics . This progressive development was applauded all over the world . At the same time , her competing in the women 's side of the weightlifting contest was subject to criticism as many considered her biologically male physique giving her an advantage over other cis-gendered women athletes . Tracey Lambrechs , a New Zealander cis-gendered woman athlete , claimed that Hubbard took her spot unfairly in the Olympics weightlifting competition to represent the country . <p> The International Olympic Committee 's ( IOC ) guidelines of 2015 allow transgender sportspersons to participate in the games if they fulfil the requirement of hormone therapy . This increasing incorporation of transgendered women athletes in women 's association of sports has fretted many cis-gendered women . Some are irrationally worried that this might be the end of women 's sports . <p> Various women athletes claim that the transitioned athletes have physical traits of a male , like greater stamina @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men and go through all the male-associated aspects of life . On the occasion of their outing , they identify themselves as women . This gives them an unfair advantage over other female athletes . Due to problematic laws of sports , trans women , with male bodies and feminine gender , get to participate in the women-only category of sports and are increasingly winning titles that they consider are reserved for cis-gendered women athletes . <p> Leia Schneeberger is an athlete of mountain bike racing . She won three championships in a row but lost the fourth title to a transgendered woman biker who formerly competed from the men 's side of the same sport . It is not the winning of titles by trans women that is the determinant of injustice , the very act of their participation is . " Why do I have to compete against a male body ? " , she complained . <p> Hormone therapy is mainly practised to reassign one 's sexual characteristics , which has nothing to do with sports . <p> Holly Lawford-Smith , an Australia-based philosopher and feminist , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their biological sex for social and legal purposes is vying to dominate . If this has happened , a person who was born biologically male , went through male puberty and has the same bodily features as that of a man , can expect to be included in all female-only spaces , including sports . <p> Trans women , on the other hand , justify their participation in women 's sports . Joanna Harper , a trans athlete and scientist , says that transgendered athletes fulfil the requirement of strength reduction , therefore , the playing field is fair . Sports federations allow transgendered women to compete in women sports provided they have undergone feminization hormone therapy , which is aimed to reduce their testerostone level . <p> Despite this therapy , the trans women athletes retain their physical edge , which is basically what decides the victor . Testosterone already develops the body height , muscle content and bone density of trans women while going through male puberty . Hormone therapy can not undo that . It can reduce a person 's physical strength a little , but mostly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Besides , hormone therapy is mainly practised to reassign one 's sexual characteristics , which has nothing to do with sports . <p> According to Emma Hilton , a developmental biologist at the University of Manchester , a male 's body could be as much as 40 per cent stronger than a female 's . The performance gap in weightlifting is over 30 per cent , 50 per cent in throwing baseball and 162 per cent in punching , all in favour of the male . <p> It must be noted that gender identity is not a time-sensitive entity , and can be determined at any given moment . People could misuse the inclusion policy by identifying themselves with any gender dishonestly to get selected in their prefered sex league . According to World Athletics 2019 ranking , it was revealed that there are over 2000 men ahead of the fastest woman in running by time . Any ' man ' from those 2000 could wrongly transition their gender and identify as a woman to join a women 's sports event , unfairly compete and , possibly , win @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ controversial rules of the sport do not make the athlete unjust . The inclusion policy is highly flawed . It is at odds with science . But if policies are implemented on the whims of the proponents of anti-trans laws , and trans women are forced to join the men 's league , there will be some more discrepancies to see . For instance , trans persons will feel isolated to be a part of a group that does not correlate to their gender , and there will always be a possibility of harassment that can crush their athletic spirit . <p> Most sports administrations around the globe follow the IOC guidelines for the inclusion of trans athletes . However , there are many other leagues that not only do not follow this rule but also do not contain a transgender-inclusive plan at all . The mainstream sports leagues like NFL , NBA and football clubs have yet no transgender inclusion policy . In the US , nine states have passed laws to bar transgendered women to participate in women 's sports competitions . Many other states are currently working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are finally getting included in different spaces of society . The sports administrations must devise a more rational inclusion strategy . The transgender community can not afford a boycott from other spheres at this point when acceptance is only getting started . <p> The only thing that makes sense is that the existing inclusion system is problematic . Anyone could perceive it as unsporting . The rule of hormone therapy that reduces a person 's strength must be abolished as a requirement for trans athletes . People should be accepted as who they are . The only fair solution to the problem is that trans men and trans women each need a category of their own . Men , women and differently-abled persons have their categories to ensure a level playing field for all athletes . Why not further classify the Olympic and other games categories into trans men and trans women sports , and collectively call it ' Translympics ' ? It would provide a fair and square chance of succeeding to all participants and also further the cause of accepting transgendered persons in society . <p> In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the dichotomy in sports between men and women must be based on biological sex rather than gender .

A person whose biological sex , according to the anatomy of their body , is male should have every right to identify themself with a gender of their choice . But since their anatomy aligns them with men , they must compete on the men 's side of the sport to make it a level playing field .

Looking into the merger opportunities , the wannabe Jazz , Telenor Pakistan can not merge with Jazz since the Competition Commission of Pakistan will not allow it due to fair competition . As per the previous merger of Jazz is concerned , Zong was not comfortable in sharing its customers so we expect that the option left with Telenor is either Ufone or SCO . <p> SCO seems the perfect option since it is trying to extend its services in the Pakistani market for some time now .

@@53381230 <h> A new regional war ? <p> Amidst all the uncertainty surrounding the resurgence of coronavirus , global supply-chain disruption , and shifting international alliances , there is one thing that can be asserted with some measure of certainty : a new war , a new Great Game , a new world order , is afoot . And in the coming months and years , South Asia , along with the Pacific , will most likely be the arena in which this next Great Game is contested . Let us put this in perspective . Modern history , its alliances , and its flashpoints , stretch only as far back as a hundred years . At the turn of the twentieth century , the world was an unrecognisably different place . Europe and the Middle East was predominantly split between the Austro-Hungarian Empire , the British Empire , The Ottoman Caliphate , and French pockets of power . Russia , China , and even the United States , were involved only at the fringes , through fragmented alliances of fleeting importance . The First World War changed all that , completely obliterating the old-world order . But the ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its military might ; Japan had not been cut to size ; and American dominance in the Western hemisphere was still in its nascent stages . This unfinished agenda led the world to war again , which culminated in the Second World War . This was far more decisive . Germany and Japan 's defeat was " unconditional " this time . The consequent division of the spoils of war gave rise to the modern-day Middle East . It also established the United States as the dominant force in the West , and resulted in the creation of institutions such as the United Nations . However , even as the West celebrated its victory , recreating international boundaries at its whim , an Iron Curtain fell across half of Europe , under the banner of the Soviet Union . This time , with atomic power in all major military arsenals , an all-out was in no one 's interest . Instead , a ' Cold War ' , fought through economic instruments , international trade blocs and proxy wars in Korea , Vietnam and Afghanistan . <p> Defeat of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fall of the Berlin Wall in November 1991 , ended the Cold War and ushered in the age of a unipolar world . For the first time since the collapse of the Roman Empire , all of the world was ' dominated ' by a single country : in this case the United States . This extraordinary turn of events ushered in a decade of uninterrupted prosperity for the United States , during the 1990s . Its military power was unchallenged . Its economic reach was unimpeded . And its political capital seemed inexhaustible . Many of the countries that had earlier sided with the Soviet bloc , started to shift their loyalty . And the first among them was India . Throughout the 1990s , India worked on realigning its international stance to side with the United States . And , in the wake of 9/11 , as the United States decided to flex its unipolar muscle in Afghanistan , India jumped on the bandwagon to rebrand itself as America 's strategic partner in South-Asia and beyond . India , through American sponsorship , started to see itself as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the process , it sought to isolate Pakistan , painting it as Global Enemy No. 1 . In fact , some years back , this strategy formally re-shaped American foreign policy -- declaring ' Af-Pak ' as one region , while including its strategic partner India in the ' Indo-Pacific ' policy , focused at countering China . This strategy worked exceptionally well for India , for almost two decades . As United States ' strategic partner , India soon found favour amidst a pliable Middle East royalty , which depends on American military and financial presence for its survival . Pakistan , it seemed , was finally being isolated ; helped , of course , by decades of bad governance , under Nawaz Sharif , Asif Zardari and Pervez Musharraf . Drunk on its strategic partnership with the United States , and emboldened by feckless leadership of the Muslim world ( including decades of isolation for Pakistan ) , India started to exert its nuisance by sponsoring terrorism in Pakistan , infiltrating Afghanistan 's NDS , and revoking Kashmir 's special constitutional status . Recently , however , something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myth of a unipolar world has started to crumble , as China grows out from the shadows , and a resurgent Russia gathers strength under the leadership of Vladimir Putin . Friends and foes , living under the erstwhile unipolar world , now have other international options to look towards -- as a result of which , the regime changes , desired by the US , could not be properly effectuated in Syria , Lebanon , and large parts of the gulf empires . Most decisively , perhaps , America 's defeat in Afghanistan has turned out to be a military and strategic set-back for America and her allies ( read : India ) . <p> Amidst these winds of change , as the world was still grappling with shifting power balance , the coronavirus epidemic swept across the world . Americans had hoped that this disease would be limited to China , or its neighbouring countries . However , exactly the opposite happened . China , where the virus started , quickly gained control over its spread . And the ' free world ' , led by the United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Brazil and India ) , have suffered the most . Not knowing how to come to terms with this reality , the hubris of America and its allies turned to blaming China . Following the American lead , India and its media continues to refer to the pandemic as ' Wuhan Virus ' . Ticking China further , the US and its allies continue to issue feeble statements of support of Taiwan , and against the ' One China ' policy . The Pacific has seen increased military activities . And Secretary Blinken is rooting for what he calls the international ' rules based order ' ( whatever that means ) . This , for all intents and purposes , is the stage of the new Cold War . Unlike the last Cold War , this ( economic and military ) stand-off will be focused on the Pacific . Or should we say , the Indo-Pacific . Almost overnight , the stakes of South Asia have changed . Within the span of a few months , India has gone from being the next big thing , to being on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever-stronger China in its backyard . Steps by India to backtrack from its " Howdi Modi " stance to a more " Non-Aligned Movement " stage , seem ( for now ) to be too little too late . This region , along with the Pacific , is now going to be centre-stage in world politics for the foreseeable future . China 's economic interests are aligned with a prosperous Pakistan , and a functional CPEC route . After its ignominious exit from Afghanistan , America 's regional interests , acting through its proxy India , include destabilisation of Pakistan and disruption of CPEC . And this important tussle , enacted by Pakistan and India , at the behest of China and the United States respectively , will determine the contours and complexion of the coming war in our region , as well as that of the new Great Game in South Asia .

@@53400236 <p> ' The global risk from the new Omicron coronavirus variant is " very high " , the World Health Organization warned ... Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus , the WHO 's director-general , said on Monday that Omicron highlighted " how perilous and precarious our situation is " as he delivered an address to the World Health Assembly . ' -- Excerpts from the November 29 , 2021 published Financial Times ( FT ) article ' WHO warns of ' very high ' risk from new Omicron coronavirus variant . ' <p> While it still remains to be seen as to how dangerous the new variant is what is important though for policymakers is to increase the spread of Covid-19 vaccines , especially to global south , and in particular Africa where the vaccine coverage is particularly low as compared to the rest of the world . The rich , advanced countries will have to understand that new and most probably more potent variants are likely to keep emerging as long as vaccine inequality remains . A recent Fatima Hassan-authored article ' Omicron : vaccine nationalism will only perpetuate the pandemic ' published by Al-Jazeera highlights this aspect as : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supply has enabled the emergence of dangerous new variants of COVID-19 . ... If we do not want Covid-19 to continue exacerbating the racist and colonial world order , we need change . And believe it or not , it would benefit the UK and Europe , too . Because you can not impose rigid policies or build high enough walls to keep the consequences of vaccine inequality out . ... We need solidarity and cooperation , not knee-jerk travel bans . ' <p> Here , the negative role of keeping intact intellectual property rights ( IPRs ) , which resulted in lack of much-needed speed in manufacturing vaccines , should have been done away with at least for the duration of the pandemic . In this regard , a November 29 , 2021 Guardian article ' Developing nations may give up on the WTO for good if it wo n't budge on vaccine patents ' highlighted in particular the highly objectionable role of Europe and ' unhindered market ' phenomenon in removing IPRs . It argued , among other things , that ' The Omicron variant is the inevitable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months that failure to vaccinate most of the world is the best way to ensure the spread of new and potentially dangerous Covid-19 variants , some of which could undermine even the vaccines we have created . ... But the WTO stands at the apex of a trade system which rules that nothing should get in the way of " the market " . An unhindered market is all we need ... Covid-19 is the proof that this is a fallacy . It has shown us that the market can not solve a crisis . In fact , the market has ensured the rich and powerful get many times what they need while the poorest get virtually nothing . Meanwhile , two medicines alone -- the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines -- are making the companies behind them $1,000 ( ? 749 ) per second in profit . ' <p> On the other hand , rather than fixing vaccine inequality , the global north continues to impose harsher restrictions on countries where new variants emerge , reducing the prospects of economic recovery in these countries , as pointed out by Fatima @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ punishing the victims of global vaccine inequality by slamming shut the borders to anyone from southern African nations . Of course , the Omicron variant , as the World Health Organization has named it , has not exclusively been found in Southern Africa . Cases have been discovered in Asia and Europe , including in the UK , but the Global South is being blamed for it , while the means to deal with COVID-19 have been kept from it . This is perfectly fitting with how rich countries have dealt with the pandemic . ' <p> The emergence of this new variant of high concern in particular is likely to halt the already slow rate of economic recovery of the global south . A recent Economist article ' Three threats to the global economic recovery ' highlighted in this regard the following : ' The emergence of a covid-19 variant , labelled Omicron , has sparked a wave of selling on financial markets , seemingly on concern that a new highly transmissible strain of the virus could set back economic recoveries worldwide . Yet even if Omicron proves manageable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as countries are squeezed between two formidable economic forces : tighter American monetary policy and slower growth in China . ' <p> At the same time , the same article highlighted the economic challenges to vulnerable economies posed by Omicron as follows : ' The emergence of Omicron adds fresh uncertainty . Little is known yet about the economic damage that the variant might wreak . ... Many currencies tumbled against the dollar amid a flight to safety . ... If Omicron were also to depress trade and growth , then its spread would further amplify the pressures facing vulnerable economies . The sailing will be anything but smooth .

Due to the trial equipment , the speed of the Khukri was just 12 knots which made it vulnerable to the Hangor . In anti-submarine warfare , the ships have to be agile and fast compared to the slow-moving submarines lurking below . <p> On the fateful night of December 9 , nearly 16 nautical miles from the Gujarat coast as the Pakistani submarine positioned itself tactically to pounce upon the charging Indian frigates , it detected two ships , eight nautical miles apart .

Former Foreign Minister Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto planted the same branch in the Taxila Museum Park on January 23 , 1964 . <p> Although the branch grew up to become a sturdy specimen , most of the people in Pakistan remain woefully ignorant of the rich and awe-inspiring history and significance of the existence of the tree . <p> Even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gandhara Civilisation in some capacity , only a small number of history enthusiasts know that the Bodhi Tree in Taxila is said to be a progeny of the same tree under which the Buddha meditated for seven weeks , attained enlightenment and gazed at with gratitude for as long as seven days . <p> For Buddhists , the Bodhi Trees are revered as sacred living beings with a direct connection to their beloved spiritual teacher and leader . <p> Renowned historian and Gandhara Civilisation expert Dr Nadeem Omar Tarar told The Express Tribune that despite the rich history attached with the Bodhi Tree at Taxila , the historical specimen has not been accorded the importance it deserves . <p> Far from receiving special attention , the Tree is almost lost from view due to its close proximity to a thicket of other large trees , which is affecting its growth and overall health . <p> The historian has termed the Bodhi Tree a national treasure that can play a vital role in encouraging and promoting religious tourism . <p> Dr Tarar urged the government to engage the services of archaeologists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ followers of Buddha celebrate December 8 as Bodhi Day , which is believed to be the day when the Buddha had ' awakened ' . Special meals such as Kheer and cookies shapes like hearts -- reflecting the heart-shaped leaves of the Bodhi Tree -- are prepared on the day . <p> Published in The Express Tribune , December 8th , 2021 . <p> COMMENTS <p> Replying to X <p> Saved !

@@53443239 <h> Meeting on the Afghan crisis <p> Finally , the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation ( OIC ) has decided to convene an extraordinary ministerial meeting in Islamabad on December 19 to discuss the humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan . The session should provide an opportunity for the 57-member organisation to look for solutions for the looming crisis in the war-torn country . It is the second extraordinary meeting of the OIC being held in Pakistan after 41 years . The first such meeting took place in 1980 after the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan . The change in Afghanistan was on expected lines , but that the change would come so suddenly was not expected ; even the Taliban are puzzled . Now the country faces a dire future . The religious militia may have succeeded in convincing the Americans to leave the country , but for the time being , the victorious Taliban are seeking international assistance to feed the people . It is much easier for Americans to resort to sanctions than to lose American lives in a remote corner of the world . The American exit from Afghanistan is perplexing from different angles . The Afghanistan war turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so too for the Afghans . Despite being an absolute power , the US had to leave the country without gaining much . Rated as terrorists , the Taliban entered into dialogue with the Americans as interlocutors and convinced the latter to withdraw from the country . In return , the Taliban agreed not to allow the Afghan soil to become a sanctuary for Al-Qaeda or Daesh . <p> The ground reality is that none of the countries has recognised the Taliban regime , not even Pakistan , which facilitated the talks between the Taliban and the Americans . The primary reason for countries ' reluctance to recognise the Taliban regime is the American annoyance . Most of the countries do not want to be on the wrong side of the United States . However , a host of factors should encourage the countries to calibrate their policies towards the Taliban regime to avoid pushing the poor Afghan population into an avoidable catastrophe . There could be mutual obligations that the Taliban and their interlocutors may adopt . First , the Taliban can widen the base of their government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the international voices which call for an inclusive government that may satisfy the broader sections of Afghan religious and ethnic minorities . Second , the question of human rights , including women 's rights , in Afghanistan has become a permanent talking point with the American and EU partners . <p> Third , the Taliban 's vindictive attitude towards their opponents is yet another thorny issue which most countries would look at with concern while considering future interaction with the Taliban . Fourth , although ISIS/Daesh took roots in Afghanistan under the US-NATO watch , it is now a headache for the Taliban to tackle . The Taliban and ISIS/Daesh have already engaged in many skirmishes in eastern Afghanistan . To completely root out ISIS would be an arduous task for which the Taliban would need international assistance , including American technological assistance . <p> It is encouraging to note that most UN organisations and international NGOs have access to almost ninety per cent of the country . However , due to restrictions on the Afghan banks , international donors and INGOs are facing difficulties in channelising their aid to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ salaries , but banks are reluctant to transact with the Afghan banks because of American restrictions .

While individually , the OIC member states may not be able to alleviate the plight of the Afghan people , they can pool together their resources to help the Afghan people , especially children facing the worst malnutrition . Approximately three million children are suffering from malnutrition . <p> Secondly , the OIC may form a special committee to oversee aid commitments from the member states .

Pakistan has not been faring any better as we regularly read reports about deaths that are mostly the result of malnutrition . Though such deaths are common across the country , one recent example is from Tharparkar where the death toll of new babies dying due to mothers ' poor health has reached 20 just the past week . This is according to the officially recorded data from Civil Hospital Mithi ; unreported deaths may be much higher . This includes new born babies whose ages range from one day to one year . If you include those who died before reaching the age of five , the number may be staggering . In addition , nearly 7,500 children have died and over 27,000 children under the age of five have been affected by the deadly pneumonia virus in Sindh alone . Over the age of five this number is much lower -- showing a direct connection with malnutrition of children and mothers during and after pregnancy .

There is also a need to collect reliable data from across Pakistan from both government and private clinics and health facilities as most data from private hospitals do not reach the government record . <p> According to some estimates , approximately 90,000 children die annually in Pakistan due to the pneumonia virus alone that affects malnourished children more than healthy children .

The government may also launch a programme to tackle the issue of extremely low levels of haemoglobin in pregnant women , prevalent in most low-income families .

If not identified and addressed , it will increase inequalities in terms of losses in earnings as well as lifetime opportunities -- because some individuals will have access to , and knowledge of , simple technology while others will not . <p> Even for small communities , connectivity is essential . <p> In the face of Covid-19 , service industry appears to be the one transforming most rapidly -- adopting remote working and developing new methods of customer-centric service provision . General Electric was one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remote working pre-Covid . Now large oil and gas service providers such as INTECH are also exploring extended remote service provision . Financial and educational service provision is maturing by leaps and bounds . This response is a testament to not only Pakistanis ' extraordinary resilience and resourcefulness but also to the quality of manpower and leadership in these sectors . <p> Having said that , these successes flow from the top five per cent at best . What happens ( or does not happen ) within , say , the bottom 50pc will create huge inequalities in terms of opportunities , income generation , growth and employment that will likely impact the generations to come . With 64pc of our population under the age of 30 , that can not be good news . <p> Take the education sector which has been one of the most highly impacted service sectors since the virus struck . The massive change in operational dynamics forced public-sector primary and secondary schools ( in the absence of quick tech solutions ) to adopt policies such as inviting 50pc of the students to school premises @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ methods took place in small private schools that were able to offer limited recorded or online classes . A driven young private school instructor explained to me how , due to bandwidth constraints , she pre-recorded audio classes and used the ' online ' session for dealing with queries through audio . Depending on how many students were able to join a live session , she would either conduct the class taking questions through text or audio or a hold a pre-recorded audio class only . <p> Top-tier institutions such as Lums invested heavily in faculty development , technology adoption as well as service provision for student support . Innovative ideas including technologically equipped outdoor classrooms and various modalities of engagement with the learners were adopted . <p> However , all these stories still come from the privileged few . The majority of students in primary , secondary and tertiary education in Pakistan will not be able to engage through any such distance-learning models in the short run . <p> The shift consequently impacts quality of education and employability . Not everyone has access to telephony infrastructure , devices and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not reap the benefits . During a research study of a novel , decentralised , local renewable energy system in district Khushab , Punjab , for example , we realised that while there were social benefits , the locals had not been able to entirely reap the expected economic benefits from access to cheap renewable energy ; a primary reason we identified was inaccessibility to mobile/data services in the area . Even for small communities to prosper , we found , connectivity was essential . <p> Mobile/internet penetration therefore is important , and we do not fare badly . <p> With 169 million cellular subscribers in Pakistan ( a good 80pc teledensity , or thenumber of telephone connections per 100 individuals ) of which 85m subscribe to 3G/4G , 87m to broadband ( 40.1pc penetration ) , cellular penetration is decent . Data and telephony services are relatively affordable but smartphones have some issues of gendered use . This is certainly something policymakers can look into . <p> We are , arguably , at the gateway of a great opportunity of integrating our educational and technological and industrial policies so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wider developmental challenges . Conversely , if we do not have the foresight this requires , we would remain on the brink of a tragedy of inequalities and a generation of yet another type of ' have-nots ' in Pakistan . No one must be left behind as we move to fulfil our UN-SDG commitments . <p> The writer is director of the Centre for Business and Society at Lums. 
@@86725230 <p> In line with spirit of the 18th Amendment to the Constitution of Pakistan the collection of provincial sales tax on services was devolved to the provinces and revenue authorities were established in all four provinces . The devolution of sales tax on services was made with the prime objective for provinces to raise own source revenue and , thus raise a bigger pool of resource that can be spent on delivering services . The revenue authorities across all provinces have made decent contributions to provincial revenues by capturing early gains -- in the last 4 years the provincial tax collection have increased to 10% of the total tax collection , while the provincial contribution to national non-tax revcenue is 20% . However , the revenue growth beyond these early gains have stalled and the tax base has stagnated -- the provincial tax collection as a percentage of GDP has wandered around at 1% . While this phenomenon is analogous to the situation faced by Federal Board of Revenue , there is one major difference . The provincial tax authorities are fairly young institutions and hence face lesser institutional rigidities and resistance to change and innovation . Given the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more innovative , flexible and efficient . The provincial government 's need to capitalize on this opportunity by reforming , modernizing and strengthening their tax authorities for better tax collection . <p> Punjab is the largest province of Pakistan and contributes almost 54.5% to the national economy . Moreover , Punjab 's economic structure is dominated by the services economy which produces 63% of the value-added . Punjab also houses 70-75% of the 5 million plus SMEs in the country where majority of these businesses are linked to the services economy . Despite this huge size of the services sector , the number of tax-payers registered with Punjab Revenue Authority ( PRA ) are just 84,000 and the revenue collection is approximately PKR 120 billion . The importance of provincial taxes can not be overemphasized . The Punjab Growth Strategy 2023 estimates that the provincial own source revenue needs to grow a rate greater than 17% per annum till 2023 for the province to meet its future investments to achieve a higher economic growth rate and meet its development targets . Most of this growth will have to come from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raising provincial own source revenue is the foundation required to provide better quality and sustainable services to citizens . There is substantial evidence that shows a strong correlation between local revenue and sustainable socio-economic development . The provincial governments face substantial resource shortfalls to invest adequately for meeting SDGs and other addressing other challenges such as Climate Change . The capabilities to raise own source revenues and link them to service delivery targets is crucial if the provinces are to make meaningful progress towards these objectives . Several international agencies such as the Foreign Commonwealth and Development Office ( FCDO ) and the World Bank are working with provincial governments and the federal government to help them build stronger and sustainable tax institutions and systems by making strategic and catalytic investments that offer larger gains on investments . They are working with the multiple provincial governments to support them increase the tax-base , improve compliance and also create a more enabling environment for the tax payers . It is important to highlight that successful tax reforms and tax policy measures are those that substantially reduce the tax-payers cost of compliance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PRA in Punjab has been one of the most progressive agency and under its senior leadership has implemented huge modernization efforts that has not only helped in increasing the revenue but has also facilitated the tax payers . An example of PRA 's success has been its superb performance during the pandemic . Under the RISE Strategy of the Punjab Government , the economic stimulus package included substantial tax rebates on services and certain services were made zero rated . Despite these reliefs PRA was able to outperform the set targets . <p> Sub-National Governance ( SNG ) is a programme funded by Foreign Common &amp; Development Office ( FCDO ) . SNG works closely with key government departments on a sustainable reform agenda supporting Governance , Planning , Public Financial Management and Taxation . One of the key features under SNG is its Innovation Challenge Fund that seeks to make small catalytic investments in innovative ideas that allow public sector to main stream sustainable reforms that otherwise in routine manner will not be possible . Sustainable innovation can only happen under a set enabling circumstances and public sector lacks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' , ' collaboration ' , ' technical and knowledge capability ' and ' resources " to pilot and knit all stakeholders towards a common objective . The SNG Innovation fund is designed to offer this and works as an internal reform and change within main stream public sector . <p> Given the importance of provincial taxation , SNG has worked closely with PRA to design a key innovation that is incline with the efforts to make PRA a modern facilitative and effective tax authority . SNG is implementing a high-tech yet home grown initiative with PRA that is designed to use intelligent data analytics and integration of existing data bases available within the public sector such as property taxation , motor vehicle registration , social security data and similar other data sets to identify new tax payers and implement a SMART Audit regime . The system is using Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning on data patterns and tax-payers information to identify anomalies that warrant exploration for tax compliance . The project in its very early days through data analytics have identified between two-three thousand new potential tax payers for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and PRA is looking to increase the tax-base by 100% over the next 3-5 years with the effective use of technology and intelligent data analysis . Moreover , the initiative involves a strong emphasis on reading and understanding the needs and behaviors of tax-payers and will help PRA use creative messaging often referred to as ' nudges ' to improve voluntary compliance . <p> Finally , the essence of innovation is its adaptability , scalability and replicability . Adaptive ICT to a large extent addresses the issue of replicability , for example , in case of SNG Intervention with PRA on provincial taxation , the system is completely adaptable in other provinces as the structures and requirement do not differ . The real strength of these innovative interventions is their interoperability leading to a more integrated and transparent system . This will also help in better integration of information and data and thus will support a stronger evidence based approach for not just increasing tax revenues but formulating a private sector enabling and a growth oriented tax policy -- a missing link in previous interventions . <p> The adaptability however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change is always an uphill task and internal and external power structures of institutions often block some of the most innovative and practical reforms . However , in case of provincial tax authorities , these are still developing their culture and grappling with setting the bars on service delivery standards and thus offer the greatest opportunity to adapt these innovative and enabling reforms . The SNG initiatives on innovation are designed on open principals of sharing its learnings , data and collaborate with any public sector entity working towards similar objectives . It is hoped that this innovation and modernization initiate by SNG in partnership with PRA will not only help Punjab raise its revenue for better services but will provide evidence , knowledge and know-how for other provinces to learn and replicate for sustainable development of our common future . <p> The writer is a social and economic policy expert and innovation lead at SNG

Seriously ! <p> Even in his childhood the 26-year-old had never fallen while playing ; he himself wonders how he never got scratches on his knees or elbows during school life , unlike almost every other child . The engineer by profession counts himself lucky that he never slipped while riding a bike on the bumpy and dilapidated roads of Karachi . The youngest among six siblings , he was brought up as " darling " of the family amid much care and fondness . <p> He encountered a particularly bad situation for the first and last time exactly a year ago . Zubair , along with 98 other people on board Airbus A320 on Pakistan International Airline 's flight 8303 crashed into the densely-populated neighbourhood of Model Colony -- hardly a couple of kilometres from Karachi airport . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 99 on board , Zubair was one of the two people who survived the deadly crash . He and senior banker Zafar Masud became headlines of the local and international media networks on May 22 , 2020 and were treated like celebrities after their miraculous stories of survival became known widely . <p> " I only remember a glimpse of light after regaining consciousness following the crash amid thick smoke , fire and distant noise of people shouting and yelling , " recalls Zubair . " I came out from one of the windows of the crashed plane and found myself on the rooftop of a home . Not fully in my senses , I finally found the stairs . I moved to the stairs and saw a man and a woman of the house running down the staircase . I joined them and finally came out of the street where the plane had crashed .

The 97 other persons are in fact reflections of the country 's typical red-tapism and justice system . <p> Just a day before Eid , the Karachi Press Club gives a reality check on this tragic fact . More than a dozen men and women , standing outside the club and carrying placards , panaflex posters with photographs of 97 lives lost in the crash and visibly shattered and aggrieved share their pain with media personnel . <p> For them , justice is still awaited .

" For us the most worrying among the conditions laid out before the families is that they can accept the compensation or insurance money only if they would not question the findings of the crash investigations or challenge them in any court of law , " he says . <p> The ruling Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf 's slogan of justice seems to be fading before the small number of people who are openly sharing what they have gone through in their experiences with the PIA and Civil Aviation Authority ( CAA ) managements since the May 22 tragedy . <p> The claims they are making are not mere allegations but should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vowed to bring reforms in the affairs of national flag carrier before it is too late .

And if it does , then that 's a government that we can work with . If it does n't , we wo n't , " Mr Blinken told Afghanistan 's Tolo news agency . <p> Asked if the US would recognise the Taliban government , he said : " That will depend entirely on what it does , not just on what it says . And the trajectory of its relationship with us and with the rest of the world will depend on its actions . " <p> On Tuesday , the Taliban announced an interim government dominated by the group 's old guard , with no women included . <p> Mohammad Hasan Akhund , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Omar , heads the new government . When Dawn sought the US State Department 's reaction to the interim government , a spokesperson said : " We have seen the announcement and are assessing it . We note the announced list of names consists exclusively of individuals who are members of the Taliban or their close associates and no women . " <p> The United States , the official said , was also " concerned by the affiliations and track records of some of the individuals " in the government . <p> The head of the interim cabinet -- Mullah Akhund -- is on a UN blacklist . Interior Minister Sirajuddin Haqqani is wanted by the American FBI . The FBI had offered a $5 million reward for information leading to Mr Haqqani 's arrest but on Tuesday it increased the reward to $10m . <p> " We understand that the Taliban has presented this as a caretaker cabinet . However , we will judge the Taliban by its actions , not words . We have made clear our expectation that the Afghan people deserve an inclusive government , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will continue to hold the Taliban to their commitments to allow safe passage for foreign nationals and Afghans with travel documents , including permitting flights currently ready to fly out of Afghanistan to agreed-upon onward destinations , " the official added . <p> " We also reiterate our clear expectation that the Taliban ensure that Afghan soil is not used to threaten any other countries and allow humanitarian access in support of the Afghan people . The world is watching closely . " <p> When the interviewer reminded Secretary Blinken that the Taliban were already violating the commitments they made , he said : " We will see ... whether it corrects course on any of these incidents of abusive conduct . That is going to be very important . " <p> Asked if the US knew about and facilitated President Ashraf Ghani 's escape from Afghanistan , he said he was on the phone with the president the night before he fled the country . <p> " He told me ... he was prepared to fight to the death .

@@88103231 <h> Discourse of a statesman <p> The virtual address to the UN General Assembly by Prime Minister Imran Khan undeniably was a conscience-rattling discourse wherein he , besides pleading for collective action to face the triple challenges of the Covid-19 pandemic , the accompanying economic melt-down and climate change , also took a swipe at the double standards on human rights shown by the big powers , particularly at Indian atrocities in Indian-Held Kashmir , expressed concern over the rising phenomenon of Islamophobia and urged the world to extend all possible support to the Taliban regime in Afghanistan to forestall the looming humanitarian crisis there , warning that abandoning the Afghan people could have disastrous consequences . <p> In regards to the conflict in Afghanistan over four decades , he rightly lamented the fact that in spite of Pakistan 's having been an ally against the Soviet Blitzkreig in Afghanistan , the USA pulled out after the war , leaving Pakistan to face the consequences . Then again in the War on Terror , despite sacrificing the lives of 80,000 Pakistanis , suffering a loss of $150 billion to its economy for being an ally of the USA , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ internally displaced persons with all the accompanying debilitating consequences , Pakistan is being blamed for the turn of events in Afghanistan by the USA . <h> Honestly speaking , the Prime Minister 's discourse indeed reflected his farsightedness and stature as a global statesman rather than a leader of the Third World country , who minced no words about the global realities and those responsible for it <p> - Advertisement - <p> The reality is that the accusations levelled against Pakistan are a deliberate attempt by the USA to portray it as a fall-guy to sweep under the carpet its own follies and failures in Afghanistan , the biggest being to foist a military solution and trying to set in motion a process of cultural change in a tribal society without understanding its dynamics and ground realities . In fact , the USA in a big way is responsible for the post-Soviet withdrawal events that saw the rise of terrorism and the use of Afghan territory by different terrorist entities , besides factional fighting between the Taliban and the Northern Alliance . The developing situation in Afghanistan is also a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out before a political settlement was reached between the Taliban and the Afghan government . <p> One can hardly contest his assessment of the likely humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan , the urgency of helping the Afghan people and the consequences of leaving them alone .

There is a huge humanitarian crisis looming ahead . And this will have serious repercussions not just for the neighbours of Afghanistan but everywhere . A destabilized , chaotic Afghanistan will again become a safe haven for international terrorists -- the reason why the US came to Afghanistan in the first place . There is only one way to go .

Pakistan has issued two dossiers to the international community in regards to human rights violation by Indian security forces , detailing Indian atrocities in Indian-Held Kashmir and its acts of state terrorism against Pakistan . <p> Imran Khan courageously castigated the double standards of the world community in regards to human rights in these words : " It is unfortunate , very unfortunate , that the world 's approach to violations of human rights lacks even-handedness , and even is selective . Geopolitical considerations , or corporate interests , commercial interests often compel major powers to overlook the transgressions of their affiliated ' countries " .

Dilating on how the issue became of international concern , he said , " In the aftermath of 9/11 terrorist attacks , terrorism has been associated with Islam by some quarters . This has increased the tendency of right-wing , xenophobic and violent nationalists , extremists and terrorist groups to target Muslims . " The world has seen some ugly manifestations of this phenomenon including the attack on mosques in New Zealand in which nearly 150 Muslims were massacred and the very recent attacks on Muslim families in Canada . The world urgently needs to pay attention to this development . <p> No person with a conscience and believing in humanitarian norms can contest his claim about India being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state policy .

" <p> - Advertisement - <p> No wonder then that a former Indian Prime Minister in an article published in The Hindu of 6 March 2020 had held the Modi government responsible for killing of 50 Muslims in Delhi when they were protesting against the Citizenship Amendment Bill and also accused it of turning India into a majoritarian state . <p> The triple challenges facing humanity mentioned by the Prime Minister in his address are of colossal magnitude beyond the prowess of any single nation to overcome and do need a collective action to ward off their cataclysmic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but as we have seen in the case of the Covid-19 pandemic , when the world failed to show solidarity and some countries even tried to extract political mileage from it .

To address the triple crisis of Covid pandemic , economic downturn , and climate emergency , we need a comprehensive strategy . "

In March 2021 , Pakis ? tan had reached an agreement with the Fund on granting autonomy to the central bank , which was also approved by the IMF board . <p> Pakistan 's economic team @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talks with the Fund officials to apprise them of the numerical strength of the ruling Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf in the lower and upper houses of parliament where the Constitution will be required to be amended to grant autonomy to the SBP . <p> On March 9 , the federal cabinet cleared a bill that was aimed at providing greater autonomy to the central bank over price control and fighting inflation . Autonomy was also linked with adopting exchange rates and monetary policy in an autonomous manner without the government 's interventions . Under the proposed law , no one will question the decisions of top officials of the SBP . <p> Soon after the decision , two leading opposition parties -- the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz and the Pakistan Peoples Party -- announced that they would block the passage of the bill in parliament . <p> Talking to the media in Islamabad today , Tarin said the matters had been settled with the IMF , however , " there is just one issue and we are seeking a legal opinion on it , while everything else is already agreed upon " . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that require constitutional amendments and such changes can not be effected because we lack a two-thirds majority in the parliament , " he told journalists . <p> When asked whether the amendments were related to the SBP , the adviser replied in the affirmative . <h> ' Inflation is a global issue ' <p> Commenting on growing inflation in the country , Tarin said inflation was a global issue , adding that " the prices of commodities in the world are not in my control " . <p> He stressed that the supply chain was affected due to the coronavirus pandemic , adding however that the economy was now " recovering " . <h> Pakistan-IMF agreement <p> In May 2019 , Pakistan had reached an agreement with the IMF after months of difficult negotiations on a $6bn bailout package , called the EFF .

@@88420233 <p> The writer is a senior research fellow at the Institute of Development and Economic Alternatives , and an associate professor of economics at Lums . <p> UNIVERSITY students from across Pakistan will be protesting today . One of their demands is for the recent fee hike to be taken back and for tuition fees and other educational expenses to be kept low . For the school sector the problem , not the solution , is simpler . Article 25A of the Constitution clearly states that all five- to 16-year-olds should have access to ' free ' education . They should not be charged for education , up to matriculation at least , under this article . <p> But providing quality education is expensive . Buildings , infrastructure , teachers , materials and management cost a lot . The cost of each item is higher if minimum quality standards are to be observed . If public-sector schools can not charge students for costs , the government/ society must find a way to pay the cost of education . For now , the government pays all expenses . But schools are severely underfunded so the provision is at a significant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of education . <p> For better access , as Article 25A stipulates , we 'll have to increase funding for the education sector significantly . The same applies if we want to improve the quality . Not every rupee of the current allocation for education is being spent in the most efficient way , but even if all the wastage and poor allocations were to be remedied , we would still need more resources to provide for all children who are out of school and for ensuring better-quality provision for all who are and will be in school . Society must acknowledge this if 25A and ' Education for All ' are to be a goal . <p> At the university level , the argument gets more complex . There is no ' right ' to university education in Pakistani law . We need many university-educated people for sustainable growth of the economy . University education also provides significant private returns so it is understandable that several young people want university degrees . But these arguments are not rights-based arguments . They are arguments about the instrumentality of higher education @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to keep higher education costs low ? <p> The private returns argument ( if I get a degree I can have higher returns in the future which will be good for my family and me ) does n't give much support for public funding of university education . Why should the state fund a person for his or her private gains ? The state will have an interest if private returns to a person create some public returns for society too . The argument will have to be on the basis that having more university educated people allows Pakistan to have better human resources across all work sectors , makes higher and sustainable growth possible , improves the quality of life , and possibly , has benefits on the side of governance too . These arguments will justify subsidising education to ensure society gets the benefits mentioned . <p> In particular , if we feel that people should have opportunities based on potential and merit , and not their ability to pay , thus making higher education accessible to people who ca n't afford to pay for it , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this still does not mean that every person who can , should have access to higher education . The instrumental arguments do not establish rights and do not cover all people who fall in a particular age or education level category . <p> How do we then see the students ' demand to keep higher education costs low ? It is a complex issue . Higher education is even more expensive to provide than school education . For sciences , laboratories are a major expense . For all subjects , faculty salary is the biggest ticket item . At higher education levels , research becomes an integral part of education provision and funding for it demands a significant proportion of funds too . If universities can not charge students , where will they get the money from ? Higher education funding for the last three years or so has n't increased . In some years , in fact , funding has decreased . So , how do we square the circle ? <p> Inflationary pressures have also been eroding the power of budgets set in nominal terms . Faculty and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staff salaries do not keep pace with inflationary pressures and the opportunity costs of being at a particular university or in academia in general , people start leaving and this has an impact on the quality of provision : we do want the very best teachers and researchers we can get . <p> It is unlikely that philanthropy will fill the gap for subsidising quality education for all ( school level ) and for those who have potential/ merit ( university level ) . Philanthropy , though not insubstantial in Pakistan , is mainly not through formalised channels . The share of education is also not too large and very little of it , even out of the amount that goes towards education , is for higher learning . Currently , we do not have a significant local funding base for research . Most research funding for now comes from the university 's own funds , HEC or overseas donors . <p> Quality education for every child up to matriculation or intermediate and for those who have the merit/ potential to attend university and contribute to national development is important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of poverty in Pakistan and overall income distribution , most parents can not pay for it . The state has taken on the responsibility of giving quality education to all children for the first 10 years . But it is not giving priority to this goal even now . Higher education too remains severely underfunded even when only a small number of those who should be getting higher education are doing so . And it seems the state has no intention of increasing funding for education in the near future . We seem to be in a poor equilibrium and there seems to be no way out of it for now . So , all children will not get education , and compromises on quality , for those who are in schools and universities , will continue . <p> The writer is a senior research fellow at the Institute of Development and Economic Alternatives , and an associate professor of economics at Lums. 
@@88528236 <p> Information Minister Fawad Chaudhry on Tuesday warned of an impending gas crisis in the country , saying the resource was depleting fast and " Pakistan will have no gas in years to come . " <p> Addressing a post-cabinet meeting press conference , the minister raised alarm over gas going scarce in the country and said it was depleting by 9 per cent every year for the last two years . <p> " Gas is available in big cities to 23pc people at subsidised rates and its burden is being borne by 78pc people in other parts of the country who rely on LPG , coal and other means , " the minister said . <p> Chaudhry stressed that people getting gas at cheaper rates in big cities should now change their habits . " This trend will not continue for long anymore " . <p> He said the government would have to restructure its gas system to ensure to equal supply to everyone . <p> The minister said an uninterrupted supply of gas to industries also resulted in sizable urea production . <p> He also informed that a Sugar Sector Reform Committee report was being released today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the government 's role in price-fixing .
