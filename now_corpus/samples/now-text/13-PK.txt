@@4581235 <h> Email <p> A family friend from old times recently visited me in Lahore . They come from a remote Punjab village where they own 25 acres of land , that is a murabba in local measure , and are considered well to do . My family is their only direct contact in Lahore . But let me make it clear that we are not the ' reason ' for which they need to connect with this city . We only serve as a conduit for their relationship as we offer a transit-type facility to their actual destination -- that is Daata Sahab , the shrine of the famous 11th century saint of Lahore . <p> There were times when this family would visit the darbar annually or even more . But of late , they prefer giving me a ring asking to offer a daig of food to the poor there on their behalf . I would oblige . You do that when you are either in distress or feel blessed . So through their visits and phone requests , I had always known what thick and thin that family went through . <p> They visited Lahore and offered a number of daigs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their grandson , however , they preferred to use my dial-a-daig service . One of their child 's serious illness deserved a visit and a floral wreath and when five of their buffaloes died of a mysterious disease , they offered one daig each for their remaining beloved animals . My children could not understand why would anyone do that and in fact found it too funny . <p> A few months back they visited Lahore to buy some spare parts for their ailing tractor and as per routine did go to the darbar for a salaam . But last week , when they told me that they are coming again , I was not expecting that their next visit would come so soon . I was a bit surprised as the reason for their visit was not a compelling one too . Whatever , I shrugged , they are a good company and why should I mind another can of desi ghee ! <p> They did not want me to drive them to the Daata darbar this time . They instead opted to take the brand new Metro @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would know the secret of their visit . They have always made me see this city from an angle that I myself was unable to discover . This time they were finding the city too hot to handle . They were overjoyed by the bus service and described their experience with such an effervescent zeal that it left me astonished . I had not yet bothered to take a trip on this latest wonder act of the Punjab Chief Minister , probably thinking that reading through a few skeptic media reviews is all I needed to do . But my friend just needed a lame excuse to travel all the way from his village to enjoy the ride . <p> When I hesitantly put forward some of the economic and policy pitfalls of the project , he ignored me as if he was n't listening at all and continued his alif laila with the same sparkling eyes and exuberance . I was forced to shun my views and listen to him . <p> He compared his Lahore bus experience with his lone travelling experience abroad when he had briefly accompanied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vegetables . That was his only brush with ' modernity ' and the two experiences matched each other well -- the flyovers , the underpasses , the moving staircases , I mean the escalators , etc . But he did not solely rely on his only encounter with the modern world . <p> He had put together an imaginary collage of a modern city , drawing heavily from his visual exposures to European cities via the daily dose of TV and thanks to films . The bus service struck a chord with these images as well . So when he would tell me " when in Dubai , I had seen " or " did you watch in that TV serial " , he anticipated that Dubai or the TV serial city have come to Lahore and this ' escalator ' gave him butterflies in stomach . <p> I learned that he was n't jealous of Lahore as would some opponents of the project want us to believe . He often complained about his ' wretched ' village life and blamed his nonchalant attitude and agrarian lethargy for his remaining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make a few attempts to come out of the slumber but it did n't work . Maybe he found the economic security offered by that murabba too dear to risk for some uncertain dividends of a business . But his continuous grumbling about his status showed that he always longed for something better . <p> His eldest son did not do well in school and now partners him in farming but he is sure that the younger one will soon make it to a college , preferably in Lahore . Does he see Lahore as the destiny of his next generation ? But who knows what the chhota Chaudhry will eventually turn into . I think his relationship with this city is not selfish . Whether or not he wishes to take a residence here himself or for his next generation , he owns the city -- as a source of fascination . <p> The bus service has made the city sexier and its fascination more fatal . The ability to help people dream of a better tomorrow is the most potent of the political potions . It has magical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and bestow a leader with what they call charisma . <p> The Punjab Chief Minister has been desperate for a place in ' the hearts and minds ' of Punjabis from day one in office . He thought that his sasti-roti scheme will be a hit with the poor but it did n't click . His daanish schools could not do the trick either . But by casting the modern city dream in concrete , has he finally hit the jackpot ? <p> We have yet to witness how much of this ' awe ' is finally converted into the real political currency -- the ballot . But an awe-struck electorate is bad news for his opponents .

@@4581236 @ @ in Pakistan <h> Muhammad Annus <p> Wednesday , March 20 , 2013 - Unemployment is one of the biggest problems of Pakistan . Even a person unemployed who has ability to do work and is willing to do work is unable to get job opportunity . In the current situation more than 30 lac people are unemployed in Pakistan and unemployment ratio is more than 12/I want to share the reasons because of which the rate of unemployment in Pakistan is very high . <p> The higher growth rate of population is the major cause of unemployment in Pakistan . the resources of the country are limited . Karachi is the biggest industrial base of Pakistan , but the investors are reluctant to invest there because of unrest and violence . Our educational system is also responsible for increasing unemployment rate among the educated youth . The attitude of our youth towards the choice of the career is unrealistic and unproductive . Rapid mechanization and computer technology is also causing unemployment . Millions of the people in Pakistan are poor and due to poverty people are over burdened with expenditures and their savings are low . Current international financial crisis is one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole world . <p> This crisis originated from the banking sector of USA , UK and some European countries and is now a global phenomena . Political instability , bad law and order situation , army ? s interference , bomb blasts , terrorism , inconsistent economic policies etc are the factors which are disturbing domestic and foreign investment . Pakistan investors are taking away their money to Dubai and other countries of the world . Baseless allegations of terrorism has tarnished the image at international level . so in the current scenario Pakistan has limited job opportunities in other countries of the world . Concluding , I would like to suggest that with proper economic planning , consistent policies of government , better law and order situation , overcoming energy crisis , sincerity with Pakistan and by adopting the Islamic economic system . we can not only tackle the issue of unemployment but every economic problem of our country as well .

At least , three small political groups exist in Swabi . One of these groups has a meager existence in one of provincial assembly constituencies . These groups are the Awami Jamhoori Ittehad , the Swabi Qaumi Mahaz and the Pakistan Patriotic Party .

A panel of the Pakistan National Accreditation Council , consisting of ulema and government officials , had approved of the creation of Pakistan Halal Product Development Board , on December 20 , 2011 , for the purpose , but it has yet to see the light of day . During the last five years , several seminars and conferences were held on ways to promote halal exports but without tangible results . Pakistan remains almost absent in the halal market . <p> The level of halal awareness among businessmen is quite scant .

But in trade there are no assumptions and the importers and buyers ask for halal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ halal exports for South Asia if the government fulfils the requirements of consumers regarding halal certification . The country is located closer to the Middle East than any of its three biggest competitors , namely , Australia , Brazil and India , which pay higher shipping costs to reach these export markets as compared to Pakistan . <p> Several Pakistani companies have , of late , begun entering the red meat business but the biggest challenge before them is of regulatory nature . They must meet the requirement of meat importing nations of observing strict health codes for the safety of the meat , including traceability of the meat of any diseased animal to the exact location that it came from , so that the entire herd it was a part of can be slaughtered . This is something that is absent in Pakistan . The government has not yet created a regulatory agency that could catalogue the country 's animal population .

Halal products are also seen as a potential engine of economic growth with an annual turnover of billions of dollars globally . <p> Halal meat is one of the fastest growing markets . In recent years , halal beef imports in the Middle East and Southeast Asia alone grew by over 18.2 per cent a year . Pakistan 's share in these imports has been hardly three per cent . Currently Pakistan exports meat to Saudi Arabia , UAE and other Gulf and Asian countries but it is not halal certified . Today , halal concept covers all the food and non-food products and also services . Before halal gained market status , this term was used for animal and poultry meat only . <p> Since halal label has become a symbol of good quality , products carrying this label are in great demand not only among Muslim states and expatriates but even among non-Muslims . The manufacturers in the West saw a great potential of profits in the halal products which has now moved beyond raw meat . Today , almost all goods and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ services are available as certified halal . <p> It is not just the rise in the number of Muslim consumers in non-Muslim countries that has made halal a big business . It is the global nature of the food industry itself . Around 80 per cent of the halal food industry is in the hands of non-Muslims . Brazilians have been big halal producers for decades . Brazil exports one million frozen halal chickens to 100 countries and more than 300,000 tonnes of halal beef products to Saudi Arabia , GCC , Egypt and Iran annually . Three-quarters of chickens exported by French firms are halal . Supermarket chains have separate halal lines . So , one sees an ever-growing demand for halal meat across the globe , in stores , restaurants and fast food chains . <p> In Europe , the market for halal foods is estimated at $66 billion with France having the largest share at $17 billion .

United States is the third largest beef exporter in the world and more than 80 per cent of its frozen beef is halal . New Zealand is the fourth largest beef exporter and 40 per cent of its beef products are halal . <p> India became the world 's top exporter of beef in 2012 but its beef is not of cow origin but of buffalo which is considered inferior and is low-priced . India no longer exports cow beef and hence is out of the global beef market after a 2005 Indian Supreme Court ruling that upheld a ban on cow slaughter as constitutional .

However , demand for Indian buffalo 's meat is on the rise in Gulf , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because of certainty of its being halal . <p> The current estimated Muslim population is around 1.4 billion and it is growing at the rate of 2.9 per cent annually and is expected to be 30 per cent of the world 's total population by 2025 .

@@4589236 <h> Why we need to bring nature back into cities <p> Modern cities create vast quantities of waste . But rather than causing a crisis , could these overflowing landfills help create urban landscapes of the future ? In the third of Building Tomorrow 's expert viewpoints , urban designer Mitchell Joachim looks at ways our trash can be turned into treasure . Cities were invented for a multitude of purposes . First was the need for the concentration of vital resources in a given region -- then came their role as places for worship , trade , governmental control and military defence . But in our modern age , urban spaces were conceived and shaped primarily around mass market industrialisation . Today the consequences of the post-industrial city have had an incredible impact on the environment . It is widely accepted cities impinge on areas well beyond their borders . Waste streams in cities are the leading factor in pollution of the areas outside their geo-political boundaries . Urban waste must be reconfigured -- our time has run out . Reports of garbage problems from Naples in Italy to Beijing in China underscore the size of the problem . Landfills are filled and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We must have a new strategy towards refuse in urban places , one that includes the design of consumables in the first place . Many concepts exist already , but what are some of the most radical solutions to our wasteful ways ? Recently , the planet reached 400 parts per million of carbon in the atmosphere for the first time since modern humans evolved . Reversing such wasteful habits will require tremendous effort , as minuscule changes will not alter this course . Humanity has reached its peak of one-way consumption . Now is the time to design waste to regenerate our cities . What are the possibilities for urban environments after our aged infrastructure is recalibrated ? How might bigger cities and waste mix ? One key idea is that waste is not recycled through infrastructural mechanisms but instead up-cycled in perpetuity . Super-sized waste The first credible step is to reduce trash by considering the life cycle of objects we make . Things that are designed for obsolescence should be outlawed . Additionally , products must be manufactured with the intent to reuse , disassemble , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tossing out bottles we could adapt them for use as planters , lighting fixtures , building wall elements . Other cities have highly organised systems to solve these problems . In Zurich , the city requires individuals pay handsomely for waste that is simply discarded , while thorough recycling is encouraged by free citywide collection services . Therefore well over 90% of municipal waste inside Zurich is recycled and sent to incinerators to produce energy . Burning waste is not the answer but it does have opportunities in the mid-term . It requires substantial need for enforceable regulations , comprehensive industry controls , economic feasibility plans , and the latest ultra-expensive technology such as plasma gasification plants . In similarly developed cities -- Malmo , Tokyo , or Copenhagen -- it makes sense to use a waste-to-energy processes . These prevailing urban populations are stable and easily taxed to support such a system -- not so easy in developing cities such as Lagos or Jakarta . Outreach programs that invite the public to observe civic waste systems as a spectacle are instrumental in spreading awareness . The Hangzhou Environmental Group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ landfill facility . Freshkills landfill in New York will be transformed into the largest public park in over 100 years that will showcase engineered nature from waste . Cuba , an island nation that has been cut-off from trade imports , has conserved almost everything through carful recycling of parts -- from 1950 's cars to eyeglasses , nothing is wasted . ' Smart trash ' How could this work ? Outsized automated 3-D printers could be modified to rapidly process trash and to complete the task within decades . These potential automatons would be entirely based on existing techniques commonly used in industrial waste compaction devices . To accomplish this job , nothing drastically new needs to be invented . Most technologies are intended to be off-the-shelf . Instead of machines that crush objects into cubes , compaction devices could benefit from adjustable jaws that would craft simple shapes into smart ' puzzle blocks ' for assembly . The blocks of waste material could be predetermined , using computational geometries , in order to fit domes , archways , lattices , windows , or whatever patterns would be needed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for fenestration , organic compounds for temporary decomposable scaffolds , metals for primary structures and so on . Eventually , the future city would make no distinction between waste and supply . The envisioned city would be derived from trash ; not ordinary trash , but ' smart refuse ' . A significant factor of the city composed from smart refuse is ' post-tuning ' -- and we would have to adapt this raw material for use . Integration into the city texture would be a learning process .

The young actor who played Ramchand , Syed Fazal Hussain made his debut as Ramchand . Javed Jabbar wrote and produced the film , while Mohammad Ahmed wrote the screenplay . The film had a memorable soundtrack , which also introduced new versions of the following classics , Mai Bhaagi 's ' Khari Neem Ke Neechey ' , Allan Fakir 's ' Tarrin Paunda ' and Mohammad Jumman 's ' Yaar Dhaadi ' in the film 's soundtracks . These tracks were original versions in terms of the music and singer 's voice but their sound quality had been improved digitally .

It was released on May 7 , 2010 . The film was directed by Pankaj Batra and starred Pakistani actors Noman Aijaz and Mehreen Raheel , as well as Indian actors such as Gulshan Grover , Arya Babbar , Kanwaljeet Singh and Aparna Sharma .

Although unlike Mansoor 's previous venture Khuda Kay Liye , Bol 's music score left much to be desired . Bol is a particularly important film for Pakistani cinema for three other reasons . Firstly , it broke all records at the local box office , previously held by My Name is Khan , starring Shah Rukh Khan and Kajol . Secondly , the film was important in the sense that budding filmmakers studying in the film department of the renowned National College of Arts ( NCA ) , Lahore assisted Mansoor on this film . Thirdly , the film maintained its box office success abroad , when it was released in India , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Australia about two months after its release in Pakistan .

Apart from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used to describe a new movement in French cinema in the 1950s , when a group of filmmakers -- many of them former film critics -- ushered in revolutionary approaches to conceiving , producing and making films . <p> The movement itself was the coming of age of the cinematic form itself , and similar ' New Waves ' were described in Iran , Mexico , Portugal , Brazil , Czechoslovakia and even Hollywood . <p> Unfortunately , much like Che Guevara going from an icon of revolution to a popular T-shirt , the term New Wave is now loosely used in any film industry whenever a clutch of films challenging the orthodoxy are released in quick succession . The problem with such usage is that it ignores the fact that a moment like the coming of a ' New Wave ' occurs as part of a crescendo of changes not just in films , but also more generally in society , culture and the arts . <p> So , can we begin to speak of any new waves in Pakistan 's much-lamented film industry ? There is a great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even with a barely functioning film industry , Pakistanis are voracious fans of cinema . The fact that we now have a slow but steady drip of new , Pakistani films has stoked the appetite of cinephiles all over the land . <p> But perhaps it is too soon to be trumpeting any New Waves , mainly because there is little orthodox tradition left to be challenged , and also because the current surge in films is more a consequence of technical , commercial and infrastructural changes than any new ideology . That said , it would be callous to downplay this moment as well , because what we are witnessing is worthy of appreciation . <p> So instead of a New Wave , or the even more abused term Revival , let me christen this moment the Return of Cinema to Pakistan . To catalogue and understand this Return , I spoke to four directors about their films and their ambitions , to try and see what we can expect on our screens in the coming months . <p> -- <p> Bilal Lashari was one of the last entrants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Pakistan . A range of directors , often armed with film degrees from abroad , took advantage of Pakistan 's evergreen music scene as well as the arrival of a multitude of new channels , equipment and technical staff to usher in a flurry of creativity . <p> However , as the stakes and the commercial potential of the electronic media continued to rise , many of these directors moved over to the cash cow of shooting advertisements and commercials . It is here that Lashari chose to buck the trend by throwing himself headfirst into making a film . <p> When I spoke to him , he had spent the past 18 months working without break . During this time , he had already spurned a host of lucrative opportunities to makes ads or return to music videos , and in a way had put his entire reputation at stake . It was little surprise then that the word he used to sum up his experiences was ' sacrifice ' . <p> Thankfully for him though , Bilal 's debut film ' Waar ' is set to premiere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ September . Starring Shaan in the lead role , it is a tale of counterterrorism and militancy . <p> When I first heard of this premise , I was cautious . For starters , Bilal 's music videos had always struck me as being technically and aesthetically superb , but guilty of wearing foreign influences too heavily . Jal 's award winning Sajni his narrative was very much from the Grimm Brothers , while Mekaal Hasan Band 's Chal Bulleya brought in the seven sins , a concept not readily accessible in the local context . <p> Moreover , there had been rumors of investments by American studios and funding by the ISPR , and I had feared that a bright , young director was unwittingly going to churn out a propaganda piece . <p> But Bilal 's response to these questions belied a director tired of batting away such suggestions . <p> " The film is shot in a realistic ( translation : non-South Asian ) style , and is at its heart an action movie . It 's not about the Army , and it has not been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is actually about a police officer , and is meant to entertain above all else . " <p> And what about the ISPR funding ? " In order to go shoot at some of the locations we needed to , we had to enlist the Army 's help . There is no way of accessing those locations otherwise , and that 's true for anyone in the industry . " <p> In essence , Bilal 's background and the premise of this film does n't suggest some searing indictment of our counterterrorism policy , but it does suggest the arrival of a modern action flick , set in a suitably fantastical yet cinematically appropriate context -- and not a moment too soon . <p> -- <p> Coming in around the same time as Bilal 's Waar will be Meenu Gaur and Farjad Nabi 's Zinda Bhaag . The two directors though are quite atypical in terms of their background when the Pakistani scene is considered , but that may well be their strongest advantage . <p> Farjad and Meenu have been part of Matteela Films , and have been making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the history of the food available in Karachi . <p> Their decision to make a film was both a result of their passion for cinema , but also an attempt to identify and revitalize the existing Pakistani film tradition . Their primary impulse was to make a film not only organic to the local scene , but also one that sought to move past the creative stifling that had marred the industry . <p> Farjad spoke about how the story -- about a group of young Pakistanis trying to immigrate abroad through dubious means -- was begging to be made . " These tales -- which all of us hear from relatives and acquaintances -- were so remarkable that all you needed to do was put them on the screen and it became cinema . " <p> Fascinatingly , the two embarked on a process which was closest to the tradition of European auteur directors , although one they felt arose more out of production exigencies than artistic sensibilities . They hired non-professionals with lives very similar to the characters , threw them into intensive workshops , and filmed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As Meenu explained , the film became a text informed by the efforts of the entire crew . <p> The obstacles they faced did not come from the censors or distributors . Instead , the film 's producer Mazhar Zaidi spoke of a missing political economy , a lack of infrastructure . The few cameras in the country go to advertisements , the equipment for dubbing sound or processing film does n't exist , and technical crew has to be flown in from abroad . When Zinda Bhaag enlisted an Indian rather than a Far Eastern crew , it had to face the inevitable India-bashing that many of us revel in . <p> But by making this film , they have set up a template for not only what a Pakistani film can look like , but also how to make one . <p> -- <p> Lastly , I spoke to Jami , a name that looms large over the visual history of the past decade or so . One of the country 's most popular and acclaimed directors , his films have been rumors floating in the ether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the vision and expertise needed to create THE Pakistani film . So why has n't that happened yet ? <p> Speaking to Jamshed Mehmood , as he is also known , I felt a theme developing . If Bilal is the l'enfant terrible and Meenu and Farjad the wise , grounded aesthetes , then Jami is a gentle yet powerful patriarch , involved as much in making films as he is in setting up an industry . <p> In his 15 or so years , he has been able to set up a creative economy , training new people and introducing new equipment and infrastructure . His team has been involved in Zinda Bhaag , Extortionist , Rafina and Josh the film , as well as his own two efforts Morqaye and Downward Dog . <p> He was laughing when he explained how setting up the infrastructure for sound recording and mastering was like building an Airbus plane , and insisted that it was far better that it took all this time to set up the industry 's basics , so that its creative potential could be realized . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ industry will follow the Bollywood item-number fish market , and crazy sleaze will fly as the likes of construction companies start producing films . But we have enough directors and talent to keep alternative cinema alive through that , which is my basic hope . " <p> Jami 's two films are diverse and terribly exciting . Morqaye is an epic journey of a Pakistani railway station master and his family , while Downward Dog is a black and white film noir set in the Karachi of the future . Incredibly , the two films almost bankrupted the successful filmmaker before he managed to find producers for himself . After such a long wait though , it seems that the time for the harvest is nigh . <p> -- <p> Perhaps now it is clearer why we should be referring to a Return when we speak of these films , as well as the others coming to our screens . They do n't have a lot in common in style or ambition , and are not part of some conscious social thought either . <p> But what they are doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , larger-than-life action hero , we need a film that can amplify rather than reject our film tradition , we need a daring vision to be backed up by skilled creative personnel . We need all these things to create a cohesive sense of identity for Pakistani cinema , one that can create the bedrock upon which future , newer waves can crash upon . The journey is a long one , but Pakistani cinema is now beginning to walk down it . <p> Zinda Bhaag , set to be released in August , uncovers the realities of the youth of Pakistan , their ' hopes and dreams ' of running off to the West , and really starting their lives or so they believe . <p> The film centres around three young men whose efforts to escape their realities turn out in an unexpected way . Illegal immigration being their main path to ' destiny ' , Zinda Bhaag also highlights issues which arise as a result of that . <p> With the colourful background of Lahore , the trailer gives off a vibrant yet tacky vibe .

With a director like Shehzad Rafique , a movie that seems to depict a powerful message is not a surprise . <p> Alongside Rafique , the film was produced by Shafquat Chauhdry . <p> The film features many of Pakistan 's film industry 's great actors such as Shaan Shahid , Zara Sheikh , Ahsan Khan , Humaima Malik , Meera , Saima , Wiam Dahmani and Inam Khan . <p> The movie is known to be releasing on Eid , as are many other anticipated products of Pakistan 's regenerated film industry . -Text by Safa Gangat <p> After going through a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its post-production stage . <p> The plot is adopted from the Anthony Schaffer 's 1970 stage play , Sleuth , but the filmmakers did not disregard the taste of the local audience and it was made keeping the viewers in mind . <p> With a Western background , viewers must be curious as to how close the movie will be the actual culture of Lahore but Steve Moore , the British director says , " The changes that we have made to the original story of Sleuth are very culture- based ; I could have never made these in America . " <p> The story is set in modern-day Lahore where a young man 's struggles in accepting feudal dominance is shown and the different stages he has to go through to pass the ' test ' that is set forth to him by the elderly wealthy man whose wife he wants to marry . <p> Judging by the trailer , the production and cinematography of the film are one that Pakistani viewers and fans of the noir genre will be happy to see . <p> Producer Sarah Tareen said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is no proper network in the film industry .

The movie claims to change how we recognise and perceive events taking place around us . <p> Considering it is a spy film with an intense subject matter , the plot reflects the corruption in Pakistan as well as the terrorism that the country undergoes on a daily basis . <p> Zeba Bakhtiar is the Executive producer and Azaan Sami Khan , the producer .

Having failed to nibble into Pakistan 's integrity through the Baloch separatists , strategists have now turned their eyes on the north-western areas of Pakistan . To support their hypotheses , they have revisited 500 years history of the area ; linked it to the pre-dominantly Pashtun resistance on both sides of Durand Line , internal instability and the aspirations of the people of KPK for a meaningful change through MMA , ANP and now PTI . The bottom line is that they want ' peace ' . As mentioned in the article , " Voila !

The absence of an inviolable international border along AfPak lends credence to this threat . The essay in no way challenges the patriotism of the majority of Pathans living in KPK and Fata .

The roots of the dispute emerged in 1837 , rather than 1947 . " According to Yasser Latif Hamdani , a modern historian , that 1947 was a new beginning of the great game with Gandhi , Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan ( Bacha Khan ) and Jamiat-e-Ulema-Hind at one end and Quaid-i-Azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah at the other , tugging the rope to claim NWFP and tribal areas . The Afghan government had laid claim to Fata and NWFP since 1944 .

According to Khalid Aziz , Pakistan for a long time has pursued a hermit policy that sometimes benefits and sometimes hurts others . Benazir Bhutto 's quest to bring an end to it in 1996 resulted in her ouster . Pakistan 's obsession with this single focal policy is oblivious to realities of internal and international stability .

Nor is this index infallible . One of the areas that the index rates India relatively well is ' Access to credit ' using its own framework to make that assessment . However the Indian government realized that access to credit for SMBs has declined ( what can you expect when fiscal deficit increases and government pays good interest for practically riskfree investments ) as one of the causes for the slowdown in India . So one should use this information for self improvement RATHER THAN gloating about it or demeaning someone else . <p> In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with actual investments as seen by the fact that FDI in Pakistan in 2012-13 was around $650 million and in India was $22.5 billion .

A taxpayer had to make 47 payments a year , consumed 577 hours to pay taxes and on average paid 34.7% of his profit in taxes . Blockquote This is corporate taxation , not individual . Corporate tax was around 35% <p> And this is what the so-called democratically elected governments have given Pakistan . I like Musharraf 's democracy much better . It was thousand times better for Pakistan in every way . Now we have looters , cheaters , and the incompetent running the affairs , so what else would one expect but results like this .

@@4605233 <p> Syed Noor discusses the trajectory of Pakistani film industry and aspires to see a more positive role of the government in its revival . PHOTO : PUBLICITY <p> LAHORE : <p> On the heels of the success of two local new-age cinema projects , interest in Pakistani films has considerably increased . Upholding the rising fervour surrounding the revival of cinema in the country , the Pak-US Alumni Network ( Lahore Chapter ) organised a seminar on October 26 in the cultural capital . The event , which took place at the Pakistan College of Law , was graced with the presence of leading names in cinema -- Syed Noor , Shehzad Rafique and Chaudhry Kamran . <p> The discussion , titled Seminar on Revival of Pakistani Cinema and Film Industry , shed light on the general perception of cinema in the Pakistani society and the political restraints that it has had to bear in the country . " The decline of cinema was constant because in our society , getting involved in films was discouraged , " said Syed Noor . For instance , actor Shah Zaman Khan ( Sudhir ) , known as the first action hero of Pakistani cinema , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family , out of the fear that his parents would hurt or disown him . " I always say that you will never see a father encourage his child to join the film industry . This is the standard mindset , " he added . <p> Noor feels that the stigma attached to the film industry in Pakistan has been aggravated by policies that have dominated the state . The political regimes of the country , he believes , have been an obstacle in the way of the success of Pakistani cinema . He is skeptical of General Ziaul Haq 's term ; although Punjabi cinema emerged to the forefront during his time , cinema on the whole underwent a structural demise . <p> Concurring with Noor , Wajiha Raza Rizvi , the director of the Film Museum Society , traced the decline of cinema back to Zia 's era , during which the industry saw a 50% drop in its releases . In constrast , General Yahya Khan 's tenure witnessed the highest box office collections , with nearly 114 films made in a year . <p> Producer-director Shehzad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believes that both democratic and martial law regimes have failed to improve the environment for film-making . " What we really need is a people-friendly government . The dictatorial governments were only concerned with their own agendas ; Zia marketed his rule under the banner of Islam , which had a huge social impact on how film was perceived , " he stated . <p> Adding to the discussion on the demise of the industry , Noor asserted that the absence of financiers resulted in film-makers turning to illegal activities and earning black money . The lack of funds , coupled with dependence on black money , furthered cinema 's deterioration . Noor aspires to see the state employ a more positive role , similar to the one of Iranian government , which founded the Farabi Cinema Foundation . " We could do something like Iran , which has had to face similar issues as far as its film industry is concerned . The Iranian government offered to provide incentives and infrastructure to their film-makers to make good films .

Earlier , there were no academies , worshops and other learning avenues for film . Today , what can be considered a favourable turn , institutes such as National College of Arts , Beaconhouse National University and now , the Forman Christian College in Lahore , have introduced film departments . In fact , Noor himself runs a film academy . <p> Commending Noor for his resilience and indomitable will , Rafique said , " I remember when I graduated from university , it was a huge gamble to pursue film-making as a full-time profession . But during that time , I remember that Noor sahab was one person who had enough focus and vision to survive . He has laid the foundation of the work that is being done today . " With recent box office successes such as Waar , things have changed .

It is time for the old guards to shup up and retire , this new wave of independent film makers like JOSH ... LAMHA .... ZINDA BAAG have proven that they can make films that people relate to and the technical skills of not over acting , crappy artificial sets were not the only source to tell a story they used the natural harsh beauty of Pakistan to highlight their projects.So goodbye and do nt let the door hit you old Lollywood ! <p> @Fawad : Punjabi movies are not made for low grade people and shame on you for such comments .

@@4605234 <p> Crowd funding is a new phenomenon that emerged from the USA and now becoming a popular way of funding small and medium enterprises in a number of countries . DESIGN : ESSA MALIK <p> LONDON : <p> Like other countries , developed and developing alike , there has been huge emphasis on financial inclusion in Pakistan . A number of institutions ( including charities and other businesses in the services and utilities sector ) are using electronic media to raise and transfer money as part of their payments or credit systems . Many businesses , however , continue to use traditional channels to raise investments from general public , primarily in an unregulated way . One recent example of failure of regulation has been in the form of Mudaraba business scam in Pakistan , which caused investors to lose billions of rupees after being lured into investing in reportedly very lucrative businesses that were presented to financially unsophisticated general public . <p> Given the improvement in technology , there is a need to look into some traditional forms of savings and loan businesses with a view to regulating them for the benefit of all the stakeholders . Crowd funding is a new phenomenon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way of funding small and medium enterprises in a number of countries . In Pakistan , " committee " system has existed for long to pool funds to save together and help members of the committee to have access to interest-free loans for a variety of purposes , primarily for household consumption but also for businesses and projects . It is interesting to see how this traditional form of savings can be used to develop a powerful financial inclusion tool in Pakistan . <p> In informal sectors , there are different types of " committees , " one of them being a " lucky committee . " Although there are different variants of lucky committees in practice , all of them have the following common features : <p> First , a group of people contributes money to a common pool on a frequent basis ( daily , weekly , monthly etc . ) ; <p> Second , a draw takes place with the same frequency as that of the monetary contributions ; Then one lucky member of the group whose name or number is drawn successfully receives a fixed amount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ common pool of contributions for the period for which the draw takes place ; once a person wins , they cease to contribute further amounts for the period of the committee ; other members of the group continue until their names are drawn successfully ; the committee is wound up when all members of the group have received a fixed amount . <p> This is an interesting arrangement , as no one in the group suffers a total loss of the capital contributed by them . Everyone does receive a fixed amount , although some receive more than what they contribute and others receive less than their contributions . For example , if there are 100 members of the group each contributing Rs100 on a weekly basis , the total weekly contributions amount to Rs10,000 . The total duration of such a lucky committee is 100 weeks . Normally the " lucky pot " is less than the amount collected . For simplicity , we assume that the lucky pot is Rs5,000 , which is received by every winning member . Thus the winner in week 1 receives Rs5,000 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other hand receives Rs5,000 , while they must have contributed Rs10,000 by that time . This actually means that all those who win in the first half of the duration of the lucky committee receive more than what they contribute while those who win in the second half contribute more than what they receive . <p> Another committee arrangement , mostly used by business people for their working capital financing , involves bidding for the committee pool . It works like this : <p> A group of traders and other businessmen agree to contribute a fixed amount on a frequent basis ; <p> The pooled money is bid by the individual members on a frequent basis ; The frequency of bidding may differ from the frequency of contributions ( e.g. , the contributions may be made on a daily basis while the bidding may take place on a weekly basis ) ; The member who is willing to receive the lowest amount wins and claims the discounted pool ; the successful bidders do not have any further right of bidding ( i.e. , they can receive money only once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contribute to the pool for the duration of the committee ; once all the committee members have claimed the pool money , the committee ceases to exist . <p> For example , a group of 50 traders and businessmen enters into a " working capital committee " to contribute Rs1,000 on a daily basis to bid at the end of the week for the amount pooled for seven days ( which should be Rs350,000 ) . Those members of the group , who are looking for cash for their business bid for the pool . The bidding may start from a slightly discounted figure of say Rs345,000 . The member who is most desperate to receive the money will be willing to receive the least amount . Thus , if there were five bids of Rs345,000 , Rs343,000 , Rs340,000 , Rs339,000 and Rs338,500 , the one bidding for Rs338,500 will win and receive this much money from the total pool of Rs350,000 . The remaining amount ( Rs11,500 ) will go into a surplus pool . <p> This is an interesting arrangement . If the terms and conditions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a great tool for developing working capital financing products and indeed can also be used for crowd funding . <p> In Pakistan , Mudaraba business regulations already exist and it will be helpful if Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan ( SECP ) develops a framework allowing integration of features of committees and crowd funding into Mudaraba regulations . This integrated framework will serve the following purposes : <p> It can be used to develop a comprehensive infrastructure for development of social enterprises in the country . It can also be helpful in expanding the scale and scope of Mudaraba business , allowing Mudarabas to have outreach into communities at large , both in the urban centres as well as in rural areas . Needless to say that this will also improve financial inclusion in Pakistan where bank penetration remains very limited .

@@4605235 <h> 8 hours of school and then tuition : Is your child learning anything ? <p> Students who are used to tuitions want to find short cuts in everything . They have never learned how to struggle and strive for something . PHOTO : FILE <p> I was quite disturbed to hear thatHaroon Tariq - the student who secured 38 As in IGCSE -- has opened up a tuition centre where he intends to offer paid tuition for O ' and A ' level subjects . <p> It is indeed sad that such a brilliant mind is encouraging a trend like after school classes . This article by no means serves to undermine the accomplishments of the aforementioned student , but to highlight the implications of the overall growing trend of private tuition in Pakistan , whose endorsement by Haroon is pitiful . <p> In my opinion , after-school tuition are a handicap , or put it more appropriately , an addiction for students . Once a child develops the habit of getting spoon fed by tuition teachers , his intellectual abilities begin to decline . He no longer strives to find solutions to the problems he faces in his studies , but instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evening from the academy . <p> ' Your only job will be to revise the material ; the extraction of relevant material is up to us . ' <p> This is the worst form of spoon-feeding one can imagine and those falling for such taglines are committing intellectual suicide . It is through the practice of extraction of relevant materials and other such intermediary activities that actual learning takes place . <p> I remember studying for my O ' level Geography paper . The subject was not offered in my school ( or any other school I knew ) , and thus it was impossible to find someone who had previously appeared for this particular subject 's examination . Yet , instead of going to a tuition centre , I went through the course syllabus and searched online for relevant books . After going through a number of book reviews , I finalised a couple of course books and bought them from the local bookshop . <p> I do understand that such measures of self-study are difficult and students can easily get confused -- or worse , distracted . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was on the right track or not , but this where my true learning took place . After studying independently , I not only scored an A* but was also awarded Top in the World in Geography certificate by the CIE . <p> As a student who never succumbed to the pressure of after-school tuitions I can say one thing for sure ; students who become accustomed to tuitions try and find further shortcuts and this habit continues even through university level . <p> Until a student realises that there is no option other than studying , striving and working hard on their own , they will never think that the struggle is worthy and will always take the easier way out . Working hard and seeing the results can change a person 's approach towards life . Allama Iqbal gives a beautiful comparison between getting end results through short cuts and through hard work stating that ; <p> ( The heaven , which was given as a gift to Hazrat Adam ( AS ) before the creation of this world , did not have that charm and beauty which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have ) <p> Another ' package ' offered by Haroon was the ; <p> ' Revised Package ' : Full course in four months <p> This is a clear violation of the official CIE stance which says that O ' level syllabuses are designed on the assumption that candidates have about 130 guided learning hours per subject over the duration of the course . Furthermore , these kinds of convenience store ' packages ' also serve as incentives to students be sloppy throughout the school year and just go for tuition for four months to cover the entire course . <p> After-school tuition are also detrimental to the health of students . Studying for eight hours continuously in school and then going to tuition centres in the evening is inhuman , to say the least . Nowadays , parents have even started sending children in primary school for evening tuition ! They can barely talk yet and are already being thrust into the ' big bad world of competitors ' ? I have relatives in my family who do the same and it is beyond my comprehension how this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their parents too ! When questioned , the usual response from parents is that they want their child to perform the very best in tests . <p> Would n't it be better if the students spent the same time in the evening playing sports , chit-chatting with their parents , or just reading some non-course books instead ? This would not only help them maintain their social presence but will also aid them in their academic performance . A healthy body and mind can perform better than an overworked one and only an active mind can perform better . Tuition make your mind lazy ; do n't encourage this dependency in students ! <p> My cousins first go to school , come home , eat , leave for tuition where they complete the homework they get from school , come back after an hour , then wait for a Qari sahab to teach Qur'an to them .

We used to come home from school , eat , sleep for an hour or two , wake up , learn Qur'an through PTV 's Iqra , do our school homework in my mother 's supervision ( my father always told my mom , " you are a graduate , teach the kids at home " ) , watch cartoon , go out for cycling , come back , eat evening snacks , watch 9pm Drama on PTV with family , read story books before going to bed .

Recommend <p> Aleem Zubair <p> Also , these strenuous academic routines that have monopolised the evenings of most students have been seriously detrimental to sports in Pakistan . They have school-work in the morning and tuition in the evening , with no time to spend on activities that exercise their physical abilities . <p> Education is important but sports should not be ignored in the process . Sadly , fun and play have been put on the back burner for far too long . Children need to be allowed to have a life outside just academic achievements . Their milestones need to be redefined . They need to be allowed to exercise the abundance of other skills God has gifted them with .

I started in the 6th Grade and that is when my result started going down . Like you have said , after some time I become completely reliant upon tuitions , something that I started noticing in the 10th Grade . Tuition did not improve my grades , in fact , they got worse . Recommend <p> Qwax <p> I 'm currently studying in my final year of O levels and , not meaning to brag , I am one of the best students in my school , consistently getting A*s and top positions . I 'm constantly faced by questions such as " Where do you go for tution ? " Or " How mny hours do you study each day ? " Hours ? Every day ? I ca n't believe how much people study nowadays .

ET thanks for nice bloggers and opinion columnists . <p> The comments by Sarah are excellent addition . I was an average student , yet enjoyed my childhood to the fullest which today 's children may not dream off . By the way being an average student in school and at university never stopped me from reaching to the tallest peeks of my profession . <p> There is another stance to this too . Most of the schools are English Medium , while at home we speak Urdu . This essentially means that the child actually does not understand what is he learning , that is why he tries to just remember it <p> In addition to this , mothers are not ready to take the heed of assisting their children for work , coz this will ask their time and energy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so that this could also be handled <p> Though I also want that my child should play and enjoy , but given the amount of workload that he receives from school , he is unable to do soRecommend <p> Sidra <p> Sadly , the education trend in Pakistan is leaning more and more towards exam-oriented learning , rather than learning for its own sake ( INCLUDING the O/A level system ) . The tuition center trend not only reinforces this , but is also flawed for other reasons , such as being a -- a status symbol and b- the teaching style is exactly as you mentioned , i.e. ' shortcut based ' . No offense to Haroon Rashid , but the goal should not be achieving a certain number of A*s , but learning to the best of one 's capabilities , both with theory and practice , and actually retaining that knowledge in the future.Recommend <p> Osama Sajid <p> So true ! After getting exceptional O Level grades ( Alhamdulliah ) , I remember being bombarded by similar questions from all sides ( relatives , friends , neighbours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as pointed by you is " How many hours do you study each day ? " Ahhhh . To avoid these irritating questions , I stopped telling people my grades , or if asked I used to avoid this topic as much as possible.Recommend <p> Osama Sajid <p> Sir , I think we need to teach our children the art of balancing . I mean if all what your child does after getting home from school is study , I would consider it even worst than bonded labour . As parents , you need to realize and appreciate this fact that even if your child is not getting the top most position , he is at least living a ' normal ' life . If the mother is a housewife and educated , and she is still sending her children to tuition centers , then this is an example of height of negligence from her side . I personally think that the role of mother in the early years of child 's education ( say up to class 5 ) is extremely crucial . I remember that my mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in school in my primary years , and that training is even helping me today.Recommend <p> Osama Sajid <p> Awww . Thank you so much for your comment . Sarah , the comparison you gave is really touching and heart breaking . We , as a society , seriously needs to change the yardstick for measuring ' success ' . Recommend <p> Osama <p> YES . Tuitions do not help you in actually studying and are certainly not advisable for primary school kids . However , O Level/ Matriculation and A Level/Intermediate students appearing for their final exams can take tuition because their grades will play an important role in their future careers and they can not afford to mess up their exams . At the same time these students should not become entirely dependent on tuition because the spoon feeding culture will decrease their brain 's abilities and they will not be able to cope with university life and career.Recommend <p> Mehreen <p> Its not only the O and A level system , FSc is worse . The kids have tutions for the entire subjects one after the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ KIPS , Star and many other have made it their logo that without their tuitions one cant get top most ( ridiculously high may i say -- and all rote based learning ) marks . And the generation to generation trend is continuing and getting worse ! Recommend <p> Muneeb <p> Not sure how correct such a generalisation is . There was a very well reputed school that I was studying at which failed to provide a good teacher for a particular A Level subject . That is when I joined tuition classes for that subject after school hours . I was the kind of student who would usually study himself but at least , I needed some guidance and direction regarding the syllabus of that particular subject ( Note : I 'm talking about guidance , not spoon feeding ) and the tuition classes in that subject inspired me to analyse things critically and to discover my own analytical skills and that was something that my school failed to provide me . Tuitions are not always good but not always bad either- it 's the teachers who are either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all tuition classes/sessions as uninspiring or counter productive- it depends on who the tutor is . If the ' tutor ' is better at his/her job than the ' teacher ' at an established school , then maybe tuition might turn out to be the student 's saving grace . However , I agree with you to a certain extent . These day a lot of tuition services are more about earning some quick few bucks for the tutor rather than providing quality education ( Even I do n't like the idea of the ' packages ' being offered by Mr. Haroon Tariq neither the spoon feeding approach being encouraged there ) . However , just because it 's common does not mean that we get judgmental about tuitions generally.Recommend <p> Ibne Abu Shafi <p> Sadly to admit , a good number of CIE teachers are also taking it as DHANDA to make money and thereby encouraging students to go for tuitions without least bothering the stand and grasping abilities of their so called students . I know of a CIE Student who was a position holder in class but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he hardly gets time to initialize his personal input in the topics he is taught resulting in gradually deteriorating his grades AND those money makers are simply concerned of their so called DHANDA ..... Be it informed , I am also a CIE English teacher and strongly discourage it.Recommend <p> Osama Sajid <p> Thank you for your feedback Muneeb : ) It 's good to see the other side of the coin.Recommend <p> Caymon <p> Brother , tuition classes are useless 90% of the time . So yes , we can generalize . " it 's the teachers who are either good or bad ? " What is that supposed to mean ? Teachers can merely tell you what to do . In the end , its all about what YOU want to do . If you have had ' bad ' teachers , then before going to tuition classes , there are these tools for guidance called books ! Recommend

ILLUSTRATION : MUNIRA ABBAS <p> KARACHI : <p> Pakistan 's current account deficit as opposed to a surplus of $439 million in the corresponding three-month period of last year , widened to $1.2 billion in the first quarter of fiscal 2014 ( July-September ) , according to data released by the State Bank of Pakistan on Wednesday . <p> The data shows that the current account deficit in September alone was $608 million , up 7% compared to $569 million in August . <p> Talking to The Express Tribune , Standard Chartered Bank Senior Economist , Sayem Ali said that the cause of the widening current account deficit is increasing imports although a considerable pick-up was recorded in exports and remittances over the same period . <p> Compared to the corresponding period last year , Pakistan 's exports of goods amounted to $6.2 billion , up 1.3% in the first quarter of fiscal 2014 . In contrast , Pakistan 's imports of goods increased 8.9% to $10.6 billion over the same period . " This is driven primarily by higher oil prices and rising energy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ import bill , " said Ali . <p> The year-on-year increase in workers ' remittances was 9.1% , which remained $3.9 billion in July-September . The International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) had projected the current account deficit for fiscal 2014 at $1.6 billion in its September report , but the first-quarter figure indicates that the current account deficit will be significantly higher , Ali noted . <p> Although the government sought IMF assistance to forestall a balance-of-payments crisis , a widening current account deficit and large debt repayments have led to a sharp drawdown of the State Bank 's foreign exchange reserves . <p> " Besides this sharp decline , markets are concerned about the growing risk of rising global oil prices and Pakistan 's large external debt repayments on the horizon , " Ali added , saying that the rupee is under pressure due to depleting foreign exchange reserves . <p> Even after the release of the first tranche of the IMF loan , the SBP 's foreign exchange reserves remain weak at $3.9 billion as on October 10 . " This is barely enough to cover one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it is the lowest level of reserves since the 2008 balance-of-payments crisis . <p> As on October 23 , the rupee has declined 11% to Rs106.4 a dollar year-to-date .

It is fairly common knowledge that the US Reserve Bank combined with the New York bankers and the large industrialists is a giant Ponzi scheme , but we do not get a lot of detail in regard to Pakistan . Obviously , the IMF appears to be part of the Ponzi scheme . Whenever the IMF appears on the scene jobs just seem to disappear , and the economy of the receiving country generally becomes worse and worse . Of course , the receiving country gets all the blame . <p> @Sexton Blake : Bravo , you are 100% correct . Why do these spineless rulers not have this vision ? It is very encouraging for me to see people who know that interest-based debt will always lead to poverty . Always , always , always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a closed system can not generate money out of thin air . However , USA is run on credits generated out of nothing by The Federal Reserve . Your solution to the imports is also very valid , but I disagree that research will take time . I am sure that there are pretty much wealthy people here who can buy companies already manufacturing the machinery from abroad . I am an engineer who has been part of an analysis done to estimate how much we can cut down our imports . The answer is down to 10%-20% Excavation in KP and Baluchistan is enough to cover Pakistan 's oil needs for a long time . But alas , our rulers are spineless and they are not allowed to develop the country due to foreign pressure . After all , a thriving Muslim nuclear state is a serious threat to all enemies .

IMF solution is to spend less , eliminate subsidies , increase taxes and make sure everyone pays there fair share -- same as the rest of the World . If you want to blame someone for Pakistan 's economic woes -- quit blaming IMF and others -- take a look in the mirror . <p> @Sexton Blake : " Whenever the IMF appears on the scene jobs just seem to disappear , and the economy of the receiving country generally becomes worse and worse . Of course , the receiving country gets all the blame " <p> Simply not true . This was not India 's experience in 1991 or Soth Korea and Thailand 's experience in 1997 .

As suchthe crisis in the economy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ashkenazi , I basically agree with you , but Pakistan is not in such a bad financial mess if one cares to look at the problem rationally . A tiny country such as Australia has a debt of about 40 billion dollars , and the US has a debt of about 60 trillion dollars with unfunded liabilities of at least 200 trillion dollars , and both growing rapidly . There are also many other worrying examples such as Greece and Spain , This of course does not mean that Pakistan should be complacent , but it certainly has a long way to go before it catches up with some of the aforementioned basket cases . <p> @Sexton Blake : US is an exception because it can pay for its imports in its domestic currency . Most countries including Pakistan are not similarly placed . <p> Also the issue with regards to fiscal deficit for Pakistan is n't that debt to GDP ratio is too high but rather that tax to GDP ratio is too low and does not provide adequate debt coverage .

@@4605237 <p> As the dust settles after the brouhaha surrounding Malala Yousufzai and the Nobel Prize that she did not win , two other figures come dimly into view . Three girls were shot in the back of that school van . Malala was the most severely wounded and the prime target , but Kainat Riaz and Shazia Ramzan were hit as well . Their wounds were treated locally ; they made a good physical recovery and their families , like that of Malala before she was shot , became the subject of threats by the Taliban . <p> Behind the scenes and very quietly wheels began to turn . Kainat and Shazia were obviously at risk ; and the government of Pakistan was no more likely to protect them effectively than it had Malala when she was merely moderately famous locally rather than the global icon she has become .

They were just two ordinary schoolgirls who were in the wrong place at the wrong time but got caught up in the ' Malala Effect ' . <p> Recently , the three young women were reunited when Malala was at Edinburgh University to receive an honorary Masters degree .

Was the plan that they would just be lightly wounded and then follow Malala to the West where they could be footsoldiers for her ? And their places at the Atlantic College were arranged in some secrecy were they not ? Very suspicious . <p> Clearly , it is time to get those critical pens dipped in vitriol and begin the process of shredding the characters and motivations of Kainat and Shazia .

@@4607230 <h> Drug menace and Pakistan <p> How the ANF , despite being a small force , is working to eradicate this menace <p> The menace of drug has engulfed the world at large . Every country is making all possible efforts to curb it , especially those which are most hit by this menace , but unfortunately the results are not as encouraging as are conceived and expected . The magnitude of the problem can well be conceived by having a look at the facts and figures which United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime ( UNODC ) compiles and makes public every year . According to the UNODC World Drug Report-2011 , the estimated annual global production of cannabis herb is over 966,000 tons , hashish over 9,900 tons , opium over 7,800 tons , heroin over 500 tons and cocaine over 1,100 tons . <p> The production of synthetic drugs and proportion thereof abused by the drug addicts , however , can not be ascertained . Unfortunately , of these , 97% of the opium is produced by only three countries i.e. , Afghanistan ( 89% ) , Myanmar ( 4% ) and Mexico ( 4% ) ; 100% of the cocaine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Peru ( 35% ) and Bolivia ( 13% ) ; and about 45% of the total hashish by only two countries i.e. , Afghanistan ( 35% ) and Morocco ( 10% ) . In other words , there are only 8 to 10 countries that produce over 90% of the total narcotics in the world and then let them spread all over . It is even more unfortunate that except cocaine only 10 to 20 percent of the total production of the narcotics is intercepted and confiscated by the law enforcement agencies all over the world while the rest is consumed . According to the UNODC World Drug Report-2006 , US$350 billion roll in drug business annually worldwide . <p> According to the UNODC Report-2011 , out of 4,533 million population of the world which falls within the age group of 15-64 years , the youth and the working group of the population , 321 million , which constitutes 7% of the group , use these drugs . <p> Taking cognizance of this grave situation , the government of Pakistan approved and promulgated the National Anti Narcotics Policy-2010 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Anti Narcotics Force . All federal and provincial law enforcement agencies like Police , Excise , ANF , Frontier Corpse , Pakistan Customs , Pakistan Rangers , ASF , Pakistan Coast Guards etc , 20 in number , are partners to this policy and are responsible to implement its provisions and make efforts to achieve the ultimate goal of a ' Drug Free Pakistan ' . In 2012 , all these agencies jointly registered 1,04,862 cases under various drug laws , arrested 1,04,009 persons in these cases , and recovered 29,481 kgs of opium , 1,369 kgs of morphine , 12,661 kgs of heroin , and 1,66,026 kgs of hashish from them . <p> The Anti-Narcotics Force since its inception is a premier agency of the country which primarily concentrates on strategic seizures . ANF is a very small organisation having a strength of less than 3,000 personnel , peon to director general , and is responsible for a far wider scope that includes 13 airports , 3 seaports , 17 dry ports , 7 entry/exit points and 25 police stations all over the country . Despite these challenges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , prevent its spread in Pakistan and to seize its export to other countries through Pakistan , is proportionally very high . It plays strategically and goes after big drug trafficking cases . Being a very small force it does not have the capacity to go into the streets and run after petty drug peddlers . This type of run and chase is the duty of police . The achievements of this small force are unmatched domestically as well as internationally . Within the country it is the smallest force than all other law enforcement agencies and the same is also true internationally . <p> The ANF not only exerts for drug supply reduction but also equally exerts for drug demand reduction in the country by creating mass awareness and community mobilisation against the drug abuse . For the purpose it arranges awareness activities exploiting every possible ways and means . In 2012 , the ANF and its Drug Free City Lahore Project conducted 1,370 various kinds of awareness activities throughout Pakistan , particularly in Lahore , targeting the youth and labor . Not only this , the ANF runs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each in Islamabad , Karachi and Quetta , where chronic drug addicts are taken care of , treated and rehabilitated without charging any fee or expense of boarding and lodging . These centres take care of and provide relief and treatment to about 3,000 drug addicts annually . <p> After the suo motu notice of the Karachi situation by the honourable Supreme Court of Pakistan and its directions to various law enforcement agencies , the ANF besides being strategic force concentrated at domestic environment , accelerated its efforts in Karachi as a special campaign under the name of operation " Umeed-e-Nau " . The operation revolves around two cardinals -- one dealing within Karachi and the other revolves around moving of drugs to Karachi from up country . During the first seven days of the campaign , 22 clean up operations exclusively by ANF and 25 intelligence led operations have been carried out in Karachi wherein 159 persons have been arrested/detained in these operations and 19.5 kgs of heroin , 2.4 tons of opium , 8.4 tons of hashish , 27.5 tons of poppy straw , 335 gms of cocaine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and 230 bottles of liquor were seized from them . <p> On the down country movement , more concerted efforts have been made . The Supreme Court of Pakistan is focusing on the affairs of Karachi and the ANF with all its resources , side by side with other law enforcement agencies , is endeavouring to do its utmost . One can hope that these efforts will have long lasting effects and the Karachi situation would improve positively as people of Pakistan wish in general and the Supreme Court of Pakistan in particular . <p> Prohibition has finally run its course ; the lives and livelihoods of hundred 's of millions of people ( users and non-users ) worldwide have been destroyed or severely disrupted ; many countries that were once shining beacons of liberty and prosperity have become toxic , repressive , smoldering heaps of hypocrisy and a gross affront to fundamental human decency . It is now the duty of every last one of us to insure that the people who are responsible for this shameful situation are not simply left in peace to enjoy the wealth and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afforded them . Former and present Prohibitionists must not be allowed to remain untainted or untouched by the unconscionable acts that they have viciously committed on their fellow human beings . They have provided us with neither safe communities nor safe streets . We will provide them with neither a safe haven to enjoy their ill-gotten gains nor the liberty to repeat such a similar atrocity . <p> Prohibition has ( again ) evolved local gangs into transnational enterprises with intricate power structures that reach into every corner of society , helping them control vast swaths of territory while gifting them with significant social and military resources .

The selectors left out Asad Ali , Anwar Ali , Haris Sohail , Sarfraz Ahmed and Zulfiqar Babar from the squad that featured in the T20s against Zimbabwe . <p> Malik was part of the squad that played the solitary T20 match during the South Africa tour and played the Champions Trophy in England , but he was dropped from the team for the tours of West Indies and Zimbabwe . In August , he played in the inaugural edition of the Caribbean Premier League and finished as the leading run-getter . <p> Razzaq , 33 , has been out of favour since the 2012 T20 World Cup in Sri Lanka following his outburst against captain Mohammad Hafeez after which he was fined Rs. 1 lakh and sidelined from the squad . Overall , Razzaq has played 30 T20s during which he has scored 383 runs at a strike rate of 119.68 and has taken 20 wickets . <p> Saleem Jaffar , the PCB selector , told reporters : " Both Razzaq and Malik have the ability to strengthen team before the World T20 because of their experience and ability in this version and that is why they have been selected . <p> " Razzaq is a useful cricketer and we felt he can play a good role in upcoming matches against the tough South African side . Although he is not in the same touch with his bowling , his batting can be very useful especially in Twenty20 and in conditions such as in UAE .

Zulfiqar Babar was ruled out of selection because of the hand-injury he suffered during the recently concluded Test series . <p> Jaffar said there were no concerns about Akmal 's glovework and believes he can be a long-term option . " We do n't feel he is a part-time wicketkeeper particularly in Twenty20 . He is looking comfortable and happy in this role . Our experience with him in ODIs is also positive .

I do n't know why Raza Hasan is being ignored and why they considered a aged zulfiqar babar over him is beyond me . <p> Wahab Riaz should also be forgotten for all formats , he is useless and controversial . <p> Moreover if Shoaib Malik does n't do anything useful this should be his last series . <p> SNUBB on November 6 , 2013 , 6:58 GMT <p> Its ok to give Razzaq the chance to perform as he did well during his last outing but Shoaib malik has been tested time and again . We should mix the fresh blood with experienced players if they are performing for better results . In bowling we need to try some right arm fast bowler like Muhammad Talha or spinner who can bat as well like Hasan Raza . <p> Happy to see Malik and Razzaq back in the Pakistan team . Hope they can deliver like they used to . If they show good form , their experience would be valuable for the next ODI world cup for Pakistan . As we have seen from Misbah , experience does help .

I think they do n't have any other options therefore the selectors have think of placing old donkeys in to play as they have nothing to loss now . <p> on November 6 , 2013 , 1:20 GMT <p> MESSAGE TO PCB , Why the hell is Mr.Malik in the squad he is a fail if Pakistan cricket ever wants to get somewhere they need too ban Shoaib Malik , Imran Farhat , Kamran Akmal , and maybe even Wahab riaz all these players just get a spot on the team with out even working hard.You should never have something just given to you and even after that they do n't preform . <p> on November 6 , 2013 , 0:45 GMT <p> Best Of Luck to Pakistan for their T20 match against South Africa , today.I am going to watch it . <p> on November 6 , 2013 , 0:42 GMT <p> Very very balanced side . Although I would like harris sohail around too . I think harris should also be given proper chance in odi and tests as well . After a long time I like the look of a Pakistan side . I think we should stick with this group of players adding babar , rizwan and harris . Sohaib should also be given s chance in odi <p> D-Ascendant on November 6 , 2013 , 0:07 GMT <p> Wait ... So what has Azhar Mahmood done wrong that he did n't get picked ? <p> ChaudryCricket on November 5 , 2013 , 22:34 GMT <p> On what basis do Abdul Razzaq and Shoaib Malik merit their selections . Razzaq recently in an interview blasted Hafeez and Misbah so how can we expect team harmony if things get ugly . Abdur Rehman should be left in the test squad and not chosen for any other format . <p> Raza Hasan , Hammad Azam , Haris Sohail would have been the better choices . Tabish Khan should have been tested out . Junaid and Irfan should be kept away from the t20 format let them focus on test and odi . Overall a dissapointing selection . <p> 14.08.1947 on November 5 , 2013 , 22:22 GMT <p> Best playing 11 : 1 ) Shezad 2 ) Razzaq 3 ) Malik 4 ) Akmal+ 5 ) Shoaib Maqsood 6 ) Afridi 7 ) JAMSHED 8 ) Hafeez 9 ) Tanvir 10 ) Irfan 11 ) Ajmal ...... Jamshed is strugglin at the moment , but it does nt mean he should be dropped . He need to gain more confidence so he might be useful in the end of the innings , because he can play good strokes . Hafeez should be also in the ODI Format play at the No.7 ! ! ! Razzaq and Malik should show their potential ..... <p> on November 5 , 2013 , 22:21 GMT <p> Thankfully you guys put Abdul Razzaq <p> Haz95 on November 5 , 2013 , 22:20 GMT <p> I think this is good for a one last hurrah . Razzaq and Malik need to prove that they are world class , not perform one day , get out for less than 5 the next 5 or so . To be honest , I for one am seeing Hammad Azam as our future fast bowler all rounder . It 's sad what they are doing with Haris Sohail and Shoaib Maqsood . The highly overrated Umar Amin is being given a lot of chance , make sure it is n't 1 too many . Maqsood on his debut smashed 1 four and 2 sixes , it 's just a minute cameo of what 's to come in his , what seems to be , brigt future . 1 . Ahmed Shehzad , 2 . Nasir Jamshed , 2 . Muhammad Hafeez , 4 . Umar Akmal , 5 . Shoaib Maqsood , 6 . Abdul Razzaq 7 . Hammad Azam 8 , Shahid Afridi ( just for bowling ) , .9 . Saeed ajmal 9 . Junaid Khan , 10 . MOHAMMED AMIR ( but for now Mohammed Irfan , who 's good too . ) <p> on November 5 , 2013 , 22:03 GMT <p> Not impressed with this , Asad , Anwar and Haris have done nothing wrong , in fact they have n't even been given a chance ! ! ! ! Why does Pakistan continue to persist with players who have failed time and time again ? Nasir is out of touch and Umar Amin has not proved himself . Pakistani select need to stop teasing the youngsters by taking them on tour and not playing them because when the time comes we are gon na find that when they do come in they will not have been groomed properly . <p> t20cric on November 5 , 2013 , 20:42 GMT <p> A few mistakes in this selection . Zulfiqar should have been in the squad instead of Rehman but Zulfiqar is injured so it makes sense . Anwar Ali deserved a spot far more then U. Amin . Anwar playing under the wing of Razzaq may have been groomed by this oppurtunity . As for Haris Sohail I do nt know what PCB are doing with him he often makes it to a squad then is given 1 or no chance and then is dropped regardless of how good he played . BY doing this PCB are making sure that every last bit of his confidence is shattered and they are destroying a great talent . <p> On the other hand happy to see Razzaq , Malik and U. Akmal in and Sarfraz out . Razzaq and Malik seem like they may only be good for t20s now so might as well keep playing t20s until retirement . <p> I think its a very good decision to include abdul razzaq in the team , At this stage Pakistani team definitely needs a fast bowling all rounder in t20 and ODI both ... This will create a good depth in Pakistan batting which is failing these days ! ! <p> on November 5 , 2013 , 19:21 GMT <p> Haris Sohail got the raw deal , should have been persisted with . He is a good prospect for Pakistan in the future <p> guys zulfiqar Baber aha injured hand that y he is not included in the team . I m disappointed not to see either Hammad Azam nor Anwar Ali in the squad.One of them must be in the side to replace A.Razzaq in future . Pakistan fails to find . replacement of A.Razzaq that 's y he is once again included in the squad Azam &amp; Anwar may replace him if groomed properly . <p> on November 5 , 2013 , 18:27 GMT <p> i never understand our Pakistani fans . only 11 players can play in a team keep razaq keep shoaib keep ahmed keep keep keep keep .. give a chance to young blood . Razaq was good shoaib was good i respect all the players . somehow they did something somewhere for pakistan . but see indian team ghambir sehwaq everyone out not chance for them now ... <p> on November 5 , 2013 , 18:20 GMT <p> Bad decision letting go of Zulfiqar Babar - I think he did really well in the last two series . <p> Very balance and talented side has been selected by selectors although some name are still debate able but on the paper it looks a strong and balance T20 team . Good to see " Finisher " Abdur Razzaq back In the side as he will give some stability to Pakistan fragile batting lineup especially towards the end of inning.He is not a self motivator so it is captain responsibility to give confidence and proper backing to extract best out of his bowling &amp; batting.If Hafeez do so than I believe A.Razzaq would display his best performance in upcoming T20 . Inclusion of Malik in the side maybe the fruit of his strong performance in Caribbean league but it is very difficult to him to claim his place in playing 11 as Green shirts have already to many spinning allrounders in the side . Shuaib Maqsood must be the part of the team as he showed his talent and potential in Zimbabwe tour . So it is a tough ask to select final eleven for the tour selection comitee . <p> Whats the point of doing this ? Younger players should be groomed and given chances . These guys are yesterdays news . Can they play in the 2015 world cup ? <p> Omarrz on November 5 , 2013 , 17:02 GMT <p> thank God to see Razzaq back in the squad . But will he be included in the XI ? A big question mark . Just what we saw in the last T20 , Yasir was constantly given precedence over Razzaq . <p> Please include Razzaq in the ODI team as well . Pak need a fast/medium bowling allrounder . <p> tigerfahad on November 5 , 2013 , 16:51 GMT <p> @ Uzaur Yousuf : your team combination is not that good as you think it is , you have played too many bowlers in this , there is no need of zulfiqar in the presence of afridi , ajmal , and M.Hafeez , instead a batsman should be included as our batting is the weaker link , secondly sohaib maqsood is not an opner instead nasir should be there with ahmad shahzad or even imran nazir can be included in the t20 format , sohaib maqsood should be there but in the middle order <p> on November 5 , 2013 , 16:50 GMT <p> Cant wait to see Razzaq play again , hope they let Soqaib play ! ! <p> on November 5 , 2013 , 16:49 GMT <p> Razzaq one of the best players in Pakistan <p> on November 5 , 2013 , 16:47 GMT <p> wow its great decsion to pick A razzaq , he is real match winner and hope he get setteled with hafeez now .. also i am very hopefull that razzaq perfroms and find the place in the ODI as well that will be great adavantage in upcoming world cup .. pakistani team really need a match finisher these days and A razzaq know how to finish the match .. Goog luck A razzaq . <p> on November 5 , 2013 , 16:25 GMT <p> well I feel PCB should learn from bcci . give youngsters ample chance . look forward PCB . look at the examples of bcci . they are thinking about future by not including sehwag gambhir bcoz u have to back younsters does nt matter if they win or loose . well t20 is young blood game not for 34 yr oldies. surprised by pcb <p> bouncer709 on November 5 , 2013 , 16:22 GMT <p> @hamaadqureshi : the youngsters who were given chance what they did ? I think they should have dropped Umer Amin too , you are right soon we will see Imran farhat and Kamran Akmal too , though I do n't want them to be back in the team , but yet I think they are better than their young replacement , Shan Masood and Sarfraz Ahmed . Razzaq is better than Wahab Riaz , and Shoib Malik is better than Umer Amin . If youngster is deserving no one can block his way , whenever he get chance he will prove , but so far I do n't see any youngster proving too good to replace seniors . <p> ispaewbi on November 5 , 2013 , 16:03 GMT <p> Awesome News . Abdul Razzaq needs to be in the team ; not only for T20 format but ODIs as well . I 'm glad they resolved their differences . <p> We 've got T20 covered but we desperately need full-time all-rounders in ODI . I still ca n't understand the mediocre players like Wahab and Sohail selection in the team while players like Junaid , Anwar and Adul Razzaq are available . Pakistan needs to play an extra batsmen , ideally an all-rounder in ODI squad . Do n't know when will they learn to select a balanced team . <p> I am all for giving new players a chance and not entirely sure about Malik but with young players not taking any responsibility out in the field , he could be a good fit and mentor . <p> on November 5 , 2013 , 15:54 GMT <p> its great pak bring back razaq , he is a match winner .. not sure about Mr Malik hit and miss .. would like to see amar back in pak set up .. hopefully very soon . <p> shoeb1 on November 5 , 2013 , 15:30 GMT <p> Good to see razzak in the team Pakistan . <p> on November 5 , 2013 , 15:04 GMT <p> I really appreciate this positive step from Pakistan cricket , after a long a time i ll see a balance team an of-course wish to see Abdul Razaq going in Action ................. one more senior player Mr Muhammad Yosaf the legend <p> on November 5 , 2013 , 15:02 GMT <p> Very happy on the selection of Malik &amp; Razzaq hope both of them perform well and find a permanent place in the Pakistan side , specially for the forthcoming T20 World Cup and Sri Lanka series . <p> All the best Malik &amp; Razzaq <p> BabaSehgal on November 5 , 2013 , 14:56 GMT <p> Even though he 's only a shadow of his former self , Shoaib Malik is still 10x better than Hafeez as an all-rounder . Abdul Razzaq is a legend and Pakistan will have a very difficult time finding a replacement for him . Anwar Ali is the only prospect that could be groomed into taking up the fast bowling all-rounder role eventually . Please keep Hafeez limited to T20 's only , and replace him with Shoaib Malik in ODIs . When Raza Hassan is fit to play , PCB should drop Afridi from ODIs for good and bring Raza Hassan in . <p> am5786 on November 5 , 2013 , 14:43 GMT <p> They should have kept Zulfiqar as he bowled well in T20I he has played , a very positive sign in a return of Razzaq though I am not sure about Malik it is so so , Hafeez has no place as a batsman but he is captain so Malik may not find a place in team . I still do n't get it how come Amin is not even part of every team without any significance performance but he is included in the team , Sohaib deserves a place instead of him in the middle order . <p> SwingReverse on November 5 , 2013 , 14:40 GMT <p> Malik &amp; Razzaq in for Zulfiqar &amp; Haris Sohail ! ? ! ? ! Are we preparing for a tournament in the past ? This has got to stop ... I see no meaningful titles coming to Pakistan with such team selection . <p> on November 5 , 2013 , 14:32 GMT <p> this has been the worst selection by far in recent times . Razzaq and Malik have had their good days but now Pakistan needs some new energetic blood . Bangladesh should have served as a good example of trying out youngsters . Old players like these are the major hindrance towards the development of Pakistan team . A very ppor decision by the selectors . I thought Mr.Najam Sethi would have revolutionised Pakistan cricket instead its just goes worse by every decision . Time for a compete over haul of the PCB . Its a complete disgrace <p> on November 5 , 2013 , 14:11 GMT <p> Finally PCB takes a step to make things right ! Both players NEED the team and the team NEEDS them ( Their BEST ) ! Its time for them to Prove their worth . to payback the team for which they have been trained for since long . You train PLAYERS for years . and when its time for them to train the youth , discard them ? Both the players are Needed for T20 WC and ODI WC . A new team is never formulated 1 year before the WC or a Mega event . Mega events always demand EXPERIENCE . Formulate the team with youngsters from the next month of WC . Do n't care for win or loss ! but need to be sensible in selection . Unbiased ! 1 or 2 youngsters are included to give them experience , not 5 or 6 . Ahmed Shahzad , Nasir Jamshed , Umar Akmal are sheer talent and bright prospects of the game for PAK . LOOK at how they started and what we have made them today ? COACH must Guide their flight . NOT Restrict them ! Polish their Natural game . Not force them . Its not the GUN its the MAN behind the GUN . <p> hamaadqureshi on November 5 , 2013 , 14:09 GMT <p> It is a circus going on . First they select them for T20s and they will 20 odd runs and take 1 or 2 wickets , and get in the ODI team as well , thus blocking deserving youngsters . They have done nothing to get selected . Now get ready to watch kamran and imran farhat playing in next series . <p> The proposed team has perfect combination with batting depth and sloggers , at the same time various bowling options . I hope these PCB selectors get some sense in them and start preparing team for T 20 world cup without favoritism . Correct if I 'm wrong and criticisms will be highly appreciated . <p> Ibrarhunzai on November 5 , 2013 , 13:54 GMT <p> These T20 's should have been played before the ODI series so that performers of t20 's could be inducted the ODI squad . <p> likeintcricket on November 5 , 2013 , 13:49 GMT <p> I am not really sure of Razzak . He used to be a wonderful allrounder but due to ill treatment by the selectors he has become a spent force . I do n't expect him to perform any miracle . His bowling could become a burdon on Pakistan . Afridi , Malik , Ajmal , hafiz and a fast bowler are enough to subdue South Africans . <p> on November 5 , 2013 , 13:42 GMT <p> Congrats Razzaq &amp; Shoaib bhai ... : ) <p> on November 5 , 2013 , 13:37 GMT <p> Anyone who 's criticizing the move to bring back Abdul Razzaq into T20 's is ignorant of the fact that pakistan had won T20 due to Performances of Abdul Razzaq as an all-rounder and Afridi as a bowler ( more then a batsman ) and Younis khan 's tailored captainship and the reason Abdul Razzaq was left out of team is because of his statement and NOT based on his performances , so very blind statements of critics whom not understanding the move is out of their biased rational and not able to understand cricket . <p> on November 5 , 2013 , 13:34 GMT <p> shoaib is a good batsman.his avg is also good.so alway take him on squad <p> on November 5 , 2013 , 13:31 GMT <p> WOW thanks to PCB for bringing back Abdul Razzaq though the discrimination he 's faced after his comment in regards to Mr hafeez wasnt the right thing to pakistan cricket itself and to Mr Abdul Razzaq and Hope so he will be back into ODI 's too insha allah as pakistan has never had any all-rounder of his calibre and he seems the only one standing out as a all-rounder from pakistan cricket from more then a decade Allah willing good move by pcb THANKS . <p> on November 5 , 2013 , 13:26 GMT <p> it is a good move.we need shoaib and razzaq like match winners even imran nazir 2. b/c we see the result of including of young players in Zimbabwe series . world t20 cup is near and we need our best eleven . <p> WackyCricLover on November 5 , 2013 , 13:25 GMT <p> These T20s are perfect opportunity to build our team for World T20 next year and we are ruining by including the old used and failed players . Abdul Razzaq is good but why Malik ? We should give chance to youngsters . In fact PCB should have selected Misbah if they want experience and composure in the team rather than Malik . <p> on November 5 , 2013 , 13:22 GMT <p> Razzaq should be in ODI and T20 , Shoaib Malik has n't done anything since 2008 , and should be left out . <p> Finally Abdul Razzaq is Back ! ! ! In my opinion he has never had a fair chance in Pakistan cricket . Anyways Gr8 News and i hope he becomes a permanent member of the side . Malik selection is good although for last few years im not his gr8st fan however he seems to be in good form and gives options as a bowler . Go Team Pakistan . Please Retain ABDUL RAZZAQ in the Team PCB ! ! <p> haq33 on November 5 , 2013 , 13:06 GMT <p> Lach ferrach and others .... the backward step was excluding him on the basis of a dressing room bust up in the first place . Razzaq is a true servant of Pak cricket who comes here not to politic but to play cricket and has on numerous occasions grasped victory from the jaws of defeat for Pakistan . what else do these heroes need to do to show their worth ? Look at the likes of players like Katich in Aus , who has finally received some sort of acknowledgement/apology that he no doubt deserves .... too little too late of course . Just like him , it was petty politics that kept Razzaq out . And now in the twilight of his career he gets back but surely Hafeez and the board should apologise to him at the very least ? It is a true reflection of Pakistani cricket that we leave quality players out to dry because of other people 's egos and then cry for them when the chips are down . <p> GermanPlayer on November 5 , 2013 , 13:06 GMT <p> Nice move to bring in Abdul Razzaq . But till when are we going to go through the same old procedure of brining a dozen young players in team , not giving anyone an extended chance and then switsching back to the old ones ? <p> binu.emiliya on November 5 , 2013 , 12:54 GMT <p> PAK should use Sami Aslam and Mohammed Nawaz and Hazan Raza is anothe good spinner pair with Saeed Ajmal <p> gr8-cricket on November 5 , 2013 , 12:52 GMT <p> Pakistan will keep giving chances to the non performing players like Shoaib Malik and they will keep on facing the same results . <p> These players are done with their career and youngsters need to be given chance . <p> Welcome back Abdul Razzaq good positive move by selectors ahead of T20 World Cup . <p> on November 5 , 2013 , 12:43 GMT <p> First time ever I am happy with Selection Committee for including Abdul Razzaq ; Congratulations ! ! ! ! Looking at Misbah 's current T20 form , he should have been included as well to provide extra stability to vatting line up . <p> on November 5 , 2013 , 12:40 GMT <p> This is definitely backward step . There are far too many tried and tested players who have had their days . I am afraid having players like Malik , Razzaq , Rehman , Hafeez and even Afridi is not a good sign for the future of Pakistan cricket . Why are we not giving youngsters the opportunity to play for Pakistan ? Where is Hammad Azam ? <p> What an absolute disgrace . The world moves forward with new young talent without turning back to the constant failures , and Pakistan move backwards to the constant failures while leaving aside the young talent . ONLY IN PAKISTAN . As for those applauding this move , then either they are ignorant of how poorly these two have done in the past despite the many chances , as well as their recent mediocre first class performance , or these applauders have very little realism and vision similar to the PCB . Sad days . <p> on November 5 , 2013 , 12:12 GMT <p> Welcome back Shoaib Malik and razzaq good positive move by selectors ahead of T20 World Cup , , Haris Sohail and Zulfiqar Babar should also be included ! ! ! <p> Hello PCB PAKISTAN CRICKET BOARD READ THIS Malik and Razak should be in test and in all 3 venue as they are experience and dependable and i am sure they will do their best to keep their place in all the games so please keep them permanantly as your middle order batting is lacking experience players get amin and akmal out and bring experience players back thank you <p> Riz000 on November 5 , 2013 , 11:58 GMT <p> PCb and all u Fans please answer my question why are you destroying young talent like Harris sohail ? ? Im happy with Abdur razzaq 's return but shoiab malik will cause politics in the team i hope this is Mohmaad haffez 's last t20 game and last time he is a captain i cant believe flops like hafeez are in the team unbelievable stuff <p> on November 5 , 2013 , 11:58 GMT <p> Fresh blood needed , 30 year old should n't be the criteria for selection <p> avmd on November 5 , 2013 , 11:57 GMT <p> Disapponited with Razzaq 's inclusion . He is old , unfit , a liability in the field and has not performed at even at domestic level . No international T20 team is hiring him now . He ca n't bowl more than 1-2 overs and his batting has deteriorated . <p> CricketChat on November 5 , 2013 , 11:51 GMT <p> Malik is a good choice , with an excellent showing in CPL recently . Probably , the T20 is the only format he can represent Pak from now on . Not sure why Razzaq is selected now after his fallout with captain . Dropping so many youngsters at the same time does n't seem right . <p> on November 5 , 2013 , 11:50 GMT <p> Good move to bring back Razzaq as Pak lacks power hitters down the order .. His presence will be an added advantage <p> on November 5 , 2013 , 11:47 GMT <p> Ironically , the T20 team was the only of our three teams that was consistently winning - while playing with young players . Appalling and un-explainable move to bring back spent forces like Shoaib , Razzaq , A Rehman . If the selectors were forward looking at all , they should have even rested Irfan and Junaid , in acticipation of their participation in the upcoming SA series and the SL series after that . I expect this bunch of old guys to loose at least one T20 game now . Pathetic PCB and its selection committee . These guys should be kicked out a.s.a.p . Bravo IHC ... <p> good additions . they still have 2-3 years of cricket left in them . hopefully malik will play and not give up his wicket <p> on November 5 , 2013 , 11:43 GMT <p> very happy for Abdur Razzaq .. Good decision to select Abdur Razzaq for T20 Series . I hope he get select for ODIs as well .. All the Best Abdur Razzaq <p> atta-ul-hai on November 5 , 2013 , 11:40 GMT <p> Hmm ! Gr8 selection of squad . this t20 team looks very gd on paper . hoping that they will perform gd too . <p> on November 5 , 2013 , 11:33 GMT <p> @kassery : you are comparing 1 st class avg of sharjeel . for odi and t20 you have to look list A stats <p> CricketFever11 on November 5 , 2013 , 11:24 GMT <p> Pakistan should target T20 world cup and future . This is a really bad move . Youngsters should have been given chance . No other options than Razzak and Malik means that Pakistan cricket is stagnating at the same position . Are not there any youngsters to carry Pakistan forward ? Negative thinking will not do any good for the team . Selectors should be brave and should have a long term vision . Temporary plasters wont do any good for the team . Give Youngsters a chance this series . Al least they will perform in the next . What you would do If these guys don not perform in this series . Drop and bring youngsters in the nest series ? Right . I do nt know why the selectors do not have average cricket brain . <p> Kassery on November 5 , 2013 , 11:10 GMT <p> ICCExpert , Not comparing Malik to Sharjeel Khan . Quite different roles in a T20 team . Someone commented S Khan was the best opener in Pakistan and I just made the point that with an average of 35 in first class cricket , ( strike rate 79 , which I admit is very good for first class cricket ) , that can hardly be the case . If it is , sad for Pakistan . Just have to look across the border and look at young Indian batting talent and their averages . <p> sapnil2000 on November 5 , 2013 , 11:09 GMT <p> they need misbah in every format to win <p> xylofon on November 5 , 2013 , 11:08 GMT <p> WE NEED NEW BATTERS ! Its wonderful to see Abdur Razzaq back because he takes his inconsistency seriously ( unlike Umar Akmal ) and is good when it matters , just see the youtube videos , the proof is in the pudding . <p> However , if PCB do not groom new batters ( not just new players but specifically batters ) Pak will not be able to perform for the big cups later , no matter how many series they play . Simple equation . <p> For example Hammad Azam shouldnt be treated so he makes a comeback 100 times like pakistani batters usually do during a career . Instead clear the case immediately ; try him PROPERLY many times to see if he has it or not and then keep him or drop him . This will allow you to move on with other players as well and find the solution for Pakistans biggest weeknes for 15 years - batting . <p> Its not just the fans who deserve it , so do the bowlers ! ; ) <p> harrdstone on November 5 , 2013 , 11:05 GMT <p> Razzaq is of no use . He is past his prime.Gul should have been selected in his place and if Gul is unfit then a young all rounder from domestic cricketi.Surprised to see Abdul Rehman because the young left arm spinner from Sialkot Stallions , Raza Hassan had done exceptionally well for Pakistan when given a chance . <p> on November 5 , 2013 , 11:03 GMT <p> Good decision to bring back Razzaq and Malik . Both can be useful in the ODI and T20 format , especially the underrated Razzaq who due to mismanagement , did not get the backing he should have . <p> on November 5 , 2013 , 10:50 GMT <p> a big NO on Malik 's selection ! If he is in , he should know that this his LAST chance ! Razzaq is T20 material , he should play this format forever ! <p> GoGoMastar on November 5 , 2013 , 10:50 GMT <p> Why was Babar dropped ? ? ? Read the articles more closely boys ... he is injured it says ! <p> Stark62 on November 5 , 2013 , 10:49 GMT <p> @ Kassery That average of 35 by Sharjeel Khan is better than Shan Masood 's and Hafeez 's , plus he averages 52.81 in in one days and 29.89 in T20 's . <p> His one day and T20 averages are outstanding considering he is a dasher and likes to get on with the game , plus I believe his one day average is the highest currently and that to as an opener . <p> most of the comments were posted before full article was published that is why many of us were not sure about zulfiqar baber . <p> Over all good selection . but interesting to see playing 11 . Are they going with 4 spinners as they have 3 spinning all rounders . <p> Malik has always been a good domestic performer . but in last couple of years he has been poor . let us see if he makes it count this time . <p> Will be hard to get in Maqsood in playing 11 . They will go as usual with umar amin and senior guys . <p> tough on haris sohail and anwar ali as they have not played many games but left out . <p> on November 5 , 2013 , 10:32 GMT <p> why rehman in t20 ? where is raza hassan ? i think selectors think about 2014 t20 world cup and picking up old faces . pakistan need new blood , like hammad azam or make uamr amin a good all rounder. ( please no more spin all-rounder like malik ) . <p> Kassery on November 5 , 2013 , 10:30 GMT <p> Short memory ! Babar split the webbing in his left hand during the Test and is not fit . Sharjeel Khan has an average of around 35 in domestic cricket . Is this the best Pakistan can do ? Razzak is a good inclusion and Shoaib Malik has a calm head which also makes him a good inclusion but he must be given a chance to bowl as well . Nasir Jamshed is potentially world class but has completely lost confidence . He must be invested in for the future and dropping him will not help him or Pakistan . <p> sehgalzeeshan on November 5 , 2013 , 10:27 GMT <p> zulfiqar babar is injured <p> TheProfPak on November 5 , 2013 , 10:23 GMT <p> @corneredagain &amp; Danish Shakeel : Did you read the article ? It states that ZB is out due to injury . However , I would prefer Reza Hassan over AB Rehman . He was brilliant against Aussies in UAE in his debut series . <p> on November 5 , 2013 , 10:23 GMT <p> It 's outstanding to see Abdul Razzaq in the squad . He should also be pick for upcoming ODI matches &amp; for 2015 World Cup . <p> on November 5 , 2013 , 10:18 GMT <p> It seems PAKISTANI FANS do not follow cricket . Firstly stop murmering about Zulfiqar Babar he is out due to hand injury . Secondly , you should know the amout of talent MALIK have which was wasted by management and yet you are not producing any such talent to replace him xept Umar Akmal ( who is being wasted by giving Wicket Keeping ) . Plus MALIK is brilliant in every domestic tournament far above any other young talent . <p> on November 5 , 2013 , 10:17 GMT <p> For all " analysts " debating how can they drop Zulfiqar babar , please read the whole article once before commenting ; It is clearly written that : " Zulfiqar Babar was ruled out of selection because of the hand-injury he suffered during the recently concluded Test series . " <p> All in all a good selection , from available pool of players .. ! ! <p> Stark62 on November 5 , 2013 , 10:17 GMT <p> Zulfiqar Babar was sensational against the Windies and was great against Zimb too , so why is he dropped ? <p> Also , where is Gul ? ! ? ! <p> Just when I thought Malik would never return , he gets his one millionth chance and Hammad is the future of Pak , plus a viable replacement for Razzaq but unfortunately , he is not being given a chance . <p> on November 5 , 2013 , 10:15 GMT <p> Not a fan of Malik -- At this stage though , it is a sound decision . I think Pakistan will win t20 series . <p> on November 5 , 2013 , 10:12 GMT <p> good selection only i would zulfiqar should have been in , but no problem with the squad bcoz abdur rehman is also a good player <p> somethingdifferent on November 5 , 2013 , 10:12 GMT <p> Wait till we see Imran Farhat and Kamran Akmal back in the next couple of series . <p> alipk52 on November 5 , 2013 , 10:11 GMT <p> Ohh here comes my Pakistan 's most favorite player Abdul Razzaq , without any doubt we are in serious need of him since this year ... Heartiest welcome to you ... finally something good happened for Pakistan cricket , even if he do n't score big , i can say he 's still remain big asset of Pakistan cricket right now , though i am not happy with the re inclusion of Malik , Need to throw in some deserving new talent from domestic , there are plenty if you believe me , despite poor performances by current batting line ( excluding Misbah and Umar akmal ) our selectors from past 3 years keep on choosing same players in different series , this is the reason of serious demise of our batting line , Razzaq at least should be included in all 3 forms of the games . He is only clean hitter in the team ! no Afridi no amin ever again . <p> why is Jamsheed and Amin been given so many chances ? We have Sharjeel Khan and he is the best opener in Pakistan ( i think one of the best on the world ) , hwere is Hammad Azam and Raza Hassan ? when will we give preference to talent ? <p> corneredagain on November 5 , 2013 , 10:02 GMT <p> why is zulifiqar Babar out ? <p> on November 5 , 2013 , 10:01 GMT <p> malik should not be a part of team . and how come zulfiqar baber out ? he was man of series in his t20 series . even misbah is better than malik . and haris is also a very talented batsman . i ask why they not slect raza . <p> Happy for Razzaq to ba back but Malik should be kept out as he is worthless . <p> on November 5 , 2013 , 10:00 GMT <p> I simply do n't understand why Zulfiqar Babar is dropped from the squad.He gave good performance in Zimbabwe tour both with the ball and with the bat.I must say poor selection <p> mzm149 on November 5 , 2013 , 9:56 GMT <p> No Anwar Ali , Asad Shafiq , Sarfraz Ahmed . <p> @Faizan Khan must be sad . Where are you ? <p> CaptainTukTuk on November 5 , 2013 , 9:48 GMT <p> Interesting to see how they make playing 11 from this squad . 4 all-rounders including captain himself will be part of the squad I think , Hafeez , Afridi , Razzaq , Malik . I want to see Shoaib Masood in playing 11 and Nasir Jamshed should n't be part of squad let alone making it to playing 11 and last but not the least its injustice with Zulifqar Babar he should be in the squad and Umar Ameen should have been dropped . <p> on November 5 , 2013 , 9:46 GMT <p> Raza Hasan could have been a good choice instead of Abdur Rehman . Good to see Razzaq is back in the team but playing under the captaincy of Hafeez is the main problem for Razzaq . And i must say i really feel for poor Haris Shail , this young lad has n't given many chances to prove himself yet . <p> I dnt know on what basis , selector select these two players , Pakistan 's T20 squad is very impressive and improving the team ranking , youngsters are feeling secure and confident my sealing the victory on some very good teams but now again they want to change the squad to disturb the batting order . And the result will be they start losing their ranking . Shoib Malik never improved his blowing and batting is only agaist weak teams or in leagure and domastic while Razak play good knocks occasionally . May God give some sense to selectors who never look to polish their youngsters . <p> huhohuhohuho on November 5 , 2013 , 9:33 GMT <p> firstly not good selection . i can understand razzaq but y shoaib malik he has failed many times and always gives the same excuses his career shows this . i do nt understan what haris sohail has done to get dropped from both t 20 and odi side . Secondly zulfiqar was not selected because of his hand injury . the team should be jamshed , ahmed , hafeez , sohaib , amin , umar , afridi , razzaq , tanvir , irfan , ajmal <p> MuddassarBaig on November 5 , 2013 , 9:28 GMT <p> It is really good to see that Abdul Razzaq is finally selected for t20s .... Hope he will perform good and approve his right selection for this format ... Wish to see him in final 11 ... <p> HassanU on November 5 , 2013 , 9:27 GMT <p> THE T20 STAR ABDUL RAZZAZ IS BACK .... hope to see him in the ODI side too . <p> on November 5 , 2013 , 9:24 GMT <p> Oh Thank God ! ! ! They are back.They are the most senior players of the pakistani side they should be regularly a part of t20 odi and test side ! ! ! <p> qaaaaasiiiiimmmmmmm on November 5 , 2013 , 9:24 GMT <p> shoaib malik should be out.If u want to give youngster a chance , then haris sohail is the man , not umar amin.What nonsence is it not to put zulfiqar babar.Where is Raza Hassan ? i think raza hassan better than rehman <p> on November 5 , 2013 , 9:24 GMT <p> Finally Abdul Razzaq is back . One of the best finishers Masha Allah . Ca n't wait to see him in action . <p> on November 5 , 2013 , 9:19 GMT <p> Also select Razzaq for the remaining ODIs . <p> ShahbazAlam on November 5 , 2013 , 9:19 GMT <p> thank you selectors for selection of Abdul Razzaq Plz give them proper chance i.e. all four T20s i.e. in UAE and in SA too . Mr. Hafeez plz utlize the best out of Razzaq and Malik Thank you <p> on November 5 , 2013 , 9:13 GMT <p> Looks like Pakistan team is now looking to go with experience rather than giving youngsters more chances , All those who are left are youngsters and those who are in are the experienced campaigners , looks like they are building a very experienced team for next years WORLD T20 . <p> Rahul78 on November 5 , 2013 , 9:13 GMT <p> And the Pak selection circus rattles along . How many chances did the dropped guys get ? Particularly Haris and Babar . If you do nt give chances to youngsters even to fail at the job how do you expect them to learn and grow in the role . I am a neutral but it pains me to see Pakistan with all its mercurial talents and passionate supporters fail to evolve into a world class team and have to leave with the tag of mercurial and inconsistent . Malik has had ample opportunities in the past but has nt lived up to his potential . His record is ordinary . Would n't it be wise to groom youngsters in his spot for future . Tomorrow with new board chief and new selection committee even few more of the current lot will be shown the door . MSD is an admired skipper in Pakistan but you should remember he has a habit of backing the youngsters to the hilt and to give them chance to learn on the job . With the ocean of talent in Pak if selection priorities are set right some new world beaters will surely emerge . <p> on November 5 , 2013 , 9:10 GMT <p> Shaun Pollock correctly predicted that Malik and Razzaq will return to the T20 side against SA last week on a TV show . <p> These 2 players should also play regularly in ODIs and Tests to take some burden out of Misbah 's shoulders <p> on November 5 , 2013 , 9:02 GMT <p> The Pakistani team is definitely complete now but I do n't get on what basis were these players selected ? The " recent matches " performance is pretty modest for both these players . And I would like to Haris Sohail come in instead of Malik or Umar Amin . <p> romirom on November 5 , 2013 , 9:02 GMT <p> same old story for selection . Malik is good only for domestic cricket . Razak is to old for cum back . Should give proper chance to young player . <p> Ghazanfarr on November 5 , 2013 , 8:59 GMT <p> hi , its pleasure for pakistani fans for come back of Razzaq , he is great all rounder but Pakistan could not use his ability . we hop he wil perform and create his permanent place in Pakistan squad . May Allah help him . <p> Rabiulhasan on November 5 , 2013 , 8:58 GMT <p> Zulfiqar Babar out ! why ? <p> on November 5 , 2013 , 8:58 GMT <p> What utter nonsense to include Malik ! ! ! He is the biggest HAS BEEN of the cricketing world along with Imran Farhat . Ca n't stand this ! ! ! He is no allrounder , because he never bowls , because he is not needed to . Better to include a specialist batsman or bowler . Where is to logic of excluding Babar ... ! ! ! <p> on November 5 , 2013 , 8:58 GMT <p> Finally Razzaq is back , , Thank God .. Hope he does his best to return to ODI Squad as well . . <p> karny1 on November 5 , 2013 , 8:58 GMT <p> why Shoaib Malik again ? ? ? <p> Why cant the Pakistan selectors move on and try different players instead of returning back to the same old individuals who have failed time and time again . <p> on November 5 , 2013 , 8:57 GMT <p> realy gud to see raaza bhai back in da team ... hope he wil perform well in t20 to retain his place : ) <p> on November 5 , 2013 , 8:57 GMT <p> I hope they play Razzaq and Malik now , they can play an essential part in the upcoming T20 WC . <p> Z.Saleem on November 5 , 2013 , 8:55 GMT <p> why to leave Babar out , after good performances they should have retained him instead of the ever non-performing Malik or Rehman <p> on November 5 , 2013 , 8:54 GMT <p> the " Dhoom Dhoom " abddul razaq back into green shirts .. good to see .. <p> on November 5 , 2013 , 8:54 GMT <p> razaq is back which is good but malik ? malik is always a good domestic performer but he has failed on intl level in recent past . any way hope he makes it count this time . <p> harsh on likes of haris sohail , anwar ali . <p> and how come zulfiqar baber out ? he was man of series in his t20 series . i guess with ajmal , afridi , hafeez , malik in , baber would have not made in playing 11.

We saw an SUV heading towards us through deep waters and stopped by . <p> A sturdy middle aged man got off the car and moved towards us to offer consolation .

Do not go for corruption to make another trillions and can expect enough financial support from the party . They have their own mouths to feed or family to look after . <p> People fail to realize that life of an MQM legislator is not an easy one unlike for someone living in Lahore and Islamabad with billions in account balances .

I fully respect his decision and I pray that he put his issues in order and get back as soon as he can . <p> Pessimistic of me to think it , but I am sure we have a dearth of such leaders in the country and Syed Mustafa Kamal brings that punch to MQM leadership . However , lets what fate has in store for MQM but let me thank Syed Mustufa Kamal once again . <p> Two self contradictory statements !
