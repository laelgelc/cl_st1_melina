@@1639230 <h> Glycemic Index Explained <p> By Dr. Harold Gunatillake Health Writer <p> The Glycemic Index ( GI ) is a way of classifying the glucose content derived from the carbohydrate foods we consume . The test is done one to two hours after eating 50 Gms of the food and checking on blood glucose level , which is then compared with and indexed with glucose which is considered having an index of 100% . <p> It is a response characterised by the effect foods have on blood sugar levels after eating . The main foods that cause a glycemic response are carbohydrates . Foods that have carbohydrates are : Breads , Asian foods cooked in wheat flour and rice flour , pastries , cereals , grains , legumes , rice , noodles , pasta , fruits , vegetables and high carbohydrate processed foods . <p> Glycaemic Index ( GI ) can be used as a guide as long as you are aware of the limitations . For example , the GI of some fruits , vegetables and cereals can be higher than foods that are considered to be treats , such as biscuits and cakes . <p> This does not mean that we can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in nutrients and antioxidants , and the latter are not . Also Glycaemic load ( GL ) has to be considered which means the amount of the specific cooked carbohydrate eaten . The glycaemic index of food is a ranking of foods based on their immediate effect on blood glucose ( blood sugar ) levels . <p> Carbohydrate foods that breakdown quickly during digestion have the highest glycemic indexes . Their blood sugar response is fast and high . Carbohydrates that breakdown slowly , releasing glucose gradually into the blood stream , have low glycemic indexes . Those who eat carbohydrates of high glycaemic index ( GI ) regularly , i.e. an index over 60 are most probably , sure candidates to become diabetics especially those with a family history . <p> Eating high GI foods regularly , such as white rice having a GI index of 87 , or cooked carrots and baked potatoes , GI of 85 , or white bread of GI 70 , or products cooked with wheat flour , such as string hoppers , hoppers , pittus , roties , are the sure candidates to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel happy that there is one imported variety of rice -- basmati -- that has only a GI index of 57 ( proviso , you restrict the load ) . <p> The reason attributed to such lower GI for this variety of rice , is due to the high amylose content , which tends to release glucose much slowly than the other varieties of rice . It is also observed that ' round rice ' has a higher GI than ' long grain rice ' , for the same reason . Samba rice being round grained has a very high GI , whilst any long grain rice has lower GI indexes . Brown and red rice have a slightly lower GI ( 75 ) , than the white rice -- GI 80 . People now tend to eat more brown or red rice in excess , being considered healthy , thus jeopardising the goodness . <p> Mashed potatoes have a GI of 90 : Cooked carrots have a GI of 85 : Breakfast corn flakes have a GI of 85 : Chocolate bars have a GI of 70 ; snack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should eat very little , sparingly , the above-mentioned high GI indexed foods . For the chocolate lovers , dark chocolates have a GI index of 22 ( over 60% cocoa ) , and a regular bite is recommended . <p> Noodles , pasta and spaghetti , have a GI index below 60 , preferable to eat regularly instead of white rice . Chinese eat a bowl of boiled noodles every two hours and remain slim , and the incidence of diabetes among them is low . Among those foods with low GI of 30 , are best considered for diabetics , and obese subjects . They are lentils , green gram , peas , dried beans , two-minute noodles , soups , all fruits , green vegetables , tomatoes , lemon , and mushrooms . It is unlikely that people who eat these low GI foods will acquire diabetes . <p> There is also evidence that a low GI diet can help control diabetes , help people to lose weight and lower blood lipids ( fats ) and improve the body 's sensitivity to insulin by keeping blood glucose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The GI testing is done only for carbohydrates , and not for proteins and fats . Simple ways to change to a low GI diet : Include at least one low GI food at each meal . <p> * Switch onto breakfast cereals based on barley , oats , and wheat and rice bran . Avoid cocoa-pops and cereals made from rice and wheat with added sugar . <p> * Eat grainy breads made with whole seeds , barley and oats , instead of white or brown bread . Unfortunately , these varieties are not available in Sri Lanka . <p> * Favour less processed foods and foods that are n't over cooked , as processing and cooking makes food easier to digest . Further , overcooked browned food has a high content of ' Acryl amide ' a proved cancer-producing chemical when fed to animals . <p> Avoid the frozen food open freezers in super-markets . These freezers are full of over-cooked , processed food with added ' trans-fats . ' <p> Eat fiber because it helps slow the digestion and absorption of carbohydrates . High GI foods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ low GI foods slows down the absorption of glucose from any high GI foods eaten at the same time . <p> This is important , as most foods are eaten as a meal and this mixing affects the GI value of the food . It is also observed that high GI foods cooked in oils ( fried rice ) will get digested and absorbed much slower as glucose into the blood stream . <p> This does not mean that we recommend foods cooked in oil to be eaten all the time . <p> The Glycemic Indices of a few carbohydrate containing foods have been researched by the Department of BioChemistry , Faculty of Medicine Science , University of Sri Jayewardenapura , Nugegoda , Sri Lanka , and some of them have been detailed below .

The OIC of the police station told us they were under ' strict instructions ' not to divulge any details .

The efforts of Asian Tribune , to expose highly tainted In June , detained Fonseka was implicated for the first time as a suspect in the HiCorp case and was ordered to be produced before Colombo Fort Magistrate on 23 June , after being named as the third suspect in the case filed by the Police Criminal Investigations Department ( CID ) . Meanwhile Fonseka 's son-in-law Dhanuna Thilakaratna who is first accused in the case which involves illegal arms dealings , is said to have fled the country . <p> Police uncover major scandal <p> It was well-known that Danuna Tilakaratne had obtained commissions for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time that Gen. Fonseka was at the helm of the Sri Lanka Army . <p> In February this year , Police Criminal Investigations Department ( CID ) probed bank accounts and safe deposit lockers belonging to Danuna Tilakaratne , being maintained at a private bank in Colombo . Fort Magistrate and Additional District Judge , Lanka Jayaratne ordered the Controller General of Immigration and Emigration to prohibit Thilakarane from leaving the country . Allegation against him was that he has a hand in with the infamous Hicorp International and its arms procurement deals with Army . <p> Credit goes to Asian Tribune and its Editor K T Rajasingham for not giving up their fight against corruption <p> A motion requesting anticipatory bail submitted by Danuna Thilakaratne in terms of Section 21 of the Anticipatory Bail Act of 1997 , was rejected by the Magistrate , stating that there was a possibility of the applicant absconding the judiciary as he had so far failed to make a statement to the CID . The applicant brought it to the notice of the Court that he applied bail from Court as there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ committing offences under Sections 453 and 403 of the Penal Code . <p> CID reported to Court that the applicant was a suspect in a case where he was charged to have had submitted forged documents to Sri Lanka Army when it had called for tenders for the procurement of arms . <p> The CID also brought to the notice of the Court that anticipatory bail could not be granted as there was a possibility of the applicant being charged for offences committed in terms of the Offences against Public Properties Act No. 12 of 1982 . <p> The Magistrate said that the Magistrate Court did not have the jurisdiction to grant bail in respect of the Offences against Public Properties Act . <p> Hypocrisy <p> The Asian Tribune reported on January 25 , 2010 in its exclusive article titled ' Corruption-tainted General 's erection-problem will have him ' how Fonseka continuously threatened , both publicly as well as clandestinely , the police and other officials who came out with information about arms deal of his son-in-law and how he squandered the public money , in spite of portraying himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Many of those officers ' who are investigating the arms deal , exposed for the first time by the Asian Tribune , that Fonseka had threatened the investigating officers to be ready to book their cells either in the Bogampara or Welikade prisons to spend rest of their lives . <p> " The man who shouts at the top of his voice in his political rallies , will he put an end to corruption in the country , once he is elected -- this he is yet to make an announcement . Also on what he will do with his son-in-law , when he is elected ?

In reality he was person with multiple personalities and faces . <p> " Corruption , sexually molesting young country lasses , wife beating , threatening , intimidating , abducting , and killing are his second nature , all reported in the columns of the Web paper . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of law will ever prevail in the country under President Fonseka ? " questioned the writer . <p> Tilakaratne tampering with investigations ? <p> Once notice was sent to him Sarath Fonseka in an election rally warned that senior officers of the Armed and the Police who are engaged in election campaign will have to find new jobs after January 27 . <p> But following the warning there was suddenly an announcement from the police which said that CID had reportedly said that they are busy on the scheduled day of the statement and had asked Danuna Tillekaratne to show up on a different day . <p> However it has been proved beyond doubt that Danuna Tilakaratne was involved in Arms dealing and amassed wealth - which can not be accounted and he needs to be brought before a court of law and investigated further . <p> Other tainted dealings of Fonseka <p> Former Army Commander General Hamilton Wanasinghe joined Sarath Fonseka at a rally in Nittambuwa . He was the Commander of the Sri Lanka Army from 1988 to 1991 . After retirement Gen. Hamilton Wanasinghe ran the Gajasakthi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tilakaratne functioned as the Manager . <p> When Sarath Fonseka was the Commander of the Army Gajasakthi Security firm supplied the boots and shoes required to the Sri Lanka Army . Surprisingly , ( or unsurprisingly ) o tenders were called and a reasonable percentage of the commission was given to Danuna Tilakaratne . <p> As a gratitude to the business offered by Sarath Fonseka , Hamiliton Wanasinghe came out to support Sarath Fonseka . Also he expected , in case Sarath becomes the President he might expect more business from him . <p> Army vehicle sales racket <p> Asian Tribune learnt that Sarath Fonseka when he was the Commander of the Army forced the Army Board to condemn many Army vehicles which were in fine running conditions and subsequently sold them to his own people . We have already reported about a case of such act in the Asian Tribune 's January 9 article titled " Land rover accident bares Sarath Fonseka 's longstanding plan to challenge his commander - in -- chief " <p> Asian Tribune further learnt that another three Landrovers were condemned and sold in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 909/9 Adikaram Mawatha , Ettulkotte , Kotte , a relative of the UNP strongman Ravi Karunanayake bought these vehicles dirt cheap . Now that we come up with more and more allegations about Danuna Tilakaratne the arms dealer son-in law of Sarath Fonseka and as far as Asian Tribune is concerned it is an open and shut case . <p> The police arrested Randy DeHoedt , ( Danuna Tilakeratne 's manager ) . Also according to information Police has already interrogated Lakshman Abeyasekera , the Director of HiCorp Company of the Arms Dealer in Colombo . Also it is learnt that they have summoned a few others also for investigation on the subject of Danuna Tilakaratne 's Arms deals . <p> False documents submitted for tenders <p> In " Every bullet fired at innocent Tamil civilians fetched kickbacks to Gen Fonseka family " published on November 22 , 2009 , Asian Tribune exclusively reported that Hicorp and British Bourneo - Companies registered by Danuna Tilakaratne in Oklahoma , USA , had submitted false evidence to win tenders they had submitted in Sri Lanka to the Army , Navy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business in Oklahoma , as well as in Texas . Also he registered his business in Colombo too . <p> He registered Hicorp Company in Oklahoma in his name , but suddenly on Nov 16 , 2009 , he changed the registration in favor of some other person apparently after he got the wind of Asian Tribune 's investigations into his dealings . In Colombo Danuna registered his business under the name of Lakshman Abeysekara . <p> Lakshman Abeysekara is just a name . The actual registration was done through a lawyer Mr. A.S.H.A Hanan . This lawyer made some kind of deal with Danuna Thilakaratne as a silent partner of the company in Sri Lanka . Detail of this registration is given in this column . <p> Danuna 's company in Oklahoma shows Ruwinda Gunaratne is a director with effect from Nov 16 . Ruwinda is the son of Vice Air Marshal Channa Gunaratne , Director Planning in the Sri Lankan Air Force . <p> Ruwinda used to live with Danuna . That was long time back . On Nov 16 , he was not in the US as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tribune 's investigation . Yet , Danuna , on 16th November went to the State Secretary 's Office and changed the name of the company to Ruwinda Gunaratne 's name . <p> Forging signatures <p> How could he do this ? By simply forging the documents ! Danuna forged the signatures of Ruwinda and got the company changed to his name . But Ruwinda was not aware of these changes . Danuna also put some other Sri Lankans ' addresses without the knowledge of those Sri Lankans . <p> Danuna Thilakaratne does not have an Alien Residency in US ( Green Card ) , but he does have a H1B visa . ( If you are a Foreign national who wants to live and Work in the USA , you need to get HIB Visa ) He had filed that H1B visa through a company which does not even exist in the US . <p> What Danuna did for the tax ? It is suspected that he forged documents and on that basis submitted his tax returns . <p> Danuna stayed in his home in Oklahoma ( his wife stays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There is a gang in this field -- a brigadier identified as Fydel Meedin , Colonel Col Rohan Wijesundara and many others . <p> Danuna Thilakaratne minted millions of US dollars from contracts secured from the security forces of Sri Lanka .

And he minted millions of dollars . All because his father-in-law was the Army Commander ! <p> After this company information surfaced on the internet , Danuna Thillakeratne went to the State Secretary Office in Oklahoma at 4.59PM November 16th/ ( or through one his agents , it is unclear he managed it ) and forged the signature of Ruwinda Gunaratne and changed the name of registered agent by signing as a president for the company and forging Ruwinda Gunaratne 's signature and address as ( Ruwinda was in Sri Lanka when he changed the agents name and address ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you will see 2 different signatures for Ruwinda Gunaratne . Danuna forged the signature . He should go to jail for this . He also changed the address to 1925 Bradford Way . <p> Company In Texas . <p> Danuna Thilakaratne registered another company in Texas as British Borneo Defence . <p> Hicorp appears to be a fictitious company created with forged document . The company appears to have been floated for the exclusive purpose of cornering orders/tenders from army , navy , air force , and the police <p> Kickbacks from Every Bullet Fired <p> Danuna Thilakaratne , who married Apsara , eldest daughter of Gen Sarath Fonseka , ( she lives in Oklahoma ) profited from every bullet fired in the war as the exclusive agent of the Pakistani arms dealer and ISI agent Ahmed Nissar . <p> The ISI agent stays rent free in Danuna Thilakeratne 's flat in Central Colombo . Danuna purchased the flat for 1.5 million US dollars . <p> As agent of Pakistan arms dealer , Danuna received 2 cents for every bullet procured and $ 20 for every shell . <p> How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ millions as the Wanni War was a very major military campaign that lasted for more than three years , when President Mahinda Rajapaksa declared a fight to finish humanitariagn Campaign against the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam ( LTTE ) . <p> The Wanni confrontation created him a multi millionaire overnight . The bullets fired by our soldiers in the defence of the country and to remove terrorism scourge enriched the pockets of the family of the very General , who was leading the campaign of the Sri Lankan forces . <p> Danuna Thilakeratne 's company Hicorp is made up of relatives of former army Commander . It was involved in the purchase of MIGs from Ukraine , uniform and telecommunication equipment from China , food rations from Malaysia and tank transporters from Russia . <p> Hicorp also supplied ration packs , which were past their shelf life and bought cheaply from a Malaysian Tamil who had imported them from China . That put the Sri Lankan soldiers in the front line at risk while from the profits and kickbacks from the sale enabled Danuna Thilakaratne and his friends feast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and USA . <p> Forging Bank Guarantees <p> Even the bank guarantee forms Danuna Thilakeratne 's company submitted were fudged . Hicorp altered and printed fudged bank guarantee forms , it appears , without the knowledge of the bank . <p> In the Army HEAD QUARTERS offices , we learn , a few Generals and others got involved in the Hicorp deals under the instruction of Gen Fonseka and covered up the issue . Gen Thoradeniya and Gen Mahesh Senanayake , Gen Jayanath Perera , Brig Fydel Meedin and Col Rohan Wijesundara are the names mentioned in this connection . <p> Tampering with Army Head Quarters Security System contract Contract for Army Head Quarters security camera system was awarded to Hicorp ( Nexsel -- British Borneo Defence ) under the influence of Gen Fonseka . The company failed to implement the system as specified in the agreement but Gen Fonseka ordered the Army to allow them to finish the work at extra cost which helped Hicorp and some Brigadiers make millions . <p> Gen Fonseka ignored the fact that Hicorp never had any experience in installing a security camera system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Colombo ! <p> The system started to fall apart even before the Army made the payment to Hicorp . But nobody questioned fearing the ire of the General . <p> Col Rohan Wijesundara influenced the decisions of the tender boards ; he also issued a special pass to Randy DeHoedt , ( Danuna Tilakeratne 's manager ) to come and go as he wished to the Army Head Quarters . <p> Gas Mask Deal <p> The Gas mask deal was also given to Danuna Thilakeratne 's company . <p> The tender board was pressurized by General Sarath Fonseka to favor his son-in-law 's company ; he threatened to charge officers if they did not cooperate with his son-in-law and his manager Randy DeHoedt . <p> Now a few questions arise and only General Sarath Fonseka can answer them <p> Danuna 's Dubious Investments <p> Danuna Thilakaratne started a new Salon in Kirulapana , Sri Lanka besides a Salon at Las Vegas , USA , Night Club at Holiday Inn , Sri Lanka , Beach Hotel in Negambo Sri Lanka , Communication Company in London , and Salon in Galle Face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Sri Lankan stock markets . Where did he get this money ? Gen Fonseka should be asked for a reply . <p> The Former Army Commander got President Fund scholarship for his daughter to study in the USA though the scholarship is meant for poor students . He used to get his son-in-law 's economy class air ticket upgraded to the first class on the National Carrier Sri Lankan Airlines . This upgrading was not limited to his son-in-law alone . The General 's entire family and their friends got upgrades for more than 50 times when Fonseka was the Army Commander . <p> The General 's official vehicle with commando guards in tow was used by the son-in-law for his personal purpose and for his business visits . It has also transpired that Fonseka granted SL Army intelligence money to political campaigns . <p> So eventually though portraying himself as a crusader against corruption , Sarath Fonseka was in fact the opposite .

Dissanayake <p> While the Sri Lankan government was fighting for control of the North , it had already lost control of many of its universities . " During the last 40 years , the politicians did not sight our universities , " said Minister S.B. Dissanayake in a recent newspaper interview . When Minister Dissanayake did set foot in Peradeniya University in July , he was greeted by protests from the IUSF student union . The two have been locked in a battle ever since . This tension has escalated as student groups occupied the Higher Education Ministry , assaulted the Vice Chancellor of Ruhuna University , assaulted students trying to take an exam , and staged numerous protests . The government , in turn , arrested IUSF ( Inter University Students Federation ) Convenor Udul Premaratne , arrested other students , deployed hundreds of police to Rajarata University and broke up protests violently , even attacking journalists . " Not only one or two , in the process of restructuring our universities , we will punish even 500 or for that matter even 1,000 students @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take up the mantle of defending students , but its own reputation for violence and political influence has caused many to question its intentions .

" On one side they 're harassing students , staff , lecturers , vice chancellors , even the Minister is threatened . They 're hitting the Vice Chancellor . The situation is against law of the country . " As The Sunday Leader reached IUSF Convenor Udul Premaratne for comment , he was being arrested . The 32 year old dental school drop-out was taken in after a meeting with the opposition UNP , according to Sanjeeva Bandara of the IUSF , who later answered his phone .

For the last 30 years , almost all the governments tried to reduce the expenditure to education and quality , they did n't really try to improve the system . " Indeed , National List MP and economist Harsha de Silva noted that the Ministry of Defence was growing faster than the education budget in a recent newspaper interview .

@@1694237 <h> The Fight For A Humane Drug Policy <p> By Abdul H. Azeez <p> A national drug policy is needed to prevent imposition of branding <p> On Thursday , the Health Minister announced that the Sri Lankan government plans to introduce a National Drug Policy ' stepwise ' from next year . Addressing the local media , Health Minister Maithripala Sirisena said the National Drug Policy will incorporate all the proposals set forth by the late Prof. Senaka Bibile . Minister Sirisena said the government has taken several measures during the past six months to remedy the drug shortage in government hospitals and improve facilities at hospitals , to provide a better health service to the patients . The Senaka Bibile Principles were initially introduced in the early ' 70s and has since met with much support and opposition in the intervening years . The Bibile Principles <p> Professor Senaka Bibile 's policy advocacy with regard to a national drug policy created waves even in the international arena . The World Health Organisation still lists it on its website as an ideal place to start for anyone looking at drug policy reform for a developing country . The recent campaign is only a part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four decades , attempting to push through these policies to prominence . It has met opposition from various quarters and pro-Bibile policy makers , medical professionals and associations have squared off with drug companies , pro-brand medical professionals and associations . The battle between branded and unbranded drug advocates is nothing new . The drug industry has been ridden with debate and conflict over the same issue for decades . The main objectives of his policy were : <p> 1 . To ensure the availability and affordability of effective , safe and good quality medicines relevant to the health care needs of the people in a sustainable and equitable manner . <p> 2 . To promote the rational use of medicines by healthcare professionals and consumers . <p> 3 . To promote local manufacture of essential medicines . <p> These policies are therefore basically aimed at reducing the high cost of medicines that most people can not afford . Generic drugs are listed out and drugs are recommended to be sold under their generic names to prevent the imposition of branding and ' value addition ' to the industry , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Branding Cuts Both Ways <p> Branding generally plays a double edged role . On the one hand , a good brand assures a quality product while on the other hand , good brands can be sold at a premium . When it comes to medicines though , brands can sometimes play a detrimental role because of the sheer power of the sellers of branded drugs and also the lack of information on the part of the patient on which drug to buy . This is where the medical professionals come in . It is their role to recommend drugs and medical services as they see fit . The issue here is that medical professionals can choose to side with either the big drug marketing firms and promote branded drugs to patients , or they can choose to side with patients and recommend cheap generic drugs . A representative of the PMRP told The Sunday Leader that medical professionals are one of the main promotional tools used by drug companies . There also appears to be rampant corruption through bribery . ' Doctors are often rewarded with free trips abroad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ medical professionals getting their ethics misplaced is a serious one . But on the other hand , concerns based on quality problems of generic drugs are still valid as drug fraud and duplication is rampant worldwide . Therefore , the government must step in to provide the necessary quality assurance to the market . Senaka Bibile established the State Pharmaceutical Corporation for this reason . Resurgence And Delay <p> In 2005 March , the Minister of Health invited Dr. Krishanta Weerasuriya of WHO SEARO , Delhi , to facilitate a three day workshop to develop a National Medicine and Drug Policy ( NMDP ) . All stakeholders , including the Ministry of Health , associations of health professionals , trade unions , academia , the private sector , pharmaceutical trade and industry and civil society and patients groups were invited to the workshop , where a first draft of the NMDP was prepared . In July 2005 , the minister convened a similar workshop to finalise the draft . <p> The second draft , accepted by consensus of all participants , was finalised and presented to the Minister of Health @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon setup a Standing Committee ( SC ) to implement , the NMDP . The SC appointed a sub-committee to draft an act to provide for the establishment of the National Medicinal Drug Authority ( NMDRA ) to implement the NMDP . The subcommittee presented the draft act to the Minister in mid 2009 . Since the draft , NMDP was handed over the Minister of Health , the PMRP has continued to inform and educate the public on the benefits of the policy that they say will make quality drugs at affordable costs available to all who need them . However , in spite of the promise in the Mahinda Chintanaya to " reactivate Bibile Policies " and repeated promises by the Minister of Health to implement the NMDP based on Bibile polices , an implementation of these polices has been long in coming . This delay is not totally unexpected . The NMDP , is a process of social transformation , one that tries to reorder an existing deep-rooted , deeply entrenched in pro brand advocacy . The then Minister Nimal Siripala De Silva had told public meetings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the NMDP . Conclusion <p> " There are over 150 brands of paracetamol in Sri Lanka , " says the PMRP representative . " There are also many unnecessary brands , while only 700 are required for this country 's medical needs . This has created confusion amongst patients and has even led to doctors prescribing brands of the same generic drug in one prescription . " On the other hand , individuals and associations opposed to the implementation of the Bibile policies state that most of its advocacy is now outdated and unsuited to modern times . They also say that identifying generic drugs is tricky and can be detrimental to patients . However , it appears that the Bibile policy reforms have garnered massive support over the years with several international organisations having propounded it as ideal for developing countries . But there are barriers to implementing it . And perhaps these barriers will be experienced by would-be policy implementers in the upcoming months .

It was not merely a story that The Sunday Leader published on February 21 , 2010 : it was a heartbreaking appeal by a young mother who begged us to get her sons back . " I am complete now , " she said last week as she held close her most cherished possessions , as if never to let them go ... The ordeal of bruised and battered Fathima Faika moved the nation when we published her story eight months ago . The response was overwhelming . Everyone wanted to know how they can help . Faika who had only her mother and ailing father for comfort soon found out that she had a whole support group who were moved by the article . Letters and emails flowed from Muslim support groups , individuals , professionals , housewives and mothers from everywhere . <p> Losing a child is the most painful loss and to experience it with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " My mother was ailing too .

I was told that they were taken out of Colombo and I travelled far and wide , but I could not find my sons , " recalled Fathima Faika . <p> After The Sunday Leader published " Prayers For My Sons " in its issue of February 21 , several wellwishers were in the forefront in the life of Fathima Faika . Dr. Mareena Thaha Reffai , Dr. M.G.M.S Zurfick who is a president of the Lions Club and Coordinator for Niyaz Moulavi , Advisor to the President on Muslim Affairs , Dr. Jeewan Thiyagarajah of the Human Rights Commission , Women in Need , several lawyers and women 's groups and Former Deputy Mayor of Colombo and presently a member of the Sri Lanka Haj Mission Azad Sally , despite all his public duties , were key people in her ' support group .

She could not remember when she had last eaten a square meal . <p> " Sometimes I used to walk the streets like a zombie . I went to every corner in Colombo , peered into every house and looked in every police station . I covered myself with an abaya and stood outside several boys ' schools and studied the face of each and every child till they left the school premises in a desperate search for my dear little sons . Then I would return home and throw myself on the pillow and cry till my whole body was wracked with pain and my chest was heavy and aching , " recalled Faika .

" I endured the torture , endured the beatings and endured the endless cooking and cleaning and fetching because of my sons who are ten and five years of age , " she said . <p> Fathima Faika had made 17 complaints to various authorities over the disappearance of her young sons . She however said that she wishes to pay a tribute to the Women and Children 's Bureau in Fort at the way they handled her complaints . " Their inquiries regarding my blood-splattered face were done in a professional manner . Even today , I can reach out to them , visit them and know that justice will always be meted out , the way it ought to be , " she said in confidence . <p> But though complaints about the disappearance of her sons were made to every authority in Sri Lanka , there was little or no progress .

We were all praying and crying .... praying that I got my sons back , " said Faika . <p> Fathima Faika 's sons disappeared from her life when she was at her mother 's house . She never saw a trace of them again . <p> Her prayers were answered when she received news that her sons were taken to Malaysia . According to a top police source at the Women and Children 's Bureau , consent from both parents was necessary before the names of children were entered into either passport for them to be taken overseas .

She did not talk to me about a fee , but wanted to get my children back for me , " said Faika , wiping tears of sorrow and joy . The first day in Malaysia was not good for Faika . She misplaced her jewellery . But nothing could slow her down . Everyone around her was shopping but this young woman 's focus was on her sons . Her life was about her sons . " Pursuing the matter with Interpol , I was also in contact with Shanika Wijesuriya , the lawyer from Women in Need who was helped me in a way I will always remember , " said Faika . <p> Faika trudged from the Bukit Aman Police Headquarters to meeting Malaysian lawyers .

With guidance from Sri Lanka 's Controller for Immigration and Emigration , W.A. Chulananda Perera I was able to bring my children back to Sri Lanka , " said Faika in relief . <p> When she returned to Sri Lanka last week , her sons safely tucked in her arms , there was a small crowd of well wishers , among them was Dr. M.G.M.S Zurfick .

@@1694240 <h> Bogeyman <p> MR 's dream haunted by SF/student unrest/International community <p> President defends CBSL circular warning depositors <p> Moves to delay UNP reforms convention <p> Government declares war on students <p> President Mahinda Rajapaksa is in the process of making grandiose preparations in view of his swearing ceremony scheduled for November 19 , 2010 . In our previous articles we stated that the venue was Anuradhapura and later changed to Hambantota . But now , it has been decided that the ceremony amidst a massive tamasha is to be held in Colombo at the Galle Face Green . To make this ceremony the greatest show on Earth , letters have been sent to all organisers from the SLFP Headquarters that every organiser shall bring along with him a thousand people and assemble at the Galle Face Green in order that the Galle Face will be a sea of heads on the day of the ceremony . <p> Sarath Fonseka AND Mahinda Rajapaksa <p> However the SLFP organisers have to abide by one condition , that is they can not bring their cell phones to the green . In other words they have to be without their cell phones for at least three hours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ questioning as to how they could hold the crowds together without cell phones for several hours . Even mustering a 1000 people would be difficult therefore they have pointed out . But Mahinda has put his foot down and said , he wo n't accept excuses ; his peremptory order shall be followed he has insisted . Mahinda who is nursing high hopes on his forthcoming ' greatest show on earth ' encountered an unforeseen misfortune . Mahinda who was doing everything possible to tell the crowds at the Galle Face Green about the number of development programmes he had launched , had taken steps to expedite the Hambantota Port project , the Norochcholai power project among others during this season . His dream was to open Norochcholai power grid project during this season , but to his great consternation a huge fire broke out there causing immense damage . Consequently his dream of opening this grid during the season before the swearing in ceremony seems to be shattered though repairs are being hastily done for the opening as scheduled regardless of the grave accident . It is significant to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a tour of China . Being the second mishap following the Karadiyanaru explosion , China too is in a quandary over these mysterious mishaps . It is certain that these mishaps would engage the attention of Mahinda when he has discussions with the Chinese leaders on his tour . Mahinda is also expected to draw China 's attention to the panel appointed by UN Secretary General Ban Ki Moon on Sri Lanka ( SL ) to look into war crime charges , and enlist their support to avert any adverse reactions emerging from the United Nations against Sri Lanka . Meanwhile , China is already deeply involved in vigorously attempting to halt a UN action contemplated against Burma . Mahinda is surely going to request China to help him similarly . Mahinda will be compelled to make this request in response to the recent announcement by the British Prime Minister David Cameron in the UK Parliament that a war crimes investigation in Sri Lanka is important and imperative . What is intriguing is , the British Premier made this announcement on the eve of the President 's UK tour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Peiris returned from UK after his tour to prepare the groundwork for the President 's impending visit to address the Oxford Union . The British PM 's statement implies that Dr. Peiris ' tour is a failure and the President 's UK tour too is therefore hanging in the balance . While this international chain of events are obstructing him , President 's dreams at home are also crashing . His other dream was to open the new Headquarters of the SLFP which is being constructed at Battaramulla after it was shifted from Darley Road . Minister Maithripala Sirisena the SLFP Secretary was overseeing this project . After this task was entrusted to President 's son Namal Rajapaksa and his Nil Balakaya , the Party Secretary has become distraught because from this action there are tell-tale signs that Namal is being groomed to take over the SLFP party headquarters . The power struggle relating to this construction is not a thing of the recent past . This had existed for a long time and harks back to the time of former President Chandrika Kumaratunga who laid the foundation stone for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the name of Mahinda Rajapaksa was not included in the list of names incorporated in the plaque though he was the Prime Minister at that time and also contributed towards the project . To everyone 's dismay however , this plaque suddenly disappeared one night . Chandrika pointed an accusing finger at Mahinda because she felt he must have arranged this as his name was not included . While this in-fighting was going on , Mahinda after becoming the President entrusted the completion of this construction to Minister Sirisena . Lately , this task had been taken away from him and given over to Namal . Though Minister Sirisena is disappointed , he has n't overtly demonstrated this . On the contrary , the Minister has suddenly become active and has begun holding discussions at the houses of every SLFP MP with regard to how best they could develop the party . Just as he was enthusiastic with his new programme , so was he cautious that he does not criticise the President . In fact , he had been extolling the President to the sky at every discussion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ action against him because according to the reports he received on Maithripala 's meetings , he had only praised the President and never criticised him . In any case , the President who can not be easily fooled is aware that the Minister Sirisena while holding meetings is building his power and popularity base within the party . Since of late Mahinda has made it a practice to attend every Parliamentary Consultative Committee meeting under his Ministries and initiating a friendly chat with the Opposition MPs . Last week when he attended the Consultative Committee meeting of his Finance Ministry , UNP MP John Amaratunge has questioned him on the newspaper advertisement of the Central Bank wherein the Bank has refused to hold itself responsible for the safety of the depositors ' monies in the banks and financial institutions duly registered with the Central Bank . He had told the President that the people are worried and in anguish over the notice . The President has then said , the government can not be making payments to depositors each time a bank goes bankrupt , and it is only part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then told him , in that case there is no difference between a duly registered financial institution and any other . When the President gave the same answer to him , Ranjan has again questioned him whether the depositors will not be paid even if the bankrupt bank is a state owned bank . The President clarified that state or non state banks , the notice applies ; the only option available is to claim the money through litigation . Amaratunge had then said , this will only encourage the public to deposit monies in illegal financial institutions as it implies that there is no difference between a state owned bank and a fraudster like Sakvithi . The President has replied that such a thing wo n't happen , and this is a financial policy followed all over the world and not confined only to Sri Lanka . Ranjan has then referred to the Wall Street collapse and how the US government paid compensation . The President 's reply to that was , Sri Lanka has n't so much money to pay . As the debate was heating up , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had jocularly asked whether there is n't an euphemism for the word ' soodhuwa ' which means gambling , because the government is earning colossal sums of money from this ' soodhuwa . ' Mahinda had then asked how else are you going to call soodhuwa ? ' Soodhuwa is soodhuwa . ' He had then asked Sumathipala whether he has a better term . When Thilanga became silent , the President had told him , Thilanga is the ideal man for researching on this . He had asked him to come with a euphemism at the next consultative meeting of the President . The President has then come out from the venue of the meeting into the special room where he has engaged Duminda Silva MP , John Amaratunge and Ranjan Ramanayake in a friendly chat . The President inquired from Ranjan as to what happened to his case . Ranjan after explaining briefly had gone off at a tangent and spoken about the impending decapitation of Sri Lankan housemaid Rizana in Saudi Arabia who had been found guilty under the Saudi laws , and asked from the President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has admitted it is very pathetic but it is difficult to convince the Saudi Government . ' In any event I shall make an appeal , ' the President has added . Later when the discussion centered on sexual harassment of housemaids in the Middle East , the President had told in a lighter vein , he read an article in The Sunday Leader newspaper that there is sexual harassment of local women by Duminda and Ranjan . When all were enjoying the joke , the President continuing had said , in our own homeland punishments are being meted out on the same lines as in Saudi . He had then related how a UNP MP 's organ was severed by his wife when he returned home after going to his paramour . Looking at Ranjan , the President had asked how Bogambara Prison life was . But before Ranjan could complete explaining the woes inside the jail , the President interjecting had told about how he suffered in jail for three months because of Ranjan 's leader , Ranil Wickremesinghe . ' In that murder case all others got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was jailed though I did not commit the crime . ' The President then addressing John Amaratunge said , ' you were all great people at that time . John used to carry rifles to shoot ' . At that moment Dr. Harsha De Silva the UNP National list MP was coming for the meeting . Having found that he was late , he began walking out . Noticing him , the President sent word through a security officer requesting Harsha to wait . The President who met him later had discussed an article of Harsha 's in an English Daily newspaper where he had severely criticized the Mahinda Chinthana . The latter had told him some of his criticisms were constructive but most of them were destructive . Mahinda is well noted for not tolerating criticism . Presently , topping his hit list are the university students . Because of this attitude universities are fast becoming battle fields . Last week the President summoned the Vice Chancellors of the universities and had a lengthy discussion . The Higher Education Minister S.B Dissanayake also participated at these discussions . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unions to raise their heads . He ordered the Vice Chancellors to strictly enforce discipline and implement the university regulations . Following this meeting , he held a discussion with Dissanayake when he told him that the JVP unions should be crippled and requested him to formulate strategies to accomplish this . He wanted Dissanayake to cripple these JVP unions somehow within two months . As a first step he suggested that associations of parents of the students be formed and SLFPers should be enrolled . As regards the crises , he said there is nothing to worry because he has made arrangement to ensure that the state as well as the private media support the government on this issue . If necessary the support of the forces can also be enlisted in this crackdown . He had also told SB to concurrently table the University Bill while this operation is under way . While the President is obsessed with eliminating his opponents in his hit list , the Opposition Leader Ranil Wickremesinghe on the other hand is seeking to eliminate the party reformists who are currently occupying the top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tiran Alles was Ranil 's No. 1 in the hit list . Ranil after mercilessly castigating him at the UNP Working Committee meeting and alleging that Tiran was having a secret deal with the President , sent a hand delivered letter to Tiran the following day , requesting him to join his ' Movement Against Dictatorship ' . But in relation to the reformists , Ranil 's strategy is different . Recently , before leaving for Europe , he had a one to one discussion with a UNP MP probing ways to block the UNP reforms being taken up at the UNP convention . He had instructed the MP to engage the services of lawyers and file legal action to delay the convention where the reforms are to be brought . The MP had told the lawyers to file the action without leaking out his or anybody else 's involvement . To Ranil 's consternation , one of the lawyers who was engaged had however leaked his plan to the reformists , whereupon the reformists had immediately summoned their lawyers and discussed how to foil Ranil 's plan to sabotage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weeks , he did not lose focus on two matters . One -- Sajith 's Indian tour ; the other was Sajith 's grassroots campaign -- ' Village Development Journey . ' Incidentally , Sajith 's campaign is on a collision course with Ranil 's ' Village to Village Journey . ' Ranil who is obviously upset over Sajith 's Indian tour is also keeping a close watch over it . A significant feature in Sajith 's tour was that he met all the IPKF chiefs who were stationed in Sri Lanka including General Kalkat and General Ashok Mehta . All of them were full of praise for Sajith 's father , the former President of Sri Lanka , Premadasa . They said they liked him personally , though they did not like his policies because he gave them bellyful . Sajith 's short reply was that he wished to rebuild the relationship with India . Ranil 's worry and anguish is about the growing ties between Sajith and his new found relationship with India . Ranil 's is eager to delve deep into Sajith 's tour because it proved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Sajith did not attend the launching ceremony of Ranil 's village development journey programme . This was because Sajith 's name was struck off from the list of speakers . Owing to Sajith 's absence the ceremony flopped . Karu Jayasooriya who was in the vanguard of this programme was terribly worried over the failure owing to Sajith 's absence . When ten office bearers of the Professional Associations met Karu to discuss how to achieve unity within the party , Karu has blamed Sajith for his absence at the launching ceremony . The office bearers had countered by explaining that Sajith 's name was deleted from the speakers ' list leaving Karu dumbfounded . Karu had later met Sajith at the funeral of Dharmadasa Banda in Bibile . They had exchanged greetings but had not spoken more . Meanwhile Sajith attended his first village development programme at Horana where coincidentally Ranil 's programme is also to commence . Ranil having learnt that Sajith 's programme was a roaring success with the whole area being highly decorated and the whole of Horana area awash with green flags and posters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conference along with the Kalutara organisers and promote Ranil 's programme . It is evident that on the one hand he is using Karu to attack Sajith while on the other he is pitting Karu against Sajith . This is Ranil 's full time occupation now . Another victim of Ranil 's game plan is Sarath Fonseka who is in jail . The untold hardships he is facing came to light when UNP MP Dayasiri Jayasekera went to meet him in prison . After Dayasiri came out and told that he had tea with Fonseka poured from a kettle , immediately thereafter that kettle had been withdrawn by the Prison authorities . At a cabinet meeting about two weeks ago , JHU MP and Minister Champika Ranawaka made a reference to General Sarath Fonseka . The President who was enraged at this reference , however did not vent his anger on Champika , but called another minister and scolded him in a fit of fury . This clearly demonstrates that the President loathes even hearing Fonseka 's name . It was the President 's hope that he could finish with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it seems that the President will continue to be haunted even more by Fonseka 's meteoric rise in popularity every time the government tramples and crushes him .
