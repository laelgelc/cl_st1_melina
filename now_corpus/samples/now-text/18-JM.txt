He did so during a press conference at the PNP 's headquarters at Old Hope Road , St Andrew . He had been faced with mounting criticism , including from the youth arm of the governing JLP , for the gesture , during which he gesture with both of his middle fingers . <p> Phillips told journalists two days after the incident that during the debate , he sought to get a two-minute extension for Opposition Spokesman on Health , Dr Dayton Campbell , to allow him more time to highlight " the deepening crisis at the Cornwall Regional Hospital , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the urgency it deserves . " <p> He said , " In seeking this two-minute extension , I used a gesture which has become the subject of controversy , and ( has been ) interpreted as ( being ) offensive . As the records of the Parliament will show , at no time was any offence meant and none was taken either by the Speaker , who is the presiding officer of the Parliament , nor by any member of the Parliament on either side of the aisle , " Phillips stated . <p> He added that , " in light of the misinterpretation , and in some instances misrepresentation , I regret using this gesture in what was a lighthearted moment of banter in the House , in fact , intended to diffuse any tensions which were arising .

She said based on all of the subsequent commentaries surrounding the statement , she now understands that the statement was not appropriate , and regretted making such remarks . <p> Daley said whereas she had no intention of removing anyone from her constituency based on their political affiliation , it did not change the interpretation and the fact that the remarks could generate unease among residents in sections of her constituency . <p> She emphasised that throughout her 31 years as a representative at the local and national levels , she has enjoyed warm relations with political opponents , and was therefore offering no excuses for her statement . <p> The PNP said Daley offered a full apology to her constituents , the political ombudsman , the party , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assured that she will conduct herself in a manner consistent with peace and goodwill , and the lowering of political tension and tribalism . <p> TOURISM MINISTER , EDMUND BARTLETT <p> One of the country 's most popular and hardworking Cabinet ministers is Tourism Minister , Edmund Bartlett .

" <p> Based on their response , the local manufacturers are of the view that the minister was displaying a serious degree of both arrogance and ignorance . <p> Responding on Thursday , the JMA said the statements from Bartlett represent " a blatant disregard for the industrial sector and the resilience of our manufacturers and other entrepreneurs who continue to robustly innovate , invest and produce at world-class standards , despite existing challenges . " <p> The JMA said it would not support the minister 's dismissal of an industry that " continues to be the backbone of this country , contributing 8.6 per cent to GDP , $55 billion in taxes ( second only to the banking sector ) , and 80,000 in employment . " <p> The association said the economic benefits of tourism are unquestionable , " but it 's extremely low impact on our national growth is undeniable " . <p> Further pressing home its position , the JMA said national economic sustainability entails building linkages and keeping the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the association said " Not only should Jamaicans be involved in tourism , but we should also share in the financial benefits derived from it . " <p> In respect of the minister himself , the JMA said " Minister Bartlett 's utterances reflect the very ignorance the JMA is committed to dispelling . We need to emancipate ourselves and recognise that Jamaica produces a wide range of products that are unique , superior and better priced than many imports . It is up to each and every one of us as consumers , businesses and Government to take the stance to support our local manufacturers and not be held captive by the erroneous perceptions that Jamaican-made is inferior , and that local producers are unable to adequately supply the tourism market . <p> According to the JMA , " if our Government and our ministers do not have faith in our own entrepreneurs , who will ? Growth begins with leadership . " <p> Despite the rantings of the JMA , Bartlett , unlike the other politicians mentioned , is not known to have yet offered an apology or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Metry Seaga , has indicated that a meeting is being scheduled between the two , to discuss the statements . <p> PRIME MINISTER ANDREW HOLNESS <p> Prime Minister Andrew Holness may not have exactly put his foot in his mouth , so to speak , on the matter of the short-lived ' acting ' appointment of Chief Justice , Bryan Sykes ( the PM said it was strategy , which , to his credit , the jury will always be out on ) , but from the public distraction that the move became , and the widespread criticism that it drew , it certainly warrants even a light mention among the foot in mouth political developments .
